(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 17=

19
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,070
You...

20
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,950
Why are you here?

21
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,230
Where's Yan Shao?

22
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,150
I switched rooms with him.

23
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:03,671
Do you need something from him?

24
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,300
I just wanted to discuss

25
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,580
how to ensure
your safe arrival at Mount Moye.

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,190
Where's his room now?

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,910
He said he wanted to take a walk.

28
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,893
Why don't you talk to him tomorrow?

29
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,070
All right.

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,030
Then...

31
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:58,330
(Blossom's Fall Inn)

32
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,910
Coming.

33
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,030
Who is it?

34
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,071
Wanci, why aren't you asleep yet?

35
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:37,860
Why are you standing
in the cold so late?

36
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,310
You're weak. Don't catch a chill again.

37
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,070
I just felt a little suffocated

38
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,100
and I needed some air.

39
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,820
I'm fine. You should rest.

40
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,670
Retreat!

41
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,893
(Blossom's Fall Inn)

42
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,510
Go!

43
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,550
Stay inside. Don't come out.

44
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,340
It's you, huh?

45
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,140
I thought you were dead.

46
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,750
Turns out you've sided with them.

47
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,950
I'll kill you!

48
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,750
Stop!

49
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,140
Shukuang!

50
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,310
Liu An?

51
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,070
Liu An!

52
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,430
When has Yuchi Manor ever wronged you?

53
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:41,715
You've allied with the Ghost Valley Sect

54
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:43,019
and turned against us?

55
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,870
That's between me and her.

56
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,110
So you were the one

57
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,990
tracking us and leaking our whereabouts?

58
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,315
That's right.

59
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,580
You and I

60
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,700
have a score to settle.

61
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,340
What do I owe you?

62
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,750
Liu An, you're still this stubborn?

63
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,110
You once told me

64
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,700
to let go of my hatred.

65
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,220
But without hate,

66
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,004
how am I supposed to live?

67
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,670
Step aside!

68
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:47,990
Second Brother!

69
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,020
Go to hell!

70
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,310
Take Red-Robed and retreat!

71
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,020
Shaoci! Yan Shao, save me!

72
00:07:10,426 --> 00:07:11,137
Wanci!

73
00:07:11,137 --> 00:07:12,110
Wangci?

74
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,700
Wanci!

75
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,804
They went this way.

76
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,204
It must be Ghost Valley Sect
who took Wanci!

77
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,430
Yan Shao, protect Shukuang.

78
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:30,220
I'll go save her.

79
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,950
We're coming too.

80
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:34,315
You and Fei Wu,
stay with Young Master Lin.

81
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,020
Yes.

82
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,110
Why are you doing this?

83
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,190
It no longer matters.

84
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,380
My revenge is complete.

85
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,780
My wish is fulfilled.

86
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,870
Revenge?

87
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,430
Fang Yi.

88
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,070
Now that you've become
Young Lady Rong of Yuchi Manor,

89
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,460
have you forgotten everything

90
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,110
about Misty Moon Village?

91
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,190
(My real name is Fang Yi.)

92
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,648
(I was called Fang Yi
even in Misty Moon Village.)

93
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,140
(Such fate.)

94
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,070
I still remember

95
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,220
that Red-Robed, bald man...

96
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,150
He personally killed my father.

97
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,500
Go!

98
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,270
(I must avenge this grudge!)

99
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,500
Father!

100
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,150
- Father!
- Go! Run!

101
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:55,980
Liu An.

102
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,100
Who helped you escape Yuchi Manor?

103
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,860
Who orchestrated all this?

104
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,150
Yan Shao...

105
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,980
I beg you.

106
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,500
Take my body back to Misty Moon Village.

107
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,740
I want to be with my family

108
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,620
forever.

109
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,820
Tiangang will take you back.

110
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,310
Rest assured.

111
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,115
Take her back
to Misty Moon Village for burial.

112
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,620
You handle it.

113
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,980
What happened with the person you sent?

114
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,310
That was an accident.

115
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,070
I should be asking you.

116
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,950
Why didn't you arrive as planned,

117
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,700
but let your men act rashly?

118
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,430
Where exactly were you?

119
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,910
This place is close to Junshan Sect.

120
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,950
I simply stopped by.

121
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
How is the Junshan Sect?

122
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,070
I have people inside.

123
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,220
Since their chief died,

124
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,150
internal conflict has been fierce.

125
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,693
They're fighting each other.

126
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,550
I took advantage of the chaos
and struck from within.

127
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,620
From now on,
Junshan Sect no longer exists.

128
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,226
Why didn't you
discuss this with me first?

129
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,390
Destroying the Six Great Sects,

130
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,190
that was your suggestion.

131
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,604
Relax.

132
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,220
Before reaching Mount Moye,

133
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,310
I will obtain the key.

134
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,740
Now is the perfect opportunity.

135
00:10:42,048 --> 00:10:43,960
But because
of your useless subordinates,

136
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,070
you missed it.

137
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,070
Yan Shao has been drawing poison
for Rong Shukuang.

138
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,820
He's at his limit.

139
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,700
We just need to wait
for the poison to take its toll.

140
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,820
You're wrong.

141
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,460
I know them best.

142
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,804
Yan Shao has deep martial skills.

143
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,860
Draining him completely
at once is impossible.

144
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,820
So what are you saying?

145
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,270
Punish those who acted recklessly

146
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,740
and capture Rong Shukuang yourself.

147
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,220
Zuitian.

148
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,820
Who would've thought Liu An

149
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
stayed at Yuchi Manor for so many years,

150
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,100
scheming all this

151
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,100
just to avenge her family?

152
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:38,315
At least she
found her way back in the end.

153
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,270
But she lost her life.

154
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,620
And you?

155
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,430
Would you be willing

156
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,500
to give up everything

157
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,430
for an obsession?

158
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:53,820
I would.

159
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,500
Me too.

160
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,100
Can you save Wanci?

161
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,790
No.

162
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,220
I thought you'd go to save her
and be the hero.

163
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,620
She'll be fine.

164
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,048
How do you know?

165
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:12,950
She's smart.

166
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,030
She can adapt.

167
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,620
So what you're saying is

168
00:12:16,448 --> 00:12:17,582
I'm the most useless

169
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,620
and always needing protection?

170
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:21,693
That's not what I meant.

171
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,860
You're the unwed fiancee
of Tiangang's leader.

172
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,620
Protecting you is my duty.

173
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,700
There you go again.

174
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,430
Saying the same thing over and over.

175
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,848
Can't you say something else?

176
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,910
It's not important.

177
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,190
You just don't get it.

178
00:12:39,137 --> 00:12:40,093
Leader Shen.

179
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,620
Leader Shen!

180
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,910
You must avenge my brother!

181
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,910
People from Yuchi Manor deserve to die!

182
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,620
That was Zuitian's target.

183
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,910
I told you to follow them.

184
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,950
Who told you to act on your own?

185
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,160
We acted recklessly, and it was wrong.

186
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
But Liu An left markers along the way

187
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,020
and led us to Blossom's Fall Inn.

188
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,893
We never expected her
to kill the Red-Robed.

189
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,820
Liu An?

190
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,790
She was just a maid

191
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,820
from Yuchi Manor.

192
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,070
The so-called
Three Wandering Masters? Useless.

193
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,070
Useless people

194
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,740
deserve to die.

195
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,390
You're at death's door,

196
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,030
yet you're still trying to sow discord.

197
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,760
We did fail in our task
and deserve to die,

198
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:25,715
but right now,
Ghost Valley Sect is in turmoil.

199
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,950
Punishing us at this moment

200
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,460
will only give the enemy an opening.

201
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,620
Better to let us make up for it.

202
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,550
Young Master Ruhai makes a good point.

203
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,804
You kidnapped Young Lady Lin.

204
00:13:35,826 --> 00:13:37,182
They'll come after her soon.

205
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,980
Well thought out.

206
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,860
Do as he says.

207
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,871
Young Master Lin.

208
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:50,620
Yan Shao sent us to assist.

209
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:52,600
We tracked them here,
but lost their trail.

210
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:53,910
Don't worry, they have her.

211
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,820
They'll reach out to negotiate soon.

212
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,790
Let's keep pursuing.

213
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:57,960
Yan Shao will be here soon.

214
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:58,804
All right, let's go.

215
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,740
I'll keep an eye on her.

216
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,190
Don't worry, she won't escape.

217
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,500
Leader Shen, should we wait
for them on the road?

218
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,030
I prefer waiting for people,

219
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,950
not chasing after them.

220
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:33,471
What are you looking at?

221
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,270
Once, snow was like flowers.
Now, flowers are like snow.

222
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,070
Master Hua is as stunning as both.

223
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,460
It's truly enviable.

224
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,340
Just call me Hua Qi.

225
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,270
That's the name Zuitian gave me.

226
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,700
All right, Miss Hua Qi.

227
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,340
I'll be counting
on your care along the way.

228
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,220
Much appreciated.

229
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,500
Are all people
from Yuchi Manor this odd?

230
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,980
Captured by enemies

231
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,620
and still so calm and composed?

232
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,150
Then how should I behave?

233
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,150
Panic? Cry?

234
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,070
Tremble in fear?

235
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,390
You're just like Rong Shukuang,

236
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,790
sharp-tongued.

237
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,030
We're not the same.

238
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,860
Besides,

239
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,100
because of me,
you're stuck in this carriage too,

240
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,270
unable to ride freely with Zuitian.

241
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,790
In the end,

242
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,693
whose prison is this carriage really?

243
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,460
Aren't we going to Mount Moye?

244
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,500
Why stop here?

245
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,910
Locals say you can pray for safety here.

246
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,340
Makes sense.

247
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,700
Soon, I'll have no family.

248
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,310
And my master won't protect me anymore.

249
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,100
After I reach Mount Moye,

250
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,790
I'll have to fend for myself.

251
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,270
You're getting married,

252
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,910
not walking into a death trap.

253
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,220
Master, don't you want
the Fuxian treasure?

254
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,310
What do you mean?

255
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,740
I'll marry Chu Tianyao,

256
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,340
but I'll give you the treasure.

257
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,910
From then on, you'll do whatever I ask.

258
00:15:57,426 --> 00:15:58,070
Not necessarily.

259
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,740
But you can try.

260
00:16:15,731 --> 00:16:18,590
(Boss Jin: Crimson Lotus can be cured.
See you at Ruthless Parlor.)

261
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,150
So this is a Dragon King Temple.

262
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,582
Looks like you'll have to pray
to this big turtle for safety.

263
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,500
Haven't you heard
of Grandpa Turtle Sage?

264
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Grandpa Turtle Sage,

265
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,340
I, Rong Shukuang,
am here to pray for safety.

266
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,430
Please grant my wish,
Grandpa Turtle Sage.

267
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,550
I don't want to marry...

268
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,471
What are you saying?

269
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,982
Did it really work?

270
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,780
(That worked like a charm.)

271
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,980
(Should I ask for something else?)

272
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,950
(No, being greedy never works.)

273
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,670
(Just standing here,)

274
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,493
(listening to the rain
with him is nice.)

275
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,460
(Being with him,)

276
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,404
(even just a day longer, is worth it.)

277
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,980
What are you smiling about?

278
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,980
I was thinking...

279
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,260
Since Grandpa Turtle Sage
is so powerful,

280
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,590
I should've wished
for supreme martial skills.

281
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:46,315
That way, when I reach Mount Moye,

282
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,780
I can strike down Chu Tianyao
with a single blow.

283
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,980
Then I can live freely as a young widow.

284
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,220
Or maybe
have Chu Tianyao fall gravely ill,

285
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:56,460
bleeding from his orifices,

286
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,560
his meridians shattered...

287
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,980
Can you shut up?

288
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,780
He's your fiance.

289
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,019
How can you curse him like that?

290
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,226
I have no love or ties with him.

291
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:04,271
Why shouldn't I curse him?

292
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:04,700
You...

293
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,630
I only care about those who care for me.

294
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,515
Aren't you the same kind of person too?

295
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,893
If you truly had no feelings for me,

296
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,980
why did you risk your life
to save me so many times?

297
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,350
At first, I saved you for 300 gold.

298
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,780
Now, it's Tiangang's mission.

299
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,740
What if there was no gold,

300
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,020
and no mission from Tiangang?

301
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,950
That's none of your concern.

302
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,060
Or is it that you can't control
your own heart?

303
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,350
If there's anyone

304
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,500
who could make Yan Shao
take on an impossible burden,

305
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,826
it's me, Rong Shukuang.

306
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,740
You're overthinking it.

307
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,670
You...

308
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,870
Are you leaving town?

309
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,590
Yes.

310
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,590
You can't.

311
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,220
The mountain road collapsed.

312
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,870
The falling rocks blocked the way.

313
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,150
All the strong men in town
have gone to clear it.

314
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,626
It'll take two or three days,

315
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,582
maybe even longer, to open the road.

316
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:12,870
Is there another way?

317
00:19:13,004 --> 00:19:14,360
Other than that mountain road,

318
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,500
there's no other path.

319
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,980
What now?

320
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,190
We'll wait here for now.

321
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:30,740
Thunder...

322
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,700
Why don't you have
any sympathy for women?

323
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,870
A heroine afraid of thunder?

324
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,780
I feel a little dizzy...

325
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,937
Master Hua,
you admire Leader Shen, don't you?

326
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,780
Everyone in the world knows that.

327
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,700
But if a girl's feelings

328
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,060
are known to the whole world,

329
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,430
yet the man in question
pretends not to notice,

330
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,950
that would be quite frustrating.

331
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,060
That Yan Shao by Rong Shukuang's side,

332
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,110
he's neither family nor a lover,

333
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,910
yet he risks his life to protect her.

334
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,300
What do you think that means?

335
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,460
Isn't it obvious?

336
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,500
Yan Shao has feelings for Rong Shukuang.

337
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,500
Miss Hua Qi, you're absolutely right.

338
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,110
But for someone so intelligent,

339
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,910
she doesn't seem to realize

340
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:43,830
that her beloved
has feelings for another.

341
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:46,540
Rong Shukuang has been captured
by Shen Zuitian multiple times,

342
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,910
but she always manages
to escape unharmed.

343
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,300
Could it be that the Leader
of Ghost Valley Sect,

344
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,670
Shen Zuitian,
is really that incompetent?

345
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,110
Or is it simply
because Yan Shao keeps saving her?

346
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,830
Perhaps your dear Zuitian

347
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,190
doesn't truly want her dead.

348
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,910
If Shen Zuitian
had no feelings for Rong Shukuang,

349
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:08,500
then why did he
keep capturing and releasing her?

350
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,020
All he's doing is giving them
more chances to meet.

351
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,740
That doesn't benefit you at all.

352
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,500
Women

353
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,740
sometimes have to be
more decisive than men.

354
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,220
When they love someone,

355
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,460
they should make sure they get them.

356
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,870
Are you plotting something?

357
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:34,020
I, too, have someone
I long for but cannot have.

358
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:43,300
Leader Shen.

359
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,693
They were spotted
near an abandoned temple.

360
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,190
Zuitian.

361
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,390
Hua Qi, come with me.

362
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,350
All right.

363
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:52,590
You stay here
and guard Young Lady Lin.

364
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,060
I passed out again?

365
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,071
Are you feeling better?

366
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,430
I think so.

367
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,950
What did you do to me?

368
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,220
Nothing.

369
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,540
Just adjusted your circulation.

370
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,220
Adjusted my circulation?

371
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,110
That sounds like something
an old physician would say.

372
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:30,780
Are you hungry?

373
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,670
Yeah.

374
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,780
Let's go to town for some buns. Come on.

375
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,740
Wait.

376
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,599
Going back to town is too risky.

377
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,950
It'll attract Ghost Valley Sect.

378
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,240
Since there are woodcutters here,

379
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:40,450
there must be a village nearby.

380
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:41,382
I'll go find some food.

381
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,300
Are you feeling unwell?

382
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:43,980
Here.

383
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,870
Hide here.

384
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,150
Come on, hide over there.

385
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:49,350
Stay put. Don't come out.

386
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,670
I'll be back soon.

387
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,910
Come back quickly.

388
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,980
Hua Qi is truly devoted to Leader Shen.

389
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,460
What a pity.

390
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:08,950
Such a pity?

391
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,590
What's the pity?

392
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,460
I pity that Young Master Ruhai
is brilliant in strategy,

393
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,630
yet he means nothing
in front of Leader Shen.

394
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,910
Hua Qi captured Rong Shukuang,

395
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,870
but caused Leader Shen
to fall off a cliff,

396
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,740
yet she still holds his trust.

397
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,870
You

398
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,870
don't hold as high a place as Hua Qi.

399
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,300
Trying to sow discord?

400
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,910
Young Lady Lin,
save your tricks for someone else.

401
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,715
You're a noble son of a great family.

402
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,448
Yet you tarnish your reputation
by following Shen Zuitian.

403
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,780
Surely, you must have your own plans.

404
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,300
But unfortunately,

405
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,020
even Lie ranks above you
in Shen Zuitian's eyes.

406
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,780
I pity you.

407
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,740
I know exactly
what kind of person you are.

408
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:54,980
No one else is here.

409
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,980
Just say what you want.

410
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,830
I meant it when I said

411
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,404
you're a mastermind.

412
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,700
I want to support you
in achieving something great.

413
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,430
You're up to something.

414
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,220
Young Lady Lin, what do you want?

415
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,190
Shen Zuitian is reckless
and short-sighted.

416
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,060
He's not the best partner.

417
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,980
I'd rather work

418
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,060
with someone as intelligent as you,
Young Master Ruhai.

419
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,700
Someone sent word.

420
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,782
They've taken shelter
in the temple up ahead.

421
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,950
Yan Shao has already set out.

422
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,590
Later, find a way to keep Yan Shao busy.

423
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,220
I'll take the chance
to capture Rong Shukuang.

424
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,960
Why do you get to capture her?

425
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,630
I refuse.

426
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,248
You distract Yan Shao.

427
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,626
I'll capture Rong Shukuang.

428
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,590
Zuitian, let me do it.

429
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,540
I caught her last time, didn't I?

430
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,560
Don't worry.

431
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,830
I'll get it done.

432
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,260
Rong Shukuang is cunning.

433
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,630
Don't waste words with her

434
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,460
and don't kill her.

435
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,737
Use a whistle as a signal.

436
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,020
As soon as you capture her,
send the signal.

437
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,590
Why not just kill her?

438
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,110
Are you reluctant?

439
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,590
Nonsense.

440
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,300
I have my own reasons
for keeping her alive.

441
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:19,700
Now go.

442
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:50,048
Yan Shao, it's been a while
since the bamboo forest.

443
00:25:50,093 --> 00:25:51,115
You've become haggard.

444
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,950
And you're looking rather refreshed.

445
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,060
What, have you
and Rong Shukuang, the lovebirds,

446
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,560
decided to go
your separate ways in a crisis?

447
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,910
She's unwell and staying
at the inn to rest.

448
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,830
The inn?

449
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:05,700
Since when did Yan Shao learn to lie?

450
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,020
Yan Shao?

451
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:25,782
Yan Shao...

452
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,150
What?

453
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,590
We're old friends, aren't we?

454
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,220
It seems that Young Lady Rong
doesn't welcome me.

455
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,870
Like a ghost that won't leave.

456
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,937
Where is Shen Zuitian?

457
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:38,780
Don't mention Shen...

458
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,390
Shen Zuitian!

459
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,830
Help!

460
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:24,350
If you dare harm Rong Shukuang,

461
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,910
I'll kill you.

462
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,071
Wait... Think this through.

463
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,300
Enough with your tricks.

464
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,390
I'm not Zuitian.

465
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,220
If you kill me,

466
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,220
Zuitian will never forgive you.

467
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,980
Enough talking.

468
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,670
He's been searching for me all this time

469
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:05,560
just for the treasure.

470
00:28:05,604 --> 00:28:06,350
If you kill me,

471
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,404
the clues will be lost.

472
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,630
He'll hate you for it.

473
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,110
I'd rather he hate me

474
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,870
than watch him still care for you.

475
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,830
Have you been deceived?

476
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,060
Used by someone?

477
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,190
I don't care anymore.

478
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,271
As long as you're gone from this world,

479
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:21,060
I can be at peace.

480
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,700
No...

481
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,870
Stay back!

482
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,740
I... I didn't mean to.

483
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,220
It was self-defense.

484
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,540
Rong Shukuang!

485
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,870
Master.

I'm fine.

491
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,260
I ran into Hua Qi.

492
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,220
But I used the Flowing Cloud Finger

493
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,590
and injured her.

494
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,220
Then I ran.

495
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,700
I was afraid you wouldn't find me.

496
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,830

00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,430
I only came

501
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,300
because of your devotion to Leader Shen.

502
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,980
So I wanted to see you one last time.

503
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,260
One last time?

504
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:32,830
Hua Qi?

505
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,430

Flowing Cloud Finger.

00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,350
Has Rong Shukuang
truly regained her martial arts?

509
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,300
By the time I arrived, it was too late.

510
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,500
Rong Shukuang poisoned her.

511
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,830
To save her,

512
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,915
I even got stabbed by Rong Shukuang.

513
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,110
But I still couldn't save Hua Qi.

514
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,910
If her martial arts have returned,
she'll be even harder to deal with.

515
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,630
Fleeting beauty of the flowers
and the slow maturation of the wine.

516
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,982
Drunken slumber cannot compare
to the gentle fall of flowers.

517
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,830
Back then,

518
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,430
I only said that one line to you.

519
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,870
And ever since,

520
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,020
you refused to use the name Hua Sixue.

521
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,700
You changed it to Hua Qi.

522
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,950
To ask of the season for flowers,

523
00:31:27,448 --> 00:31:28,980
but when flowers fall, no one knows.

524
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,780
The dead cannot return to life.

525
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,540
That's right.

526
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,737
I have no grudge against you.

527
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,630
Why are you doing this to me?

528
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,830
I did this to you

529
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,190
only because

530
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,590
right now, you are my most useful pawn.

531
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,950
Kill me.

532
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,150
Jiang Ruhai.

533
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,190
Have fun with her.

534
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,150
I am kind-hearted.

535
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,110
I can't bear to witness such brutality.

536
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,060
Kill me. I beg you, just kill me.

537
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,910
Why don't we wait here for a while?

538
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,950
Maybe they'll catch up.

539
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,300
Sister Rong.

540
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,870
Yingluo.

541
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:41,780
We were just saying

542
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,350
and here you are.

543
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,540
Any leads?

544
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,826
Still no sign of the Young Lady Lin.

545
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,390
But we've sent people to search.

546
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,204
Young Master Lin.

547
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,020
I need a word with you alone.

548
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,220
You may speak freely, Yan Shao.

549
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,950
We can't go to Mount Moye yet.

550
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,830
I need to take her to Ruthless Parlor.

551
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,590
Why?

552
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,390
Besides the Mystic Ice Jade Palm,

553
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,390
there's another poison in her body.

554
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,500
Someone at Ruthless Parlor can cure it.

555
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,460
You can verify this with Tang Yingluo.

556
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,630
What poison?

557
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,350
Crimson Lotus Heart.

558
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,430
Crimson Lotus...

559
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,780
It's said to be a deadly poison.

560
00:33:23,937 --> 00:33:25,670
Those afflicted
suffer excruciating pain.

561
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,590
They would rather die,
and there's no cure.

562
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,780
All this time,

563
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,500
I've been drawing the poison from her.

564
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,460
Drawing poison?

565
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,870
She mustn't know.

566
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,500
You did all this for her...

567
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,430
She doesn't even know she's poisoned.

568
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,830
Please keep this from her.

569
00:33:41,982 --> 00:33:42,893
In Ruthless Parlor,

570
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,500
someone there can help us.

571
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,190
So...

572
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,020
I understand.

573
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,700
After pasting this desert town,

574
00:33:59,782 --> 00:34:01,360
we'll soon reach Ruthless Parlor.

575
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:02,950
Ruthless Parlor?

576
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,460
It's been so long.

577
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,980
I wonder how Jin Buyao,

578
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,980
Chai Hu, and Huo Xiang are doing.

579
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,230
What's wrong?

580
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,390
Nothing.

581
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,293
Let's get to Ruthless Parlor quickly.

582
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,448
They're catching up fast.

583
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,870
A sandstorm is coming.

584
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,950
We should take shelter
in the town first.

585
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,026
Then we'll decide.

586
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,710
Let's go.

587
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,310
Yan Shao!

588
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,350
Yan Shao.

589
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,270
I'm fine.

590
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,871
Young Master Lin...

591
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,180
There's something you need to do.

592
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,950
Only then can we escape.
