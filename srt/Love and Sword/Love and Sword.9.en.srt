(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 9=

19
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:50,670
A disciple killing their master

20
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:52,260
is an unforgivable crime.

21
00:01:52,648 --> 00:01:53,582
Shangguan Tong,

22
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,137
the senior disciple of Junshan Sect

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,909
has also arrived
at Yuchi Manor this time.

24
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,020
If they find out you've sided
with Ghost Valley Sect,

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,870
what do you think

26
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,670
they'll do to you?

27
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:05,980
Who are you?

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,950
How did you know my identity?

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,150
You were an orphan born
during a drought.

30
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:11,737
At just three months old,

31
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:14,582
your master took you in
and raised you in the sect.

32
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:18,915
Three years ago, you killed your master
while traveling through Mount Daling

33
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,915
with him.

34
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:25,340
The Junshan Sect branded you a traitor

35
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,982
and sent word to all sects
to hunt you down.

36
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:29,390
You changed your appearance,

37
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,270
hid your name, and disappeared.

38
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,271
But you unexpectedly joined
the Ghost Valley Sect.

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,710
Kill me.

40
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,740
Just kill me!

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,150
I said, kill me!

42
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,715
You're not even worthy
of dirtying my hands.

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,390
If I reveal your true identity,

44
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:46,382
even Yuchi Manor won't be able
to keep your body in one piece.

45
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,180
Who on earth are you?

46
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,780
Why does everyone

47
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,550
love asking that question?

48
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,620
You're with Tiangang.

49
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,110
I changed my appearance.

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,220
Only those from Tiangang

51
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,500
would know my past.

52
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
Who instructed you

53
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:04,940
to do it?

54
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,340
If you had set fire
to those kerosene and wine jars,

55
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,180
no one

56
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,180
on that street would have survived
from that fire.

57
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:23,430
What wrong have the innocent done?

58
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,710
With so much innocent blood
on your hands,

59
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,710
I'm sure

60
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,537
you'll have sleepless nights

61
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,460
and relive their screams
and cries every night

62
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,030
for the rest of your life.

63
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
You killed your master

64
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,110
because his cultivation went astray,

65
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,715
driving him into madness.

66
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:47,782
In the only moment of clarity,
he begged you to end his suffering.

67
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,390
But he was a renowned swordsman,

68
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,248
and you didn't want to tarnish his name.

69
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,990
So you kept the truth to yourself.

70
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:00,160
Even if it meant being hunted
for the rest of your life.

71
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,500
Yellow-Robed
of the Three Wandering Masters

72
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,660
and Shen Zuitian

73
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,150
are in the city.

74
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,515
The distillery and Blossom's Smile
are their meeting points.

75
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:13,760
There's also one more person.

76
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,220
But I don't know who that is.

77
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,860
But that person seems very familiar
with Yuchi Manor.

78
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,150
That's all I know.

79
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,070
It's easy to go astray.

80
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:31,540
But it's difficult
to walk the path of righteousness.

81
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,270
Shangguan Tong,

82
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,270
you should live for your master's sake.

83
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,980
Marvelous!

84
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,830
Young Master,

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,780
I sent the food personally.

86
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,671
He was still here just moments ago.

87
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,893
He might not have left the manor yet.

88
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,830
Search every corner.

89
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,270
Don't let anything slip past.

90
00:05:07,448 --> 00:05:08,300
Yes, Young Master.

91
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,660
If you could escape
from the prison cell,

92
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,030
leaving Yuchi Manor
wouldn't be difficult

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,900
for you either.

94
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:19,737
So, why are you still here?

95
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,693
I was waiting for you.

96
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:29,604
Ghost Valley Sect won't let you go

97
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,510
after you've betrayed them.

98
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:33,150
That's why I waited for you.

99
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,100
You're so sure I'll help you?

100
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,540
I want to join Tiangang.

101
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,980
What do you take Tiangang for?

102
00:05:45,515 --> 00:05:48,715
At the very least, Tiangang dares
to stand against Ghost Valley Sect.

103
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,293
At the entrance of Blossom's Smile,

104
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,270
there's an old fortune teller.

105
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,070
Go to him and say,

106
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,900
"Though born of the same branch,

107
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,300
each leaf has its own fate."

108
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,390
Someone tampered with this bun.

109
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,830
There's a spy

110
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:12,950
inside Yuchi Manor.

111
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,980
Who gave it to you?

112
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:19,715
The prison guard brought it over.

113
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,582
Young Lady Lin touched one as well.

114
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,340
I don't know who's trying to poison me

115
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,300
or what kind of poison
is inside the bun.

116
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,220
But I just know

117
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,420
it's poisoned.

118
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,390
Be careful.

119
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,510
Will we meet again?

120
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:31,271
(Celestial Maiden's Blossom
is affecting me.)

121
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,750
(My inner strength is unstable.)

122
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:34,804
(I won't be able to hold on for long.)

123
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,340
Master?

124
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,590
When did you climb into my bed?

125
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,460
Are you asleep?

126
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,230
Don't tell me you fainted
from my beauty?

127
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,660
You really have no self-control.

128
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:40,537
Young Lady Rong, please open the door.

129
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,515
A prisoner has escaped.

130
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:42,582
Young Master has ordered

131
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,270
a full search of the manor.

132
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,750
All right.

133
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,248
I'll come after I get changed.

134
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,760
Yan Shao, wake up.

135
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,150
Yan Shao. Yan Shao.

136
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,580
Wake up.

137
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,060
Get...

138
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:08,337
Sorry for disturbing you,
Young Lady Rong.

139
00:09:20,057 --> 00:09:22,000
(Shao)

140
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,230
At least you cared.

141
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,270
You lost focus while training.

142
00:09:36,893 --> 00:09:39,293
But when it comes to painting,
you're completely in the zone.

143
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,660
Young Lady Rong, get some rest.

144
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,180
I'm resting just fine.

145
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,150
I'd rather no one disturb me.

146
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,060
What...

147
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,580
Master.

148
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,300
Master.

149
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:30,300
Come on.

150
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,870
Master!

151
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,270
He's not dead, is he?

152
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,030
I need to do CPR.

153
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,350
No, Rong Shukuang.

154
00:10:56,471 --> 00:10:57,715
You're trying to save his life!

155
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,990
You must stay focused.

156
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,660
Ouch, my hair...

157
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,750
My hair!

158
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:14,300
You're pulling it my hair!

159
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,060
Get off!

160
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:15,940
Don't push me.

161
00:11:16,271 --> 00:11:16,990
That's enough.

162
00:11:20,426 --> 00:11:21,982
What are you trying to do to me?

163
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,390
I was trying to save you.

164
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,470
Save me?

165
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,715
Do you need to take off my clothes?

166
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,820
In some cases, yes.

167
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,515
Unbelievable. Absolutely shameless.

168
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,030
Me? Shameless?

169
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:35,537
Then what about you sneaking
into my bed while I was asleep?

170
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:36,337
Isn't that shameless?

171
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:36,620
I...

172
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:37,060
Master,

173
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,700
you're not behaving well.

174
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,700
I...

175
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,626
I didn't do anything inappropriate.

176
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,940
Oh? A man and a woman sleeping
in the same bed at night.

177
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,715
Are you saying that's not inappropriate?

178
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,350
Before coming to my room,

179
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,180
where were you?

180
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,648
Why are you asking that?

181
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,630
The manor is being searched.

182
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,540
They said a prisoner escaped.

183
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
You have nothing to do with this, right?

184
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,115
I don't know anything about it.

185
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,580
So that's why you brought me

186
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,900
to the secret chamber.

187
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,820
You didn't see anything
in the secret chamber, did you?

188
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,390
I saw your deep affection
for Lin Shaoci.

189
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,300
Do you mean that painting album?

190
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,180
Anyway, I don't have

191
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,870
any romantic feelings for Lin Shaoci.

192
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,382
So don't overthink it.

193
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,660
I don't care how deep
your feelings are for him.

194
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,110
I really don't like him that way!

195
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,300
I'll just put it this way.

196
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,750
If I truly like someone,

197
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:43,900
I want to share all the beautiful things
in the world

198
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
with him.

199
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,940
When I see bright stars,

200
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,580
(I want him to see them too.)

201
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,110
(When I eat something delicious,)

202
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:55,848
(I want to share half of it with him.)

203
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:58,848
(When something funny happens,)

204
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,048
(I want to laugh about it together.)

205
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,470
Basically,

206
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,180
all the scenery,

207
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,110
all the fun,

208
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,300
all the joy, anger, sorrow,
and happiness,

209
00:13:14,382 --> 00:13:16,471
I want to experience
all of these with him.

210
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,540
And Lin Shaoci

211
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,700
is not that person.

212
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,580
I'm very sure of that.

213
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,940
How did you end up at Yuchi Manor
as a child?

214
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,230
I don't remember.

215
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,750
They only say

216
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,470
Lin Shaoci treated me well,

217
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,940
like an older brother.

218
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,300
You say you don't like him.

219
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,390
But the paintings you painted of him
are filled with deep affection.

220
00:13:59,626 --> 00:14:00,700
It's just one step away

221
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,300
from writing a girl's longing for love.

222
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,940
Master, you seem to be invested
in my relationship with Lin Shaoci.

223
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,390
Are you

224
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,510
jealous?

225
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,230
No, I'm not.

226
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,750
Get off me.

227
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,780
(You call me "Master" all the time.)

228
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,540
(Yet you secretly hide
Lin Shaoci's painting album)

229
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,582
(and look at it
in the secret chamber every day.)

230
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,300
(Who knows who's really in your heart?)

231
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,230
(Forget it.)

232
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,329
(The most important thing right now)

233
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,810
(is to find the one who poisoned her)

234
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
(and save her life.)

235
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,071
Master, are you...

236
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:39,560
If you had put half as much effort
into your swordsmanship,

237
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:41,626
you wouldn't even need me
as your master any more.

238
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Get up early tomorrow

239
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,180
to continue training.

240
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,750
Are you serious?

241
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,390
What does Rong Shukuang's love life

242
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,030
have to do with me?

243
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,350
Master, I'm here.

244
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,030
Laziness

245
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,540
is the greatest enemy of martial arts.

246
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,030
From now on,

247
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,580
I won't go easy on you.

248
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,750
Master, I have a question.

249
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,470
What is it?

250
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,630
They say

251
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,420
one needs to sink Qi to the Dantian.
How do you do that?

252
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,471
Feel it for yourself.

253
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,420
This is incredible.

254
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:41,830
Concentrate and circulate your energy
through the meridians.

255
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,000
When your Qi sinks to Dantian,

256
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:45,470
your energy gathers
at the Shenque acupoint,

257
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,779
and it clears the mind
and strengthens the body,

258
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,093
making you feel almost superhuman.

259
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,350
I have another question, Master.

260
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,230
You just mentioned the Shenque acupoint.

261
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,510
Where exactly is it?

262
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,060
Here.

263
00:15:59,540 --> 00:15:59,940
Here?

264
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:01,060
What are you doing?

265
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,580
Keep quiet.

266
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,820
You're losing your energy.

267
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,150
What were you thinking?

268
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,870
During training, you must concentrate

269
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,900
and stay calm.

270
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,900
No distractions.

271
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,715
What happens if I get distracted?

272
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:18,315
You could lose control and go berserk.

273
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:20,182
Then I don't want to practice anymore.

274
00:16:20,182 --> 00:16:20,915
That's too risky.

275
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,110
Just stay focused.

276
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,150
In less than a month,

277
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,430
you can use your sword techniques

278
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,226
even if your inner strength
doesn't recover.

279
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:27,640
Since you're retraining from scratch,

280
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,250
there's no need
to learn from anyone else.

281
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:30,350
I can teach you personally.

282
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,540
No need to trouble you
for something so minor.

283
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,820
Rong,

284
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,630
you used to train with Shaoci
all the time.

285
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,110
Young Master Lin,

286
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:41,510
are you that eager
to snatch my disciple?

287
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,270
Why? You won't allow it?

288
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,180
She's already my disciple.

289
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:47,240
Of course, it's not advisable
to change her master.

290
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,780
Then may I ask
where you learned your skills?

291
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,350
What if I don't want to answer?

292
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:56,560
(We'll see
how long your arrogance lasts.)

293
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,180
Excuse me, gentlemen.

294
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Why don't you two spar?

295
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,110
The winner gets to be my master.

296
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,820
Go ahead and fight. Feng, come.

297
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,750
Then let's begin.

298
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,620
(It's time for Shukuang)

299
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,580
(to see your true colors.)

300
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:43,990
Rong, are you feeling unwell?

301
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:54,820
Are you all right?

302
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:56,950
Shaoci,

303
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,670
do you remember
which tea set you loved the most?

304
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
Tea set? Why?

305
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,820
I don't remember.

306
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,030
It feels like there are things

307
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,100
I should remember.

308
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,626
But no matter how hard I try,
I just can't recall them.

309
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,950
If you don't remember,

310
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,060
why force yourself?

311
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,140
It must be something important.

312
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,780
I have to remember.

313
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,030
Over here.

314
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,580
No, a little lower.

315
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,340
Here.

316
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,140
Yes! That's the spot.

317
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,470
Not bad, Yingluo.

318
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,340
You've got some serious massage skills.

319
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:42,750
It's all because of that album.

320
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:45,540
Master has been making my life miserable
ever since he saw it.

321
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,510
What's so special
about those sketches anyway?

322
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:48,580
I can't even memorize them.

323
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,030
Sister Rong, what album
are you talking about?

324
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,620
Oh, just Shaoci's
sword technique illustrations.

325
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,470
Brother Shaoci's?

326
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:00,860
Ah, yes.

327
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,430
Since Master hates that album so much,

328
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,430
I might as well sell it.

329
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,100
I bet images of someone
with many admirers

330
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,670
would fetch a high price.

331
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,230
That's really valuable. Don't sell it.

332
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:15,710
- Don't do it.
- There she is.

333
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,380
Keep this for me.

334
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,493
Are all of you admirers of Lin Shaoci?

335
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,580
Yes.

336
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:22,510
You too?

337
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,510
Young Master Lin

338
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,750
is talented and charming.

339
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,950
Who wouldn't admire him?

340
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,230
If they can like him,

341
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,340
why can't I?

342
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,710
Sure, why not?

343
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,140
All right.

344
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,604
Stock is limited.
So first come, first served.

345
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:35,380
Come and get it.

346
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,220
I want the first one.

347
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,826
- I want this one.
- I'll take this one.

348
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,340
All right. There you go.

349
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,380
All right, then.

350
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,990
Pay up if you like it.

351
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,580
Thank you.

352
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,300
Pay up.

353
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,540
Here you go.

354
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,820
Here's your money.

355
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,100
Thank you, everyone.

356
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,510
Let me see.

357
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,100
No!

358
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,330
Wait, just let me take a look.

359
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:03,470
I've already paid.

360
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,300
He's so handsome.

361
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,710
Let me see.

362
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,510
You can take your money back.

363
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,510
No way.

364
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,060
I changed my mind about selling them.

365
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,430
You can't do that.

366
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,100
You've received the payment.

367
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:15,670
I can return the money to you.

368
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,910
The market price isn't the same anymore.

369
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,470
It's at least

370
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,540
this much now.

371
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,030
One hundred taels.

372
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,950
You raised the price

373
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,470
in just a few seconds?

374
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,140
Ever heard
of "once the deal is set, no changes"?

375
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,820
Fine.

376
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,140
I am Young Lady Rong from Yuchi Manor.

377
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,430
Wait here.

378
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:35,604
You think I can't afford it?

379
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:36,448
Just wait and see.

380
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,300
These

381
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,780
don't seem to add up to 100 taels.

382
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,470
Master!

383
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,340
Master!

384
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,340
Master.

385
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,230
Uh...

386
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,230
Can you lend me some money?

387
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:00,910
For?

388
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,470
I want to buy

389
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,230
some girls' things.

390
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,950
How much?

391
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,060
I need 100 taels.

392
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,510
Sorry, no.

393
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,060
Master,

394
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,780
don't they say once a teacher,
always a father?

395
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,470
Since you're my father,
can't you spare some pocket money?

396
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,380
Give me some.

397
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,230
Tell me what it's for.

398
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,990
I... I want to buy some...

399
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:31,710
I wanted to...

400
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,230
Sister Rong!

401
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,620
After some negotiation,

402
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,182
they agreed to lower the price.

403
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,950
You can get the album back for 50 taels.

404
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,510
Shut it.

405
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,380
So you asked Yan Shao to help?

406
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,780
Album?

407
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:50,750
Is that the album of Lin Shaoci looking
all charming and dashing?

408
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:53,137
Handsome, graceful, and irresistible.

409
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,140
No!

410
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,990
Yes.

411
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,990
It's hard to tell.

412
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,100
I already sold the album.

413
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,780
But I suddenly saw something important.

414
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:00,910
But they won't give it to me.

415
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,380
So I have to buy it back first.

416
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,750
But they jacked up the price.

417
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,860
So are you selling it or redeeming it?

418
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,471
I'll redeem it first,

419
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:08,890
take a look, and then sell it again.

420
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,030
That's not an issue.

421
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:11,990
Spending a fortune just for a glance.

422
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,780
Young Lady Rong,
you sure are passionate.

423
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,100
No, it's not...

424
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,190
Master!

425
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,820
You said you'd give me
the pocket money.

426
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,910
How could he go back on his words?

427
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,190
Why do you think he did that?

428
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,060
Let's go.

429
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:51,250
(Fuyuan County Office Criminal Records)

430
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,510
(There's someone else here.)

431
00:23:54,115 --> 00:23:55,910
(I just don't know
why this person is here.)

432
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,750
It was a long night for me.

433
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,340
Yan Shao, you can't sleep either?

434
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,470
This is really killing me!

435
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,470
Why are you sneaking around?

436
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,910
Look who's talking.

437
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,471
I only followed
because I saw you sneaking in first.

438
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,030
Did you hear that clearly?

439
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:47,780
Not really.

440
00:24:47,826 --> 00:24:49,710
It sounded like someone moving
around inside.

441
00:25:37,897 --> 00:25:39,040
(River and Terrain Survey)

442
00:25:50,404 --> 00:25:52,493
Young Master, we've searched everywhere.

443
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:57,048
(It's hard to guard
against someone from the inside.)

444
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,670
(Since you want to play cat and mouse,)

445
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,540
(I'll play along.)

446
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:03,540
Leave.

447
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:18,293
Are you done hugging me?

448
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,737
You couldn't borrow money,
so now you're stealing?

449
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,780
I was not.

450
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,030
I wanted to know

451
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,430
the manor's income and expenses.

452
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,670
That's rich of you to say.

453
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,950
If I didn't, I wouldn't
have caught you here.

454
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,540
If you had nothing to hide,

455
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,760
why didn't you show yourself

456
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,071
when your Young Master was here?

457
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,270
Mind your own business.

458
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,470
What about you?

459
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,470
What are you doing here?

460
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,430
Just looking around.

461
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,750
Why didn't you catch me just now?

462
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,820
Consider this a lesson.

463
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,540
From now on,

464
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,620
stay out of my business.

465
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,750
Stay out of your business, huh?

466
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,950
A couple of nights ago,

467
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,060
I saw Young Lady Rong and Yan Shao

468
00:28:05,093 --> 00:28:06,580
sneaking into the Hidden Pavilion.

469
00:28:07,537 --> 00:28:10,270
Are you saying they went there together
in the middle of the night?

470
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,190
That's right.

471
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,950
I saw Rong Shukuang

472
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,340
sneaking out.

473
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,710
So I followed her.

474
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,910
But when she went in, she was alone.

475
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,780
When she came out,
there were two of them.

476
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,030
I heard Shukuang has been short
on money lately.

477
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,950
She's probably looking into
Yuchi Manor's financial records

478
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,430
to take over the business.

479
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,060
But why was Yan Shao

480
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,470
so reckless?

481
00:28:33,515 --> 00:28:35,670
Just because he contributed
to the Zhonghe Festival

482
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,820
and has Young Lady Rong's trust,

483
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,910
he's getting more and more
out of control.

484
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,580
I suspect

485
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,860
he has another motive.

486
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,270
Keep an eye on him

487
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,430
and find out what he's really after.

488
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,860
If we don't deal with him,

489
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,160
it's hard for you to achieve
what you want to do.

490
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,100
I understand.

491
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,510
Could it be

492
00:29:05,337 --> 00:29:07,404
that our goals are actually aligned?

493
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:12,540
(If that's the case,
why don't I give you a hand?)

494
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,270
Shaoci,

495
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,580
I heard about what happened last night.

496
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,990
Were you injured?

497
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:29,820
I'm fine.

498
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,130
You're not in the best health.

499
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,537
So don't push yourself too hard.

500
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,620
Yan Shao is still an outsider.

501
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,380
You must put the manor's safety first.

502
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,580
Of course.

503
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,860
Don't worry. I'll walk you back.

504
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,910
What kind of plot is this?

505
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:04,382
The Assassination of Jing Ke
or The Gathering of Heroes?

506
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,580
You infiltrated the Yuchi Manor.

507
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:08,910
Are you playing the role
of Jing Ke or Zhou Yu?

508
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,710
Let's put the theatrics aside.

509
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,190
Why the sudden hostility?

510
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,060
Stay away from this person.

511
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,100
Come here.

512
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,710
Yan Shao is here because of me.

513
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,670
If there's a problem, say it clearly.

514
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:27,780
Just come here first.

515
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,110
Last night, a brocade box went missing
from Hidden Pavilion.

516
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,140
Yan Shao,

517
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,604
do you know where it is?

518
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,270
He didn't steal it. I can prove it.

519
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,340
Say something.

520
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,140
What's this?

521
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:53,950
Why?

522
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,140
Yan Shao,

523
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,230
why did you sneak
into the Hidden Pavilion?

524
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:03,071
Don't bother asking him.

525
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,910
Only Father and I knew

526
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,710
about this brocade box.

527
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,100
But last night,

528
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,990
I found signs of an intruder.

529
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,580
If I'm not mistaken,

530
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,448
it was you, wasn't it?

531
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:15,230
Yes, it was me.

532
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,950
You're bold but at least you dare
to admit what you've done.

533
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,990
That brocade box contains

534
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,710
the key to unlocking
the Fuxian treasure.

535
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,430
You infiltrated Yuchi Manor

536
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,230
for this, right?

537
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,270
Yuchi Manor has always denied

538
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,780
any connection to the treasure.

539
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:30,750
What's this

540
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:31,910
sudden change of heart?

541
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,430
Shukuang,

542
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,950
do you still trust him?

543
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,140
Think back.

544
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,990
Since the day you met,

545
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,950
Yan Shao has risked his life
for you multiple times

546
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,990
and then conveniently decided
to follow you here.

547
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,060
Are you sure

548
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,990
that his intentions are pure?

549
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,190
Shaoci,

550
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,470
I want to ask him a few questions.

551
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,030
Don't let him fool you again.

552
00:32:23,382 --> 00:32:24,510
I know what I'm doing.

553
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:26,950
Once I get my answers,

554
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,300
I'll decide for myself.

555
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,380
After all this time,

556
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,710
I've always considered you
the person I trust most.

557
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,620
Do you really have nothing to say to me?

558
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,190
There's nothing left

559
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,860
to say.

560
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,190
Fine.

561
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,860
You're my master,

562
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,910
and you once saved my life.

563
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,710
From now on, we're even.

564
00:33:41,048 --> 00:33:43,100
Do you really believe
I'm that kind of person?

565
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:44,750
It doesn't matter anymore.

566
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,710
The world is vast.

567
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,820
