17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 7=

19
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,850
It's getting windy.

20
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,770
The spring breeze
brings the fallen flowers.

21
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,010
Tomorrow night,

22
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm afraid the street will be too full

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,360
of fallen flowers to be swept away.

24
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,570
Fallen flowers?

25
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,160
They deserve such a nice description?

26
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:11,370
They're nothing more
than a bunch of pissants.

27
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:14,715
In all my years of traveling
in the martial world,

28
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,920
I've never seen

29
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,690
a woman like you.

30
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,250
You're so weak but ruthless.

31
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:24,582
The martial world is full of strife,
and only the strongest survive.

32
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:27,715
Which of those who claim
to be of the highest caliber

33
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,290
are not motivated by greed?

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,480
If it weren't for the treasure,

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,760
they all wouldn't be here.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,920
If something happens

37
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,640
to those sects in the territory
of Yuchi Manor,

38
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,850
it will be difficult for Master Lin
to explain to the world.

39
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,810
Since ancient times,
the weak have submitted to the strong.

40
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,600
The strong don't care
what the weak think.

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,850
By the time Yuchi Manor

42
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,530
rules the martial arts world,

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,640
they won't have the guts to complain.

44
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,250
If you weren't in such a state,

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
you'd have the whole Yuchi Manor
in your possession.

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,130
If I wasn't in such a state,

47
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,320
I wouldn't need others

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,920
to help me plan.

49
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,010
It's all right.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
With your body,

51
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,760
you can't withstand the spring breeze.

52
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,880
The great work is not yet done.

53
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,970
I won't die yet.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
Where did you go, Young Lady Lin?

55
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,720
Are you here to see me?

56
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:37,760
Young Master Lin and Young Lady Rong
are worried about you.

57
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,600
I was just walking around.

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,480
Let's go back.

59
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,320
Okay.

60
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:12,693
(Yuchi Manor)
The Pure Sword Sect has arrived.

61
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,440
The Tang Clan has arrived.

62
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,080
The Spirit Fox Sect has arrived.

63
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,200
Madam Xing, this way, please.

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,690
The Junshan Sect has arrived.

65
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,560
Madam Xing.

66
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,310
(Madam Xing,)

67
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,930
(Head of Pure Sword Sect)
It's been a long time.

68
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:24,570
You're still so strong and healthy.

69
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,690
You haven't been out for years,

70
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,130
and now you're in Yuchi Manor in person.

71
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,610
Master Lin has so much respect.

72
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,080
Head Tang.

73
00:04:34,114 --> 00:04:35,460
(Tang Chanyi, Head of Tang Clan)

74
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:38,130
(A Disciple of Junshan Sect)
Is Head Tang thinking of

75
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,880
forming a marriage bond
with Yuchi Manor?

76
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,520
What?

77
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,250
Your sect is afraid
of Ghost Valley Sect

78
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,893
and even your head doesn't dare to come?

79
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:46,520
The Seven-Star Hall has arrived.

80
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,640
Chanyi, don't be mad at him.

81
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,690
(Jiang Ruhai, Seven-Star Hall)

82
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:55,280
Chief Jiang.

83
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,782
(Jiang Cheng, Chief of Seven-Star Hall)
Head Tang,

84
00:04:57,826 --> 00:04:59,290
how have you been?

85
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:00,471
I have been good.

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,626
That's good to hear.

87
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:11,010
(Boardroom)

88
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,893
You all have traveled
across the seas or mountains

89
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,010
to join us here at Yuchi Manor.

90
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm deeply grateful.

91
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,440
I apologize for the poor hospitality.

92
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,080
Please forgive that.

93
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,130
Master Lin,

94
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,690
spare the formalities.

95
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,690
We came to Yuchi Manor

96
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,320
for the sake of Six Great Sects
to be together

97
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,440
and to support each other.

98
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,730
Wait.

99
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,490
If it's a war
with Ghost Valley Sect,

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,440
the Pure Sword Sect
doesn't intend to be part of it.

101
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,490
That's what

102
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,050
we're here to discuss.

103
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,130
Master Lin,

104
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,010
Ghost Valley Sect arrested someone

105
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,010
for the key and map
to the Fuxian treasure.

106
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,760
Who here

107
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,130
isn't after the treasure?

108
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:15,050
Today, I'd like to ask
Master Lin for an explanation.

109
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,610
Is the key to the treasure
in Yuchi Manor or not?

110
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,170
I've invited you here,

111
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,200
firstly for Zhonghe Festival,

112
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,293
and secondly,

113
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,320
to discuss this matter.

114
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,130
You've come a long way,

115
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:35,560
so why don't you take a rest first?

116
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,520
As for this matter, it's not urgent.

117
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:39,130
We can discuss it in the long run.

118
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,960
Master, the guest rooms are ready.

119
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,280
Please have a good rest.

120
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,370
Please come with me.

121
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:49,930
Please.

122
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,280
Please.

123
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
You've disgraced

124
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,810
the Tang family.

125
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,400
Chanyi, what's wrong?

126
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,400
You've been following
Lin Shaoci all day.

127
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,448
It's been so many years

128
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,915
and he hasn't married you yet.

129
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,200
If you go on like this,

130
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,130
you'll become the laughing stock
sooner or later,

131
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,130
just like Rong Shukuang
and Yu Linglong.

132
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,520
Brother Shaoci has his own plans.

133
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,026
Snake, be good.

134
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,130
Use this

135
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:20,848
and he will definitely fall for you.

136
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,490
Chanyi, I can't do this
to someone I like.

137
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Distribute the people in the inner city

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,640
to coordinate with each other

139
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,440
to protect the city.

140
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,520
So

141
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,640
the city will be well protected

142
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,690
and there'll be no mistakes.

143
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,080
Father,

144
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,400
the sects are gathering today.

145
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
The heads and chiefs
have their own plans, right?

146
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,400
Whether it's a friend or foe,

147
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,880
we can't give Ghost Valley Sect

148
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,050
a chance to take advantage of us.

149
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,400
I understood.

150
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,250
Besides,

151
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,810
there's one more thing
you should plan as soon as possible.

152
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,960
For Yu Linglong and Tang Yingluo...

153
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,960
Which one...

154
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,130
do you want to marry?

155
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,050
Father,

156
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,730
Yu and Yingluo,

157
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,930
to me,

158
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,730
are sisters like Wanci.

159
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,930
Sisters?

160
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
They are not your blood relatives.

161
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,800
How can they be the same?

162
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,730
What about Shukuang?

163
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,490
You said

164
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,520
you just thought
of Shukuang as a sister.

165
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,330
- To her, you...
- Father.

166
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,130
Once upon a time, I even thought

167
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,520
that Shukuang was a man

168
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,130
I could trust and rely on.

169
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,560
But

170
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,520
since she got hurt,

171
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
I feel like she's changed.

172
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,210
I suddenly...

173
00:08:57,448 --> 00:08:59,648
Suddenly, I feel like
I want to protect her.

174
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,640
Father,

175
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,970
I still need

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,400
to think about this.

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,370
Two days later is Zhonghe Festival.

178
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,293
It is not to be taken lightly.

179
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,137
You may leave now.

180
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,400
Yes.

181
00:09:42,893 --> 00:09:44,210
Watch out, Young Lady Rong.

182
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,730
Let's go.

183
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,250
You finally showed up.

184
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,730
I haven't seen you all day.

185
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,160
Where have you been?

186
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,450
Drinking.

187
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:58,280
Drinking on such an important day?

188
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:02,040
Fine.

189
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:03,293
As long as you're back.

190
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,850
Look at me.

191
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,920
What do you think?

192
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,880
You deserve the title
of Top Swordsman of Yuchi Manor.

193
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,520
Go.

194
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,610
Greetings, Master Lin.

195
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,450
Head Yu,

196
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,160
Madam Xing.

197
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,280
Today's flower fair is very lively.

198
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,730
Yes.

199
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,250
Today is Zhonghe Festival.

200
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,250
We are honored to have

201
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,450
all the heroes here.

202
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,560
Whoever wins the contest

203
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,671
against all the other heroes

204
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,610
will be rewarded
with a big gift from Yuchi Manor.

205
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,090
Young Lady Rong, I'm here.

206
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,040
She...

207
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,680
Let's go.

208
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,010
After two hours,

209
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,160
the Red Banner Flower Fair

210
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,400
will officially begin.

211
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,640
Please have a seat.

212
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,450
Please.

213
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,450
I thought I won every year.

214
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,800
What about my prize money?

215
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,250
The prize money is for this year,
not for previous years.

216
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,271
- That's too unfair.
- Mister and Miss,

217
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:45,960
please come in.

218
00:11:45,982 --> 00:11:47,640
I'll bring you a bottle of good wine.

219
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,450
Okay.

220
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:48,970
Have a seat.

221
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Young Lady Rong,

222
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,040
it's been a long time.

223
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,210
I'm glad

224
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,800
to see you're safe and sound.

225
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,520
Young Master Ruhai,

226
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,560
Young Lady Rong has been missing you.

227
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,210
Yes.

228
00:12:01,248 --> 00:12:02,090
She broke your leg

229
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,760
at the flower fair last year.

230
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,490
She's still upset about that.

231
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,250
How's your leg?

232
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,010
Thank you.

233
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,010
It's healed.

234
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,610
Well, was I ever this mean?

235
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,850
Is your leg okay
for this year's contest?

236
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,250
This one.

237
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:19,920
Okay.

238
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,640
If my guard wins
the prize money this year,

239
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,730
I'll give you all of it

240
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,210
as medical expenses.

241
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:25,850
Okay?

242
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,330
I don't care about money.

243
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,730
If you really want to apologize,

244
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,730
come on,

245
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
drink up this bowl of wine

246
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,680
as an apology.

247
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,010
I'll finish it.

248
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,730
Young Lady Rong,

249
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,160
you're the best of men,
and the greatest of women.

250
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,370
Here's to you.

251
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,210
- You flatter me.
- Yan Shao.

252
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,330
- Let's drink.
- Bottoms up.

253
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,350
Young Lady Lin told you
to prepare for the contest.

254
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,730
Okay.

255
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:49,404
- Young Lady Rong.
- Young Lady Rong.

256
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:50,560
- Here's to you.
- Let's go.

257
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
That's too kind of you.

258
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,280
Remember to enjoy yourselves here.

259
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,693
- Sure.
- Thanks, Young Lady Rong.

260
00:12:58,737 --> 00:12:59,520
Young Lady Rong.

261
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,370
I'll be going.

262
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,490
I'm leaving.

263
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,800
Young Lady Rong.

264
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:12,280
(Tavern)

265
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,680
Split up for patrols.
Nothing is allowed to happen.

266
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,040
Young Master Lin!

267
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,880
Young Master Lin!

268
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,426
Something's happened to the winery
on the west side of the city.

269
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,090
Young Master Lin!

270
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:25,090
What's wrong with you?

271
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,640
Sorry.

272
00:13:25,915 --> 00:13:27,400
I'm in a hurry to see my young master.

273
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,680
Wait.

274
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,330
What's going on at the winery?

275
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:31,330
I went to make a delivery

276
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:32,826
and found out something was wrong.

277
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:34,226
The carriage wasn't carrying wine.

278
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,040
But...

279
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:35,760
But...

280
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,782
Forget it. I'm not talking to you.

281
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,640
I told you not to run so fast.

282
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,370
Look at you.

283
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,970
Don't throw up.

284
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,400
I'll take you to a physician.

285
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:50,340
(Blossom's Smile)

286
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,610
Lucky sachets!

287
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,880
Fragrant and beautiful lucky sachets!

288
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,970
This is good wine.

289
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,610
Thanks for selling it to me.

290
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,880
Lucky sachets!

291
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,640
Fragrant and beautiful lucky sachets!

292
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,970
Lucky sachets!

293
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,210
The Red Banner Flower Fair
at Yuchi Manor is about to begin.

294
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,520
Those drinking sessions
before the contest

295
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,090
are the same as in previous years.

296
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,450
It's not interesting.

297
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
You're tired of serving the guests.

298
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,680
Just go back and rest.

299
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,730
It's a mess out there tonight.

300
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:33,084
Don't go out.

301
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,970
I have to go to the bank.

302
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,900
(Blossom's Smile)

303
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:58,680
Goodbye, Young Lady Rong.

304
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,490
Mr. Jiang,

305
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,250
the fun's about to begin.

306
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,090
Where are you going?

307
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Young Lady Rong,

308
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:06,490
you want to go to the toilet with me?

309
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:08,537
It's just a little bit
of an exciting moment.

310
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
How can you leave now?

311
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,610
Come on, Mr. Jiang.

312
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,648
I wish you good luck in the contest.

313
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,730
I'll drink it when I get back.

314
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:16,680
Mr. Jiang.

315
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,490
Mr. Jiang.

316
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,400
Let's go.

317
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,370
What's the point of chasing me?

318
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,490
You were with Yan Shao last time.

319
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,210
I'm Feng Ming.

320
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,920
When Yan Shao is away,

321
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
I'll protect you.

322
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,250
Ignition stick?

323
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:35,920
Something is not right.

324
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,090
There's something wrong with
Red Banner Flower Fair today.

325
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,680
Young Lady Rong,

326
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,210
you're probably drunk.

327
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,610
You have to attend
the Red Banner Flower Fair.

328
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,250
Both of them smell the same.

329
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,490
What smell is that?

330
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,090
What do they have to do with each other?

331
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,640
Who do you mean?

332
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:58,610
The kid who dropped this ignition stick

333
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,400
and Jiang Ruhai
who kept getting me drunk.

334
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,730
Both of them smell the same.

335
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,450
It's unusual.

336
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,210
No way.

337
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,650
I want to see what they're up to.

338
00:17:50,693 --> 00:17:52,170
Why are we meeting so suddenly?

339
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,410
Is there a change of plans?

340
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,450
Yes.

341
00:17:54,893 --> 00:17:57,210
Leader Shen needs to notify you
of other arrangements.

342
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,080
Where are your ignition sticks?

343
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,360
I was in a hurry.

344
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,170
I might have dropped it outside.

345
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,280
If you mess up today,

346
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,010
can you still keep your life?

347
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,930
When the flower ball drops,

348
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
that's the signal.

349
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,489
At the same time,
ignite the kerosene everywhere.

350
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,360
When the fire is lit,

351
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,730
all of us will meet up
at Blossom's Smile.

352
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,650
After that,

353
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,490
we'll leave the city together.

354
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,490
I'll take the shortcut.

355
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,970
Watch out!

356
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,320
This...

357
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,410
This is

358
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,080
blood.

359
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,760
Young Lady Rong.

360
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,690
Young Lady Rong.

361
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,600
Madam Li.

362
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,970
Let's take him to my shop

363
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,250
and get a physician.

364
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,509
Don't worry, Young Lady Rong.

365
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,537
Blossom's Smile has been open
for 20 years.

366
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,515
Madam Li can be trusted.

367
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:00,520
(Blossom's Smile)

368
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,170
Wait.

369
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,760
Okay, you may go now.

370
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,890
Inspection.

371
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:57,250
Look over there.

372
00:19:57,337 --> 00:19:58,160
It's so beautiful.

373
00:19:58,930 --> 00:19:59,730
It's so crowded.

374
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,840
It's so lively today.

375
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,120
Slow down.

376
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,840
Come on. Come here.

377
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,760
Be careful.

378
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,271
With Young Master Lin
guarding the checkpoint,

379
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,490
no one can get through, right?

380
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,650
In the past years,

381
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,760
it's Young Lady Rong
who's the most outstanding.

382
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,690
This year, she was injured
by Ghost Valley Sect

383
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,040
and she can't join the contest.

384
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,280
This flower fair

385
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,650
isn't as exciting as previous years.

386
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,930
There are many heroes
in the world today.

387
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,040
We don't know if there will
be an unexpected winner this year.

388
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,210
Tonight, all the heroes are gathered.

389
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,600
I hope you all

390
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,930
have a good time.

391
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,650
Come on, let's drink.

392
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:49,800
Sorry.

393
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,360
Excuse me.

394
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,040
Excuse me.

395
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,760
Excuse me.

396
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,690
Sister Rong.

397
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,840
Where's Yan Shao? I need to see him.

398
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,040
He's ready for the contest.

399
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,280
Let's leave him for now.

400
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,520
Wanci is not feeling well,

401
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,180
so she asked you
to guard the checkpoint.

402
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:03,310
I can't. I've been bad at Chinese
since I was a kid.

403
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:04,280
We've got you covered.

404
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:08,804
Look. The first checkpoint
is Speaking the Name of the Wine.

405
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,010
The second checkpoint
is this Flying Flower Order.

406
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,715
The third is Climbing Up to the Attic.

407
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,800
Shaoci is the keeper
of the third checkpoint.

408
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,426
You're the one
of the second checkpoint.

409
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,280
In my opinion, these swordsmen

410
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,715
won't even make it to the third
checkpoint with their poetry.

411
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,970
Just go ahead and take it easy.

412
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,380
If you can't, we'll take care of it.

413
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:23,799
Go.

414
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,490
Okay.

415
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,170
The Red Banner Flower Fair
officially begins now.

416
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,600
Please welcome Yan Shao of Yuchi Manor

417
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,410
and Jiang Ruhai of the Seven-Star Hall

418
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:37,537
to enter the venue.

419
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,520
There's only one bowl
of wine on the table.

420
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,450
The two of you can't move your feet.

421
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,040
You should grab the bowl and drink,

422
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,310
and the one who announces
the name of the wine correctly

423
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,520
passes it.

424
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,450
Let's go.

425
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,490
It starts now.

426
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,730
Nice.

427
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,730
Penglai Spring Wine.

428
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,250
Nice.

429
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,760
The winner is Yan Shao of Yuchi Manor.

430
00:22:31,448 --> 00:22:32,490
Thanks for letting me win.

431
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,026
Please proceed to the next checkpoint.

432
00:22:34,093 --> 00:22:35,840
Well done.

433
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,450
The young man in red
doesn't look familiar.

434
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,693
He defeated Young Master Ruhai
in just a few moves.

435
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,170
Who is he?

436
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,040
I've never seen him before.

437
00:22:45,326 --> 00:22:48,126
I heard he's Young Lady Rong's guard.

438
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,930
Interesting.

439
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:53,760
(Blossom's Smile)

440
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,410
Wine...

441
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,890
Wine? What wine are you talking about?

442
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,280
Where do you mean the wine?

443
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,250
There's wine all over the city now.

444
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,520
I ran into your friend, Feng Ming.

445
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:20,520
Someone was assassinated
in a back alley.

446
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:23,182
This flower fair is not going to be
a peaceful one tonight.

447
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:25,840
And Jiang Ruhai,
something's wrong with him too.

448
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,010
I got it.

449
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,840
How come you don't seem nervous at all?

450
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,600
Are you sober?

451
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,930
I've never been drunk.

452
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,410
(Cunning fox.)

453
00:23:37,604 --> 00:23:39,737
(Do you have something
going on behind your back?)

454
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,730
(I will eventually
strip away your disguise.)

455
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,450
(Little liar,)

456
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,170
(you better behave yourself.)

457
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:46,826
(Don't get into any more trouble.)

458
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,650
(I'm afraid)

459
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,010
(I can't protect you tonight.)

460
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:50,537
Second checkpoint,

461
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:52,204
answering phrases of poetry.

462
00:23:56,471 --> 00:23:57,530
(Flying Flower Order )

463
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
The Flying Flower Order starts now.

464
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,970
Nice.

465
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,970
Nice.

466
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,040
The Flying...

467
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:07,826
The Flying Flower Order?

468
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,760
What?

469
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:10,930
Have you forgotten how
to play Flying Flower Order?

470
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,410
How dare you look down on me?

471
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:17,360
Come on.

472
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,080
Pick the flowers
when they are in bloom...

473
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,800
Butterflies are seen fluttering around
in the flowers.

474
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,120
With gorgeous make-up
and gold hairpins...

475
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,040
It's the time of year when the
plum blossoms fall and fade.

476
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,271
Gorgeous dress is like a floating cloud,
pretty face is like a blooming flower.

477
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,250
Wanci, aren't you feeling unwell?

478
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,170
Why are you here?

479
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,660
Shukuang was injured, lost her memory

480
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,490
and got drunk.

481
00:24:49,515 --> 00:24:51,250
She can't play
Flying Flower Order with you.

482
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:53,004
Let me be the keeper of this checkpoint.

483
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,890
That's fine.

484
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,800
East wind weakens,
and all flowers wither.

485
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,970
Flowers fly everywhere
in the city of spring.

486
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,490
I'm afraid the wind

487
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,690
won't blow down the flowers
in the city tonight.

488
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:09,970
Noble Consort's head ornaments
are left on the ground.

489
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:17,250
Congratulations, Yao Shao.

490
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,010
You've passed the second checkpoint.

491
00:25:19,182 --> 00:25:21,604
Congratulations.
Please proceed to the third checkpoint.

492
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,410
Well done.

493
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:33,826
What's so great about
being able to recite poems?

494
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,250
Wanci.

495
00:25:37,426 --> 00:25:38,520
Your health is important.

496
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,800
I'll take you back first.

497
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,010
Don't bother.

498
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:43,160
You guys stay here
and guard the checkpoint.

499
00:25:43,182 --> 00:25:43,960
You can't move.

500
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:45,280
My carriage is nearby.

501
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,450
I'll just take a break.

502
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:58,080
(It's that smell again.)

503
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:12,204
Congratulations, Miss Yu.
Please proceed to the third checkpoint.

504
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,930
Yu, sorry to offend you.

505
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,320
I'll go to the Spirit Fox Sect

506
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,648
to apologize to you in the future.

507
00:26:26,648 --> 00:26:27,782
Who wants you to apologize?

508
00:26:27,848 --> 00:26:28,730
Young Master Lin,

509
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:30,520
it is hard to repay a debt of love.

510
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,690
You should be more compassionate.

511
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,690
Shut up.

512
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,010
If I can't get up there,

513
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,280
you can't get up there either.

514
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,600
Yu,

515
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,520
that's not fair.

516
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,493
None of your business!

517
00:27:12,293 --> 00:27:13,760
Young Lady Lin has disappeared.

518
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:14,982
The carriage is still there.

519
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,800
Why is the Yellow-Robed here?

520
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,715
Yan Shao, please ascend the building.

521
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,520
Thank you.

522
00:28:17,137 --> 00:28:18,582
Kerosene is flammable.

523
00:28:19,248 --> 00:28:21,093
The ignition stick
is used to light the fire.

524
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:22,450
Barrels of wine are piled up.

525
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,982
The appearance of the Yellow-Robed here

526
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,280
means that Ghost Valley Sect's men

527
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,669
have already infiltrated the city.

528
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,650
If they want to light
the fires at the same time,

529
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,800
they'll need a signal

530
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,970
they can see together.

531
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,930
Signal...

532
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,930
The falling of the flower ball
is the signal.

533
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:43,690
He's got problems.

534
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,560
Catch him.

535
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,410
Look, this...

536
00:29:04,937 --> 00:29:06,760
Something is wrong
with Young Master Ruhai.

537
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,426
Something's going
to happen here tonight.

538
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,937
Someone's going to be lighting fires
all over the place tonight.

539
00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:13,490
I've already smelled kerosene

540
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,840
on at least two people at the scene.

541
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:15,804
When will it happen?

542
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:17,890
If I'm not mistaken,
the falling of the flower ball

543
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,890
is the signal.

544
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,250
That's bad.

545
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:40,410
Yan Shao, no.

546
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,520
So it's you.

547
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,650
What are they doing?

548
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,800
When has Yuchi Manor
ever treated you badly?

549
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,040
No.

550
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,840
What will happen
when the flower ball drops?

551
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,520
I can't tell you.

552
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,515
Put the flower ball down first.

553
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,800
Yan Shao.

554
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:59,120
Shukuang.

555
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,650
Get out of here.

556
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:03,870
You don't even care
about Shukuang's life?

557
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,280
Do you think

558
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,970
I should care?

559
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,040
The lives of the people in the city

560
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,010
are at your mercy.

561
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,320
I don't care if they live or die.

562
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,010
You...

563
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
I trust you.

564
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,490
Yan Shao,

565
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,250
I trust you.

566
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,730
You care about everyone.

567
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,650
You'd never do anything

568
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,410
to hurt the innocent.

569
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,280
I don't doubt you.

570
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,210
I never have.

571
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,250
Thank you, Young Lady Rong.

572
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
Give me the flower ball,

573
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,890
