(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 5=

19
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,630
I didn't try to harm Young Lady Rong!

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,350
I just don't think
she is Young Lady Rong.

21
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,870
(Where did I slip up?)

22
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,510
(How did she catch on?)

23
00:01:58,004 --> 00:01:59,260
(That shouldn't be possible.)

24
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,300
Nonsense.

25
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,070
My sister is Yuchi Manor's
top swordswoman.

26
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,790
No one could just pretend to be her.

27
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,100
If you're so sure,

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,750
then where's your proof?

29
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,950
Young Lady Rong doesn't smile much.

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,750
She does.

31
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:13,660
Young Lady Rong walks fast,
like the wind.

32
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,510
She sways when she walks.

33
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,782
Young Lady Rong dislikes sweets
and loves jerky.

34
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,380
But she prefers sweet treats

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,190
and dislikes jerky.

36
00:02:20,382 --> 00:02:22,380
Young Lady Rong speaks directly
and to the point.

37
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,100
She's smooth-talking and playful.

38
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,950
But she is still allergic

39
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,100
to Arnebia root.

40
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,230
That's right.

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,580
I used Arnebia root

42
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,750
to test her.

43
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,030
The reaction

44
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,260
was exactly like before.

45
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,160
But knowing
Young Lady Rong's personality,

46
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:38,860
she would have confronted me directly

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,030
if she suspected anything.

48
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,580
She wouldn't play mind games

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,048
and secretly test me instead.

50
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,310
Shukuang has a scar on her right wrist.

51
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,140
I accidentally cut her during training

52
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,070
when we were young.

53
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,140
A wound like that wouldn't be fake.

54
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,310
I remember that scar.

55
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,380
Liu An,

56
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,580
you were wrong.

57
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,140
She is Rong Shukuang.

58
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,540
But

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,230
everything Liu An pointed out

60
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,580
isn't completely baseless either.

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,140
(You sure have sharp instincts.)

62
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,030
Actually, I...

63
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,390
The Mystic Ice Jade Palm injury

64
00:03:43,411 --> 00:03:44,580
affected her head.

65
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,580
When I found her,

66
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,310
she had already lost her memories.

67
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,350
You silly girl,

68
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,310
why didn't you say so sooner?

69
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,230
Father.

70
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,540
Even though I can't remember anything,

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,750
I know

72
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,380
Yuchi Manor is my home.

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,510
I thought

74
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,230
if I could just return,

75
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,310
everything would come back to me.

76
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,990
But...

77
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,340
Lately,

78
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,190
Father and Shaoci have been busy
with the Ghost Valley Sect,

79
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:29,780
and Wanci's health is fragile.

80
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,340
I didn't tell anyone

81
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,750
because I didn't want

82
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,070
to worry anyone.

83
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,020
I never expected it

84
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,670
to turn into such a misunderstanding.

85
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,140
Shukuang,

86
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,780
we're family.

87
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:43,700
If something
this important happens again,

88
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,310
you must tell us.

89
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,310
Yes,  Father.

90
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,220
It's all my fault.

91
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:52,430
I shouldn't have doubted
Young Lady Rong.

92
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:54,220
Please punish me, Young Lady Rong.

93
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,900
That's all right.

94
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,750
Get up.

95
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,750
Liu An,

96
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,630
Young Lady Rong doesn't punish you

97
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,990
because she is kind.

98
00:05:04,582 --> 00:05:06,550
But Yuchi Manor
has always followed strict rules.

99
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,220
Actions have consequences.

100
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,670
You made this decision on your own,
so you will be punished.

101
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,990
Twenty lashes.

102
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,510
Go and receive your punishment.

103
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,430
Yes, Master.

104
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,140
Wanci,

105
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:20,820
you and Yingluo need to find a way

106
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,869
to cure Shukuang's cold poison
as soon as possible.

107
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,580
Also, her memory loss
must remain a secret.

108
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,220
No one else can know.

109
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,990
Shaoci, don't worry.

110
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,260
Young Lady Rong,

111
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,670
Master ordered us

112
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,670
to keep an eye on you
so you don't wander off.

113
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,110
I'm standing at my own bedroom door.

114
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,110
Did Master say
I couldn't step outside my room?

115
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,550
Exactly.

116
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,510
I'm going to see Miss Tang.

117
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:02,900
But...

118
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,340
I can have breakfast with her, right?

119
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:06,820
By the way,

120
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:09,093
you were whipped,
and your injuries aren't light.

121
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,020
Go rest.

122
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,560
No need to come
for the next few days.

123
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,700
Go on, hurry back.

124
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,260
All dressed up already?

125
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,260
Guess you knew I was coming.

126
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,380
Sister Rong,

127
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,430
are you going on patrol

128
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,220
with Brother Shaoci?

129
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,580
Patrolling the manor sounds so boring.

130
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,990
As long as I get to spend
more time with Brother Shaoci,

131
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,820
I'm happy.

132
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,340
Did he agree to take you along?

133
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,110
So you see.

134
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,950
Knowing how he is,

135
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,510
he would never bring you with him.

136
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,140
Instead of trying to help him,

137
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,510
why don't we

138
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,340
have some tea

139
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,780
and enjoy a lady's day out?

140
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,110
What does that mean?

141
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
Let's go to town.

142
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,780
Staying in the manor all day
is unbearable.

143
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,990
Brother Shaoci told us not
to let you leave the manor.

144
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,070
It's too dangerous outside.

145
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,140
That's why I came to find you.

146
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,293
If we go together,
it's not just some reckless outing.

147
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,750
After facing death,

148
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,820
I've realized something,

149
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,780
that life is precious.

150
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,310
Let's go.

151
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,110
Look at that!

152
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,750
That's incredible!

153
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,870
Amazing!

154
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,950
Wow!

155
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,780
Look over there!

156
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,670
Please make way.

157
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,260
Thank you.

158
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:38,680
(Blossom's Smile)

159
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,670
If you keep this up,

160
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,070
you'll only harm your body,

161
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,140
and your life might...

162
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,670
I'm fine.

163
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,140
If you face

164
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,700
something dangerous again,

165
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,700
let me handle it for you.

166
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,990
This is my problem,

167
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,070
not yours.

168
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,310
Just focus on what I asked you to do.

169
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,140
All right.

170
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,379
Our people are stationed
all over the city to keep watch.

171
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,140
Also, Boss Lady

172
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,380
will help gather information

173
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,510
about the Six Great Sects.

174
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,070
Ghost Valley Sect
is spreading rumors

175
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,190
that Yuchi Manor holds
the Fuxian treasure.

176
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,460
The martial world is full of schemers.

177
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,340
It's hard to predict what will happen.

178
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,700
Don't worry. I will be extra careful.

179
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:22,700
(Nichang Clothing Store)
Take a look.

180
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,404
We have the finest selection.

181
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,426
Thank you for visiting!

182
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,140
Please come again.

183
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:31,980
Please come in.

184
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,980
Okay, let's go.

185
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,190
Okay.

186
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,910
Take care, sir.

187
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:36,980
Please come again.

188
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,310
What?

189
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,150
Do I look scary?

190
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,670
Young Lady Rong,
you're naturally beautiful.

191
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,582
These newcomers
are not used to such elegance.

192
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,500
Young Lady Rong,
just tell us what you want.

193
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,580
Someone.

194
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,740
Bring out our finest piece!

195
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:08,782
Young Lady Rong, please take a look.

196
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,390
This dress was handcrafted
by our master tailor.

197
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,740
It took three months to complete.

198
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,670
The skirt is woven
from premium brocade silk,

199
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,800
while the outer robe is adorned
with rare feather gauze.

200
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:20,030
Once you put it on,

201
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,671
you'll be light as air,
as if you're floating with every step.

202
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,910
Yingluo,

203
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,790
what do you think?

204
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,500
It's...

205
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,500
It's too extravagant.

206
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,980
For martial artists like us,

207
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,860
it's not exactly practical.

208
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,790
Did you hear that?

209
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,020
Young Lady Rong, you are right.

210
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,150
I wasn't being considerate.

211
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,310
Someone,
take Young Lady Rong's measurements.

212
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,740
Come.

213
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:14,804
Let's get out of here.

214
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,460
After them! Hurry!

215
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,130
(Nichang Clothing Store)
What's going on?

216
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:22,460
Darn it!

217
00:10:24,048 --> 00:10:24,950
Stop right there!

218
00:10:25,137 --> 00:10:27,670
Sister Rong, I told you
leaving the manor was dangerous.

219
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,670
But you wouldn't listen!

220
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,950
Hurry! This way!

221
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,550
Over here!

222
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,960
I can't take them on with just
my poisons and hidden weapons.

223
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:33,648
We can just run!

224
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:34,448
- Stop!
- Hurry!

225
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:37,910
That way!

226
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,740
Hurry!

227
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,790
Slow down!

228
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,100
Take this!

229
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,030
Sister Rong, run!

230
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:50,620
Get her!

231
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:57,740
Oh, my!

232
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,220
I didn't see anything!

233
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,150
Why are you here?

234
00:11:02,804 --> 00:11:03,670
Someone's chasing me.

235
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,220
Yingluo...

236
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,190
Yingluo is still downstairs.

237
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,150
Who is that?

238
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:38,790
(She faints at the sight of blood?)

239
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,550
(It looks like her body
is getting weaker.)

240
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,500
Young Lady Rong
was never like this before.

241
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:51,980
A person's constitution

242
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,700
can change
under different circumstances.

243
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:56,737
Could it be
because of the Mystic Ice Jade Palm?

244
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,910
And the Arnebia root.

245
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,190
It might have affected her too.

246
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,270
Arnebia root only causes itching

247
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,310
and shortness of breath.

248
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,100
It shouldn't be the reason.

249
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,220
So you used it to test
if she was really Young Lady Rong?

250
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,100
Maybe

251
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,270
she has other hidden health issues

252
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,030
we don't know about.

253
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:27,980
She's awake.

254
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,740
Did I pass out again?

255
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,670
What about Yingluo?

256
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,430
She's fine.

257
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,620
And those people
who tried to capture us?

258
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,740
They've been dealt with.

259
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:43,670
But I'm curious about something.

260
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,310
You...

261
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,980
You and that guy in the room together...

262
00:12:59,293 --> 00:13:00,693
He's just the inn's attendant.

263
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,070
The inn's attendant?

264
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,820
He didn't look like one to me.

265
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,310
What exactly

266
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,150
were you two up to?

267
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,670
I was sobering up.

268
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,670
Sobering up?

269
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,790
I drank too much
and needed to sober up quickly.

270
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:14,493
So I ask him to bring me
a bucket of cold water to soak in.

271
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,460
What kind of sobering method is that?

272
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,580
And that guy didn't even dress
like an inn's attendant.

273
00:13:19,848 --> 00:13:21,893
It's up to you
if you want to believe it or not.

274
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,790
Just tell me.

275
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,340
Do you like...

276
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,860
What do you think?

277
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,950
If...

278
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,620
If you're not, then you're not.

279
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,550
Young Lady Lin sent a message.

280
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,910
She's asking for Yan Shao.

281
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,310
She wants to discuss a way
to treat Young Lady Rong.

282
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,220
I'll go right away.

283
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,150
This is about me.

284
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,220
So I'm coming too.

285
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,070
Rong, I'm here!

286
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,620
I brought a huge gift for you.

287
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,910
Who is this?

288
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,700
Feng Tingxie, Hall Master Feng's son.

289
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,430
You, Lin Shaoci,
and he grew up together

290
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,340
and trained together.

291
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,860
Rong,

292
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,860
you're finally back.

293
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,950
I was so worried about you.

294
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,340
The moment he heard you returned,
he rushed over to see you.

295
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,620
Look, I found your sword.

296
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,220
Who are you?

297
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,550
Why are you acting so close to Rong?

298
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:49,910
Wait... Are you
my future brother-in-law?

299
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,910
Don't be ridiculous.

300
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,430
Yan Shao is Rong's personal bodyguard.

301
00:14:57,693 --> 00:14:58,700
Greetings, Young Lady Lin.

302
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,620
Did you catch them?

303
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
They got away.

304
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,550
But I'll assign more people

305
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,026
to strengthen security in the city.

306
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:07,390
Shukuang, are you all right?

307
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,460
I'm fine.

308
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,820
Shukuang,

309
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,550
you got your most treasured sword back.

310
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,430
I miss the days
when you wielded your sword.

311
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,190
Man and sword as one,
your presence was unmatched.

312
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,430
It's a shame

313
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,620
that it's been so long
since I've seen that again.

314
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,220
Then...

315
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,270
Why don't...

316
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,150
It's all right.

317
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,760
Your inner strength
hasn't recovered yet.

318
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,648
No need to push it.

319
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,820
That's true.

320
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,340
But I've heard your bodyguard

321
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,030
is highly skilled.

322
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,270
Maybe we could see for ourselves?

323
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,860
Yan Shao managed to rescue her
from Ghost Valley Sect on his own.

324
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,250
His martial arts must be incredible.

325
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,700
I'd love to witness it.

326
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,670
How about a little demonstration?

327
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,820
Do I have to?

328
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,070
If no one believes
you're capable of protecting me,

329
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,150
you should prove them wrong,
shouldn't you?

330
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,820
Fine.

331
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,790
Seven-Star Hall's Seven-Star Leaf Slash.

332
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,030
Buddhist Heart Sect's
Floral Weaving Hands.

333
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,150
Gentleman's Sword from Junshan Sect.

334
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:17,950
And the Phantom Steps
from Wuwang Pavilion.

335
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,670
I never expected Yan Shao
to be a master of multiple disciplines.

336
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,715
He must've learned
from many different sects.

337
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:30,604
Young Lady Lin, you're well-versed

338
00:17:30,604 --> 00:17:31,382
and I, in combat.

339
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,910
We're quite the match.

340
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,240
But aside from martial arts,

341
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:35,430
I also have knowledge

342
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,430
of medicine and poisons.

343
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,440
I may not be on the level
of Tang Clan's experts.

344
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:39,910
But I can still work with you

345
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,426
to find a way to cure the cold poison.

346
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:42,980
I've spent so much time in the manor

347
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,910
that I've always felt
my knowledge was limited,

348
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,515
like a frog at the bottom of a well.

349
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,110
If you're willing to share,

350
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,300
I'd love to learn from you.

351
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,590
All right.

352
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,040
Yan Shao, this way, please.

353
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,870
After you.

354
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,419
Weren't we supposed
to be discussing my treatment?

355
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,889
Shouldn't you worry about my injuries?

356
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,190
Shaoci, Wanci have been taken away.

357
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,980
That's enough.

358
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,460
You should focus on your own health.

359
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,590
You're still weak.

360
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,670
We'll take you back to rest.

361
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,893
Let them handle the discussion.

362
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:07,430
But I...

363
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,460
Come on, Rong.

364
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,540
- Discuss...?
- Come on.

365
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,700
Count me in.

366
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,150
I'm also a frog in the well.

367
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,830
Yan Shao, please have a seat.

368
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:22,350
I have some knowledge of medicine.

369
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,300
Yan Shao, what do you think?

370
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,315
I wouldn't call it advice.

371
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,780
But what's your plan
for curing the cold poison?

372
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,980
Yingluo has already prepared

373
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,670
several warming and nourishing tonics.

374
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,590
But I think the effects are too slow.

375
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,220
So I looked through medical texts

376
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,670
and found a stronger remedy.

377
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,700
If all goes well,

378
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,430
the poison should be cured
within a month.

379
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,110
Yan Shao, please have a seat.

380
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:42,910
All right.

381
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:46,604
Young Lady Rong's body is still weak

382
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:47,626
from her injuries.

383
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,060
We can't rush her recovery.

384
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,540
A gradual approach is safer.

385
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,870
You might not understand
my sister's personality.

386
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,150
She's always been strong-willed.

387
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
If she doesn't recover quickly,

388
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,220
she'll grow anxious.

389
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,220
Not forgetting the dangers
outside the manor right now.

390
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,300
If that's the case,

391
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,350
I'll leave it to you.

392
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,220
She's my sister.

393
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,093
Of course,
I'll do everything I can to help.

394
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,137
(But once the cold poison is cured,)

395
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,700
(the other unidentified poison
in her body will become active.)

396
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,060
(That will only cause more trouble.)

397
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,360
We have to remove
the cold poison first.

398
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,390
Otherwise,
no amount of supplements will help.

399
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,540
Wanci,

400
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,110
the cold poison runs deep.

401
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,060
Your remedy is too strong.

402
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,590
If it's not done gradually,

403
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,980
it could disrupt her meridians,

404
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,430
and the consequences would be severe.

405
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,179
All medicine carries
some level of toxicity.

406
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,050
Using poison to counter poison
isn't unheard of.

407
00:19:36,071 --> 00:19:38,500
Miss Tang, I'm sure you understand
this better than anyone.

408
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,780
I do. But Sister Rong's condition...

409
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,582
Let's go with Young Lady Lin's method.

410
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,460
I'll do it.

411
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,540
It's all right. I can do it.

412
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,060
Shukuang, drink it before it gets cold.

413
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,780
What kind of medicine is this?

414
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,537
- Just a herbal tonic...
- Don't drink it!

415
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,430
This isn't some fake health supplement

416
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:25,670
that scams old people, is it?

417
00:20:25,848 --> 00:20:28,693
It's medicine to help you recover
from the cold poison faster.

418
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,430
So if I drink it,

419
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,220
I'll regain my martial arts?

420
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,350
Yes.

421
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,430
Then I'll drink it.

422
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,590
This is too bitter.

423
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,430
Is it?

424
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,590
I'll add some sugar for you.

425
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,980
Thank you.

426
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:51,537
I knew you wouldn't like it
because of the bitterness.

427
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,740
So I made a special version

428
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,870
with honey.

429
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,590
Now, I can drink this.

430
00:21:02,982 --> 00:21:04,150
I'm just drinking medicine.

431
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,460
Why are you two doing?

432
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,248
Sister Rong, don't be mad.

433
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,910
The medicine is a little hot.

434
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,550
So I was trying
to cool it down for you.

435
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,460
Okay, you can drink it now.

436
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,260
Regaining martial arts.

437
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,150
You heartless thing!

438
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,500
You said you were going to add sugar

439
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,493
but you just left me there?
What if something...?

440
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,980
You've been complaining all day.

441
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,430
But you're still not tired?

442
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:55,220
What are you doing here
so early in the morning?

443
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,540
Checking if I'm dead?

444
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,020
You're nowhere near dying.

445
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,740
I was only gone for a short while.

446
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,500
Why did you let Lin Wanci swoop in?

447
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,020
You're so weird.

448
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,560
You said you wanted to cure the poison.

449
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
But you're also the one
who won't allow it.

450
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,537
You say you care about Sister Rong.

451
00:22:07,537 --> 00:22:09,670
But then you're so close to Wanci.

452
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,260
And while you're close to her,

453
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,260
you still don't trust her.

454
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,500
What you see isn't always the truth.

455
00:22:16,382 --> 00:22:18,204
Right now, we can't let anyone else know

456
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,440
that Rong Shukuang
has a second type of poison in her body.

457
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,980
Lest it alerts the enemy.

458
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,910
But her pulse is steady.

459
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,048
Could it be
that the antidote didn't work?

460
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,060
That's impossible.

461
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,190
Young Lady Lin isn't someone
to be underestimated.

462
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,910
But I may have made

463
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,020
a little adjustment to the medicine.

464
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,540
Wait, is it another poison?

465
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,740
I had no choice.

466
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,830
I added a tiny bit
of Bone-Corroding Powder.

467
00:22:43,382 --> 00:22:44,910
The two poisons counteract each other.

468
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,060
It's the only way

469
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,500
to suppress the effects of the tonic.

470
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:49,839
You even used a top-tier poison
from Tang Clan.

471
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,950
Are you sure she'll be fine?

472
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,430
To be honest,

473
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,870
I can't say for sure.

474
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,740
We only tested the poison on animals.

475
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,390
I have no idea what will happen

476
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,830
when used on a person.

477
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,150
I'm either dead
or on the brink of death!

478
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,026
You people mess with me
like this every day!

479
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:07,540
I don't even know what's an antidote

480
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,780
and what's poison anymore.

481
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,630
Answer me.

482
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,950
Among you, Tang Yingluo,
and Lin Wanci...

483
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,350
Who should I trust?

484
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,910
Sorry? Who?

485
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,500
You...

486
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,190
That's right. Trust me.

487
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,780
I didn't say that.

488
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:27,870
Are you feeling better now?

489
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,271
You bring nothing but trouble...

490
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,950
I'm feeling better now.

491
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,670
Young Lady Rong,

492
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,982
Master requests your presence

493
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:37,020
in the Boardroom.

494
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,150
You go ahead.

495
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,782
I'll be right there after I get changed.

496
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,350
The Ghost Valley Sect
has been reaching out

497
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,071
and recruiting different martial sects.

498
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:50,950
Their ambition to dominate
the martial world is clear.

499
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,150
Many unfamiliar martial artists
have been entering the city.

500
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
We've tightened security

501
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,670
at all checkpoints

502
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,260
to prevent their spies from sneaking in.

503
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:01,020
But it's still difficult to control.

504
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:03,350
Young Master Lin, please rest assured.

505
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,300
Hall Master Feng and I will do our best
to assist you.

506
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,350
Master Lin,

507
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,350
the Zhonghe Festival is approaching.

508
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,004
Invitations were sent out

509
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:14,110
to the major sects two months ago.

510
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,190
Many of them
should already be on their way.

511
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,670
It's hard to tell

512
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,300
who's friend or foe.

513
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,630
This makes security even more difficult.

514
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,950
In my opinion,

515
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,150
given the current crisis,

516
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,910
we should cancel

517
00:24:29,115 --> 00:24:30,390
this year's Zhonghe Festival.

518
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,740
The Zhonghe Festival
is a longstanding tradition

519
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,315
celebrated annually in this city.

520
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:35,820
The invitations have already been sent.

521
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,760
If we cancel it now,
it might not be appropriate.

522
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,582
The Red Banner Flower Fair,
in particular,

523
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,670
has always been hosted by Yuchi Manor.

524
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,780
With so many different agendas at play,

525
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,460
it's too risky to go forward with it.

526
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,537
Ghost Valley Sect spreads rumors
that we have a treasure

527
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:49,390
to stir up trouble.

528
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,950
If we cancel the festival now,

529
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,626
it will only make people more suspicious

530
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:54,260
that the treasure is real.

531
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,460
Shukuang,

532
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,260
what do you think?

533
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,110
Everyone has made valid points.

534
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,670
Strengthening security is always
a good idea.

535
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,700
(It would be better to say nothing)

536
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,430
(to give such feedback.)

537
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,190
(It won't cause me any trouble, right?)

538
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,350
Ever since Young Lady Rong was injured,

539
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,590
Young Master Lin

540
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,671
has been handling everything
in the manor alone.

541
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,740
Some things will inevitably
be overlooked.

542
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,220
So, when will Young Lady Rong

543
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,630
fully recover?

544
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,226
I'll do my best to heal
as quickly as possible

545
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,300
and share the burden
of running the manor.

546
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,950
Everything will proceed as usual

547
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,980
according to tradition.

548
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,540
But city defenses

549
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,060
must be strengthened.

550
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,060
Understood.

551
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,670
Shaoci and Wanci,

552
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,590
you'll be in charge

553
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,590
of the Zhonghe Festival.

554
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,910
Shukuang,

555
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,590
you're still injured,

556
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,271
and it's dangerous outside.

557
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,590
So stay in the manor.

558
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,740
Yes, Father.

559
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,540
Father,

560
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,870
the safety of the manor
shouldn't be risked.

561
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:19,737
The various sects
each have their own agendas.

562
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,337
But if we can't cancel it,

563
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,430
we can treat the event
as a mere gathering.

564
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,590
Once we explain the situation,

565
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,590
I'm sure

566
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,715
the sect leaders
would have no complaints.

567
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,430
Right now, everyone in the martial world

568
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:33,980
is going after the key
to the Fuxian treasure

569
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,950
and is unaware
of Shukuang's memory loss.

570
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,060
This gathering concerns

571
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,020
the safety of Shukuang and the treasure.

572
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,260
That time, everyone will expose

573
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,390
their true intentions.

574
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,460
So you must observe carefully.

575
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:52,910
Yes, Father.

576
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,870
When will I ever be worthy

577
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,500
of being called a true swordsman?

578
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,430
Rong.

579
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,460
Rong.

580
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,150
Oh, you're here.

581
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:17,060
Shaoci asked me to bring this for you.

582
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,140
For cooling down the body,
which is perfect for you.

583
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,460
Then why didn't he come himself?

584
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,700
He thought

585
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:24,190
you might not want to see him.

586
00:27:24,693 --> 00:27:27,293
Why wouldn't I be unhappy
when someone brings me food?

587
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:28,626
What kind of excuse is that?

588
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,110
Come with me.

589
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,910
Liu An?

590
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,670
Isn't she your maid?

591
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:44,871
Why are you hiding from her?

592
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,350
Didn't you see what she's carrying?

593
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,980
If you want to recover
and get your martial arts back,

594
00:27:49,982 --> 00:27:51,109
you'll take your medicine.

595
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,590
Don't you know all medicines
have risks or side effects?

596
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,220
Besides,

597
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,980
they can't even agree on how to cure me

598
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,430
or what medicine to use.

599
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:02,240
They always change that.

600
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,693
They're using me as a test subject.

601
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:05,870
Shukuang,

602
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,060
your memory is getting poor these days.

603
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,950
If you want to hide,  it's easy.

604
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,160
There's a secret chamber
in your room, remember?

605
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,110
My room

606
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,780
has a secret chamber?

607
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,020
Where is it?

608
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,260
Rong Shukuang,

609
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,110
you sure have a lot of secrets.

610
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:27,093
People light the candle,
and ghosts blow it out.

611
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,300
Abracadabra.

612
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,430
Don't scare me now.

613
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,670
What is this?

614
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,430
You have a hidden chamber
just for this stuff?

615
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,220
It's time to learn about Rong Shukuang.

616
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,830
Empty?

617
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,870
Everyone says Rong Shukuang

618
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,980
always dresses as a man.

619
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,590
But even the ruthless swordsman
has a soft side, huh?

620
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,740
"Ci?"

621
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,110
Oh, Rong Shukuang.

622
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,590
Does he even know

623
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,780
how much you liked him?

624
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,190
If he cared even a little,

625
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,980
he wouldn't have rejected

626
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:09,630
the proposal in public
and turned you into a laughingstock.

627
00:31:16,952 --> 00:31:19,330
(Dingchou Day, June)

628
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,950
(Is this)

629
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,740
(her memory?)

630
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:12,390
(I didn't expect her
to be so deeply in love.)

631
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,630
(But right now,)

632
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,950
(the only time my heart races)

633
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,190
(is when I'm around Yan Shao.)

634
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,060
(Oh no.)

635
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,350
(I'm such a terrible person.)

636
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,910
Two hearts longing drenched in snow.

637
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:56,390
Consider it to have grown old together.

638
00:33:01,404 --> 00:33:04,126
(Two hearts longing drenched in snow.
Consider it to have grown old together.)

639
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,740
Why am I tearing up?

640
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,910
Why am I suddenly getting sentimental?

641
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,460
This bird

642
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,430
and this poem...

643
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,220
What does it mean?

644
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,700
A hidden chamber

645
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,060
with a vague and confusing clue?

646
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,630
How am I supposed to figure this out?

647
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:14,978
