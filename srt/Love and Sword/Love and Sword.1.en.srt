=Love and Sword=

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 1=

19
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,090
(Yan Shao)

20
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,080
Who dares to enter
Ghost Valley Sect alone?

21
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,910
Are you not afraid of death?

22
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,800
I am.

23
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:43,120
Would you all be willing
to spare me a way out?

24
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,000
A way out?

25
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,750
Which way are you heading out?

26
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,004
To the Soul Reaping Platform
of Ghost Valley Sect.

27
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:49,910
I heard it's gut-wrenching
and heart-piercing,

28
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,240
a torment beyond life and death.

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,404
I'd like to see it for myself.

30
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,604
So, you've come there to rescue someone.

31
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:57,310
Make it through our Three Souls
and Seven Spirits Formation alive,

32
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,240
and then we'll talk.

33
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,826
There's no formation in this world
that I, Yan Shao, cannot break.

34
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:01,648
Form the formation!

35
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,400
Repose Gate!

36
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:16,770
(Repose Gate)

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,840
Break!

38
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:32,870
Wound Gate!

39
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,226
(Wound Gate)
Break!

40
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,310
Shock Gate!

41
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,056
(Shock Gate)

42
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,590
Break!

43
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,400
Sealed Gate!

44
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,582
(Sealed Gate)
Break!

45
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,400
Death Gate!

46
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,848
(Death Gate)
Break!

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:57,960
Life Gate!

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,340
(Life Gate)

49
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,248
The formation is broken.

50
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:21,270
(Yuchi Manor, Rong Shukuang)

51
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,830
(This is...)

52
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,040
(The Great Desert? Flying Apsaras?)

53
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,920
(Bandits?)

54
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,720
(Brutal marauders?)

55
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,720
(What's going on here?)

56
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,830
Rong Shukuang.

57
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,070
I never expected you
to survive until today.

58
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,600
No wonder you're
Yuchi Manor's top swordsman.

59
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,950
(Rong Shukuang?)

60
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,480
(Is that me? My name?)

61
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,480
What a shame.

62
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:08,830
Three days and three nights...

63
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,950
No one from Yuchi Manor
came to rescue you.

64
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,510
Either they fear the Ghost Valley Sect,

65
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,480
or that key is more important than you.

66
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,630
You little wench.

67
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:19,950
You were struck
by our leader's Mystic Ice Jade Palm.

68
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,010
Your martial arts are gone.

69
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,440
Three days without food, left
to wither under the scorching sun...

70
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,671
You won't last much longer.

71
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,270
Who are you?

72
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,950
Why are you trying to kill me?

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,680
Hey, you!

74
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,950
Are you playing dumb?

75
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,270
Or has your brain stopped working?

76
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,120
We are the Four Wandering Masters.

77
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,870
Exactly.

78
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:39,004
(Green-Robed, Yellow-Robed, Red-Robed)
The last people you should ever forget.

79
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,190
But there are only three of you.

80
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,950
The last one is here!

81
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,160
And he died by your blade.

82
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,070
Rong Shukuang!

83
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,000
There is no coexistence between us!

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
Wait... I'm a heroine?

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,560
Like a powerful warrior?

86
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,240
(Then why am I tied up here?)

87
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,920
(No way.)

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,360
(Another one coming to kill me?)

89
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,830
Wait.

90
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,750
There can't be two tigers
on one mountain.

91
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,830
One group

92
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,310
can't have two people in red.

93
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,040
A hero saving a damsel in distress?

94
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,270
Hero.

95
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,560
Come save me!

96
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,120
Are you saving me or trying to kill me?

97
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,550
Is this

98
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,790
poisoning?

99
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,870
Leader.

100
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:34,937
Rong Shukuang was taken
from Soul Reaping Platform.

101
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,750
Is it someone from Yuchi Manor?

102
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,337
Haven't seen anyone from Yuchi Manor.

103
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:39,510
They don't look familiar.

104
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,750
Go.

105
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,600
No matter what, capture them.

106
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,080
Yes!

107
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,440
(Thanks for ruining my idea of happiness)

108
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,390
(on such an important day.)

109
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,750
(There's nothing in this world
that I care about anymore!)

110
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,320
What happened? The rescue failed?

111
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:36,910
(I said I had nothing left,)

112
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,480
(and God just sent me off?)

113
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,550
(My life in the modern world)

114
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,200
(wasn't exactly great,)

115
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,670
(but it wasn't that bad...)

116
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,000
(No...)

117
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,120
(Let me think.)

118
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,390
You don't seem like

119
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,630
you want to be saved.

120
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,790
Yes. I should just die.

121
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,910
Ow!

122
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,150
Your fate was never to die.

123
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,093
You were unconscious
for a whole day and night.

124
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,240
Yet you still survived.

125
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,720
(This isn't a hallucination)

126
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,390
(or a dream.)

127
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,910
(It must be a parallel world.)

128
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,840
(In situations like this,)

129
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,550
(I either find a way back)

130
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,790
(or...)

131
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
(I accept my fate and move forward.)

132
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,960
Another crossroads in life...

133
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,550
What did you say?

134
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,750
Nothing.

135
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,750
May I ask for your esteemed name, hero?

136
00:11:33,515 --> 00:11:35,150
There are always charming young nobles.

137
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,737
A place where young men seek romance.

138
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,360
That sounds like a famous title.

139
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,000
No.

140
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,240
Just a nobody.

141
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,720
Something I made up.

142
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Whether you're famous or not,

143
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,600
I wouldn't know.

144
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,360
My surname is Yan.

145
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,137
I'm known as Yan Shao
in the martial world.

146
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
Master Yan Shao.

147
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,600
You don't have any brothers

148
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,848
who died by my hand, right?

149
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:01,493
No.

150
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,910
Then I don't owe you
any romantic debts either?

151
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,480
No.

152
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:11,080
Then why did you save this woman?

153
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,600
Why did you save me?

154
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:15,493
A good deed for the day.
Just happened to pass by.

155
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,670
So many stars.

156
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,030
Hero, do you have a mirror?

157
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,750
A bronze mirror.

158
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,120
Do I look like someone

159
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,630
who carries a mirror everywhere?

160
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,750
Then let me borrow your sword.

161
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,510
(Grandma's jade...)

162
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
(I remember
when the car accident happened,)

163
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,550
(I was holding)

164
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,870
(the jade my grandmother gave me.)

165
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,750
(Why does his sword)

166
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,480
(also have the exact same jade?)

167
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,270
(Could this jade)

168
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,960
(be the key that connects two worlds?)

169
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
Hero.

170
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,550
Your sword must have a name, right?

171
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,240
Xuelang Sword.

172
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,390
Famous?

173
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,480
Not really.

174
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,790
Who gave it to you?

175
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,240
My master.

176
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,120
A reclusive master.

177
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,870
So, what do you plan to do with it?

178
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,510
Looks pretty good.

179
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,000
Not bad for ancient attire.

180
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,270
Rong Shukuang. Shukuang...

181
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,870
I'm not your enemy.

182
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,150
You don't have to play dumb with me.

183
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,750
Don't tell me you lost your memory.

184
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,240
Well...

185
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,030
What if I said

186
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,480
I really don't remember?

187
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,120
Have you even forgotten your own name?

188
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,240
My mind is...

189
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,720
empty.

190
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,240
The Mystic Ice Jade Palm.

191
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,840
It damages the brain too?

192
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,200
Maybe

193
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,960
you'll remember over time.

194
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,600
Hero.

195
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,550
Speak.

196
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,840
That ice... palm thing you mentioned.

197
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,080
Could it be fatal?

198
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,826
What is Yuchi Manor?

199
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,780
Those three old men
in red, green, and yellow

200
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,471
said they were exchanging me
for some key.

201
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:57,320
What key?

202
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,720
Wait...

203
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,480
What do you mean?

204
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,670
People say

205
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,670
Yuchi Manor's Rong Shukuang

206
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,320
has sword skills and courage
that rival any man's.

207
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,440
But no one ever said

208
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,030
she was shrewd

209
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,320
and calculating.

210
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,720
Besides, Rong Shukuang

211
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,630
is known to be cold and reserved.

212
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,550
Exactly.

213
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,510
This rumor is unreliable,

214
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,080
and gossip isn't worth spreading.

215
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,390
I... I nearly died at death's door.

216
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,390
It's normal for my personality

217
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,240
to change a little.

218
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,510
You're asking too many questions.

219
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:38,550
Pick the one you want to ask the most.

220
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,960
I'll answer it.

221
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,750
Why did you save me?

222
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,240
(Bounty Order)

223
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,030
A bounty order?

224
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
Three hundred gold.

225
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,550
I'm worth that much?

226
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,440
Stop mumbling.

227
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,720
We can't stay here for long.

228
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,550
Let's go.

229
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,910
Wait for me, hero!

230
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,790
We've tracked him from where he

231
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,910
switched camel carts,
changing directions twice,

232
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:25,390
but both times led to nothing.

233
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,440
I swear

234
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,240
I'll break his bones if I catch him.

235
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,600
That guy isn't ordinary.

236
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:31,720
What makes you say that?

237
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,440
He planned everything so well.

238
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:35,200
Not just anyone could pull that off.

239
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,240
I've never heard of Yuchi Manor

240
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,510
having someone like him before.

241
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,480
Could he be connected to Rong Shukuang?

242
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,960
Who cares?

243
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Just catch him first.

244
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,670
Half a day's travel from here,

245
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,200
we'll reach Immortal Spring.

246
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,440
It's an oasis.

247
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Caravans passing by

248
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,120
always stop there to rest.

249
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,320
In this desert,

250
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:03,630
as long as you have money,

251
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,270
you can buy anything.

252
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There's an oasis too?

253
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
This isn't following the usual script.

254
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:18,350
I'm not drinking. I'm allergic.

255
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:20,960
(Wait...)

256
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:23,440
(I'm allergic,
but that doesn't mean Rong Shukuang is.)

257
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,030
(Might as well test it.)

258
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,830
I'll take a sip.

259
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,960
Slow down.

260
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,790
Ancient wine really does

261
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,350
taste better than modern ones.

262
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:37,582
You need to apply medicine
to your wound.

263
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,110
(Yan Wuying)
Yan'er, Yi'er.

264
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,310
Come and have some snacks.

265
00:18:01,334 --> 00:18:02,870
(Fang Yi)

266
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:06,960
Here.

267
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,960
Yi'er.

268
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,270
Eat.

269
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,110
Hey, control yourself.

270
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,790
I know men have certain thoughts.

271
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,110
But if you actually do anything to me,

272
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,240
you won't get your bounty.

273
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,590
(Turns out this hero
is quite the gentleman.)

274
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,960
(Why does that make me feel like...)

275
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,480
(What's wrong with me?)

276
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,350
(Why do I feel so hot?)

277
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,350
I...

278
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,350
Why am I suddenly burning up?

279
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,240
Didn't I get hit
with Mystic Ice Jade Palm?

280
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,920
Why does it feel like I'm on fire?

281
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,960
Is it the heat from the fire?

282
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:05,480
You were struck
by the Mystic Ice Jade Palm.

283
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,550
Medicine and wine

284
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,510
help expel the cold from your body.

285
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,480
You know medicine?

286
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,110
I was weak and sickly as a child.

287
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,000
A kind physician took care of me.

288
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,790
He taught me a lot.

289
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,000
I learned from him.

290
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:25,680
Hero.

291
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,350
So...

292
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,550
How about my martial arts?

293
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,000
Can I get them back?

294
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,000
Maybe.

295
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,750
Who is this Shen Zuitian?

296
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,070
Why did he attack me?

297
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:38,310
He's the leader of Ghost Valley Sect.

298
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,590
A few months ago,

299
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,680
a rumor spread across the martial world.

300
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,350
They said the key to the Fuxian treasure

301
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,590
was hidden in Yuchi Manor.

302
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,537
Ghost Valley Sect
has always coveted the treasure,

303
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:47,871
so they set a trap and captured you,

304
00:19:47,871 --> 00:19:49,680
forcing Yuchi Manor
to trade the key for you.

305
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,350
At the time, Young Master Lin Shaoci

306
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,510
was handling affairs elsewhere.

307
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,000
He was too far away to return in time.

308
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,110
So he issued a bounty
across the martial world,

309
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,000
offering a reward to any skilled fighter

310
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,110
who could rescue you.

311
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,830
A treasure...

312
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,350
at Yuchi Manor?

313
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,480
I have no idea.

314
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,750
What about Lin Shaoci?

315
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
What's my relationship with him?

316
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,750
The Manor Lord

317
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,240
once proposed marriage.

318
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
But he refused.

319
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,270
(So Lin Shaoci
is actually my destined match?)

320
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,720
Why is it suddenly so cold?

321
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,590
I was just burning up.

322
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,440
Now it feels like I'm in an ice cellar.

323
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,750
Let's go.

324
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,590
Wait.

325
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,000
Look over there.

326
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
Don't get the wrong idea.

327
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,440
I'm just too cold.

328
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,510
I need to borrow your warmth for a bit.

329
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,110
So beautiful.

330
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,590
I wish I could take one back.

331
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,830
(This world has treasures,)

332
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,110
(heroes,)

333
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,915
(and most importantly,
it frees me from my modern-day troubles.)

334
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,440
(Why not roam the land with my sword,)

335
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,590
(and live out my martial arts dream?)

336
00:21:25,337 --> 00:21:27,720
Why is the wind picking up?

337
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,550
Yan Shao!

338
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,093
Why is it so windy?

339
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,937
Shut up.

340
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,750
Don't speak.

341
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,590
A sandstorm is coming.

342
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,310
This world isn't so fun after all.

343
00:21:45,893 --> 00:21:46,804
Get off the horse.

344
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,070
Yan Shao, what now?

345
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,440
Get down.

346
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:00,920
Quick.

347
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Don't move.

348
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,480
A sandstorm.

349
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,110
Yan Shao.

350
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,750
Why did you save me?

351
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,750
Because you are Rong Shukuang.

352
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,920
Right now,

353
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,200
we have no food or water, don't we?

354
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,440
There's an oasis ahead.

355
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,880
I don't see anything.

356
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,160
(Are all ancient people farsighted?)

357
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,070
This jade...

358
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,226
I have a feeling
I'll need it sooner or later.

359
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,360
I should find a way
to get my hands on it first.

360
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,550
Thinking of taking my sword again?

361
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,160
Let me see it.

362
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,582
Just a look. What's the big deal?

363
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,510
Up close, you actually look quite manly.

364
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,310
What?

365
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,000
I just meant you look manly.

366
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,440
Do you need to look to tell

367
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,480
whether I'm a man?

368
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,680
Sister, you're so pretty!

369
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,070
Thank you.

370
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,000
Sister, where are you from?

371
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,720
From...

372
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,070
Somewhere you wouldn't know
even if I told you.

373
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,182
The baby turned three months old,
cries every night,

374
00:25:04,182 --> 00:25:05,071
and has a flushed face.

375
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:06,240
Do you have a cure?

376
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,680
Infants shouldn't be given medicine.

377
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,760
I have some herbal cakes
to cool and detoxify.

378
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:13,248
Go play.

379
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,030
Take them home for your mother.

380
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,590
The baby will get better naturally.

381
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,750
You're truly a lifesaver in the desert!

382
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,200
This is the finest hide.

383
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Please accept it.

384
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,480
Thank you, Master Healer!

385
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,440
Master Healer?

386
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:26,240
Thank you.

387
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,650
If she's that skilled in medicine...

388
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:28,240
Master Healer.

389
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,880
Why would she wander the wild,

390
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,240
traveling with merchants?

391
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,590
She must have another identity.

392
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,550
A woman with a story to tell.

393
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,680
True.

394
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,790
The martial world is full of

395
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,310
hidden stories.

396
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,030
And you?

397
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,720
What's your untold story?

398
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,680
Me?

399
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,240
My brain's frozen right now.

400
00:25:56,248 --> 00:25:58,182
Even if I had one, I wouldn't remember.

401
00:25:59,070 --> 00:25:59,720
Tell me,

402
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,030
what business

403
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,160
thrives here?

404
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,590
Chopped meat tastes better.

405
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,720
What is this?

406
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,400
This is called "meat stuffed in bread."

407
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,720
What kind of dish is this?

408
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,182
Did Yuchi Manor teach you this?

409
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,310
Now you see why

410
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,200
I bought all the bread here?

411
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,480
Otherwise, my method

412
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,750
would get stolen.

413
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
What happens to my business then?

414
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,270
Business?

415
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,200
Watch this.

416
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Roujiamo!

417
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,310
Come and try some roujiamo!

418
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,920
A dish you've never seen
or heard of before!

419
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,480
Tender, fragrant,
and filled with meat and bread!

420
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,382
Tasty and convenient!

421
00:26:39,382 --> 00:26:40,030
Give it a try!

422
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:40,640
Never seen it.

423
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,270
Please have one.

424
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,480
That's right.

425
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,440
The meat does smell pretty good.

426
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,920
I'll take one.

427
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,830
Sure, here you go.

428
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,510
How does she like it?

429
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,400
Well?

430
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,350
This is delicious! Let's buy one.

431
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,880
Everyone, come try it!

432
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,790
This young lady's new creation

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,310
is the best in the world!

434
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,350
Come, come!

435
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,550
Come on!

436
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,070
Try it!

437
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,270
Here, take it!

438
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,270
I want one too!

439
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,110
All right.

440
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,070
Here's yours.

441
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,160
Take it.

442
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,240
It really is tasty!

443
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,590
How long did you think of this?

444
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:17,510
I'll have another!

445
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,640
Uh... just now.

446
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,310
Just now?

447
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,830
I... I'll take one.

448
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,880
What's wrong?

449
00:27:26,826 --> 00:27:27,750
What happened to her?

450
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,240
How is she?

451
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,720
Her organs have been damaged
by extreme cold.

452
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,960
The Mystic Ice Jade Palm.

453
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,960
Did she offend

454
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:41,590
the Ghost Valley Sect?

455
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,640
That's right.

456
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,160
It was Shen Zuitian
of Ghost Valley Sect who injured her.

457
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,070
The Mystic Ice Jade Palm
is no minor technique.

458
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,960
How will you counteract it?

459
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,440
A cold-dispelling remedy mixed
with Sangluo wine.

460
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,693
She's already mostly recovered
in the past few days.

461
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:01,550
Please help dispel
the remaining cold energy.

462
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,030
The cold is not severe.

463
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,590
I have a secret remedy for it.

464
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,160
But her fainting...

465
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:09,750
It has nothing to do with the cold.

466
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,070
Then what's the cause?

467
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:16,515
I ask for your guidance, Senior.

468
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,790
This girl is very important to me.

469
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,030
No matter the cost,

470
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,110
I must save her.

471
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,350
The cold energy
has invaded her bloodstream,

472
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,160
temporarily suppressing
the poison she was afflicted with.

473
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,920
You want to save her,

474
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,160
so you're doing everything
to dispel the cold.

475
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
But you don't realize,

476
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,590
the faster the cold is removed,

477
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,480
the faster the poison will take effect.

478
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:45,440
No wonder she shifts
between hot and cold abnormally.

479
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,750
Only by identifying
the poison she was given

480
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,830
can we determine how to neutralize it.

481
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:53,760
There are only one
or two people in the world

482
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,782
who can cure this poison.

483
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,030
And you are one of them.

484
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,550
You're Tang Wu,
most skilled poison master of Tang Clan.

485
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,310
I must say,
your reputation precedes you.

486
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,640
What is your identity?

487
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:15,940
(Tang Wu, Helian Huanwu)

488
00:29:16,007 --> 00:29:17,480
My sect leader's hidden weapon.

489
00:29:17,826 --> 00:29:18,830
Rest assured, Senior.

490
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:20,200
I come as a friend, not a foe.

491
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,110
I only wish to save this girl.

492
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,070
It was for the sake of saving her

493
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,310
that your sect leader
granted me this weapon.

494
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,920
To have connections with the Tang Clan

495
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,070
and to know my whereabouts...

496
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,750
Your scheming runs deep.

497
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,960
I see now who you are.

498
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,750
(If you wish to suppress
the poison in her body,)

499
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,400
(you must activate her meridians.)

500
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,640
(Guide the heat back to its core.)

501
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,160
(Use your inner energy)

502
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,830
(to channel through her Jianyu
and Jianzheng points,)

503
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,680
(Shouwuli and Quchi points,)

504
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,640
(to her Xialian,
Yangxi, and Hegu points.)

505
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,160
(The detoxification energy)

506
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,960
(must flow continuously.)

507
00:30:15,382 --> 00:30:16,960
(However, the poison being drawn out)

508
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,680
(will transfer
to the nearest person beside her.)

509
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,960
(Sacrificing oneself to save another.)

510
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,480
(Thus,)

511
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,000
(this method is known as)

512
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,640
(the Poison Extraction Technique.)

513
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:44,240
How is the poison extract?

514
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
Her breathing is steady now.

515
00:30:47,515 --> 00:30:49,315
Thank you for your guidance, Senior.

516
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,440
You saved her life.

517
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,400
Saving one life

518
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,030
while harming another.

519
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,750
I don't know if it's right or wrong.

520
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,000
But I am willing
to bear this burden for her.

521
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:01,640
I'll take you to the Immortal Spring.

522
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,070
The poison extract technique
is my own creation,

523
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,270
known to very few.

524
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,510
But even so,

525
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,590
the two of you won't last long.

526
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,510
Are you certain you can find out
who poisoned her

527
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,960
and what poison was used?

528
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,640
Even without knowing the outcome,

529
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,960
you've done so much to save her,

530
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,270
risking your own life.

531
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,200
Does she even know?

532
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,510
I just hope she never finds out.
