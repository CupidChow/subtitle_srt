(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 4=

19
00:02:00,271 --> 00:02:01,240
Leave us.

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
What are you up to?

21
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm proposing to marry you.

22
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:13,582
Marry into my family, of course.

23
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,560
Proposing to me?

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,360
(Bonded Contract)
"This is the great hero of the desert..."

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,190
You must sign your real name.

26
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,840
Stop trying to fool me
with flashy names like Yan Shao.

27
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,070
Don't push your luck here.

28
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:32,510
You keep disappearing all the time.

29
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,790
Where am I supposed to find you?

30
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,350
Besides, this is my turf now.

31
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:37,537
Are you signing it or not?

32
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:38,560
Your turf?

33
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,470
You're just an adopted daughter.

34
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,120
If your life here was really that easy,

35
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,880
you wouldn't need me at all.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,470
I don't care if you sign it or not.

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,910
Whether I live or die,

38
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,440
I'll leave it to fate.

39
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,320
Fine, I'll sign it.

40
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,750
Something is off about you.

41
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,840
What is?

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,910
I may be the one who hired you.

43
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,720
But you're surprisingly cooperative.

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,510
Did you come to the manor
with an ulterior motive?

45
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,470
Are you after the treasure map key?

46
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,280
No.

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,126
So, are you trying
to learn martial arts secrets?

48
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,560
(Bonded Person: Yan Shao)
Not interested.

49
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,320
(Bonded Contract)
One of the conditions says

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,160
you only take orders from Rong Shukuang.

51
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:31,626
It doesn't seem like
the behavior of a gentleman.

52
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:33,190
I was never a gentleman.

53
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,630
I am a lady.

54
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,070
Give it back to me.

55
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,840
Hey! You're cheating!

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Give it back!

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,280
(What just happened to me?)

58
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,160
(You probably passed out)

59
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,226
(from the cold poison.)

60
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,910
(Yan Shao saved you.)

61
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
I work for Rong Shukuang,

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,510
not Yuchi Manor.

63
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,110
But since you've signed,

64
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:23,430
there's no backing out now.

65
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,720
From now on, you'll have to stay close

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
and protect me at all times.

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,200
You can't be more
than 10 meters away from me.

68
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,910
Not more than 10 meters?

69
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,160
Even at night?

70
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,790
Your room

71
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,910
isn't even that big.

72
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,110
Here's your payment.

73
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,200
Consider it a thank-you
for helping me back in the desert.

74
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,910
From now on,

75
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,520
just follow me

76
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,310
and I'll treat you well.

77
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,550
Come with me.

78
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,115
Father wants to treat you to a meal.

79
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,160
Yan Shao, you rescued Shukuang
from Ghost Valley Sect

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,080
and escorted her all the way here.

81
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,230
We, at the Yuchi Manor
are truly grateful.

82
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:23,550
Master Lin, you're too kind.

83
00:05:27,426 --> 00:05:29,040
I made a deal with Young Lady Rong.

84
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,200
She pays me,

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,350
and I work as her bodyguard.

86
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
It's just a job.

87
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,430
Saving someone
from Ghost Valley Sect

88
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,026
and making it through the desert alone

89
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,720
takes real skill and courage.

90
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,400
You're clearly not an ordinary fighter.

91
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,160
May I ask which school
or sect you trained under, Yan Shao?

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
My master has passed away.

93
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,600
She was a recluse

94
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:52,960
who wished to remain unknown.

95
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,670
As for me,

96
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:56,150
I rarely travel in the martial world.

97
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,280
So I'm just a nobody.

98
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:00,026
Now that you're here at Yuchi Manor,

99
00:06:00,048 --> 00:06:01,110
you're one of us.

100
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,280
With enemies closing in,

101
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,520
we need all the help we can get.

102
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,910
You're welcome here.

103
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,280
Cheers.

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,110
Yan Shao, have you
and Shukuang met before?

105
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,110
Let me go!

106
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,110
No, we've never met.

107
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,040
My sister has always been
proud and independent.

108
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,520
It's surprising

109
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,604
she's letting
a complete stranger stay by her side

110
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:46,790
as a personal guard.

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,910
When you've fought side by side
with someone

112
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,280
(and see what they're willing
to do for you,)

113
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,160
(you learn to trust them.)

114
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:05,040
(The ones who would risk
their lives for you)

115
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,760
are the ones worth believing in.

116
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,597
(Yan Shao said
I used to be cold, distant,)

117
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:19,550
(and commanding.)

118
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,910
(Everyone in the manor feared me.)

119
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,040
(Now the manor's top swordsman's)

120
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,670
(acting skills are being tested.)

121
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,960
I barely escaped with my life this time.

122
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
It made me realize a lot of things.

123
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,200
The old Rong Shukuang was too reserved,

124
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,470
always holding back.

125
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,470
But from now on,

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,760
I want to live freely.

127
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,550
I'll say what I want

128
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,200
and do what I want.

129
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,870
Father, Shaoci,

130
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,110
and Wanci.

131
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm truly happy to be alive and reunited

132
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,870
with you all.

133
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,640
So forget the old Rong Shukuang

134
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,470
because I'm starting over.

135
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,550
From now on,
let's live as a real family.

136
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,080
A toast to everyone.

137
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:06,960
All right.

138
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,430
Good.

139
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:11,990
Yan Shao,

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,670
I want to toast to you as well.

141
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,160
Thank you for saving my life.

142
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,640
Stay by my side after this,

143
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,280
and I will treat you well.

144
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,430
Yan Shao,

145
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,960
I'll toast to you too.

146
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,470
For Shukuang.

147
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,670
Cheers.

148
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,280
Shukuang was injured by Shen Zuitian's
Mystic Ice Jade Palm

149
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,648
and lost her martial arts abilities.

150
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:40,310
She does need someone to protect her.

151
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,430
But don't worry.

152
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,160
Shaoci has arranged for Yingluo and me

153
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,240
to find a cure for you.

154
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,880
Actually, Young Lady Rong's cold poison

155
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,640
has improved significantly.

156
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,950
That's right.

157
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,880
Yan Shao is also skilled in medicine.

158
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,430
Thanks to his treatment,

159
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,240
I indeed feel much better.

160
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,310
But to fully regain your martial arts,

161
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,950
the cold poison
must be completely cured.

162
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,360
(Once the cold poison is removed,)

163
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:03,520
(that unknown poison
in her body will activate.)

164
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,000
We can't rush this.

165
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,537
It might be too much
for Young Lady Rong to handle.

166
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
I can take it.

167
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,160
As long as I can recover
my martial arts,

168
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm willing to try anything.

169
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,880
But I trust Yan Shao's
medical skills the most.

170
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,040
I'd rather have him treat me.

171
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,640
Then we'll leave
the cold poison treatment

172
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,120
to Yan Shao.

173
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,950
All right.

174
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,640
Please eat.

175
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,830
Wanci, what's wrong?

176
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,950
I feel a little dizzy.

177
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,400
It's from a few sips of wine.

178
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,520
Then you...

179
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,640
Shukuang...

180
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,640
Thank you, Yan Shao.

181
00:10:00,737 --> 00:10:01,400
You're welcome.

182
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,480
Come, get up.

183
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,760
Here.

184
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,626
- Are you all right?
- What happened?

185
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,190
Thank you, Father.

186
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,040
Here's some sobering tea.

187
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,950
Ladies, have a sip.

188
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,280
Shukuang, drink some as well.

189
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,430
You'll feel better soon.

190
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,310
Thank you, Wanci.

191
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,226
(I haven't had a chance
to draw the poison these past two days.)

192
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,760
(If it acts up at any time,
she'll be in danger.)

193
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,590
(I need to do it as soon as possible.)

194
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,550
You... You creep!

195
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,430
No, I'm not.

196
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,604
What do you mean you're not?

197
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:57,670
You look decent.

198
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,839
But you're actually disgusting!

199
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,910
- In the desert,
- I didn't.

200
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,240
did you do the same thing to me?

201
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,280
Now I know why I wake up
every day with back pain!

202
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,480
You're a beast!

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,648
Somebody! He's assaulting me!

204
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:06,540
Stop talking nonsense!

205
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,310
Scream. Go on, scream.

206
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,190
Why aren't you screaming?

207
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,790
I swear I never touch you.

208
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,710
I was only treating your injuries

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,160
to prevent the cold
from damaging your meridians.

210
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,000
If you believe me,

211
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,240
blink.

212
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,830
I only say a few words.

213
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,190
He didn't have to react that way.

214
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,480
Wait, I was the one
being taken advantage of.

215
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,000
Why is he the one running away?

216
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,310
Even if I falsely accused you,

217
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,910
you don't have to drown yourself

218
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,120
to prove your innocence!

219
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,310
I'm afraid you're probably the only one
who could drown in a tub like this.

220
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,790
It's hot?

221
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,520
So you treated my injuries
for free just now.

222
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,120
Then dip in here
to recover your strength?

223
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:15,240
I enjoy experimenting
with rare and unusual poisons.

224
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,190
Saving you was just a coincidence.

225
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,670
Oh?

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,280
Do you have a lover?

227
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,382
That's not a question
a lady should be asking.

228
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,710
Hero,

229
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,160
don't tell me...

230
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,550
(You're overwhelmed with desire)

231
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:39,960
(but trying so hard to resist me.)

232
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,400
(But at the same time,
you're so pure and innocent)

233
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,520
(that you don't know what to do.)

234
00:13:44,848 --> 00:13:47,070
(So you jumped into this tub
to cool yourself down.)

235
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,400
(What a disciplined hero.)

236
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,430
Hero,

237
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,240
why don't you just marry into my family?

238
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,910
Nonsense.

239
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,550
I don't care what your background is.

240
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,160
If we get married,

241
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,240
it'd be a social upgrade for you.

242
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,910
Am I right?

243
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,982
Don't joke about something
as serious as marriage.

244
00:14:06,982 --> 00:14:08,219
I'm from the martial world.

245
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,420
I don't care about these things.

246
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:10,070
And besides,

247
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,760
if it doesn't work out,
we can just divorce.

248
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:13,950
Marriage isn't something
to be taken lightly.

249
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,040

Tell me where it is.

254
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:44,382

She's poisoned.

300
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,640
Open the door.

301
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,559
Arisaema, Pinellia Tuber,
sweet wormwood, tangerine leaf,

302

What?

305
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:53,950
This is the only way to save her.

306
00:16:54,026 --> 00:16:55,880
No one from Yuchi Manor
would ever poison her.

307
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,220
Not all poisonings are intentional.

308
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,709
When some things are eaten by someone,
it can cause severe reactions.

309
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,315
So it's common.

310
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:01,871
You're her personal bodyguard.

311
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,160
This is your responsibility.

312
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,070
If we delay any longer,

313
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,070
she won't make it.

314
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,280
If I wanted to harm her,

315
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,870
why would I bring her here?

316
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:11,310
I'll make the preparations now.

317
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:13,439
Prepare the medicine
and personally bring it to her.

318
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,920
I don't trust anyone in Yuchi Manor

319
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,870
except you.

320
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,040
Once we find out who poisoned you,

321
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:28,630
I'll take you away from here.

322
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,310
Don't worry. I'm here.

323
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,280
I'll make sure you get
to live the life you want.

324
00:17:44,782 --> 00:17:46,937
I'm afraid calling for a physician
will take too long.

325
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,137
I've summoned Yingluo instead.

326
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,070
Her pulse is so erratic.

327
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,390
It's more than just cold poison.

328
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,290
Revival Acupuncture
technique from your family

329
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:58,871
can save her.

330
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,440
The Revival Acupuncture?

331
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,220
I've only seen
my eldest sister use it before.

332
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,550
She did teach me the technique.

333
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,280
But I've never used it to save anyone.

334
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,671
Right now, we have no other choice.

335
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,440
Listen.

336
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:09,720
As Thirteen Lady,
your title is not just a hearsay.

337
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
You can do this.

338
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,520
I really can't do it.

339
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,310
If you don't try,

340
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,870
she will die.

341
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,240
But in a situation like this,

342
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,026
only my eldest sister can administer it.

343
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:20,150
I can't do it, Yan Shao.

344
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,870
She can't hold on much longer.

You're the only one
who can save Shukuang now.

346
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,790
Do you want to watch her die?

347
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,790
Talent is a gift from the heavens.

348
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,870
If your sister can do it,

349
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,390
you can too.

357
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
passed down by the ancestors.

358
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,182
That's something my grandmother left me.

359
00:19:47,182 --> 00:19:48,300
Why are you giving it to her?

360
00:19:48,315 --> 00:19:49,630

It worked! Sister Rong is back!

364
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,480

Brother Shaoci, look!

366
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,790
I saved Sister Rong!

367
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,760
(I'm still here?)

368
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,480
Here, drink this medicine first.

369
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,790
What is it now?

370
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,226
It's medicine for your condition.

371
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,680
Did you prescribe this?

372
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,440
I made it myself.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,310
Then it should be fine.

374
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,040
(But this is clearly
a severe allergic reaction.)

375
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,630
(Rong Shukuang,)

376
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,630
(what exactly are you allergic to?)

377
00:20:51,293 --> 00:20:52,440
Get some rest early.

378
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,070
Yan Shao.

379
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:57,582
Young Master Lin,
do you have further instructions?

380
00:20:57,582 --> 00:20:59,204
Why are your clothes completely soaked?

381
00:20:59,204 --> 00:21:00,310
Aren't you going to explain?

382
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,150
Oh, this?

383
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,150
It was raining outside.

384
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,280
Didn't you notice?

385
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,920
The rain was really heavy.

386
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,240
Sister Rong, do you feel any discomfort?

387
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,960
I'm fine now.

388
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,720
I will find out

389
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,790
who poisoned you.

390
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,680
It wasn't poison.

391
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,200
It was an allergic reaction.

392
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,790
Have I ever had allergies before?

393
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,960
What did you say?

394
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,760
I asked

395
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,870
if I ever had any reactions
to certain things.

396
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,630
Like itching, difficulty breathing,
or anything like that?

397
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,550
When you were little,

398
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,604
I remember you only
had a reaction to Arnebia root.

399
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:34,920
If you touched it,

400
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,448
your arms would get red and itchy.

401
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,960
Could there have been Arnebia root
in the manor?

402
00:21:41,537 --> 00:21:43,240
Wanci has been preparing Baihua Brew

403
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,160
for the upcoming festival

404
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,004
and collecting all sorts
of herbs and flowers.

405
00:21:47,004 --> 00:21:48,550
Maybe some Arnebia root

406
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,390
accidentally got mixed in.

407
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,760
Wanci?

408
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,960
She's already back home,

409
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,480
and yet trouble still follows.

410
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,390
Every one of you

411
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,920
has a part in this mess!

412
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,240
The Zhonghe Festival is coming soon.

413
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,790
I was making Baihua Brew.

414
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:12,390
So I collected some Arnebia root.

415
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,920
It's possible that a new servant

416
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,040
mistakenly mixed it

417
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,000
into Shukuang's food.

418
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,680
That's how this happened.

419
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,760
You are Young Lady's personal maid.

420
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,680
How could you not check properly?

421
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,000
It was my mistake.

422
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,920
There are too many people
in the manor now.

423
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,200
Be more careful next time.

424
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:33,590
Yes, Young Master.

425
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,550
What is it?

426
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:50,760
When I treated Sister Rong
with acupuncture last night,

427
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
I discovered

428
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,040
a hidden poison in her body,

429
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,150
which is hard to detect.

430
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,000
It causes her temperature
to fluctuate wildly.

431
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,630
One moment, she's freezing,

432
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,520
and the next, she's burning in flames.

433
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,550
Do you recognize this poison?

434
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,310
Is there a way to cure it?

435
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,520
So you knew Sister Rong

436
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,070
was poisoned?

437
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,310
Is this related to you?

438
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,630
I only noticed that her symptoms

439
00:23:21,715 --> 00:23:23,200
didn't match just the cold poison.

440
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,790
How long have you known about this?

441
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,310
I don't recognize the poison.

442
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:36,040
But the fact that she's held on
for so long

443
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,093
without succumbing to it,

444
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,390
it must be because of you.

445
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,240
Miss Tang, I trust you.

446
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
I hope we can help her through this.

447
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:44,350
The Tang Family's belief taught

448
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,390
that even an enemy
should be saved first.

449
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,350
So, do you think this poison

450
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,782
has been inside her for a long time?

451
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,680
It's possible.

452
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,200
Then who has been in charge

453
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,626
of her daily meals and medicine?

454
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
Wanci.

455
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,960
She manages everything in the manor,

456
00:23:57,982 --> 00:23:59,480
including minor medical treatments

457
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,830
when needed.

458
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,720
Are you suspecting Wanci?

459
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,830
Miss Wanci

460
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,630
is certainly elegant and intelligent.

461
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:14,960
Young Lady Lin.

462
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,590
Yan Shao, did you come looking for me?

463
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:19,520
Just a coincidence.

464
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,310
Young Lady Lin, are you feeling unwell?

465
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,630
It's an old illness.
Come in and talk.

466
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,350
All right.

467
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,000
Please have some tea.

468
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,590
Thank you.

469
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,680
You must have a reason

470
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,550
to come and see me, right?

471
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,515
Young Lady Lin,
not only are you beautiful,

472
00:24:39,515 --> 00:24:40,830
but you're also remarkably sharp.

473
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,000
As Young Lady Rong's personal bodyguard,

474
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,920
I need to understand her daily routine

475
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,150
so I can do my job properly.

476
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,920
Are you always this attentive
toward young ladies?

477
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,630
I've heard you're skilled in medicine.

478
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,350
Of course,
you'd take great care of my sister.

479
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,200
How is she now?

480
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
She still hasn't recovered
from Mystic Ice Jade Palm

481
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,004
and now Arnebia root
has made things worse.

482
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,293
It's becoming a real problem.

483
00:25:07,293 --> 00:25:08,240
I heard the manor keeps

484
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,390
a record of daily meals and routines.

485
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,870
May I take a look?

486
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,520
I'll have someone deliver

487
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,550
the Household Record to you shortly.

488
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,040
Thank you, Young Lady Lin.

489
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,110
Back to visiting Lin Wanci again?

490
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,790
You must have
some unspeakable secret with her.

491
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,830
(What are you reading secretly
at this hour?)

492
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,680
(Could it be a love note?)

493
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,830
Why do you like doing

494
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,630
suspicious things at night?

495
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,720
I wasn't the one spying at midnight

496
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,150
or breaking into someone's room.

497
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,630
If you're up to something,
at least try to be discreet.

498
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,680
What did I do?

499
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,000
Look at you

500
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,760
making that strange expression.

501
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,550
Hand it over!

502
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,720
You have no shame, do you?

503
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,920
It's just men's stuff.

504
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,870
Everyone knows about it.

505
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,280
The Household Record?

506
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,680
This is about me?

507
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,110
Are you a stalker?

508
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,150
I am not.

509
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,070
Oh really?

510
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,289
Then why are you reading this?

511
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,382
As your bodyguard,

512
00:26:54,382 --> 00:26:56,440
I need to know
what kind of enemies you've had before.

513
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,693
(To Yan Shao. Please go through.
From Wanci.)

514
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,830
You and Lin Wanci taking
a romantic sunset stroll,

515
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,150
gazing at each other,

516
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,790
chatting, and laughing.

517
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,110
Was that part of your duties too?

518
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,480
Throwing in all those fancy words
doesn't mean you're right.

519
00:27:09,604 --> 00:27:10,720
Why were you following me?

520
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,240
So I was right after all.

521
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,150
Fine.

522
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,350
Then

523
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,550
how do you explain always being alone

524
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,550
with Lin Shaoci?

525
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,280
The 15th day of July.

526
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,630
Lin Shaoci got injured.

527
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,680
Rong Shukuang brought him back
to the manor.

528
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,550
That was the perfect chance
to save a damsel in distress moment.

529
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,280
Why didn't you take advantage of it?

530
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,110
What did you say?

531
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,630
I said if I had grabbed that opportunity

532
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,280
and become the Young Madam
of the manor,

533
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,404
I wouldn't be wasting
my time arguing with you now.

534
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:40,960
You really have no shame.

535
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,390
So what if I don't?

536
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,693
You're the one
who doesn't behave decently.

537
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,350
You and Lin Wanci
are behaving all lovey-dovey.

538
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,000
I bet you're waiting for the right moment
to swoop in and win her over!

539
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,426
No!

540
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:52,520
I should tell Lin Shaoci
all about your little schemes.

541
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,390
Stop making things up.

542
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,830
I, Yan Shao,

543
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:57,390
am upright and have nothing to hide.

544
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,515
Do I need to scheme
to win over Young Lady Lin?

545
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,520
You shameless scoundrel!

546
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Scoundrel?

547
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,550
You're the one trying...

548
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,520
You want to go after Young Lady Lin!

549
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,920
- At least I'm not after Young Lady Rong!
- You scoundrel!

550
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,040
(Why does this sound like
we're arguing like...)

551
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,110
Why are you here this late?

552
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,390
I want to ask about my allergic reaction
the other day.

553
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,760
Allergy?

554
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,590
The reaction from the poison.

555
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:37,630
I've thought about it.

556
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,150
Liu An is the one who prepares my meals.

557
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,630
Thank you.

558
00:28:47,004 --> 00:28:48,630
But how could she have made a mistake?

559
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,110
Are you saying Liu An is behind it?

560
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,350
Could it be
because I mistreated her before?

561
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,200
That's something only Liu An can answer.

562
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,000
How should we ask her?

563
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,110
Help me.

564
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,390
Add another blanket for me.

565
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,550
The cold poison acts up at night,

566
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,720
and I keep feeling cold.

567
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,830
Bring more candles too.

568
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,280
This room needs to be brighter.

569
00:29:35,582 --> 00:29:36,520
Yes, Young Lady.

570
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,760
Anything else, Young Lady?

571
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,040
Tomorrow, I want an eggplant dish.

572
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,870
What kind of strange dish is that?

573
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,760
Diced chicken breast

574
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,040
with shiitake mushrooms,
bamboo shoots, tofu,

575
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,830
and a mix of dried fruits.

576
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,280
Since when did you learn to cook?

577
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,760
I read about it in a book.

578
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,920
Since when did you enjoy reading?

579
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,590
Since when did you learn
to be so rude to me?

580
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,960
It's late. You should rest.

581
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:48,720
The wine has been warmed.

582
00:30:49,337 --> 00:30:50,550
Send it to Young Lady Rong.

583
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,240
She's already asleep.

584
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,204
With the cold poison,
she won't be sleeping well.

585
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,110
Wake her up.

586
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,070
There are two pots.

587
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,240
Drink this one first,

588
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,390
then the other.

589
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,760
Arnebia root?

590
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:12,830
Liu An,

591
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,248

to harm Young Lady Rong?
