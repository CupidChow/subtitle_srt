17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 19=

19
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,720
I risked my life to save you.

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,490
Do you still refuse to trust me?

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,410
Right now, it's just the two of us here.

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,404
Young Lady Lin.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,050
If you want me to believe you,

24
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,650
then you should tell the truth.

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,930
I was captured by Shen Zuitian.

26
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,530
I've been trying to deal
with him ever since.

27
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,760
I would never harm Yuchi Manor.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,530
Nor have I ever intended to hurt anyone.

29
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,370
No matter what,

30
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,010
thank you for saving me.

31
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,480
Then...

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,570
Do you still think I'm a bad person?

33
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,130
Do you still trust me?

34
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,880
If you want to be a good person,

35
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:39,130
it shouldn't matter
whether I believe you.

36
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,570
A good person is simply a good person.

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,920
Yan Shao.

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,160
I know.

39
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,600
No matter what I do,

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,040
you'll never believe me.

41
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,570
But I have no regrets.

42
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,530
If I had to choose again,

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,850
I would still make the same decision.

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,440
Because this way,

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,290
I will still matter to you,
even just a little.

46
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,671
Now, there's only you and me left here.

47
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,570
You won't leave me behind.

48
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,250
Yan Shao...

49
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,640
Brother Shaoci.

50
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,360
We've been walking through this passage

51
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,848
for a long time, haven't we?

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,382
I don't know either.

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,737
Where are Sister Rong and Feng?

54
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,320
We're here.

55
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,690
We're right here.

56
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,090
It's so dark and cold here.

57
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,760
If we can't find the exit,

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,848
what should we do?

59
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,248
There's a draft over there.

60
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,480
Let's head that way.

61
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,570
Okay.

62
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,250
There's light!

63
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,810
Quick, keep up!

64
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,480
Feng.

65
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,640
What is this place?

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,690
The body is suffering,

67
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,930
and I am burdened with sin.

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,880
Fleeting is life.

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,320
Only in nirvana is there peace.

70
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,200
All things are impermanent.

71
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,400
All laws are without self.

72
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,930
Silence is nothingness.

73
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,730
Detach from all desires.

74
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,490
Who exactly are you?

75
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,440
Hey.

76
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,010
Jin Buyao sent us here.

77
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,250
That means you must be one of us.

78
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,693
Which way do we go?

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,520
Please, show us a way out.

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,080
I want

81
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,050
the most valuable thing in your life.

82
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,280
Heroes treasure these things

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
more than their lives.

84
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,440
Yet in the end, they all end up with me.

85
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,050
Do you want to trade
your treasures for your life?

86
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,400
The choice is yours.

87
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,010
You...

88
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,360
Why do you take from both
the living and the dead?

89
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,810
This is a longevity lock
my mother made for me.

90
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,560
I'll trade it for my life.

91
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,250
She wouldn't blame me.

92
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,690
Fool, your mother gave you that lock

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,871
because she wished for you
to live a long life.

94
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,840
Fine. I'll take it.

95
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,170
This hairpin was given
to me by someone most dear.

96
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,080
I've carried it with me always.

97
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,810
Seems like it's indeed a treasure.

98
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,170
But while the receiver values it,

99
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,960
the giver may not
have had the same intent.

100
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,810
Leave it.

101
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,826
The heirloom sword
of Yuchi Manor's Young Master.

102
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,730
That must be an important item.

103
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,370
Of course.

104
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:46,071
The Cloud-Slicing Sword.

105
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
You're not being honest.

106
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,560
That's the sword of Yuchi Manor's
top swordsman.

107
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,490
Isn't that important?

108
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,004
To others, maybe.

109
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,080
But to her,

110
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,010
not necessarily.

111
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,610
Even when people
are at their last breath,

112
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,730
they still won't let go.

113
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,570
It must truly be

114
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,640
more precious than life itself.

115
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,400
Enough.

116
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,840
If you are not her,

117
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,582
then we have nothing left between us.

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,280
After you reach
at Mount Moye, take care.

119
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,582
We part ways here,
and never to meet again.

120
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
It's just a broken whistle.

121
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,250
Turns out it's a bone whistle.

122
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,130
What?

123
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,610
Was it a gift from someone dear?

124
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Get us a carriage.

125
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,960
The most important thing
to you isn't with you anymore.

126
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,570
You've already lost it.

127
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,520
Take back your things.

128
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,840
I'll go get you a carriage.

129
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,320
Your travel expenses
have already been paid.

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,080
Thank you.

131
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:32,515
Yan Shao left this medicine for you.

132
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,730
Where is he?

133
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,893
Why didn't he give it to me himself?

134
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,850
Don't push your luck.

135
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,330
Risking your life for a mere ruse,

136
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,760
was it worth it?

137
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,520
Even if I die here in Ruthless Parlor,

138
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:48,737
no one in this world
would grieve for me.

139
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,210
Too many lives have already
been lost in Ruthless Parlor.

140
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,337
There doesn't need to be one more.

141
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,248
You still have a family.

142
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,010
Family?

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,330
Rong Shukuang is
the real Young Lady of Yuchi Manor.

144
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,010
What am I, then?

145
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,210
As long as I exist in this world,

146
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,271
whenever the name
Rong Shukuang is mentioned,

147
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,040
I am the one who gets abandoned.

148
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,280
Why do you hate her so much?

149
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,920
Since I was a child,

150
00:09:25,182 --> 00:09:26,182
I always wished

151
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:27,960
I could be like Rong Shukuang,

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,893
living freely in the martial world.

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,160
But I never had the chance.

154
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,850
All I could do was watch

155
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,160
as she took everything
that should have been mine.

156
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,560
From the moment we met,

157
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,920
you've always suspected me
of plotting against her.

158
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,490
Haven't you?

159
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,280
Yes.

160
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,560
Yan Shao.

161
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,250
I was even willing

162
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,250
to risk my life for you.

163
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,250
Do you really feel nothing for me?

164
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:02,970
Fine.

165
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:04,970
I understand now.

166
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
If you hate me so much,
why not just let me die?

167
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,090
Dying is the easiest thing
in this world.

168
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,280
Living is much harder.

169
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,280
Even now,

170
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,850
you still believe I colluded
with Ghost Valley Sect

171
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,010
and betrayed Yuchi Manor, don't you?

172
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,610
I believe you were using Shen Zuitian

173
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,604
and Ghost Valley Sect

174
00:10:29,782 --> 00:10:31,130
to defeat the Five Great Sects,

175
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,515
and then claim the treasure.

176
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,537
To make Yuchi Manor
the ruler of the martial world.

177
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,490
In my father and Shaoci's eyes,

178
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
I have always been nothing
but a useless invalid.

179
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,520
That's why I wanted to prove myself.

180
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:48,248
I wanted to show them I could make
a name for myself in the martial world.

181
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,680
But no matter what you do,

182
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,920
you shouldn't treat human lives
as if they're worthless.

183
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,800
Lin Wanci.

184
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,210
You need to repent.

185
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,640
And how exactly do I do that?

186
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,210
What about this?

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,400
But you'll be disappointed.

188
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,520
Rong Shukuang's Crimson Lotus Heart

189
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:14,271
has already been neutralized.

190
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,560
Yan Shao.

191
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,550
Should I prepare some ice water for you?

192
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:32,337
No need.

193
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,048
Blood converges,
and the red lotus blooms.

194
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,280
Ice water won't help anymore.

195
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,680
That Ghost Mask...

196
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,250
He agreed so easily

197
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,760
to prepare a carriage for us.

198
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,160
I wonder how Yan Shao and Wanci

199
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,010
are doing now.

200
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,848
Wanci was injured because of Yan Shao.

201
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,182
He definitely
wouldn't just leave her be.

202
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,250
He

203
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,760
always has his ways.

204
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,400
He'll take care of Wanci.

205
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,210
Sister Rong.

206
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,280
If you're upset, just say it.

207
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,680
Don't keep it bottled up.

208
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,680
I've let go.

209
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,271
The eagle-bone whistle
was from Yan Shao.

210
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,550
You were willing to give up
Cloud-Slicing Sword,

211
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:28,160
but you couldn't part with that whistle.

212
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,010
And you call that letting go?

213
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,450
What if I let go now?

214
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,610
What if I don't?

215
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,920
If, back then,

216
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,137
I had died in the desert,

217
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:43,880
and he never came to save me,

218
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,204
then there wouldn't be
this sorrow today.

219
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,880
Yan Shao sacrificed a lot
just to save you.

220
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:54,250
What did you say?

221
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,090
I just don't want you to live in pain.

222
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,010
No matter what,

223
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,330
I will always take care of you.

224
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,010
Gu Long once said,

225
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,090
there are two purposes in life.

226
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,130
One is to burn.

227
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,920
The other is to watch others burn.

228
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,004
Which one will you choose?

229
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,450
I will burn.

230
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,760
So you won't have to.

231
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,490
No one can protect another forever.

232
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,130
I will protect myself.

233
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,560
Everyone, as boundless
as mountains and rivers.

234
00:13:42,893 --> 00:13:44,271
Take care on your journey.

235
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,330
Let's go.

236
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:55,970
Get in the carriage.

237
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,071
Where is Jiang Ruhai?

238
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,640
He's always the first one to run.

239
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,850
No wonder Hua Qi said...

240
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,760
One day,

241
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,920
I will have

242
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,130
my revenge.

243
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,210
Everything that belongs
to the Shen family,

244
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,800
I will take it back!

245
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,880
Stop.

246
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,640
Your eldest sister thinks
you've been out for too long,

247
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,730
causing trouble.

248
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,210
She sent me to bring you home.

249
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,130
Jiang Ruhai.

250
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,640
You barely escaped Ruthless Parlor,

251
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,737
and now you've come
to wreak havoc on Tang Clan?

252
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,071
The First Young Lady of Tang Clan

253
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:29,382
merely followed my advice.

254
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:30,848
She is making a strategic decision.

255
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,640
This Young Lady Rong
must return to Tang Clan as well.

256
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,130
Take her.

257
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,330
Stop!

258
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,730
Is Head Tang
really going to aid evildoers

259
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,400
and betray the Six Great Sects?

260
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,210
I have my reasons for what I do.

261
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,040
Chanyi, what are you thinking?

262
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,490
Shut up.

263
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,730
Jiang Ruhai cannot tell right
from wrong and harms the innocent.

264
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,160
Are you really going
to continue trusting him blindly?

265
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:25,920
Nonsense.

266
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,210
Chanyi, everything I've done
has been for you.

267
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,370
Trust me.

268
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,610
Right or wrong,

269
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,970
Jiang Ruhai is my man.

270
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,680
If any of you dares to harm him,

271
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,640
I will make sure you all die with him.

272
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,130
Yingluo. If you refuse
to come back with me,

273
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:47,182
then you are no longer
a member of Tang Clan.

274
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,960
Chanyi, you've been blinded.

275
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:50,960
You can't even tell right
from wrong anymore.

276
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,090
Head Tang, let me
give you a word of advice.

277
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,640
As long as

278
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,560
he has legs to walk with,

279
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,330
he will keep stirring up trouble.

280
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,170
Unless you break
his legs and lock him up,

281
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,120
otherwise

282
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,840
he will never be truly devoted to you.

283
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,450
Let's go.

284
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,520
It wasn't supposed to happen this fast.

285
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,970
But because you used
my Revival Acupuncture,

286
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,930
your blood circulation sped up.

287
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,520
This...

288
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,080
Won't last much longer.

289
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,250
I know.

290
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,650
I've sealed several of your acupoints.

291
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,450
Don't force yourself anymore.

292
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,120
This way, you'll be able
to hold on for a while longer.

293
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,120
Thank you.

294
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,160
What are your plans from here, Senior?

295
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,490
Now that Jin Buyao is dead,

296
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,120
someone has to stay here.

297
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,248
Someone to take care
of those who need it.

298
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,040
I'll stay here,
and live or die with them.

299
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,800
The people of Yuchi Manor
are on their way here.

300
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,730
I came to bid you farewell, Senior.

301
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,080
Take care.

302
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:52,800
Take care.

303
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,800
I want you

304
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,930
to live well.

305
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,730
I understand.

306
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,360
Take care, Senior.

307
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,210
Yan Shao.

308
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:21,730
Yan Shao!

309
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,520
Young Lady Lin!

310
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,210
Yan Shao!

311
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,560
Yan Shao, you can't leave!

312
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,520
Yan Shao!

313
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,490
- Yan Shao!
- Young Lady Lin!

314
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,320
Young Lady Lin!

315
00:19:29,426 --> 00:19:31,537
He promised me
he wouldn't leave me again.

316
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,490
He can't go!

317
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:33,960
- Yan Shao!
- Young Lady Lin!

318
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:36,170
A man's words in the martial world

319
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,690
are like the desert winds.

320
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,080
They come and go as they please.

321
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,280
They never hold weight.

322
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,840
When someone leaves,

323
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,210
it's like the wind passing by.

324
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,120
Not a single trace remains.

325
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,560
You're still injured.

326
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:48,515
You need to rest and recover.

327
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,690
Rushing like this,
do you have a death wish?

328
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,489
If you keep this up,

329
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,320
you might not make it
back to Mount Moye alive!

330
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,210
I must get back
to Mount Moye before they do.

331
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,760
(One day,)

332
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,760
(I will make you realize)

333
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,120
(that going against me)

334
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,930
(is the worst mistake
you could ever make.)

335
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,650
Friend,

336
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,210
back then, to save myself,

337
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,600
I left you hanging in that tree.

338
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,520
Then I entered Ruthless Parlor...

339
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,250
Now,

340
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,800
Ruthless Parlor is no more.

341
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,730
It's time

342
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,250
for you to leave with me.

343
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,450
Who's there?

344
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:22,648
Mr. Phantom, it's been years since you
last wielded your mourning staff.

345
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,410
I fear it must be rusted by now.

346
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,730
Even if it is rusted,

347
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,280
it's still more than enough
to kill a weak girl like you.

348
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,250
What good would my death do?

349
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,520
Everyone in the martial world is itching

350
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,280
to take your head and trade it for wine.

351
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:37,800
You...

352
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,410
Right now, I need people.

353
00:21:39,937 --> 00:21:41,730
And you, Mr. Phantom,
have nowhere to go.

354
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,890
Rather than kill each other,

355
00:21:43,937 --> 00:21:45,693
why not work together
for our own benefit?

356
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,120
What do you have to trade?

357
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,690
The Fuxian treasure.

358
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,280
You're still recovering.

359
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,970
Why are you in such a hurry?

360
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,360
Chanyi.

361
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,970
I can't let this go.

362
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,170
But right now, Yuchi Manor

363
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,600
has already allied with Tiangang.

364
00:22:13,226 --> 00:22:15,170
I received an invitation
from Moye Manor.

365
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,080
They've called for the heads
of Six Great Sects

366
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,760
to gather and discuss an alliance.

367
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:22,515
This time, they will select
an alliance leader of martial world

368
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,190
to lead the fight
against Ghost Valley Sect.

369
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,170
An alliance leader?

370
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,520
Either way,
I have no plans to join this alliance.

371
00:22:28,604 --> 00:22:29,982
Focus on your recovery.

372
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:30,804
Chanyi.

373
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,930
Why shouldn't you
be the alliance leader?

374
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,080
And why shouldn't you

375
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,840
hold the key to the treasure?

376
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,004
Besides, Ghost Valley Sect...

377
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:38,626
Shut up!

378
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,490
Chanyi.

379
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,040
You...

380
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,840
Ruhai.

381
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,730
Chanyi, listen to me.

382
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,650
I'm not asking you to side
with Ghost Valley Sect.

383
00:22:53,026 --> 00:22:55,110
We are only using
Ghost Valley Sect and the treasure

384
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,490
to divide the Six Great Sects.

385
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,840
Once they are split,

386
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,550
we can bring
the right sects to our side.

387
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Just trust me.

388
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,930
I will make sure you
become the alliance leader.

389
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,120
In a few days,

390
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,648
we will meet again at Mount Moye.

391
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,060
(Moye Manor)

392
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,410
Young heroes, you have traveled far.

393
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,320
Miss Rong.

394
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,600
Have we met before?

395
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,250
"Drifting like willow fluff
to the ends of the earth."

396
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,520
That was the fortune
Young Lady Rong drew before.

397
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,280
I still remember it.

398
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,840
You're the fortune teller
in Blossom's Smile?

399
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:54,930
Indeed.

400
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,040
I am Ye Guizhou.

401
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,010
I oversee daily affairs at Tiangang.

402
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,471
Tiangang truly
has eyes and ears everywhere.

403
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,410
I never expected that fortune teller

404
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,715
to be one of your people.

405
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:07,915
Where is Leader Chu?

406
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,410
To be honest,

407
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,800
our leader has been
in poor health these past years.

408
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,120
Once he recovers a little more,

409
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,760
he will personally
come to welcome you all.

410
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,080
So he's a sickly man.

411
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,650
Sister Rong, maybe
you shouldn't marry him.

412
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,650
What if...

413
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,560
We've come this far.

414
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:29,080
We can't leave empty-handed.

415
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,250
The guest rooms are ready.

416
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,930
Please follow me, young heroes.

417
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:34,930
This way.

418
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,760
Please, this way.

419
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,650
Everyone, take a look.

420
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,970
This is the place.

421
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,560
Miss Rong,
Leader Chu has given instructions.

422
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:54,960
(Shuxin Pavilion)

423
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:58,250
This great chamber
will be your residence.

424
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,170
As for the others,

425
00:25:00,204 --> 00:25:02,582
you may choose
from the remaining rooms as you wish.

426
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,840
Mr. Ye.

427
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,537
Please relay a message to Leader Chu.

428
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,210
I am concerned about his health.

429
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,360
By right,

430
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,280
as his betrothed,

431
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,080
I should visit him.

432
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:15,970
Yes.

433
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,320
Miss Rong is absolutely right.

434
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:21,360
I will be sure to inform him.

435
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,840
Please, Miss Rong.

436
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,560
Come.

437
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,320
This way, please.

438
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,730
(Her room must be spacious and bright.)

439
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,930
(Make sure there are
more candles than usual.)

440
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,010
(Prepare fresh fruits
and delicate pastries.)

441
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
(The fruits must
be crisp, sweet, and tart.)

442
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,890
(The pastries must
be soft, fragrant, and sweet.)

443
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,930
(Get a wooden tub ready for her bath.)

444
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,490
(Make sure the bed is comfortable.)

445
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,520
(Add more blankets.)

446
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,650
From the outside,
it looks cold and mysterious.

447
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,170
The exterior is unimpressive.

448
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,520
But the interior accommodations
are quite nice.

449
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,550
I am Wen Zhu, greets Miss Rong.

450
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:29,730
Mr. Ye has instructed me
to attend to you.

451
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,170
I...

452
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,600
I don't need maids.

453
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,040
Miss Rong will soon marry our leader.

454
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,280
You will be the Madam of Mount Moye.

455
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,410
I can take care of myself.

456
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,560
I don't need you.

457
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,170
Miss Rong,

458
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,320
I was born and raised in Mount Moye.

459
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,450
My parents were also part of the manor.

460
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,120
I have a clean background
and simple origins.

461
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,450
You need not worry.

462
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,970
It seems you already know
what I was thinking.

463
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,040
Rest assured, Miss Rong.

464
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,410
I will neither deceive you

465
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,760
nor harm you.

466
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,170
Mr. Ye is a trustworthy man.

467
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,650
Since he arranged for me to serve you,

468
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,210
he must have his reasons.

469
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:11,970
Fine.

470
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,970
Then you may stay.

471
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,800
The manor is damp and cold.

472
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,600
You still have a lingering cold
in your body.

473
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,600
A cup of warm wine will help you rest.

474
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:26,650
Thank you.

475
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,010
By the way,

476
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,490
has Feng Ming returned?

477
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,760
I need to speak with him.

478
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,560
I know nothing of Tiangang affairs.

479
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,080
Please rest early, Miss Rong.

480
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,410
(Leader Chu is so mysterious.)

481
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,520
(I must take a look myself.)

482
00:27:53,177 --> 00:27:59,930
(Shuxin Pavilion)

483
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,560
Miss Rong, are you going out?

484
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,280
Why?

485
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:06,320
Am I not allowed to walk around?

486
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:07,320
Miss Rong is a guest.

487
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,893
Of course, you are free to move about.

488
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:09,930
That's good.

489
00:28:12,648 --> 00:28:13,450
What do you want?

490
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:14,550
The paths are dark at night.

491
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,982
We wouldn't want you to get lost.

492
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,120
I'm only walking nearby.

493
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,040
I won't get lost.

494
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:24,737
You know who I am, don't you?

495
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,930
Does my word mean nothing here?

496
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,937
For now, everything is fine.

497
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,840
But once the other sects arrive,

498
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,210
things will become chaotic.

499
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,210
Security must be tightened everywhere.

500
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:51,626
I'll make the arrangements.

501
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,970
Come on, let's go see the Leader.

502
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,800
Miss Fei Wu, please.

503
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,170
Leader Chu, we have arrived.

504
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,250
Enter.

505
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:09,890
Why are you here?

506
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,360
I should ask you that.

507
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,120
Why are you here? Where is Yan Shao?

508
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,080
I don't know.

509
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,760
Miss Rong, it's late.

510
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,040
Why are you wandering around?

511
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,360
Weren't you always with him?

512
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:20,970
When did you leave Ruthless Parlor?

513
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,170
How did you get to Tiangang so fast?
Where is he?

514
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,730
Tiangang affairs
are none of your concern.

515
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
I just want to know if he's all right.

516
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,450
Yan Shao said

517
00:29:30,871 --> 00:29:32,693
there is nothing
between you two anymore.

518
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,337
Now that you've arrived at Mount Moye,

519
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,737
don't make this difficult for me.

520
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,040
Just focus on marrying
and becoming the Madam.

521
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:39,120
Right.

522
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:40,970
Fine.

523
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,520
Then as the Madam here,

524
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,648
surely I have the right
to meet my husband?

525
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,210
Leader Chu is recovering.

526
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:49,426
He is not receiving visitors.

527
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,320
That's right.

528
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,040
Miss Rong, I can escort you back
to the other courtyard.

529
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,320
- Please...
- Leader!

530
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,410
- Your...
- Miss Rong...

531
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,930
Your fiancee is right at your doorstep.

532
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:58,226
Won't you come out to meet me?

533
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,410
Hiding away?

534
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,450
Is this how Tiangang

535
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,890
treats an unwed bride?

536
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Arriving uninvited
isn't exactly proper either.

537
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,360
Please stop here, Miss Rong.

538
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:11,604
Weren't you the one
who insisted on marrying me?

539
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,010
Now you're avoiding me?

540
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,650
According to tradition,

541
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,360
as the wedding approaches,

542
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,040
the couple must not meet.

543
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,210
Leader Chu,

544
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:20,890
I think you and I

545
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,600
should drop all this talk about customs.

546
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,730
We both know the truth.

547
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,010
We were

548
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,120
never really a couple

549
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,410
bound by love.

550
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,170
You're marrying me for the key.

551
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,490
And I'm marrying you
for the same reason.

552
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,040
Since this is merely
a political alliance,

553
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,690
why pretend to play the part?

554
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,210
What's wrong? Are you backing out?

555
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,080
Of course not.

556
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,730
I, Rong Shukuang, keep my word.

557
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,650
Yuchi Manor stands
by its promises as well.

558
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,560
But this blind marriage,

559
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:52,760
this wasn't my choice.

560
00:30:53,271 --> 00:30:54,930
People in the martial world are direct.

561
00:30:55,026 --> 00:30:56,737
We don't care for unnecessary rules.

562
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,410
Leader Chu, would you be willing

563
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,840
to show me your face?

564
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,520
Leader Chu is

565
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,930
unable to step out?

566
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,890
If you can't come out,

567
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,760
then I will come to you.

568
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Rong Shukuang.

569
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,840
Now that you are at Mount Moye,

570
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,250
you must follow our rules.

571
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:23,320
The wedding is imminent.

572
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,360
It would be best
if you behaved yourself.

573
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,210
If you want me to behave,

574
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,600
then first tell me.

575
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,930
Where is Yan Shao?

576
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,450
Miss Rong is perceptive.

577
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,840
This matter won't stay hidden for long.

578
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:43,970
I know.

579
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,970
But in my current state,

580
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,650
how can I face her?

581
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,560
Where is Yan Shao?

582
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:55,040
If you won't explain today,

583
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,120
I'm not leaving.

584
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,280
Why are you so concerned

585
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,760
about Yan Shao?

586
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:05,026
He risked his life
to save me multiple times.

587
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,250
Is it not right

588
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,560
for me to worry about him?

589
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:10,730
Escorting you
to Mount Moye was his duty.

590
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,840
It was my order.

591
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,450
Once I see him,

592
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,250
I will let him know of your concern.

593
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,360
As for now,

594
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,730
he is attending to other matters.

595
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:25,671
He is not at Ruthless Parlor.

596
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:27,560
What about Wanci?

597
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,890
Are you referring
to the Young Lady Lin?

598
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,650
Yan Shao sent word that she is fine.

599
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,730
She is still recovering
at Ruthless Parlor.

600
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,690
Yuchi Manor has been informed.

601
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:40,040
(That's not right.)

602
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:41,930
(This person before me...)

603
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,280
(Why does he seem so familiar?)

604
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,004
(Their voice is different,
their tone has changed,)

605
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,280
(but there's something)

606
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,671
(that reminds me of Yan Shao.)

607
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,210
(Something is off.)

608
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,250
Leader Chu...

609
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:57,970
have we...

610
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,410

Why do you ask, Miss Rong?

614
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:13,210
Perhaps it's just my imagination.

615
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:14,970
It's late.

616
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,490
