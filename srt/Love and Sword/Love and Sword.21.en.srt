(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 21=

19
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,310
Young Master Lin, your talent

20
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:57,493
is well deserved.

21
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,400
I've long heard
of the Leader of Tiangang.

22
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:00,960
It's rare to meet you in person.

23
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,404
I've spent most of my life here,
rarely meeting outsiders,

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
and I never show my true face.

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,760
A few days ago, I wasn't feeling well

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,360
and couldn't come out to meet you.

27
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,310
I hope you'll forgive
my lack of hospitality.

28
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:12,071
Leader Chu, you're being too formal.

29
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,590
We don't mind the slight treatment

30
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,310
if you take good care of Shukuang.

31
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Miss Rong and Young Master Lin

32
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,848
are both esteemed guests of Mount Moye.

33
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,310
When the Six Great Sects gather here
a few days later,

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,710
things will be even livelier.

35
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,471
The Six Great Sects no longer exist.

36
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,190
Junshan Sect is no more,

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,680
and the Six Great Sects exist
in name only.

38
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:32,893
It has long since fallen apart.

39
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:34,693
That's exactly why we need
this gathering.

40
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:36,382
So we can discuss forming
a new alliance.

41
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:38,529
Yuchi Manor is the top manor
in the martial world,

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,471
and it could rally many people
with a single request.

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,160
It should unite and lead the others
to go against the enemies.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,870
But...

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,870
It's difficult to convince the others
when Yuchi Manor is in this situation.

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,893
Yuchi Manor will have Tiangang's support
from this marriage alliance.

47
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,870
Then Yuchi Manor will regain
its authority.

48
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,310
We appreciate your sincerity.

49
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,426
I've received a letter from my father.

50
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,150
He's already on his way to Mount Moye.

51
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,960
I'll be waiting
for Master Lin's arrival here.

52
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,310
Leader Chu, I'll take my leave now.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,190
Brother Shaoci.

54
00:03:32,248 --> 00:03:33,671
Shaoci, how did the meeting go?

55
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,671
We discussed the alliance
between the sects.

56
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,630
Shaoci,

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,590
Leader Chu is so mysterious.

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,560
What does he look like?

59
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:42,630
Is he tall and handsome,
like a noble gentleman,

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,840
or fierce and intimidating?

61
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:46,400
He is Leader of Tiangang, after all.

62
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:47,648
He won't be that bad looking.

63
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,680
He wears a mask

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,150
that covers his entire face.

65
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,960
For him to hide his face like that,

66
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,310
he's quite suspicious.

67
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,590
No wonder no one
has seen Chu Tianyao before.

68
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,160
What if he's actually not blessed
with good looks?

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

70
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,190
Don't you think

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,590
his figure looks familiar?

72
00:04:06,137 --> 00:04:07,093
Who does he resemble?

73
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,280
Yan Shao.

74
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,520
That's impossible.

75
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,870
That can't be.

76
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,310
How can you be sure?

77
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,000
I saw Yan Shao at the manor.

78
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,360
Yan Shao is back?

79
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,070
I only met him briefly.

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,040
Also,

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,120
he had someone send me a message
to wish me and Chu Tianyao a harmonious

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,160
and happy marriage.

83
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:34,782
Maybe Yan Shao has his reasons
for keeping his distance.

84
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,000
Miss Rong.

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,000
Miss Rong, I heard you wanted
to discuss something with me?

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,630
Ah, yes.

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,040
Everyone,

88
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:46,693
I'm going to discuss
the wedding arrangement with Mr. Ye.

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,680
Please excuse me.

90
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,600
Rong...

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,310
Let's go.

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,270
This way, please.

93
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,970
(Chu and Rong's Wedding Arrangement)

94
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,870
Miss Rong, what is this?

95
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,630
A wedding is a big event
so the preparations must start early.

96
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,680
I have already listed all the processes

97
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
and things

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
that needed to be arranged.

99
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,390
Mr. Ye, you can make
any necessary adjustments

100
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,040
before showing it to Leader Chu.

101
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,680
Of course.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,070
I'll report everything to Leader Chu.

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,750
Mr. Ye,

104
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,040
the wedding attire
is of utmost importance.

105
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,070
Rest assured. I'll have it arranged
as soon as possible.

106
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,240
And

107
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,226
we need to set the wedding date soon.

108
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:38,620
I've already found the best date,

109
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:40,960
which is this month on the 16th.
A very auspicious day.

110
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,337
We'll pick this day.

111
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,430
The 16th of this month?

112
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,004
- All right.
- (Just watch)

113
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,160
(how I catch you red-handed
within these few days.)

114
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,510
What Miss Rong means
is she wants the wedding

115
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:55,950
to be on the 16th of this month.

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,310
The 16th of this month?

117
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,270
That's only ten days away.

118
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

119
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,560
Leader Chu, what do you think?

120
00:06:03,715 --> 00:06:05,693
Just do as she says
and make the preparations.

121
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,390
Understood.

122
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:09,271
I'll take care of it immediately.

123
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Yan Shao.

124
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm fine.

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,310
You still can't let go.

126
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,070
You still want an answer, right?

127
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,310
What do you mean?

128
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,920
Whether she has truly moved on
from Yan Shao.

129
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,310
Even though Yan Shao
and Chu Tianyao are the same person,

130
00:06:33,648 --> 00:06:34,720
you still want to know

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,360
if the one she truly loves is Yan Shao,

132
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:37,537
not Chu Tianyao.

133
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,750
Everything you've done

134
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,360
is to keep her here at Mount Moye

135
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
as the Leader's wife.

136
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,190
But deep down,

137
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,510
you just want to know
who she really loves.

138
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,480
Am I right?

139
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,890
We've been through much together.
So we're practically family.

140
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,137
I know you better than anyone.

141
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,560
But when it comes to love,

142
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:55,920
there's no room for a third person.

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,120
Yan Shao.

144
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,390
If you marry her as Chu Tianyao,

145
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,600
you're hurting both yourself and her.

146
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,600
Tong, come here.

147
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Which color looks best?

148
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,000
You're naturally beautiful.

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,848
No matter what you wear,
you'll look stunning.

150
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,270
What a sweet talker!
Did you eat something sweet?

151
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,310
Tianyao,

152
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
what do you think?

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Black and red are more dignified

154
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,310
and suit Tiangang's identity.

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,390
All right. I'll go
with what my husband says

156
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,800
and use this color

157
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,830
for the wedding robes.

158
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, Miss Rong.

159
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,360
Go ahead.

160
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,720
Let me take your measurements
for the robes.

161
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,830
What's this?

162
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:10,182
It's just something from an old friend.

163
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,600
Just an old item.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,390
It must be important to you

165
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,560
since you always carry it with you.

166
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,360
On my way to Mount Moye,

167
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,120
I met a coffin maker.

168
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,040
He told me
I could trade this for my life.

169
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,950
I almost did.

170
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,830
Good thing I took it back.

171
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,070
Why?

172
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,830
Even when you know something is lost,

173
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,360
sometimes you just can't let go.

174
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Can't let go?

175
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,120
Of a person or an object?

176
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
In life,

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,630
not everything goes the way we want.

178
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,440
What about you, Leader Chu?

179
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,630
Is there anything in your life
that you couldn't let go of?

180
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,670
If you like it,

181
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,790
you can have it.

182
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,480
I don't need it anymore.

183
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,790
I have no use for things
that belong to others.

184
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,000
Take it back.

185
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,150
When I first received this whistle,

186
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,080
I was told it was for sending signals.

187
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,080
If I was ever in danger,

188
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I just had to blow it.

189
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,000
But I never used it.

190
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,150
Not even once.

191
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,360
On your way from Yuchi Manor
to Mount Moye,

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
you were in danger multiple times.

193
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
Why didn't you use it?

194
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,000
First of all, things happened too fast.

195
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,550
Secondly,

196
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,720
I was afraid.

197
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,000
Afraid of what?

198
00:09:37,137 --> 00:09:39,293
If a person lies about being
in danger too many times,

199
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,471
no one will come and save him
when it's real.

200
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,720
I was scared when I used it,

201
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,910
he wouldn't come.

202
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:51,093
You don't have to worry.

203
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,600
I'll get rid of it.

204
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,960
How?

205
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,750
Burn it,

206
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,840
bury it, or smash it.

207
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:58,915
Whatever it takes,
just to be done with it.

208
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,550
Only by letting go of the past
can a person start over.

209
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,720
He's really not coming after me.

210
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,510
That old fox is truly heartless.

211
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,804
Are you trying to get rid
of the eagle-bone whistle,

212
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,493
or are you trying to get rid
of yourself?

213
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,030
I never told you
it was an eagle-bone whistle.

214
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,510
Why does Mount Moye

215
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,600
have hidden traps like this?

216
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,870
It's just an old dried-up well,

217
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,270
not a trap.

218
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,960
Are you hurt?

219
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,510
I think I dislocated my arm
from the fall.

220
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,750
Wait there.

221
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,200
Don't leave me!

222
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,000
If you leave now, you'll be a widower!

223
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Climb up.

224
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,715
Do I look like I can climb up myself

225
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,182
with this dislocated arm?

226
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,200
- Stay still.
- What are you doing?

227
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,630
Someone is coming.

228
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,840
Ouch.

229
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,030
Your dislocated arm is back in place.

230
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,270
But it'll take some time to heal.

231
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,240
It's fine.

232
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,750
The wedding won't be delayed
over an arm.

233
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,150
You're still thinking about the wedding
at a time like this?

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,630
Hold on tight.

235
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm ready.

236
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,030
When things are going smoothly,

237
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,030
then something unexpected happens.

238
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,200
Where are they?

239
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,440
On a date.

240
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,550
A date?

241
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
What's that?

242
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,440
Shukuang told me.

243
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,390
She said a date is when two people
in love meet alone

244
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,480
and share their thoughts.

245
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,390
And what are these?

246
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,030
They're choosing desserts

247
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,960
for the wedding banquet.

248
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,240
This one's good.

249
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,440
Try it.

250
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,750
I'm fine.

251
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,493
Just have a bite.

252
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,440
Not bad.

253
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,870
You didn't set this up on purpose,
did you?

254
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,200
Did I dig this well?

255
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,390
Did I break the rope?

256
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:14,720
This was obviously an accident.

257
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,960
So how could I have planned it?

258
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,150
And even if I did,
what would I gain from it?

259
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,440
Maybe the chance to take off my mask

260
00:13:20,537 --> 00:13:21,960
while I'm caught off guard?

261
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:26,390
I have no interest
in seeing your face right now.

262
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:30,071
It's not that you don't want to see it.

263
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,910
It's that you already know who I am.

264
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,720
That's why you're in such a rush
to get married.

265
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,080
I will never marry Chu Tianyao.

266
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,270
Why not?

267
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,840
Without love,

268
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,871
how can we spend a lifetime together?

269
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,790
I, Rong Shukuang,

270
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,320
will never marry a man I don't love.

271
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,600
Then why are you doing all this?

272
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,000
Setting the wedding date

273
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,270
was just a deadline.

274
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
Before that day,

275
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,030
I want you to be honest

276
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
and tell me the truth.

277
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,270
Remember the Truth or Dare game?

278
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,537
If I don't hear the truth
from you by then,

279
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,550
I'll leave Mount Moye

280
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,750
on our wedding day.

281
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,960
Why... Why do you look sickly?

282
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,960
Only Yan Shao knows
about the eagle-bone whistle.

283
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,390
And only Yan Shao would come
to save me after hearing it.

284
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,000
I had no choice but to meet you

285
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,870
as Chu Tianyao.

286
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,240
It wasn't to deceive you.

287
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,480
Do you believe me?

288
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,000
I do.

289
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,150
Do you know

290
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,000
the night you met Shangguan Tong

291
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
as Yan Shao,

292
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,320
I already knew.

293
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,270
How?

294
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,440
I just felt it.

295
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,000
That feeling when two people
are closest to each other.

296
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,440
No matter how well you disguise yourself
and try to hide it,

297
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,440
the way your heartbeat changes

298
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,750
because of someone

299
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,750
is not something you can fake.

300
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,790
And to think

301
00:16:22,404 --> 00:16:24,550
I was actually jealous
of Chu Tianyao for days...

302
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,870
You always like this.

303
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,480
Before, you were jealous of Lin Shaoci.

304
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,870
You're getting more absurd now.

305
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,600
You're even jealous of yourself.

306
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,440
When someone cares for another deeply,

307
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,000
there's no room in their heart
for anyone else,

308
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,870
not even another version of themselves.

309
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,320
So, are you confessing

310
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,870
your feelings for me now?

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,910
Yes.

312
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,510
Even

313
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,030
if I'm not really

314
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,270
the person who grew up with you?

315
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,320
I spent all those years searching
for Rong Shukuang

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,750
because I made a promise

317
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,550
to protect her for a lifetime.

318
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:07,360
But the one I've truly longed for
and never stopped thinking about

319
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,070
is the woman I saved

320
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,760
at Soul Reaping Platform in the desert.

321
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,110
Me too.

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,240
In my entire life,

323
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:21,440
I've never cared for a man this deeply.

324
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,590
My heart and mind are filled
with nothing but you.

325
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,640
Let's never be apart again,

326
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,200
all right?

327
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:29,960
All right.

328
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,680
But who are you,

329
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,110
and where did you come from?

330
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,680
I'll tell you

331
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,270
once we get out of here.

332
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,270
Then we will have so much

333
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,400
to talk about.

334
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,590

Of course.

00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,871
and you're already agreeing?

367
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,480
No matter what you ask,

368
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,640
my answer is yes.

369
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,400
Then promise me this.

370
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,110
From now on,

371
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,590
no matter what happens,

372
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,110
we will never hide anything
from each other

373
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,310
or tell each other lies.

374
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,590
All right?

375
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:05,960
I promise.

376
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,790
Feng Ming, find a strong rope.

377
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,480
All right. Please wait there.

378
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,830
Let's go.

379
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,480
We still have so much to talk about...

380
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,720
So, your place or mine?

381
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,680
I'll follow whatever you decide.

382
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,960
Do you have wine?

383
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,790
Whatever you want, I have it.

384
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,893
We'll eat more later.

385
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,640
I really liked the one we had last time.

386
00:20:58,648 --> 00:20:59,030
Really?

387
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,760
They're not going to lock the door
and start fighting again, are they?

388
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,750
No.

389
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,440
They're probably

390
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,960
just going to talk.

391
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,270
I left my snacks inside.

392
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,590
Then let's not eat the snacks this time.

393
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,270
How about some roasted pigeon instead?

394
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,270
Let's go.

395
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,590
There's something
I need to tell you first.

396
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,830
What is it?

397
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,160
I've been poisoned.

398
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,680
It's called Crimson Lotus Heart.

399
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,920
It could flare up at any moment,

400
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,750
and there's no cure.

401
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,400
What?

402
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,270
How did this happen?

403
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,830
When did you get poisoned?

404
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
The poison was meant for you.

405
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,160
I took you to Immortal Spring
to see Senior Helian.

406
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,000
She taught me a rare technique
to transfer poison.

407
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,790
Ever since we were in the desert,

408
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
I've been drawing the poison
from your body into mine.

409
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,270
Returning to Ruthless Parlor this time

410
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,160
was to get the antidote.

411
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,350
But

412
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,680
there was only enough for one person.

413
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:20,493
We'll talk later after you eat this.

414
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,000
So that pill

415
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,030
was the only antidote?

416
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,880
I'm such a fool.

417
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,440
From the desert

418
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,440
to the Yuchi Manor

419
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,110
and to Mount Moye,

420
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,200
you followed me all this way
and saved me so many times.

421
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why

422
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
didn't I realize it sooner?

423
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,510
And at that time,

424
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,310
you already knew

425
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,400
I wasn't the real Rong Shukuang.

426
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,640
Why did you still give me

427
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,680
the only antidote?

428
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,400
Because

429
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,270
I wanted you to live.

430
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,590
How...

431
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,110
How did I get poisoned?

432
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,070
It was Liu An.

433
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,830
She poisoned your food

434
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,790
little by little.

435
00:23:21,093 --> 00:23:22,471
Over time, the poison built up

436
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,960
until it was ready to take effect.

437
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,350
Did someone order her to do it?

438
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,310
I suspect Lin Wanci.

439
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:30,790
Liu An has always been
under her control.

440
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:32,937
She was most likely acting
on Lin Wanci's orders.

441
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,750
But

442
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,750
why would Lin Wanci want to harm me?

443
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,400
I think it's jealousy.

444
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,030
She is jealous that you were loved
and trusted by your father and brother.

445
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,310
Or maybe she had another motive.

446
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,070
She has the mind of a sinister
and ruthless person,

447
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,680
far beyond what an ordinary woman
would think.

448
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,240
So,

449
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
is there really no cure?

450
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,310
At Ruthless Parlor,

451
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,590
Senior Helian taught me

452
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,510
an incomplete breathing technique.

453
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,750
It can slow down
the effects of the poison.

454
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,200
That's why

455
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,160
you must marry me as Chu Tianyao

456
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,240
so they will hesitate.

457
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:23,048
Even if something happens to you
in the future,

458
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,750
as the wife of Tiangang's Leader,

459
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,830
I'll be under their protection,

460
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,337
and I won't have to worry
about survival.

461
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,590
You're sharp, as always.

462
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,960
Nothing gets past you.

463
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:46,830
But now that we've made
our feelings clear,

464
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,830
we must stay together,

465
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,240
always.

466
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,000
I don't believe
any poison is truly incurable.

467
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,830
If one antidote existed,

468
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,110
there must be a way to create another.

469
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,000
Even if we never find it,

470
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
I refuse

471
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,640
to let our days be filled

472
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,830
with sorrow and despair.

473
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,750
I have the same thought too.

474
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,337
It's always easier
when two people share the burden

475
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,350
than carrying it alone.

476
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,590
Now, let's talk about you.

477
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
So, who are you,

478
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,000
and where did you come from?

479
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,200
And how did you end up as Rong Shukuang?

480
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,400
I already told you before.

481
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,750
But you weren't really listening.

482
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,550
Then tell me again.

483
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,510
It might sound strange.

484
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,440
You might not even understand.

485
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,750
You mean

486
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,830
the planetary orbits

487
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,590
and rotations?

488
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,960
How exactly does it work?

489
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,440
Like this.

490
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,480
Like this?

491
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,640
I come

492
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,310
from a place very far away.

493
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,590
A place completely different from here.

494
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,270
Because of an accident,

495
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,720
I was transported
from that world to this one.

496
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,871
(No Parking Along the Entire Road)

497
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,590
(When I opened my eyes,)

498
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,471
I was already
at Soul Reaping Platform in the desert.

499
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,960
Earlier, you mentioned

500
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,240
you had a piece of white jade

501
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:36,200
that's the same as the one on my sword.

502
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,590
Yes, that's the one.

503
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,720
I don't know why.

504
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,590
But I think it was that jade

505
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,510
that brought me from that dimension
to this dimension.

506
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:48,240
It also gave me some
of Rong Shukuang's memories

507
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,400
and even a bit of her martial arts.

508
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,510
Ancient books stated,

509
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
"A child roams freely
within the six realms."

510
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,790
Maybe that's what happened to you.

511
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,510
As you said, the orbit or a rotation.

512
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,240
You may not fully understand
my explanation.

513
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,880
But as for Misty Moon Village,

514
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,640
Father did mention something to me.

515
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,070
I have a few scattered memories.

516
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,350
The Fang Family possessed
a secret treasure

517
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,920
and were hunted down.

518
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,680
They went into hiding

519
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:28,048
and lived in the Misty Moon Village.

520
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,648
The Misty Moon Village
was hidden deep in the valley,

521
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
unknown to most people.

522
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,550
(Misty Moon Village)
(The Fang and their guards lived there.)

523
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,590
(They believed it was a paradise,)

524
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:40,048
(a place where they could spend
their lives in peace.)

525
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:41,671
(The children of Misty Moon Village)

526
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,720
(had no idea)

527
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,960
(who their parents really were.)

528
00:27:45,493 --> 00:27:46,782
(But then, everything changed.)

529
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,790
(Panic spread everywhere.)

530
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,400
(It was as if Master)

531
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,480
(had foreseen this day would come)

532
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,493
(and had already made the preparations.)

533
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,070
At first, we hid well.

534
00:27:57,737 --> 00:28:00,030
But then the Ghost Valley Sect
expanded their search.

535
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,790
I hid you in a safe place

536
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,071
and went to lure them away.

537
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,110
But when I returned,

538
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,070
you were gone.

539
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,920
I searched for you until I collapsed
from exhaustion.

540
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,750
Later,

541
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
(I met Chu Moxiong,)

542
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,830
(the master of Mount Moye.)

543
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,550
(He took me in.)

544
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,960
From now on,

545
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,640
this will be your home.

546
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,480
I trained under Father.

547
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,590
I honed my martial arts
while looking for you.

548
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,070
(Until I found out)

549
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,030
(you were taken by Yuchi Manor.)

550
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,590
(You changed your name)

551
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,590
(and became Rong Shukuang.)

552
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,510
- What do you want?
- This figure...

553
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,880
- Let me have a feel.
- Let me go!

554
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,640
- Then I'll buy the flowers...
- Let me go!

555
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,350
She told you to let her go.

556
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,160
Didn't you hear?

557
00:28:52,048 --> 00:28:53,790
Who are you to meddle in our business?

558
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,270
Cloud-Slicing Sword?

559
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,750
You're Rong Shukuang from Yuchi Manor?

560
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,270
You people

561
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,200
aren't even worthy of facing this sword.

562
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,310
Who cares what blade she uses! Get her!

563
00:29:20,248 --> 00:29:21,150
Let's get out of here.

564
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,915
I'll buy all your flowers.
So you should head home.

565
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,160
Thank you, Miss.

566
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,720
What are you doing here?

567
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:39,350
I heard you took care of the bandits
on the western road.

568
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,000
Father wants to reward you.

569
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,070
All right.

570
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,110
Let's head back to the manor then.

571
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,640
By the way,

572
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,048
I just bought these.

573
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,160
So, you finally found her.

574
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,310
But you didn't reunite with her.

575
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,310
Back then,

576
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,160
I could tell Rong Shukuang had feelings
for Young Master Lin.

577
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,240
So, you chose to walk away.

578
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,920
Later,

579
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,880
you learn that Shen Zuitian
had kidnapped Rong Shukuang.

580
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,480
The one I saved
from the Soul Reaping Platform

581
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,880
was no longer Rong Shukuang.

582
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
Maybe

583
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,880
I was destined to meet you

584
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,480
from the moment I arrived in this world.

585
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:53,530
(Shuxin Pavilion)

586
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,310
Is Sister Rong not here?

587
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,204
She didn't stay out all night, did she?

588
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,880
Did something happen to her?

589
00:31:03,137 --> 00:31:05,550
Yesterday, she was discussing
the wedding with the Leader.

590
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,550
But they didn't part on good terms.

591
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,000
What's wrong?

592
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,160
Brother Shaoci,

593
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:13,400
Sister Rong went
to see Chu Tianyao yesterday.

594
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,404
It seems like
she never returned all night.

595
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:18,426
Let's go and find Chu Tianyao.

596
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:23,120
(Hanyu Pavilion)

597
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,680
Young Master Lin,

598
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,200
you seem to be in a hurry.

599
00:31:36,382 --> 00:31:37,200
What's the matter?

600
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,070
Is Leader Chu here?

601
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,030
Leader Chu is resting right now.

602
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,720
My sister never returned last night.

603
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,920
We're worried about her safety.

604
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,720
We only want to ask

605
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,893
if Leader Chu has seen her.

606
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,200
I'll pass on the message

607
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,750
once the Leader wakes up.

608
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,937
- It's morning.
- Get up.

609
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,680
Keep quiet.

610
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,830
To search the manor...

611
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,920
Miss Rong is safe in Moye Manor.

612
00:31:58,226 --> 00:31:59,760
I can assure you that, Young Master Lin.

613
00:31:59,804 --> 00:32:00,471
She is safe.

614
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,920
Hey,

615
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,350
where's your mask?

616
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
I'll leave first.

617
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:10,648
Things like jumping out of the window
are better left to men.

618
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:11,750
Wait, hold on.

619
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,929
Isn't this your room?
Why are you the one jumping out?

620
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,426
- No, I should leave.
- You're right.

621
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,350
Wait.

622
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,790
We're husband and wife now.

623
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,510
Why can't we be in the same room?

624
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,000
Why should we hide?

625
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,270
You're right.

626
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,240
You're Chu Tianyao now.

627
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,160
I thought you were Yan Shao
for a moment.

628
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,240
We won't leave until we see Leader Chu.

629
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,310
Shaoci.

630
00:32:34,804 --> 00:32:36,271
You've been here this whole time?

631
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,720
Sister Rong, are you...

632
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,693
- I told you, didn't I?
- Are you all right?

633
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,493
Miss Rong is perfectly safe
in Moye Manor.

634
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,750
I had a misunderstanding
with Leader Chu yesterday.

635
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,440
So I came to clear things up.

636
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,160
We drank and talked for a long time
and had a great time.

637
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,510
But I drank too much

638
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,750
and passed out.

639
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,240
But nothing happened between us.

640
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,960
So don't get any funny ideas.

641
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,750
You had a great time and passed out?

642
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,830
I'm exhausted from talking all night.

643
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,750
I'm going to bed.

644
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,515
Let's go.

645
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,070
Come on, Shaoci.

646
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,000
Come on.

647
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,160
What are you doing?

648
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,830
Nothing, just go.

649
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,750
Spring waters fill the pond,

650
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,790
and the new grass grows in spring.

651
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,790
What spring?

652
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,550
I meant spring came early this year

653
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,480
in Mount Moye.

654
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:52,871
Should we go out and enjoy the scenery?

655
00:33:52,893 --> 00:33:54,590
No. I'm tired so I'm going to sleep.

656
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,830
Stop smiling like that.

657
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,004
You look weird in that way.

658
00:34:00,026 --> 00:34:00,826
Shukuang.

659
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,400
When did you

660
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,920
and Chu Tianyao become so close?

661
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,360
We never had a bad relationship before.

662
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,190
But you just said

663
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,280
you had a misunderstanding?

664
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,840
Exactly.

665
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
And now it's cleared up.

666
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:18,670
All right, then. I'm going to bed now.

667
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,800
It looks like
she's completely over Yan Shao.

668
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,510
I wonder where Yan Shao is now

669
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,440
or if he even knows
how Sister Rong feels.

670
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,670
I don't care if it's Yan Shao

671
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
or Leader Chu.

672
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,190
As long as Rong is happy,
that's all that matters.

673
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,670
Let's get started.
