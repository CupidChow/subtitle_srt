=Love and Sword=

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 10=

19
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,670
(Since you both have your own plans,)

20
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,671
(I can't just sit around
and do nothing.)

21
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,670
(If I want answers,)

22
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,140
(I need to make enough money)

23
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,470
(to buy back the album.)

24
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,670
Sister Rong,

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,470
what are you up to now?

26
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:59,990
I'm making a weapon
that'll help me make money.

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,580
How's that going to earn you money?

28
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,670
A crossbow.

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,500
One that can ignite
and explode on impact.

30
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,460
That sounds

31
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,670
even deadlier

32
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,790
than our Tang Clan's hidden weapons.

33
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,620
They're not even on the same level.

34
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,990
This is the difference
between projectile weapons and firearms.

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,860
Then what do you call this weapon?

36
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:27,300
I'll call it Inferno Crossbow.

37
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,180
It's fine.

38
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,830
Scientific experiments

39
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,270
always have setbacks.

40
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:42,230
We'll get it right.

41
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:43,648
Let's go again.

42
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,550
Come on, please work.

43
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,460
We'll try again.

44
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,070
Ladies and gentlemen,

45
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,550
let me tell you a strange tale
from the martial world.

46
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,860
The master of Xingfeng Cave
has suddenly died,

47
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,390
leaving behind a legendary weapon
known as the Inferno Crossbow!

48
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,160
What is an Inferno Crossbow?

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,510
Never heard of it.

50
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,230
This weapon has driven

51
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,580
his two top disciples to turn
against each other,

52
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,580
fighting to the death.

53
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,020
They've agreed to a final duel

54
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,270
on the lake tomorrow!

55
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,390
Mister, may I ask

56
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,790
who these two are?

57
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,700
Ah, you want to know?

58
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,990
One is swift as a bat in the night,

59
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,230
known as the Lone Swallow.

60
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,270
The other one

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,020
fights like a beast,

62
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,860
wielding a great blade,
the Merciless Blade.

63
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,510
It's a battle between Merciless Blade

64
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,900
and Lone Swallow.

65
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,700
That's a true clash of masters.

66
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,070
We have to watch this.

67
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,830
We must not miss it tomorrow.

68
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,020
Hurry! Let us through!

69
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,350
Hurry! They're going to start!

70
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:12,115
Don't push.
The fight hasn't started.

71
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,270
Excuse me, excuse me!

72
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,180
Excuse me,

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,060
that man in black on Huxin Pavilion,

74
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,150
is he the hero, Lone Swallow?

75
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:32,990
That's him.

76
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,500
They say his sword strikes
as fast as a ghost's shadow.

77
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,640
He's one of the finest swordsmen
in the martial world.

78
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:38,550
Wow, that's amazing.

79
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,350
But where's the other one?

80
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,790
There he is. Over there!

81
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
There he is!

82
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,471
Look! It's the Merciless Blade!

83
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:47,300
Merciless Blade. That's Merciless Blade.

84
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,790
Martial Brother,

85
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,420
this duel between us...

86
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,620
It's not what I wanted.

87
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,550
Are you really going to kill me

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,380
over the Inferno Crossbow?

89
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,420
In the martial world,

90
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,940
grudges are endless.

91
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,500
I'm tired of this life

92
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,710
that I wish only for death.

93
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,260
But my skills are so great,
even dying is difficult for me.

94
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,110
So in the end,

95
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,110
you refuse to hand over

96
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,060
our master's weapon?

97
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,860
I've lived for decades.

98
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:53,710
Today,

99
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,671
I finally get to witness the peak battle

100
00:05:55,715 --> 00:05:57,740
of Xingfeng Cave's
two greatest disciples.

101
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,180
I can die with no regrets!

102
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,420
But it would be a shame

103
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,350
if both of them perish from this duel.

104
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,940
Then this legendary weapon
will disappear forever.

105
00:06:06,026 --> 00:06:07,626
What does the weapon even look like?

106
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:08,848
A legendary weapon?

107
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,740
It must be priceless.

108
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,470
In that case...

109
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
They're starting.

110
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,620
Make your move!

111
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,470
In that case,

112
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,860
we shall start this duel!

113
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,804
They're making their move!

114
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,590
Look!

115
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
That's impressive!

116
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,380
That power is insane!

117
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,260
Martial Junior,

118
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,910
this weapon has turned us
against each other.

119
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,350
It's nothing but a curse.

120
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,860
I'll destroy it right now!

121
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,710
I only hope this can bring peace
to the martial world.

122
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:52,710
Wait, hero!

123
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,260
If you're going to destroy it,

124
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,590
why not just gift it to me instead?

125
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,350
That's right!

126
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:58,110
What? No way!

127
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,110
Such a treasure
can't be given away for free!

128
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,350
I'll give you five taels for it!

129
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:02,470
Five taels is too little.

130
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,740
I am willing

131
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,790
to pay 10 taels.

132
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,230
I'll pay 20 taels.

133
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,500
Thirty taels!

134
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,990
Forty taels!

135
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:08,819
Fifty!

136
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,115
- Sixty taels!
- Eighty taels!

137
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:10,910
One and fifty taels!

138
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,826
Three hundred taels!

139
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,470
Five hundred taels!

140
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,248
Six hundred taels!

141
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,030
Seven hundred taels!

142
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,493
Eight hundred taels!

143
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,350
Nine hundred taels!

144
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,350
I'll pay 1,000 taels!

145
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:27,060
Following Young Lady Rong is amazing!

146
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,030
Young Lady Rong.

147
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:29,380
Young Lady Rong.

148
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,260
Young Lady Rong.

149
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,740
It didn't take long
to sell all 100 Inferno Crossbows.

150
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,790
I must be a marketing genius.

151
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,550
That's right.

152
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,160
Young Lady Rong is truly brilliant.

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,300
It's time to split the money!

154
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,260
Come on.

155
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,030
Everyone.

156
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,790
Here's your money.

157
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:44,230
This is yours.

158
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,740
Let me say this in advance.

159
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,820
You must keep quiet about this.

160
00:07:47,848 --> 00:07:49,040
When we get back to the manor,

161
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,910
don't say a word about this.

162
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,500
Understood?

163
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,710
Yes, we won't say a word!

164
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:57,770
(Heshun Restaurant)

165
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,940
You'll get paid what you asked for.

166
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:07,670
Money on delivery, goods in return.

167
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,550
Rong Shukuang has always been
proud and aloof,

168
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,890
never involving herself with money
or wealth at the manor.

169
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,420
Where did you get this money?

170
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,940
A woman can't earn a single cent
without relying on a man?

171
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,910
That's the biggest joke of this era.

172
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,404
But even if I explain it to you,
you won't understand.

173
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,670
Come on, give it back.

174
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:35,660
If you've decided
to sell the paintings,

175
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:38,137
that means you've completely moved on
from Young Master Lin.

176
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,990
So why spend so much to buy them back?

177
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,380
Are you still holding onto him?

178
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,860
Rong Shukuang,

179
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,470
what exactly are you up to?

180
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,070
Yu,

181
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,350
that will cost you a fee.

182
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,740
Everyone says Rong Shukuang

183
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,950
is a meticulous person.

184
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,310
She marked the same symbol
in multiple places.

185
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:10,020
There must be a deeper meaning.

186
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,660
Could she have been
secretly recording clues?

187
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,950
They've really cut ties.

188
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,950
After this,

189
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,260
we'll have one less obstacle in our way.

190
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,110
But Young Master's men
are still guarding the Hidden Pavilion.

191
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,710
I can't make a move yet.

192
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,470
The more they tighten security,
the more likely something is inside.

193
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,110
No matter what, you have to go.

194
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,110
As for the guards,

195
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,350
I'll give you their shift change times.

196
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,190
So getting in will be easy.

197
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,140
Young Lady Lin,
you're always so thorough.

198
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,370
(Rivaling Tycoons in History)

199
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,190
Finally, you're here.

200
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,590
You really enjoy sneaky business,
don't you?

201
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,740
If you surrender now,

202
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,310
you might still have a way out.

203
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,950
You...

204
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,430
If we didn't stage all this,

205
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,950
do you think we can lure you in?

206
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,070
There's a traitor in the manor.

207
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,915
And that person is someone close to me.

208
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,590
Yuchi Manor has indeed been
unsettled lately.

209
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,110
But the only outsider is Yan Shao.

210
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,590
It can't be him.

211
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:52,182
These illustrations were drawn

212
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,020
before Shen Zuitian captured me.

213
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,230
The markings

214
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,500
were added later on purpose.

215
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,710
I believe that even back then,

216
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,500
I suspected

217
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,350
there was a Ghost Valley Sect spy
inside the manor.

218
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,590
So I secretly investigated

219
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,140
while leaving these marks.

220
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,350
Each marked location

221
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,190
is where I suspected
the spy had appeared.

222
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,470
At that time...

223
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,350
Yan Shao hadn't even arrived
at the manor yet.

224
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,140
You're smart, Young Master Lin.

225
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,740
My father told me

226
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,430
Yan Shao is trustworthy.

227
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,140
Since Master Lin believes in me,

228
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,660
I'm willing to play along
with your setup

229
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,048
to dig out the real traitor hiding
in the shadows.

230
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,660
At the same time, I'll help you see

231
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,190
the true nature of those

232
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,070
in Yuchi Manor.

233
00:13:39,782 --> 00:13:41,782
Then I'll be counting on you, Yan Shao.

234
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,330
(Thank you for visiting)

235
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,230
Well?

236
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,230
How's my writing?

237
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,950
Surprised?

238
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,982
Take him down!

239
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:35,950
Liu An?

240
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,740
Liu An, huh?

241
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,260
I've suspected you for a long time.

242
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,230
Who ordered you

243
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,430
to betray Yuchi Manor?

244
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,140
Just kill me already.

245
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,140
No need for all this nonsense.

246
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,230
Well, at least you've got some backbone.

247
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,020
You want to die?

248
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,430
I won't give you that chance.

249
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,470
Take her away

250
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,893
and interrogate her properly.

251
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,780
What happened here?

252
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,226
What did she do?

253
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,310
Don't hurt her!

254
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,660
Young Lady Lin treats you well.

255
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,350
You bear to hurt her?

256
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,350
Don't come any closer!

257
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,160
Don't hurt her.

258
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:40,715
Young Lady Lin, don't worry.

259
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,830
We will save you.

260
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:47,830
Let her go!

261
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,900
Wanci!

262
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,540
After her!

263
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,380
Are you hurt?

264
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,590
Are you all right?

265
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,020
I'm all right.

266
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:13,830
Get some rest early.

267
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,260
What?

268
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,260
Are you still thinking about it?

269
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,660
About what?

270
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,230
Young Lady Lin in your arms,
soft and warm.

271
00:16:22,293 --> 00:16:23,760
You must have enjoyed that, right?

272
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:24,540
No, I wasn't.

273
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,310
Of course, you did!

274
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,990
You were obviously overjoyed.

275
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,448
So stop pretending to be all serious.

276
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,830
Keep your voice down.

277
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,780
I'm not lying to you about this.

278
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,660
But what if one day I do lie to you?

279
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,950
And what if I lie to you first?

280
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,950
Forget it.

281
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,950
Everyone has their own secrets.

282
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,430
What a shame.

283
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,230
Liu An got away this time.

284
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,190
The person behind her

285
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,100
is probably back in hiding.

286
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,137
Ghost Valley Sect
won't give up that easily.

287
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:09,060
So they'll be back.

288
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,448
We might as well take our time
and play along.

289
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,260
So no rush.

290
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,500
Uh... Your face...

291
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:21,950
This side.

292
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,780
Not there.

293
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,060
(Oh, no.)

294
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,430
(Why is my heart racing again?)

295
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,190
(Rong Shukuang, pull yourself together.)

296
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,670
(Stop being so obsessed.)

297
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:56,582
You used red flower juice
to fake bloodstains

298
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:57,870
and trick Liu An.

299
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,260
Who taught you that?

300
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,710
Do I need to be taught?

301
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,500
That's how it's done in storybooks.

302
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,340
As for this contract,

303
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,910
I only made it up to mess with you.

304
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,160
It doesn't mean anything.

305
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,990
So why bother returning it to me?

306
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:23,780
Keep it.

307
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,990
So, what are we now?

308
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,780
Young Lady and a guard,

309
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,870
or Master and disciple?

310
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,390
Up to you.

311
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,740
Gu Long once said

312
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,710
that life has two purposes.

313
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,820
One is to burn,

314
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,580
and the other is to watch others burn.

315
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Which do you choose?

316
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,190
I'll burn

317
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,340
so you don't have to.

318
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,300
Shaoci?

319
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,020
Have you not slept
or did you wake up early?

320
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,293
We wake up at the Yin hour
to train since childhood.

321
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,271
It has been a habit for years
and never changed.

322
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,300
That early?

323
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,710
No wonder martial artists

324
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,580
have such strong willpower
and endure what ordinary people cannot.

325
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,430
But every time I wake up,

326
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:51,826
I see you practicing sword techniques
in the courtyard.

327
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,820
I've always wanted to ask.

328
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,670
What time do you actually wake up?

329
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,710
Nowadays, I often sleep
until the sun is high in the sky.

330
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,990
I guess you'll never

331
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,870
have the chance to know the answer.

332
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,839
When we were kids,
I always hoped you'd be a little lazier.

333
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,510
Then I wouldn't have
to push myself so hard

334
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:09,337
to get stronger.

335
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,470
Why?

336
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,982
I'm the Young Master of Yuchi Manor.

337
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,026
If my martial arts weren't
as good as my sister's,

338
00:20:15,093 --> 00:20:16,426
wouldn't that be embarrassing?

339
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,430
Seems like no matter the era,

340
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,870
strong women
always make men feel pressured.

341
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,870
I think back then,

342
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,150
I just wanted to impress you.

343
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:33,020
But working so hard

344
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,820
backfired.

345
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,426
I must've left a bad impression instead.

346
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,230
If you hadn't been so strong back then,

347
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,990
maybe

348
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,820
I would've seen you as a girl sooner.

349
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,020
I'm going to check
if my master is awake.

350
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,230
Otherwise,
he'll scold me for being lazy again.

351
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,870
Wait. I know you trust Yan Shao.

352
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,500
Capturing the traitor proves
that he is upright

353
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,671
and honorable,
always standing up for justice.

354
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
But that doesn't mean

355
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,630
you truly understand him.

356
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,580
I understand.

357
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,093
After losing your family
when you were a child,

358
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,910
you came to Yuchi Manor knowing nothing

359
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,990
except your own name.

360
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,150
Back then, I secretly vowed

361
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,500
to treat you like my own sister.

362
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,540
Because of our years together,

363
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,260
I assure you

364
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,780
that I have no grudge against Yan Shao.

365
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,870
I just don't want his presence

366
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,870
to bring trouble to you.

367
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:41,404
I understand.

368
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,670
Then, I'll go practice now.

369
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,340
Go.

370
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,740
Cosmic Shift.

371
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:01,910
Is that what I taught you?

372
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,430
Isn't this the move?

373
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,020
Not enough power.

374
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,820
Again.

375
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,190
Can't you at least give me a hint?

376
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,500
Don't hit me!

377
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,630
Don't hit me!

378
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,910
I just pointed...

379
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,630
I mean, what is this?

380
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,382
Gathering internal energy
at your fingertips

381
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:37,019
to release sword energy from a distance.

382
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,470
It's Flowing Cloud Finger,
able to injure foes from a distance.

383
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:40,190
That powerful?

384
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,910
Sounds like that Six-Meridian Sword.

385
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,604
The whatever Finger move...

386
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,670
Uh...

387
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,630
Why can't I do it now?

388
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,710
Does it only work
in life-or-death situations?

389
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,060
What if you can't pull it off
in a real crisis?

390
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,780
Maybe you should give me some pressure?

391
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,950
Like ambushing me at night or something.

392
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:02,893
What do you mean?

393
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,990
What were you thinking?

394
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,100
I meant a real sneak attack.

395
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,300
Flowing Cloud Finger...

396
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,540
See? It still didn't work.

397
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,870
Again.

398
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,150
Who exactly are you?

399
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,150
I really hope you're the last person

400
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,190
to ask me that.

401
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:01,950
Knowing my identity

402
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,500
won't do you any good.

403
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,950
But you want to know
who I really am too.

404
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,100
We're the same in that way.

405
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:14,990
No.

406
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,100
You and I are nothing alike.

407
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,870
I don't risk my life for others,

408
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,190
especially

409
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,780
not for the man who killed my father.

410
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,300
Misty Moon Village.

411
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,100
Your real name is Liu Yue.

412
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,515
(Misty Moon Village)
My precious treasure!

413
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,910
Ah! You lost!

414
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,419
All right. You can all go and hide now.

415
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,448
I'll come find you later.

416
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,870
Hurry.

417
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,870
One, two, three, four,

418
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,540
five,

419
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,820
six...

420
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,780
Someone's attacking the village! Run!

421
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,390
Nine,

422
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,820
ten,

423
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,340
eleven...

424
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,300
Run.

425
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,950
Run for your lives!

426
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,630
Here.

427
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,115
Let's escape into the forest
behind the village.

428
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
No matter what happens,

429
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:43,004
remember not to look back.

430
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,910
Don't you remember

431
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,100
the ones
who massacred Misty Moon Village

432
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,470
were those from the Ghost Valley Sect?

433
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,230
Father!

434
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,780
That can't be.

435
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,950
That's impossible.

436
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,470
Ghost Valley Sect murdered your family.

437
00:26:28,848 --> 00:26:31,160
Yet you still want to acknowledge
your enemy as your father

438
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,540
and help them wipe out Yuchi Manor?

439
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,390
That can't be. It can't be!

440
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,910
You're lying to me.

441
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,390
I won't believe you.

442
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,100
It was all the Fang Family's fault.

443
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,820
Because of them,

444
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,540
the Misty Moon Village was massacred.

445
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,721
(Young Liu An)

446
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:55,485
Do you know

447
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,230
everything happened because of her?

448
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,710
I'm taking you back to Yuchi Manor.

449
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,340
From now on,

450
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,670
forget Misty Moon Village.

451
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,100
Your name

452
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,990
is no longer Fang Yi.

453
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:18,537
Then what should my name be?

454
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,470
From now on,

455
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,870
you are Rong Shukuang.

456
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,780
Rong Shukuang.

457
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,100
Remember that.

458
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,580
Let's go.

459
00:27:34,982 --> 00:27:36,760
The people of Misty Moon Village
had sworn

460
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,300
to protect the Fang Family.

461
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,390
It was their duty.

462
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,580
I don't know what duty or purpose means.

463
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,190
All of them were dead!

464
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,540
But why is the Fang Family's
daughter still alive?

465
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,190
This silver locket belonged
to your sister.

466
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,404
Your father held onto it tightly
even as he died.

467
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,630
You and she are both victims.

468
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,500
Deep down, you know exactly

469
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,060
who killed your family.

470
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,540
Enough talking! Just stop it!

471
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,740
Yue...

472
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,540
You are...

473
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,190
If you weren't blinded by hatred,

474
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,630
wouldn't you already know who I am?

475
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:44,710
If everyone in Misty Moon Village
was dead,

476
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:47,093
who else could possibly know
your real name?

477
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:57,060
Palm or back of the hand,
they're all part of the same body.

478
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,230
You lost!

479
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,190
Two,

480
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,020
three!

481
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,340
You are Yan Wuying,
the one Su Shiyu took in.

482
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,115
You're here for Rong Shukuang,
aren't you?

483
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,740
What poison

484
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,820
did you use on her?

485
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,430
Where did you get it?

486
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,910
Where's the antidote?

487
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,630
There is no cure.

488
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,820
Rong Shukuang will die
from it sooner or later.

489
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,950
Yan Shao.

490
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,470
Even if you give everything you've got,

491
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,870
you still won't be able to save her.

492
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,100
Tell me.

493
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:40,950
What poison did you use on her?

494
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,740
It's the Crimson Lotus Heart.

495
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,950
The Crimson Lotus Heart
was Su Shiyu's own creation.

496
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,260
And now, it's been used on her daughter.

497
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:54,540
She was dead.

498
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,990
No one in this world can cure
the Crimson Lotus Heart.

499
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,300
As long as I'm here,

500
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,100
she won't die.
