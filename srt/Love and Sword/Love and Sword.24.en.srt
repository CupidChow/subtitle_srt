17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 24=

19
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,090
Leader Chu. Master Lin.

20
00:01:48,715 --> 00:01:50,780
No doubt Jiang Ruhai is guilty
of countless crimes.

21
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,140
But he's my man,

22
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:55,090
and now that his legs are crippled,

23
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:57,420
he's no longer a threat
to the martial world.

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,220
- Chanyi...
- Could you spare his life

25
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,500
for my sake?

26
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:01,610
Chanyi.

27
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,020
Believe me.

28
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,970
I will never betray you in this life.

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,610
Once you obtain the treasure,

30
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,170
the entire martial world
will be at your command, Chanyi!

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,820
Don't you understand?

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,420
My sister sacrificed her reputation

33
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,980
and everything she had to protect you.

34
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,580
And yet all you do is use her
and manipulate her!

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,610
She gave you her heart in vain!

36
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,100
Alliance Leader Tang.

37
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,260
You may take him away.

38
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:28,848
But if he ever shows his face
in the martial world again,

39
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,580
the Six Great Sects
may not show him mercy.

40
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,890
Thank you for understanding, Leader Chu.

41
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,450
I am unfit

42
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,890
to lead the martial world after all.

43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,300
I fear that responsibility
will have to fall upon Master Lin.

44
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,700
Does that sound acceptable?

45
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,980
Many thanks to everyone.

46
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,860
I will not fail you.

47
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,170
Young Lady Lin.

48
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,540
I apologize
for summoning you so abruptly,

49
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,160
but it is better for you to be here

50
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,700
for what is about to happen.

51
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,930
Before everyone arrived at Mount Moye,

52
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,039
Jiang Ruhai incited Head Tang

53
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,910
to compete for the position
of alliance leader,

54
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,860
allied with Madam Xing,

55
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,700
and then went to Seven-Star Hall

56
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,730
to murder his own uncle, Chief Jiang.

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,580
Moreover, the supposed antidote

58
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,293
for the Head of the Yu family
was actually Heart Devourer,

59
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,204
a highly addictive poison
that erodes the mind.

60
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,260
You and Mr. Jiang

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,490
were behind all of these,
right, Young Lady Lin?

62
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,380
Wanci.

63
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,330
Is what Leader Chu said true?

64
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,540
Head Tang had already revealed to me

65
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,580
the schemes
of Young Lady Lin and Mr. Jiang.

66
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,380
Wanci.

67
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,820
How could you do such things?

68
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,290
And why shouldn't I?

69
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,090
In the eyes of all,
Young Lady Lin

70
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,290
is nothing more

71
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,530
than a frail, sickly girl.

72
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,620
And yet, this very same girl
has done so many wicked things.

73
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,020
Isn't that amusing?

74
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,620
Leave none alive. Kill them!

75
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:11,404
The Ghost Valley Sect is attacking us.

76
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,271
Take our people to intercept them.

77
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,290
Yes.

78
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,970
Disciples of Tiangang, to battle!

79
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,850
Leader Chu, what is happening?

80
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,330
Everyone, remain calm.

81
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,380
Since there is no further dispute,

82
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,700
I will now destroy the treasure keys

83
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,850
in front of all the sects,

84
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,330
so the martial world may know peace
from this day forward.

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,380
The Fuxian treasure
was left behind by the Fang family.

86
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:39,426
Its fate should be decided
by the Fang family's descendants.

87
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,060
Wouldn't you agree, Shukuang?

88
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,330
Young Lady Rong Shukuang of Yuchi Manor,

89
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,650
was a Fang by birth.

90
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:51,471
She is the sole surviving heir
of the Fang family.

91
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:53,226
She and I have discussed this matter.

92
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,260
We have already made our decision.

93
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:11,820
I disagree with destroying the keys.

94
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:14,850
There is something in the treasure
that I must obtain.

95
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,450
The keys cannot be destroyed.

96
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,970
You promised me

97
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,500
that we would never keep secrets
from each other.

98
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,620
Only by unlocking the treasure vault

99
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,210
can the cure
for Crimson Lotus Heart be found.

100
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,620
That is the only way

101
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,260
to save Yan Shao.

102
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,620
Think carefully.

103
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,850
Leader Chu, Shukuang wants
to open the treasure vault

104
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,210
for the one she cares about the most.

105
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,580
You are a broad-minded man.

106
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,290
Surely, you wouldn't mind?

107
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,090
Young Lady Lin.

108
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,620
Mind your tongue.

109
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,850
My wife's reputation is not for you

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,770
to slander!

111
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,530
Shukuang's heart was never yours.

112
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,410
Shukuang, am I wrong?

113
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:09,890
No.

114
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,560
You are mistaken.

115
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,580
Tianyao...

116
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,500
Yan Shao!

117
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,330
Chu Tianyao is Yan Shao!

118
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,090
I knew I was right.

119
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,140
They are the same person.

120
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:45,020
Shukuang wouldn't have agreed
to marry him so willingly otherwise.

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,620
So,

122
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,820
the man you were meant to marry
is Yan Shao!

123
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,850
Yes.

124
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,770
Yan Shao

125
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,500
is Chu Tianyao.

126
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:01,700
The only way to save your life

127
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,770
is by finding the elixir
among the treasure!

128
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,290
Enough, Wanci!

129
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,260
Take your sister away. Now!

130
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:10,693
- Rong Shukuang!
- Wanci!

131
00:08:10,715 --> 00:08:12,740
Do you believe Yan Shao
genuinely loves you?

132
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,290
Maybe he has other motives!

133
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,290
Young Master Lin.

134
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,060
Let Young Lady Lin speak her mind.

135
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,740
Let go of me!

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,380
Rong Shukuang.

137
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,315
Why do you think your adoptive father,
who doted on you for years,

138
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,970
saved you back then?

139
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,170
If he hadn't wronged the Fang family,

140
00:08:32,404 --> 00:08:33,980
why would he try to atone for his sins

141
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,170
by taking you back
to Yuchi Manor and raising you?

142
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,020
Father has raised me for years

143
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,100
and treated me as his own daughter.

144
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,570
You are slandering him.

145
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,500
He did that because he was guilty!

146
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,530
Father,

147
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,410
can you really say

148
00:08:48,471 --> 00:08:50,915
you had no hidden motives
when you saved her back then?

149
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,860
Misty Moon Village was isolated

150
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,410
from the outside world for years.

151
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,340
How did the Ghost Valley Sect

152
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,740
suddenly discover its location,

153
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,220
and why was it suddenly attacked?

154
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:04,204
Only those who were there

155
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,620
knew what really happened.

156
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,560
If there was any misunderstanding,

157
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:10,315
now is the time to clear it up.

158
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:15,740
Father...

159
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,530
I heard everything Mother told you

160
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,890
before she died.

161
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,220
I wronged Shiyu and the Fang family.

162
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,570
I should never have
betrayed Misty Moon Village

163
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,690
to get the medicine to save Wanci.

164
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,930
It led to their tragic fate.

165
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:38,650
After you sent out the message

166
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,980
and retrieved the cure for Wanci,

167
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:43,893
I immediately informed
Martial Brother Chu,

168
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,460
and rushed to Misty Moon Village.

169
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,020
But I was too late.

170
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,220
Thankfully,

171
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,380
I found Shukuang.

172
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I leave Shukuang

173
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,380
in your care.

174
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,740
Treat her as your own.

175
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,340
Do not neglect her.

176
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,570
At last, I can go see Shiyu

177
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,340
and beg for her forgiveness.

178
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,810
Inside that treasure vault

179
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,690
lies what the martial world fights over.

180
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,500
Perhaps wealth that rivals kingdoms,

181
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,340
perhaps peerless
martial arts techniques,

182
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,170
perhaps miraculous elixirs...

183
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,460
It is enough to stir greed in hearts.

184
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,860
If the other half of the key is found,

185
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,530
then destroy them all.

186
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:31,980
All right.

187
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,382
Li.

188
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Li!

189
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,620
My mother suffered in torment

190
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,260
and worry,

191
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,890
and in the end,
she passed away from her illness.

192
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,570
But you...

193
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:55,570
You couldn't bear to give up
your position as Master of Yuchi Manor.

194
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,620
To appease your own conscience,

195
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,260
you brought Rong Shukuang back
to Yuchi Manor.

196
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,380
Rong Shukuang.

197
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,530
Do you really think

198
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,290
your father loves you?

199
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,140
Never!

200
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,050
He has only ever cared about Yuchi Manor

201
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,170
and his position as Master!

202
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,140
Nonsense!

203
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,620
Wanci, you've lost your mind!

204
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,810
And your so-called brother.

205
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:16,770
He publicly rejected your engagement,

206
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,220
humiliating you before the martial world
and making a mockery of you.

207
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,740
Now that you've given your heart
to someone else,

208
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,860
he suddenly acts like he loves you

209
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,500
but cannot have you.

210
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,890
He never truly loved you.

211
00:11:29,137 --> 00:11:30,570
He just can't stand the thought

212
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,760
of a woman who once loved him

213
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,770
belonging to another man!

214
00:11:32,804 --> 00:11:33,410
Shut up!

215
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,690
Now, look at Yan Shao.

216
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,690
You think he goes

217
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,740
to the ends of the world for you?

218
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,290
Yet he still hides things from you!

219
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,860
He is now the Leader of Tiangang.

220
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,340
He changed his name
to stay by your side.

221
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:50,770
Tell me.

222
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,810
Does he want the treasure,

223
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,140
or does he want you?

224
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:58,770
Rong Shukuang.

225
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,380
Open your eyes.

226
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,100
Your so-called family and friends

227
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,770
have only ever used you.

228
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,810
These so-called righteous sects

229
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,048
are nothing but hypocrites

230
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:19,710
who covet the treasure and spout
empty words to justify their greed.

231
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,690
Do you still trust them?

232
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,340
I know

233
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,890
you are filled with hatred right now.

234
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,740
You want to kill.
You want to draw blood.

235
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,220
Do it.

236
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,140
Get your revenge. Kill them!

237
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,140
Rong Shukuang.

238
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:40,140
You have been a victim all your life.

239
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,220
Orphaned as a child,

240
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,050
raised in someone else's home,
always alone, always struggling.

241
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,340
No matter what you do,

242
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,890
it is what they owe you!

243
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,890
Lin Wanci.

244
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,930
I don't know whether they wronged me.

245
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,050
But I know for certain

246
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,890
that you did.

247
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:31,570
You're the one I should kill the most,

248
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,140
aren't you?

249
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,050
Fine.

250
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,170
Then kill me. Do it.

251
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,340
Kill me, Rong Shukuang!

252
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,020
You don't have the guts to do it.

253
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,382
The world says you walk with frost
on your lips and tread on snow,

254
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:44,537
you stand as a noble presence
with peerless blades.

255
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,460
What gives you such a reputation?

256
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,500
Why do they love you, respect you,

257
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,890
follow you, and trust you?

258
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,020
You should be like me.

259
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,860
Cruel and merciless, drowning in blood.

260
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,020
Harboring only hatred in your heart!

261
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:00,410
Kill me, Rong Shukuang.

262
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,810
Crimson Lotus Heart poison
I gave you

263
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,770
was originally created by your mother.

264
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,170
Before my mother died,

265
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,020
she passed down the prescription to me.

266
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,020
You'll only be free

267
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,740
from your hatred if you kill me.

268
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,050
Kill me!

269
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,690
Lin Wanci.

270
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:26,650
I will not live my life as you have,

271
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,340
consumed by jealousy and hatred.

272
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,530
She wove her own web of pain,

273
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,860
and now she wants to drag you into it,

274
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,410
trapping you in a life of hatred.

275
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,890
Lin Wanci,

276
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,220
you know nothing.

277
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,220
You have no idea

278
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,140
who Rong Shukuang truly is.

279
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,740
From the start,

280
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,810
everything you've done
has been a mistake.

281
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,340
You have ruined
the reputation of Yuchi Manor

282
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,220
and yourself.

283
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,410
I am to blame

284
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,020
for Wanci's misdoings.

285
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,460
I, too, bear responsibility

286
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,500
for betraying Misty Moon Village.

287
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,740
My wife, Rong Li, and Shukuang's mother

288
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,810
were once martial sisters.

289
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,620
When Wanci was born,
she was weak and frail,

290
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,690
barely clinging to life.

291
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,290
The Ghost Valley Sect offered
a miracle elixir in exchange.

292
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,810
In desperation to save our daughter,

293
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,100
Rong Li revealed the location

294
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,860
of Misty Moon Village.

295
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,980
That is what led to its massacre,

296
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,410
to Shiyu's tragic death.

297
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,340
And Rong Li...

298
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,980
overcome with guilt, soon followed.

299
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,980
Father...

300
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,410
I owe this debt,

301
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,460
and I'll have to settle it eventually.

302
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,860
Now,

303
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,620
I've lost all dignity and honor.

304
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:06,980
Shaoci.

305
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,810
You have never let me down.

306
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,650
I entrust Yuchi Manor

307
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,930
to you.

308
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,890
Shukuang.

309
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
The Lin family owes you

310
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,570
far too much.

311
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,570
Stop him!

312
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,020
Father!

313
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:33,650
Father!

314
00:16:35,671 --> 00:16:36,740
- Father!
- Master!

315
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,380
Father!

316
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:38,448
- Father!
- Master!

317
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,460
Father!

318
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,650
Shukuang...

319
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,620
Father.

320
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,380
You...

321
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,140
Father.

322
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,620
Father!

323
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,340
Father!

324
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,020
Leader Chu!

325
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,420
They've made their way up the mountain!

326
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,610
We are outnumbered.

327
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,330
We cannot hold them back!

328
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,290
Yan Shao.

329
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,290
No.

330
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,180
Yan Shao won't last much longer.

331
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,700
We must get to the Fuxian treasure

332
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,260
and find a way to save him.

333
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,740
Take Yan Shao and leave first.

334
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,900
- I'll stay behind and stall them.
- Shukuang!

335
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,810
Shukuang!

336
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:29,050
Shukuang, we'll handle this.

337
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,740
Go!

338
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,260
Come on, Yan Shao!

339
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,330
Let's go!

340
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,500
Come on!

341
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,226
Pure Sword Sect, prepare for battle!

342
00:17:55,937 --> 00:17:56,980
Leader Shen.

343
00:17:57,048 --> 00:17:58,260
Rong Shukuang's carriage headed

344
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,130
in that direction.

345
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,700
You're quick to arrive.

346
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,260
You left signs
and a carriage along the way.

347
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,700
Wasn't that for me to join you?

348
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:25,182
This is no longer your concern.

349
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,220
Young Lady Lin, take care of yourself.

350
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,900
Let's go.

351
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,900
Without the trap mechanism map,

352
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,700
do you really think

353
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,220
you can enter safely, Leader Shen?

354
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,660
Where is the map?

355
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,740
If I hand over the map,

356
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,770
you wouldn't

357
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,290
let me live, would you?

358
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,570
Where is it?

359
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,330
Speak!

360
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,180
I burned it.

361
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,460
But I have memorized it all.

362
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,180
Help Young Lady Lin into the carriage.

363
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,220
We have no time to lose.

364
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,290
Shaokuangtian Mansion.

365
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,460
So fate truly comes full circle.

366
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,020
Before Father died,

367
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,220
he told me

368
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,090
the treasure was hidden
in a cave 20 kilometers

369
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,226
east of Misty Moon Village,
behind the mountains.

370
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:17,937
Who'd have thought
it was here all along?

371
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,260
Shen Zuitian schemed endlessly,

372
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,900
yet he never realized
how close we all had been

373
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,940
to the treasure.

374
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
The path ends here.

375
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,020
Be careful.

376
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,610
There used to be

377
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,810
snakes here.

378
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,226
Don't be afraid.

379
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,370
The snake nest?

380
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,180
Over there!

381
00:19:54,337 --> 00:19:55,804
It might be in that direction.

382
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,180
Interesting.

383
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:21,610
What is it?

384
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:24,900
I've been here before.

385
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,370
Be careful.

386
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,420
Take this.

387
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:36,770
Careful.

388
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:43,115
Don't waste your effort. It's Wain.

389
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,810
Tianshu.

390
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:49,900
Tianxuan.

391
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,810
Tianji.

392
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:54,940
Tianquan.

393
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,130
Yuheng.

394
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,370
Kaiyang.

395
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,090
Yaoguang.

396
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,770
Can you keep going?

397
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,530
This way.

398
00:21:35,248 --> 00:21:37,050
I stayed in this cave for a long time.

399
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,980
I never discovered any mechanisms.

400
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,130
How do we use this?

401
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,700
So that's the key.

402
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,290
I'll lead.

403
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:07,090
Come on.

404
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,570
These are records of mining, ceramics,

405
00:23:27,715 --> 00:23:30,500
transportation by boat and cart,
and the art of painting and crafts.

406
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,370
The so-called treasure is actually

407
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,940
a collection of lost knowledge.

408
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,050
No wonder Master Lin, on his deathbed,

409
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,900
entrusted you
with protecting the treasure

410
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,500
for the greater good.

411
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,220
Sadly,

412
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:08,337
even if these texts have been preserved,

413
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,260
many will still struggle
to grasp their meaning,

414
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,471
even after a lifetime of study.

415
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:14,900
Having learned the truth by morning,
one can die content in the evening.

416
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:16,880
Those who dream
of controlling this treasure,

417
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,810
thinking it will make them
richer than nations,

418
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,050
or help them dominate

419
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,660
the martial world,

420
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,980
will be sorely disappointed.

421
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,260
They cannot comprehend

422
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,660
that the true treasures of the ages

423
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,810
are these books,

424
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,500
which hold the wisdom of the ancients.

425
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,290
Feng Ming.

426
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,850
Find the cure first.

427
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,700
Got it.

428
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,610
Hang in there.

429
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,260
There's a passageway here.

430
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,020
So this is where it was.

431
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,700
This place is filled with traps.

432
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:55,220
The path ahead won't be easy.

433
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,570
You go first.

434
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,740
Don't worry. I have the map memorized.

435
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,850
After you, Young Lady Lin.

436
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,290
Even now,

437
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,530
you remain as cautious
as ever, Leader Shen.

438
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,370
As you wish, then.

439
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,130
Come check this out!

440
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,700
Look.

441
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,220
This is the second half of
Senior Helian's cultivation technique.

442
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,330
Show yourself, Rong Shukuang!

443
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,500
Focus on practicing it.

444
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:06,093
I'll deal with them.

445
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,660
Feng Ming,

446
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,290
watch over him.

447
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,460
Got it.

448
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,980
You and Yan Shao are truly remarkable.

449
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,026
You actually managed
to unlock the treasure vault.

450
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,500
Rong Shukuang, where is the treasure?

451
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:30,810
The treasure you have been
desperately seeking

452
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,570
is right before your eyes.

453
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,660
Pottery? Transportation?
Grain refining? Salt production?

454
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,940
This is no treasure!

455
00:26:50,315 --> 00:26:52,782
Rong Shukuang,
do you take me for a child?

456
00:26:52,826 --> 00:26:54,130
Where is the martial arts manual?

457
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,370
My father told me

458
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,530
our ancestor left
a secret technique in the treasure.

459
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,850
Then you and your father
have wasted your efforts.

460
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,980
Only she knows

461
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:04,260
where the true treasure is!

462
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,220
Oh, Lin Wanci.

463
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,960
I thought that,
after scheming for so many years,

464
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,420
you'd be an exceptionally
intelligent woman.

465
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,130
I overestimated you.

466
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,420
You have disappointed me.

467
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,290
The true treasure is right
before your eyes,

468
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,293
yet you are too blinded
by greed to recognize it.

469
00:27:24,182 --> 00:27:26,248
If you do not hand over
the martial arts manual,

470
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,700
you will die, and so will he.

471
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,290
Not as long

472
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,220
as I'm here.

473
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,770
Kill them!

474
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,770
Yan Shao!

475
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,610
The woman you love
is on the verge of death!

476
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,020
Still won't come out?

477
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,330
Didn't you say
the Crimson Lotus Heart poison

478
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,770
had already taken effect?

479
00:29:43,267 --> 00:29:45,570
I saw it myself at Mount Moye!

480
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,260
He must have found

481
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,220
a martial arts secret technique

482
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,420
or an extremely rare elixir!

483
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,530
How else could he have
recovered so fast?

484
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,260
Shen Zuitian!

485
00:30:01,337 --> 00:30:02,850
Aren't you supposed to be powerful?

486
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,660
Kill him, you useless fool!

487
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,090
If it weren't for the treasure map,

488
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,810
I would have killed you long ago!

489
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,900
Is your poison cured?

490
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,370
It is.

491
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,050
All my life,

492
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,530
my duty has been to protect you.

493
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,130
To keep you safe.

494
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,770
I...

495
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,260
Has the Crimson Lotus Heart

496
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,050
truly been cured?

497
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,330
Completely.

498
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,050
Chu Tianyao!

499
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,610
Surrender the martial arts manual,

500
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,940
or you'll all be left unburied!

501
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,220
Shen Zuitian,

502
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:19,050
years ago, you spared our lives.
I've given you multiple chances

503
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,130
to live because of it.

504
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:24,050
But you continue to hunt us down,
refusing to let us be.

505
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,940
Now that you know the secrets
of this place's mechanisms,

506
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,260
I won't let them fall
into Ghost Valley Sect's hands.

507
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,810
I will not aid the wicked.

I'm sorry.

522
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,560
I've neglected you all this time.

523
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,770
Shaoci...

524
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,500
Save your breath.

525
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,050
I don't need anyone's pity.

526
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,660
After I die,

527
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,850
don't return my remains to Yuchi Manor.

528
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,260
Throw me into the river or the sea.

529
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,900
I don't care.

530
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,500
As long as I can be free.

531
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,180
The fortune teller was right.

532
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:33,370
In the end, it's all just an illusion.

533
00:33:33,493 --> 00:33:35,760
Like the moon in a mirror,
or flowers on the water.

534
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,370
In this life,

535
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,180
I never got anything

536
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,500
I truly wanted...

537
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,260
Yan Shao.

538
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,226
Rong Shukuang.

539
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,210
Yan Shao!

540
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,980
Yan Shao! What's wrong?

541
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,300
What's happening to you?

542
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:32,648
Didn't you say you were cured?

543
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:34,600
Didn't you say
Crimson Lotus Heart poison was gone?

544
00:34:34,648 --> 00:34:35,648
Why is this happening?

545
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,460
It's the Revival Acupuncture.

546
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,730
You lied to me!

547
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,530
Why did you lie to me?

548
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,090
You promised

549
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,300
we would never hide things

550
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,980
from each other again!

551
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,820
Why did you lie to me?

552
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,730
If I hadn't deceived Shen Zuitian,

553
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,250
then even if the two of us
joined forces,

554
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,271
we still wouldn't have been
a match for him.

555
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,650
Young Master Lin.

556
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,570
You heard Master Lin's

557
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,340
dying words,

558
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,820
didn't you?

559
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:30,780
Father wanted us to protect the treasure

560
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,530
and retrieve it

561
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,380
for the good of the world.

562
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,170
Good.

563
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,820
From now on,

564
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,410
this responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

565
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,170
Leave it to me.

566
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,340
You are all here.

567
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,650
I can rest easy.

568
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,530
No...

569
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,300
Don't go, please...

570
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,610
Stay...

571
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,730
No!

572
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,730
You can't leave!

573
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,250
You can't...

574
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,090
Leader Chu and Miss Rong

575
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,250
were true heroes.

576
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,730
No...

577
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,090
Yan Shao?

578
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,820
Yan Shao!

579
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,130
Yan Shao!

580
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,650
Be quiet.

581
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,820
I'm tired.

582
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,940
I want to sleep.

583
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,050
Liar!

584
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,980
You lied to me!

585
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,820
You lied to me...

586
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,650
(Disciple Rong Shukuang
humbly kneels in respect.)

587
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,980
(Please take me as your disciple.)

588
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,050
(I promised your mother)

589
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,300
(I would protect you for life.)

590
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,530
(Am I a burden to you?)

591
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,380
(Do you just want me)

592
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,820
(to disappear from your sight?)

593
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,170
(No.)

594
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,300
(You say one thing but mean another.)

595
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,300
(No.)

596
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,570
(I do it willingly.)

597
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:58,500
(What if the day comes
that I can no longer protect you?)

598
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,780
(That's fine.)

599
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,610
(I won't need you to protect me.)

600
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,570
I'll be the one to protect you.

601
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:44,200
(Chu Tianyao)

602
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,448
Chu Tianyao...

603
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,170
Do you remember Rong Shukuang?

604
00:39:00,182 --> 00:39:01,582
(Why are we back in the desert?)

605
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:03,893
(This is where Yan Shao
and Rong Shukuang)

606
00:39:03,937 --> 00:39:04,860
(first met.)

607
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:07,860
(Why do we have)

608
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,210
(their memories?)

609
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,250
(Because)

610
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:11,250
(they once did)

611
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,610
(something extraordinary.)

612
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,020
(Those books on mining,)

613
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:16,293
(metallurgy, shipbuilding, and pottery)

614
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,610
(shouldn't be hoarded for personal gain)

615
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:20,980
(nor should they be buried
beneath the sands.)

616
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,860
(Perhaps)

617
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,210
(that white jade wanted)

618
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,250
(to share their story with us.)

619
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:58,130
Are you sure this is our wedding photo?

620
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,420
No, it's Yan Shao and Rong Shukuang's.

621
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,860
I can't. My back is sore.

622
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:03,820
My hands hurt.

623
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,050
Let's take a break.

624
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:05,730
Come.

625
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,340
Hold still!

626
00:40:08,582 --> 00:40:09,610

I got sand in my eye.

630
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:15,940

631
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:17,210

What do you think
defines the martial world?

Blades, wine, loyalty,
