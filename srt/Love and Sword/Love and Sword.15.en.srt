(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 15=

19
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,250
Don't...

20
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,920
Leader Shen,

21
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,120
shouldn't you take the hint

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
and step out for a bit?

23
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,170
I'm not leaving.

24
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,280
Why not?

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,182
There's an agreement
in Shaokuangtian Mansion.

26
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,890
If I leave, you might kill me.

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,810
Just pretend I'm not here.

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,680
I swear,

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,530
ever since you gave me this whistle,

30
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,930
I've carried it with me.

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,090
They took it from me

32
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,330
when they captured me.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,490
Liar.

34
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,280
You still dare to deny it?

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,426
You searched her body?

36
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,370
It wasn't me. It was Hua Qi.

37
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,120
See? They took it from me.

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,440
Lin Wanci

39
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,120
had the exact same eagle-bone whistle.

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,280
What?

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,600
You gave both of us the same gift?

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,770
You're terrible.

43
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,440
I only gave this whistle to you.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,370
No one else.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,810
So she must've seen it

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,770
and made a copy?

47
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,880
Good.

48
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:48,770
You're finally starting
to use your brain.

49
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,000
I've always had a brain.

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,026
That was because she admires you.

51
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:53,090
Since she can't have you,

52
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,880
she wants to have something
of yours instead.

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,490
Wrong.

54
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,760
When you were being hunted down
by the Wuwang Pavilion,

55
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:58,770
she blew the whistle

56
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,737
to lure me into a trap

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,210
so I had no time to save you guys.

58
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,640
How did you know we were being chased
by the Wuwang Pavilion?

59
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,050
I...

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,330
I...

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,050
Have you been following me all along?

62
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,600
I...

63
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,560
Let's go.

64
00:03:36,648 --> 00:03:38,560
Why are there suddenly so many snakes?

65
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,848
This must've been
a snake cave all along.

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,250
They fear bright flames.

67
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,982
- They must have held back...
- Lie.

68
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Go.

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,782
Before pouncing all at once.

70
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,000
Where is Lie going? Come back!

71
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,970
Leader Shen,

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,210
now that we've left
Shaokuangtian Mansion,

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,560
we should part ways.

74
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,880
Where are you two headed?

75
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:58,048
None of your business.

76
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,120
It's an open path
so just take your own path.

77
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,330
Let's go.

78
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:09,050
I discovered a bamboo house
in the woods yesterday.

79
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:09,810
We'll stay there.

80
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,040
Yan Shao. Yan Shao.

81
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,040
Who said you could follow us?

82
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,826
A distinguished guest has arrived.

83
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,600
Why?

84
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:36,871
Are you not going to welcome me?

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,450
You got poisoned by a snake

86
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,915
and still act like nothing happened.

87
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,720
Even after I injured you, you kept going

88
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,982
without showing weakness.

89
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,570
I have to say I'm impressed.

90
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,970
All right.

91
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,160
You two, that's enough.

92
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,970
Yan Shao, treat his poison first.

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,530
You, help heal Yan Shao.

94
00:04:58,737 --> 00:05:01,560
Since ancient times, the righteous
and the wicked don't go together.

95
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,970
But in desperate times,
a deal can be made.

96
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,450
In any case,

97
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,040
don't let your pride get in the way.

98
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:09,271
Staying alive is important.

99
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,330
All right?

100
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,450
Look!

101
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,920
I built this
automatic bathing mechanism.

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,693
What do you think?

103
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,040
(It'll help me recover faster)

104
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,040
(while I meditate.)

105
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,130
Not bad, huh?

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,400
Don't just stand there.
Hurry up and wash up.

107
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,137
There won't be any water
if the rain stops.

108
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,890
Come on.

109
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,690
The water's still a little cold.

110
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,920
You can try it out first.

111
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,820
I'll improve this issue next time.
Is that okay?

112
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:53,400
Cold is good.
The colder, the better.

113
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,600
I need cold water.

114
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,090
Then go ahead and wash up. I won't look.

115
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,450
I'm leaving.

116
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,090
A young lady trying

117
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,720
to peek at a man bathing, huh?

118
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

119
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,770
I already heard it.

120
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,720
Heard what?

121
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,530
Your thoughts.

122
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,160
You practically said them out loud.

123
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Didn't you hear yourself?

124
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:40,840
That can't be.

125
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,840
You are betrothed

126
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,600
to Tiangang's Leader.

127
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,210
What nonsense are you talking about?

128
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,480
Leader Shen,

129
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,970
are you afraid to slaughter it?

130
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,330
How could that be?

131
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm

132
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,280
just looking for a better angle to cut.

133
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,090
Rong Shukuang,
you won't understand this.

134
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,890
If you're afraid, just say so.

135
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,090
Hand it over.

136
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,560
- I'll do it.
- Just hand it over.

137
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,115
No need.

138
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,840
Give it to me.

139
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,010
I can do it.

140
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,970
Don't run!

141
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,600
My chicken!

142
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,450
Stop right there!

143
00:07:23,293 --> 00:07:23,970
Come here...

144
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,650
What are you guys doing?

145
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,600
Tell me!

146
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,360
Master.

147
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,090
We were chasing the chicken...

148
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,330
I'll go and slaughter the chicken.

149
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:54,480
I'll let you guys liven things up a bit.

150
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,450
Am I the first person to see you bathe?

151
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:05,600
I guess you could say that.

152
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
What do you mean by "guess"?

153
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,650
Normally,
a proper lady would cover her face

154
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,450
and run away at a sight like this.

155
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,890
But you're something else.

156
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,360
A proper lady?

157
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,570
How many proper ladies
have watched you...

158
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,170
You...

159
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,000
The mood is perfect.

160
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,330
Don't you think we should do something?

161
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,810
Catch the chicken!

162
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,520
Catch it!

163
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:57,782
Go and catch the chicken.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,210
Shen Zuitian, I'll get you for this!

165
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,690
So? Is it ready yet?

166
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,050
That smells great.

167
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,880
Sickly one.

168
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,250
- Who are you calling sickly?
- Who are you calling sickly?

169
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,410
I was talking about myself.

170
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,690
What?

171
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,450
Aren't we all a little sickly
at this point?

172
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,720
Well, now the chicken's gone.

173
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:41,820
We'll have to settle
for grilled mushrooms and wine.

174
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:42,970
Shen Zuitian, you've truly

175
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:45,604
changed my perspective on you.

176
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,480
How about we play a drinking game?

177
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,570
I can teach you

178
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
the "Drifting in the Martial World."

179
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:57,330
In the world of martial arts,
who can escape the blade?

180
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,560
Cut you with three strikes.
Cut you with four...

181
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,840
Five strikes.

182
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,000
Truth.

183
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:05,840
What's the question?

184
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,450
Which one would you choose
between Yan Shao and the treasure key?

185
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,450
I'll drink instead.

186
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,330
Yan Shao.

187
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,050
Again!

188
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,330
In the world of martial arts,
who can escape the blade?

189
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,999
- Cut you with one strike.
- Two strikes.

190
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,930
Do you have any secrets?

191
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:30,930
I do.

192
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,520
I don't believe I'll keep losing. Again.

193
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,410
All right.

194
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:36,050
In the world of martial arts,
who can escape the blade?

195
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,210
Cut you with one strike.

196
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,640
Cut you with two strikes.

197
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,290
Leader Shen, tell us

198
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,240
one of your secrets.

199
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,000
I once spared two people

200
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,000
out of mercy.

201
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,210
Yet, I've regretted it ever since.

202
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,170
Come on, it's your turn now.

203
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,720
Hurry up.

204
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,760
Ready? Go!

205
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,480
In the world of martial arts,
who can escape the blade?

206
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,930
Here you go.

207
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:06,315
You wanted to drink, right?

208
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,170
Here, drink up
since you love it so much.

209
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,330
Is that enough?

210
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,930
You sure can hold your liquor.

211
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,240
Again.

212
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,570
Come.

213
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,840
In the world of martial arts,
who can escape the blade?

214
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:35,693
Do you want to keep playing?

215
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,240
Of course.

216
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,760
I still have a lot of questions.

217
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,448
- One strike.
- Four strikes.

218
00:11:42,537 --> 00:11:44,071
- Three...
- Four strikes.

219
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,240
Yan Shao, why did you save me?

220
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,410
It's a long story.

221
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,240
The night is long and I have the time.

222
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:55,520
Leader Shen,

223
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
we met years ago at Misty Moon Village.

224
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,810
That night, you spared my life.

225
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,640
That's why I went easy on you

226
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,410
a few times.

227
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,760
Young Master,

228
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,450
is anybody there?

229
00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:15,360
There's nobody here. Search over there.

230
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,182
Yes, Young Master.

231
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,480
So you were one

232
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,330
of the two children I spared.

233
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,210
I grew up in Misty Moon Village.

234
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:59,410
Your alcohol tolerance is terrible.

235
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,170
Wait a minute.

236
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,050
What is the meaning of this?

237
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,290
Rong Shukuang,
this is as far as I can help you.

238
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,970
I... I...

Don't worry.

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,210
I won't take advantage of you.

Just kill me.

254
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,480
The Crimson Lotus Heart made
my life a living hell.

255
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,640
The Fuxian treasure...

256
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,810
You have to get it back.

257
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,120
Even if I die,

258
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
you must...

259
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,930
You must take back what belongs
to the Shen Family.

260
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,290
The mineral vein map

261
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,840
is hidden in the treasure.

262
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,970
Do you two take me

263
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,840
for a fool?

264
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,570
Drink up.

265
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,760
No cheating.

266
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,610
Drink!

267
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,760
He's talking in his dream.

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,720
He's drunk.

269
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:12,800
Let's go.

270
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,240
My leg has gone numb from sleeping.

271
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,480
You're too strong.

272
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,450
Maybe we should take a break?

273
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,026
We've been on the run all night.

274
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:38,760
He definitely won't catch up now.

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,760
When we left,

276
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,890
he wasn't actually asleep.

277
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,610
How do you know?

278
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,480
He sounded drunk.

279
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,850
But he was actually controlling
his breathing.

280
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
Then why did he let us go?

281
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,080
He's injured
and still has poison in his body.

282
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,410
He didn't dare fight us.

283
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Then...

284
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,970
Then we should hurry.

285
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,320
We were still too late.

286
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,720
Leader Shen left a mark
and he headed that way.

287
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,040
Slow down.

288
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,210
Are you all right?

289
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,520
I'm fine.

290
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,130
Lie's prints go this way,

291
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,080
which means Zuitian
must be in this direction.

292
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,370
Be careful.

293
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,890
Keep looking.

294
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,520
Zuitian should be close.

295
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,720
They have horses.

296
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,240
I know.

297
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,760
Then they'll find the bamboo house

298
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,080
and us soon.

299
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:01,970
I know.

300
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,315
What's the point of saying that?

301
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:04,204
Think of something.

302
00:19:04,271 --> 00:19:05,560
You're usually full of ideas.

303
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,850
As for Tiangang,

304
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,930
it's powerful, right?

305
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,890
Why didn't Tiangang...

306
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,137
Once we get through that forest,

307
00:19:10,137 --> 00:19:11,382
we'll reach the main road.

308
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,890
They're gone.

309
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,930
Zuitian,

310
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,690
are you all right?

311
00:19:39,048 --> 00:19:40,480
Why does it still smell like alcohol?

312
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,650
We had a wild night of drinking

313
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,610
and it was great.

314
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,610
Aren't you going to ask

315
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,480
who I drank with?

316
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,970
Who?

317
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,450
Rong Shukuang and Yan Shao.

318
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,930
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

319
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,080
Where did they go?

320
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
Yan Shao is injured and poisoned.

321
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,560
He won't get far.

322
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,650
We can definitely catch up to them.

323
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,610
Why are you here?

324
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,915
Looking for something.

325
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,080
What?

326
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,040
The betrothal jewelry.

327
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,760
When Hua Qi captured me,

328
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,690
I hid it.

329
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,540
I thought you were not willing
to get married.

330
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,370
That jewelry is expensive.

331
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,604
I couldn't just let Hua Qi take it
for free.

332
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,170
That's a good excuse.

333
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:33,610
Where did you hide it?

334
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,410
I hid it...

335
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,480
This isn't hiding.

336
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:40,071
You're throwing it away.

337
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,560
Forget it.

338
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:42,810
It's just a piece of jewelry.

339
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,540
Mount Moye has plenty of jewelry.
Let's go.

340
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:45,360
Wait.

341
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,715
I'll be honest with you.

342
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,480
It's the treasure key.

343
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,970
Where is that place?

344
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,890
Where exactly did you throw it?

345
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,800
Here.

346
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,800
Right here.

347
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:29,970
Why?

348
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:33,370
I used the sun to mark the spot.

349
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,610
You wouldn't understand if I told you.

350
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,160
It's something important.

351
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,315
Aren't you afraid
I'll steal the treasure?

352
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,240
I am.

353
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,040
But I still trust you.

354
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,370
After all,

355
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,520
you've risked your life helping me.

356
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,370
If I still tried to deceive you,

357
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:07,720
that'd be too ungrateful.

358
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,800
Let's go.

359
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:23,850
Be careful.

360
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:40,960
Didn't you say you were going
to meet up with someone?

361
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,970
What do you like to order?

362
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,450
Beef, sesame flatbread,
and two liang of liquor.

363
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,893
Feng Ming and Fei Wu
already sent Young Lady Lin over

364
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:55,893
and went to find you.

365
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,320
Send them a message.

366
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,210
Tell them to stick to the planned route.

367
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:09,880
(Dockside Tavern)

368
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,850
Your intel exchange spot

369
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,515
is pretty well set up.

370
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:16,471
Of course.

371
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,170
Shukuang. Yan Shao.

372
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,520
You're finally back.

373
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,970
Are you both all right?

374
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,760
Shaoci and Yingluo have been searching
everywhere for you.

375
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,970
I was worried too.

376
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,520
But there wasn't much I could do.

377
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,210
Yan Shao told me

378
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,093
you were also captured
by Wuwang Pavilion.

379
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:32,382
It's a relief you made it out.

380
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,650
I was really useless.

381
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,320
I caused Yan Shao a lot of trouble.

382
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,480
But luckily, he rushed
to save you right away.

383
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:39,760
By the way,

384
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,480
I heard Shen Zuitian fell off

385
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,610
the cliff with you.

386
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,000
He's not dead.

387
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,690
How did you know that?

388
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,930
Because he's been with us
these past few days.

389
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,170
He never left our side.

390
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,930
You've been with Shen Zuitian
this whole time?

391
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,370
We drank, caught fish,

392
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:00,960
and even played games together.

393
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,690
The good and the evil are supposed
to be sworn enemies.

394
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,450
How could you be so close to him?

395
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,610
We had no choice

396
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:08,320
since it was a matter of survival.

397
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,915
Since everything is fine now,

398
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,130
we should set off.

399
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,315
After all, Shukuang's wedding
is the priority.

400
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:15,604
We can't delay it.

401
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,480
Why the rush?

402
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,990
Shouldn't we wait
for Young Master Lin and the others?

403
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:21,226
If we move together as a big group,

404
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,337
we would be an easy target.

405
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,715
So it's not safe.

406
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,450
We should split up

407
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,890
and meet somewhere secure.

408
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
Good idea.

409
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,320
Let's do that.

410
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,720
We've been traveling for days.

411
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,850
Let's at least wait

412
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,240
until Shaoci and the others arrive.

413
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,000
No.

414
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:38,610
Your wedding date is set
and you can't afford to miss it.

415
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,690
Prepare a carriage for us.

416
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,000
All right.

417
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,930
You said

418
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,890
traveling together is too risky.

419
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,560
You should stay behind

420
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,170
and wait for Young Master Lin.

421
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,450
Shukuang, I want to go with you.

422
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,130
At least you'll have company.

423
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,690
Wanci,

424
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:05,520
I know your concerns.

425
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,410
But this journey has been dangerous

426
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,000
and exhausting.

427
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,320
How can I

428
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,970
let you suffer through it too?

429
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,040
Stay here

430
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,480
and wait for Shaoci and the others

431
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,450
and depart with them.

432
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,930
The road ahead is long.

433
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,610
We'll meet again.

434
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Wait for me!

435
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm storing up energy right now.
You wouldn't understand.

436
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,382
How many have you eaten already?

437
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,560
Have we met before?

438
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
No, you never met him.

439
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,210
Young Lady Lin.

440
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,970
You're finally here.

441
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,240
I thought you weren't coming.

442
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,320
You need me.

443
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,915
Of course, I would come.

444
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,520
The road ahead is dangerous.

445
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,080
Be careful.

446
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,480
You too.

447
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,130
Welcome back, Leader Shen.

448
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,170
Go and rest at Wuwang Pavilion
before setting off again.

449
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:06,040
No. I'm going to kill them.

450
00:27:06,115 --> 00:27:07,404
Let's return to Wuwang Pavilion

451
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,280
and treat the Leader's wounds first.

452
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,690
In just a few more days,

453
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,320
we'll reach Mount Moye.

454
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,080
What if we just ran away,

455
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,182
left everything behind,

456
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,800
traveled the world together,
and lived freely?

457
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,240
Wouldn't that be nice?

458
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:33,715
You've been drinking too much lately.
So stop drinking.

459
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:36,930
Truth or dare?

460
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,210
Sure.

461
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,130
Do you know

462
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,000
what I want to say the most right now?

463
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,760
Tell me. I'm listening.

464
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:48,650
Come.

465
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,040
Closer.

466
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,930
I found a crack in time and space.

467
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:57,450
What?

468
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,280
Do you know how I got here?

469
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,520
I don't know.

470
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,130
Neither do I.

471
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:04,690
This person

472
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:05,760
isn't really me.

473
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,930
I'm not supposed to exist in this world.

474
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,130
So

475
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,610
time and space must be broken.

476
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,240
The universe is full of mysteries.

477
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Young Lady Lin,

478
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,000
did you poison Rong Shukuang

479
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,480
with the Crimson Lotus Heart?

480
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,930
Do you know

481
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,930
why the poison hasn't taken effect
on her yet?

482
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,480
It's because Yan Shao

483
00:29:06,626 --> 00:29:08,280
has been drawing the poison
into himself

484
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,040
and taking it into his own body.

485
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,248
That's impossible.

486
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,690
All I know is
the Poison Extraction Technique

487
00:29:13,715 --> 00:29:16,271
is a secret technique
from the Tang Clan,

488
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,650
known only to a few.

489
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,890
Yan Shao is risking his life for her?

490
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,890
Their relationship

491
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,040
is far more complicated than we thought.

492
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,720
That just makes

493
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,040
me even more determined
to separate them.

494
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,760
Someone will be leaving
some markings along the way.

495
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,240
As long as you follow marks,

496
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,210
you'll catch up with them soon.
