(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 16=

19
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,300
Who... Who are you?

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,329
The Junshan Sect is here to capture
a traitor who betrayed his master.

21
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,271
Why are you stopping us?

22
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,410
He belongs to Tiangang.

23
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,900
You can't touch him.

24
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,250
Tiangang?

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,019
Since when has Tiangang
lost its sense of right and wrong?

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,471
This traitor plotted against his master
and betrayed his sect.

27
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:28,115
Everyone has the right to eliminate him.

28
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,130
If that's the case,

29
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,570
then the three of you
won't be leaving either.

30
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,810
Yan Shao, please spare them.

31
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,020
Shangguan Tong,
a traitor who broke your vows.

32
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,071
Tonight, we shall avenge our master.

33
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,182
We will take your life!

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,004
The Junshan Sect resorted to ambushes

35
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:46,200
in the dead of night.
It's shameful and dishonorable.

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,610
Falsely accusing a fellow disciple
without knowing the truth.

37
00:02:48,693 --> 00:02:51,582
Aren't you afraid of becoming
a laughingstock in the martial world?

38
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,900
If he really betrayed his master

39
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,426
and abandoned his sect,

40
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,204
he would have killed you before I did.

41
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:00,137
Why would he plead for your lives?

42
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,493
You claim he murdered your master.

43
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,910
Do you have evidence?

44
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,750
Did you witness it with your own eyes?

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,720
Shangguan Tong, speak for yourself.

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,910
I...

47
00:03:10,671 --> 00:03:11,790
I have nothing to say.

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,750
My master did die by my sword.

49
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,910
He admitted it!

50
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
But I never plotted against my master.

51
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,470
I have indeed made mistakes,

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,750
but toward my master

53
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,950
and Junshan Sect,
my conscience is clear.

54
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,070
If you still wish to kill me,

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,880
then do it.

56
00:03:26,204 --> 00:03:28,190
Are you really willing
to die with this injustice?

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,190
If there's more to this,

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,440
you can tell us.

59
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,230
Junshan Sect

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
is not one to ignore reason.

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
I made a vow.

62
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,120
I will never reveal the truth.

63
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,000
Please don't press me any further.

64
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,070
I have carried this accusation
for years and remained alive.

65
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,670
That is already a great fortune.

66
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,160
I accept my death.

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,604
Let my death
fulfill your long-cherished wish.

68
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,720
Is your life really so worthless?

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,440
If you're ready to die, why follow me?

70
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,515
You said you'd stand
against Ghost Valley Sect.

71
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,910
Was that just empty talk?

72
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,160
Kids these days

73
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:05,893
always fighting and killing.

74
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,350
Is this that day...

75
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,880
In the name of Tiangang, I swear

76
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:14,670
that Junshan Sect
will receive the justice it deserves.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But tonight,

78
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,137
you will not
take Shangguan Tong with you.

79
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,760
Senior brothers, I give you my word.

80
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,040
Once I destroy the Ghost Valley Sect,

81
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:27,893
I will go to Junshan Sect
and accept my punishment.

82
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,790
- Fine.
- Fine.

83
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:34,400
We'll be waiting for you.

84
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Let's go.

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Go get some rest.

86
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,430
This is...

87
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,470
Don't act recklessly again.

88
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,600
So that child is the one who was caught
by Yuchi Manor while trying

89
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
to set the oil on fire at Zhonghe
Festival but managed to escape?

90
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,600
Yes.

91
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,600
Why?

92
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,310
He's not an irredeemable villain.

93
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,640
He was merely being used.

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,230
There's more to his master's death.

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,200
If Shangguan Tong
had been truly ruthless that night,

96
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,600
the Six Great Sects would
have suffered heavy casualties.

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,760
That's not what I'm asking.

98
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,230
Then what is?

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,720
I asked if I had seen him before.

100
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,910
And what did you tell me?

101
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,870
You said no. You lied to me.

102
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,910
I was wrong.

103
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:36,350
I shouldn't have lied to you.

104
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,400
Then pinky swear.

105
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:40,293
You're not allowed to lie to me again.

106
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:44,493
Pinky swear, hang ourselves,
never break it for a hundred years.

107
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,048
If you lie to me again, you'll be...

108
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,080
Be what?

109
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,790
A pig.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,280
Fine.

111
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,080
Seal it with a stamp.

112
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,080
Are you certain
he didn't murder his master?

113
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,640
I am.

114
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,160
I'm completely sure.

115
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,400
Then I believe you.

116
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,160
That kid has suffered enough.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,960
It's not easy for Junshan Sect to have

118
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,310
such a disciple.

119
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:14,760
Yeah.

120
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,600
But there have been many cases
of disciples killing their masters.

121
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,910
Master, don't worry.

122
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,350
I would never betray you.

123
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm such a good disciple.

124
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,040
Good disciple.

125
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,110
Good.

126
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,520
What's wrong?

127
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,550
Suddenly, I felt a sharp pain.

128
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,870
I don't know why.

129
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,715
How long has this been happening?

130
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
Just the past two days.

131
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,871
It's probably just exhaustion
from traveling, and lack of rest.

132
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm fine.

133
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,550
All right.

134
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,080
Master.

135
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,840
But I was thinking just now...

136
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,640
Who would have known

137
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,600
Shangguan Tong was here?

138
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,400
Were they really after Shangguan Tong

139
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,840
or were they actually targeting us?

140
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,790
Good question.

141
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,600
I have a feeling
this journey won't be peaceful.

142
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,870
Master, do you have a plan?

143
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:14,448
Have you heard the story of waiting
for a hare to hit a stump?

144
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,640
And I'm the stump?

145
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,400
You're exceptionally clever.

146
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,310
And when will the hare come?

147
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,870
When the time is right,

148
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
it will come.

149
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,180
(Dockside Tavern)

150
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,790
Wanci.

151
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:32,604
Shaoci.

152
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,360
Yan Shao and Shukuang
have returned, right?

153
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,350
They did return.

154
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,271
But they immediately
set off for Mount Moye.

155
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,600
They left in such a hurry.

156
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,080
Why didn't they meet up with us

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:40,960
and go together?

158
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,600
We searched for so long.

159
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,760
Finally, we got to see her.

160
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,671
I never thought Rong
would be in such a rush to get married.

161
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,110
How are they?

162
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:49,280
Were they injured?

163
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,890
Where have they been
these past few days?

164
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:52,448
They seemed fine. Don't worry.

165
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,960
Seeing how eager Shukuang
was to get to Mount Moye,

166
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,080
I couldn't stop her.

167
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,400
So I let them go.

168
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,670
But Yan Shao said that on the way,

169
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,520
he would find a safe place
to meet up with us.

170
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,893
As soon as we got the news,

171
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,720
Feng Ming and Fei Wu already set out.

172
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,960
We should hurry too.

173
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,870
Wanci, you've been out for too long,

174
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,937
Father will be worried.

175
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,790
Let Feng escort you
back to Yuchi Manor.

176
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,350
I want to go with you.

177
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,550
I grew up with Shukuang.

178
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,870
Now she's getting married

179
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:23,071
and I want to see her wedding
with my own eyes.

180
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,840
Then come with us.

181
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,520
But stay safe.

182
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,230
Of course.

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Why did I sleep so deeply?

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,550
You were exhausted.

185
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,040
Why are you sweating so much?

186
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,880
Training.

187
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:11,626
Internal energy leaked out.

188
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,670
Is that so?

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,310
You wouldn't have...

190
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,430
What is Earth?

191
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,190
E... Earth is just...

192
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,790
Where did you hear that?

193
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,804
You mentioned it
when you were drunk last time.

194
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,240
You said, "The sky is round,
and the land is flat."

195
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,550
You don't get it, do you?

196
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,670
Let me teach you a lesson.

197
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,160
The sun rises in the east every day

198
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,590
and sets in the west.

199
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,880
Oh, right.

200
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,120
Shouldn't we find a place

201
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,910
to wait for Shaoci and Yingluo?

202
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,790
Eager to see Young Master Lin?

203
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,950
Not really.

204
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,471
I just don't want
to reach Mount Moye so soon.

205
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,790
If you don't want to,

206
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:51,804
why agree to the marriage?

207
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:53,550
Because you insisted on leaving.

208
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,310
Anyway,

209
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,040
an arranged marriage

210
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,280
is full of risks.

211
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,240
What if your leader

212
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,480
turns out to be old and ugly?

213
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,426
Wouldn't my life be miserable?

214
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,880
Who told you

215
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,640
the Leader is old and ugly?

216
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,240
If he isn't,

217
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,760
why all the secrecy?

218
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,137
No one in the martial world
knows anything about him.

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,430
The Leader is a discreet man.

220
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:18,280
He rarely gets involved in conflicts.

221
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,190
Rarely involved?

222
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,790
Yet he runs an intelligence network?

223
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,640
The martial world
needs someone to uphold justice.

224
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,280
The Leader has a noble heart.

225
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,760
Tiangang punishes
the wicked and upholds justice.

226
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,760
What?

227
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,590
Do you want me to marry him?

228
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,550
The Leader
of Tiangang taking a wife

229
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,160
is a grand event for Mount Moye.

230
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,048
Of course, the sooner, the better.

231
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,670
Don't argue with women.

232
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:50,048
Just go along with them
and keep them happy.

233
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,670
Focus on riding.

234
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,550
Leader Shen,
this is the route they're taking.

235
00:11:18,182 --> 00:11:20,160
Three Wandering Masters
and Young Master Jiang.

236
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,910
Follow Rong Shukuang's group

237
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,910
using the markers along the way.

238
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,910
I'll take this path.

239
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:28,715
I have some matters to attend to

240
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,520
and I'll meet up with you later.

241
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,430
I'll go with Zuitian.

242
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,160
Leader Shen, where are you headed?

243
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,550
Junshan Sect isn't far from here.

244
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,760
Are you planning to visit them?

245
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,790
Jiang, you always know too much.

246
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:45,240
Since their chief's passing,
Junshan Sect has been in chaos.

247
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,040
The senior disciples
are secretly fighting for power.

248
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,790
It's a mess.

249
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,070
But they're still
one of the Six Great Sects.

250
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,160
Their foundation runs deep.

251
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,790
Leader Shen, you must be careful.

252
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,880
Don't worry.

253
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,710
With Master Hua
and Wuwang Pavilion's support,

254
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,480
Junshan Sect is nothing to fear.

255
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,640
Until I return,

256
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,520
do not act recklessly.

257
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,480
Let's go.

258
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:24,550
Everything west of here
belongs to Ghost Valley Sect.

259
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,693
We must be extra cautious.

260
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,950
Let's hurry.

261
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:30,830
Are you tired?

262
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm fine.

263
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
Even if you aren't, the horses are.

264
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,880
Let's stop at the next town to rest.

265
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,026
It's not safe to stay out here.

266
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,040
Tell him.

267
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,910
I don't want to sleep outdoors anymore.

268
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,070
Young Lady Rong says...

269
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,950
I'm not deaf.

270
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,000
Fine, we'll rest in town.

271
00:12:49,071 --> 00:12:51,160
It's a good place
to wait for Tiangang's people.

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,040
And for Shaoci,
Yingluo, and Feng.

273
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,190
Go on, ask Young Lady Rong.

274
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,070
Does she want to sleep

275
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,280
or wait for Lin Shaoci?

276
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,190
Go on, ask Yan Shao.

277
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,790
Is he being fussy or just jealous?

278
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,670
Are you two flirting

279
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,910
or just messing with me?

280
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,430
It's lively here.

281
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,520
Let's find an inn first.

282
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,920
(Blossom's Fall Inn)

283
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,520
(Blossom's Fall Inn)

284
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,400
The innkeeper
said this place is secluded.

285
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,760
Not many people stay here.

286
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,040
It's safe and reliable.

287
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:43,550
What about the other rooms?

288
00:14:44,693 --> 00:14:46,115
This is the only one available.

289
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,520
So you're saying

290
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,160
the three of us have to share one room?

291
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,120
I don't like sharing a room with others.

292
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,640
I'll sleep in the carriage.

293
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:55,160
You're still not used to
sleeping next to someone?

294
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,226
I got some paper
and ink from the innkeeper.

295
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,400
If you don't want to talk to each other,

296
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,310
just write it down.

297
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,520
If you don't want to see each other,

298
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,520
just turn your backs.

299
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:12,315
Just the two of us, a single man
and a single woman, in one room...

300
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:12,893
This...

301
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,670
You're not marrying me.

302
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,590
So I don't care
if you two are alone together.

303
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,160
If you're not satisfied,

304
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,280
find another inn.

305
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,270
(Rong)

306
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,450
(Yan)

307
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,420
(Rong)

308
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,360
Sir, five coins
is the lowest price.

309
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,648
I'm barely making a profit here.

310
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:56,790
Delicious candied treats!

311
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,480
Come, come!

312
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,070
Do you have money? Lend me some.

313
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,240
I...

314
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:04,240
Which one do you want?

315
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,480
Never mind.

316
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,310
You two.

317
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,880
Put these on.

318
00:16:23,893 --> 00:16:25,790
That way, you won't
have to see each other.

319
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,000
Might as well.

320
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:32,982
I wouldn't want
Ghost Valley Sect spotting us.

321
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,480
Your face is huge. You wear it.

322
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm not afraid.

323
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,448
You're just a kid. You wear it.

324
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,190
Don't call me a kid.

325
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,240
Suit yourselves, then.

326
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,160
If you're not a kid, then what are you?

327
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,830
Fine, I'll call you Tong?

328
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,190
If they've arrived,

329
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,710
they must've found a place to stay.

330
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,350
We'll check every inn.

331
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,110
The town isn't big.

332
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,200
There aren't many inns.

333
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,000
If they're here,

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,830
we'll find them.

335
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,000
Knowing Sister Rong,

336
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,480
she'd go somewhere lively first.

337
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,480
Shaoci,

338
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,590
take Yingluo to check
the busy areas first.

339
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll take Feng
and ask around at the inns.

340
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,390
This town isn't big

341
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,680
and we're outsiders.

342
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,630
Splitting up won't attract attention.

343
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,390
We'll meet back here later.

344
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,240
Got it.

345
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,790
Feng, take care of Wanci.

346
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,680
Understood.

347
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,830
Let's go.

348
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,680
- This way.
- Feng...

349
00:17:33,382 --> 00:17:35,310
You just wanted an excuse
to go somewhere lively.

350
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,870
No way!

351
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:38,248
As long as I'm with Brother Shaoci,

352
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:39,200
anywhere is fun.

353
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,300
(Blossom's Fall Inn)

354
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:52,560
(Blossom's Fall Inn)
How about it, Young Lady Lin?

355
00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:54,626
The innkeeper
said he hadn't seen them.

356
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,240
Let's check another place.

357
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,390
All right.

358
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,210
(Blossom's Fall Inn)

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,280
Come and have a look!

360
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,590
Miss, let your husband
buy you a hairpin.

361
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,280
We're not...

362
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,520
Just take a look.

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
Sure, take your time.

364
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,310
Brother Shaoci, does this look nice?

365
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,720
I'll buy you anything you want.

366
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,760
Then this one.

367
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,337
All right, how much?

368
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:20,390
Thank you, Brother Shaoci.

369
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,350
That will be five coins.

370
00:18:22,293 --> 00:18:23,960
Brother Shaoci, look at this.

371
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,440
It looks like snow chrysanthemums!

372
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:28,240
Do you remember Sister Rong's

373
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,630
Falling Snow Kite from that day?

374
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,760
Those flowers were snow chrysanthemums.

375
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:37,370
I'll take one of these too.

376
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,040
All right.

377
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,648
- This also...
- It's the same price.

378
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,960
Here you go.

379
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:43,350
Thank you.

380
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,360
Thank you, Young Master.

381
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,350
This one's nice too.

382
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,630
Let's head that way.

383
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,390
Take care.

384
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,390
Bun...

385
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,480
Buns.

386
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,000
Sir, your buns.

387
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,040
Are you talking to me?

388
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,480
I... Buns.

389
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,150
I...

390
00:19:04,115 --> 00:19:05,870
Fresh, hot buns,
just out of the steamer.

391
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,550
Wait a moment.

392
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,760
Sir, take a look.

393
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,826
Six buns, please.

394
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,440
Got it!

395
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,680
Hey, I'll take one too.

396
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,680
Hold on.

397
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,240
Shaoci, wait here.

398
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,240
I'll pick one for Wanci.

399
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,360
Excuse me!

400
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,115
Please move aside.

401
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:32,910
- Excuse me!
- Is this enough?

402
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,448
Yes.

403
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Be careful, it's hot.

404
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,630
Excuse me.

405
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:37,760
- Let's go.
- Brother Shaoci, look at this.

406
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,110
Would this suit Wanci?

407
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,830
Let's go.

408
00:19:48,293 --> 00:19:50,070
I see the markers.
They've entered the town.

409
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,000
Good. Let's head in.

410
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,550
We'll observe the situation.

411
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,582
Leader Shen instructed us

412
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,680
not to act recklessly until he returned.

413
00:19:57,382 --> 00:19:58,582
Young Master Ruhai.

414
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,110
You're always afraid of dying.

415
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,000
Whenever trouble arises,

416
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,630
you're the first to run.

417
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,200
In the martial world,
survival is all about timing.

418
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,240
Enough talk. Let's go.

419
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,170
(Yan)

420
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,440
Fine, I'll leave.

421
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,350
A leaky house and a rickety bed.

422
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,590
We'll have to make do.

423
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,000
You just ate five buns.

424
00:21:01,048 --> 00:21:02,182
Stop pretending to be sick.

425
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,350
I'm not pretending.

426
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,760
Let me see.

427
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,830
The stomach...

428
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,520
It's nothing,

429
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,440
just indigestion.

430
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:23,390
Bear with it.

431
00:21:24,315 --> 00:21:25,560
It's the buns' fault.

432
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,520
Gently...

433
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,280
I wonder if they found anything.

434
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,760
How is it?

435
00:21:50,515 --> 00:21:52,110
We checked all the inns in town.

436
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,315
None of them have seen them.

437
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,648
Feng Ming and Fei Wu
should've arrived before us.

438
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:57,280
Yet there's no sign of them either.

439
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,240
Tiangang's people are always elusive,

440
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,040
and hard to track.

441
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,520
They might show up

442
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,630
when we need them.

443
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,550
It's getting late.

444
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,390
Let's find a place to rest.

445
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,960
We'll decide our next move tomorrow.

446
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,630
Let's go.

447
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,960
Wanci, look at this.

448
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,471
Isn't it pretty? I picked it for you.

449
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,870
It looks like a snowflake.

450
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,150
I love snow.

451
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,830
But my hometown
hardly ever sees snowfall.

452
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,390
But snow eventually melts.

453
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,390
Everything fades away in the end.

454
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,870
Like the moon reflected in water

455
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,350
or flowers in a mirror,
they're just illusions.

456
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,830
Why like something so fleeting?

457
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,310
Why not?

458
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,720
Flowers bloom when the time is right.

459
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,870
Snow falls when it should.

460
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,480
Not everything in life

461
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,000
needs an ending to be perfect.

462
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:47,560
As long as you like it.

463
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,040
Wait.

464
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:07,630
This is your fault.

465
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,830
Blame the buns.
What does this have to do with me?

466
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,350
Who bought the buns?

467
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,350
You can talk to me now?

468
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,870
I'm talking to myself.

469
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,720
I can't stay silent all day.

470
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,240
I'd suffocate.

471
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,040
You sleep there.

472
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,240
I'll sleep here.

473
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,680
At least you have a conscience.

474
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,240
Yan Shao.

475
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,390
Answer me honestly.

476
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,390
Are you really willing

477
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,240
to send me off to marry Chu Tianyao?

478
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,960
Answer me.

479
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,310
That thing you mentioned earlier
about orbital rotation...

480
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,590
What does it mean?

481
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,870
Come on.

482
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,310
Don't you think your way
of changing the subject

483
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,920
is way too obvious?

484
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,871
Orbital rotation... Axial rotation...

485
00:24:23,226 --> 00:24:24,590
What kind of martial art is that?

486
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,040
Fine. If you won't answer, forget it.

487
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,070
Just go to sleep.

488
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,960
Sir, your wine.

489
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,350
Brother Shaoci.

490
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
Has Wanci gone to bed?

491
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,830
Do you like Sister Rong now too?

492
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,000
Some things in life

493
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,280
are beyond our control.

494
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,830
It's all my fault.

495
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,520
I was wrong...

496
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,440
Brother Shaoci.

497
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,040
If you love someone,
you should let her be happy.

498
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,550
It's just hard to let go at once.

499
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:59,440
Sister Rong can be with the one

500
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,920
she truly cares about...

501
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,280
What about you?

502
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,550
I... I get to stay by your side...

503
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,680
That's enough.

504
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,520
I have no other wishes.

505
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,960
Silly girl.

506
00:26:25,426 --> 00:26:27,630
Longing for something
you can't have is too painful.

507
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,070
I don't want you

508
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,110
to suffer like I have.

509
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,760
Gold! Gold fell from the sky!

510
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,000
That's not gold.

511
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,680
- It is!
- That's a meteor.

512
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,110
Gold is falling, so I can buy sweets.

513
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,440
Yan'er, I want sweets.

514
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,110
I want to pick up gold.

515
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,680
All right. I'll help you find it.

516
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:54,220
(Yiyun Inn)

517
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,310
Where were you last night?

518
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,671
You didn't come back at all.

519
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,310
Wanci.

520
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,040
I was downstairs talking
with Brother Shaoci.

521
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,960
All right.

522
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,350
Shaoci.

523
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,000
Let's leave today.

524
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,560
We should catch up with Sister Rong.

525
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
It's still early.

526
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,870
Let's look around first.

527
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,310
If we don't find them,

528
00:28:17,315 --> 00:28:18,515
we'll continue on our way.

529
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,520
All right.

530
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,720
Let's go.

531
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,920
Let's go.

532
00:28:32,382 --> 00:28:33,350
When did you arrive?

533
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,520
Last night.

534
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,920
Our people have already checked.

535
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,790
Lin Shaoci

536
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,070
and Ghost Valley Sect are here.

537
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,630
But Shen Zuitian isn't.

538
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,590
They arrived so quickly.

539
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,110
Feng Ming and I
have been watching this place.

540
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,680
Just as Yan Shao suspected,

541
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,337
someone is following us

542
00:28:48,337 --> 00:28:50,140
and leaking information
to Ghost Valley Sect.

543
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,000
Since that's the case,

544
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,760
let's wait here.

545
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,310
They won't sit still for long.

546
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,350
But without Shen Zuitian,

547
00:28:56,537 --> 00:28:58,626
they won't
make a move so soon, will they?

548
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:00,848
Three Wandering Masters
have lost to me multiple times.

549
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,310
They won't let it slide.

550
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,440
They might take action on their own

551
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,680
before Shen Zuitian even arrives.

552
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,520
So, you have a plan?

553
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,870
We wait for their move

554
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
and catch them in the act.

555
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,200
Sister, you won't catch it like that.

556
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,150
You don't believe me?

557
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,310
Listen up.

558
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,760
I know a bit of lightness technique.

559
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,960
Watch this.

560
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:31,382
Keep your eyes open.

561
00:29:35,582 --> 00:29:36,790
(Normally, at this moment,)

562
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,550
(someone should catch me.)

563
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,150
Shaoci!

564
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,960
Yingluo!

565
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,440
You're finally here!

566
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,093
I was worried something happened to you.

567
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:50,182
As long as you're safe.

568
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,040
Here, take it and play.

569
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,960
When did Young Master Lin
and Young Lady Lin arrive?

570
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,693
Thank you, Sister.

571
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,280
We checked a few inns last night.

572
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,790
None had any news of you.

573
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,093
Rong, I'm glad you're safe.

574
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,600
After the incident at Wuwang Pavilion,

575
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:01,937
we searched everywhere for you.

576
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,448
Good thing we found you here

577
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,004
or we would've missed you again.

578
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,000
Where are Feng Ming and Fei Wu?

579
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,280
They got word in advance

580
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:09,660
and should've left earlier than us.

581
00:30:09,715 --> 00:30:11,093
They haven't arrived in town yet.

582
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,440
But I left a marker for them.

583
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:18,204
Young Lady Lin's
old illness is acting up?

584
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,520
I might have caught a chill

585
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,579
from rushing on the road.

586
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,337
It's nothing serious.
Some rest should help.

587
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,790
All right, since that's the case,

588
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,070
let's rest here for a day.

589
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,200
We can wait for Feng Ming
and Fei Wu to join us.

590
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,350
You don't seem so eager
to get things done now.

591
00:30:32,604 --> 00:30:34,048
This isn't the place to talk.

592
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,293
Let's go back to the inn.

593
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:38,630
- Let's go.
- You...

594
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,350
Sister Rong.

595
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,000
We were all so worried about you.

596
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,226
I'm just glad you're safe.

597
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,240
Don't worry.

598
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,200
Let's go.

599
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:49,590
With Ghost Valley Sect
and Wuwang Pavilion involved,

600
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,848
this journey will be filled
with relentless trouble.

601
00:30:55,093 --> 00:30:57,137
I booked two more rooms
with the innkeeper.

602
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,520
Wanci.

603
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,150
Let's go check out the rooms first.

604
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,960
You're not feeling well.
Make sure to rest.

605
00:31:05,448 --> 00:31:06,550
Sister Rong, come with us.

606
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,720
All right.

607
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,070
Let's check the rooms.

608
00:31:15,537 --> 00:31:17,380
Didn't you say the inn
was full and leaking?

609
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,920
Are you saying
I arranged this on purpose?

610
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,590
What else?

611
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:22,560
Don't think I don't know
what you're up to.

612
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,920
Men...

613
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,870
Women...

614
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,590
I'd say you set this up deliberately.

615
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,960
Trying to take advantage of me?

616
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,630
I...

617
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,390
You have no shame, do you?

618
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,200
Sister Rong, aren't you coming?

619
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,000
This inn is in a secluded area
with few guests.

620
00:31:50,648 --> 00:31:52,893
It's normal
for the furnishings to be a bit old.

621
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,826
Let's make do for now.

622
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:56,470
- I'll handle it.
- Shukuang. I got it.

623
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,604
It's too old, Sister Rong.

624
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,040
Oh, right.

625
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,720
Last night, Feng and Wanci

626
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,390
checked a lot of inns.

627
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,110
None of them said they saw you.

628
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,550
This place hardly gets guests.

629
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,440
The innkeeper shouldn't have forgotten.

630
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,630
Maybe the innkeeper

631
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,150
was just giving us a vague answer.

632
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,720
Shukuang, which room are you staying in?

633
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,720
The one over by the stairs.

634
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Since our hurried farewell at the ferry,

635
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,630
we haven't had a proper conversation.

636
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,440
How are you feeling now?

637
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,520
Have you been taking
the medicine I prescribed?

638
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,830
Yan Shao has been drawing
the poison out.

639
00:32:34,982 --> 00:32:36,760
He's been absorbing it
into his own body.

640
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,960
That's impossible.

641
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,960
The bond between them

642
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,070
is more complicated than we imagined.

643
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,110
I've been too busy dealing
with Wuwang Pavilion.

644
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,737
I barely had time to take my medicine.

645
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,248
But I haven't had any flare-ups.

646
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,070
Could it be that I'm cured?

647
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,280
If you're cured,
then I can rest easy.

648
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,000
Well, Sister Rong.

649
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,920
Are you sure you're feeling all right?

650
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,040
On the way to Mount Moye,
we'll pass by my home.

651
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,310
If you're unwell,

652
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,360
I can take you
to meet my elder sister in Tang Clan.

653
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,070
If you ever feel unwell,

654
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,070
you can come to me too.

655
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,390
No... No need.

656
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,870
I feel perfectly fine.

657
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,870
Aside from overeating last night...

658
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:19,871
Two miracle physicians,

659
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,550
I don't need a check-up or any medicine.

660
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,350
I beg you, just let me be.

661
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,960
You two go ahead.

662
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,040
I won't disturb you.

663
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,271
I'll leave you to it.

664
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,790
Give me a room.

665
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,110
No rooms left.

666
00:33:42,626 --> 00:33:44,737
The rain leaked in,
causing the rooms to collapse.

667
00:33:44,782 --> 00:33:46,150
You said the same thing yesterday.

668
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,710
But suddenly, two rooms opened up today?

669
00:33:47,715 --> 00:33:49,390
Yesterday, we really had none.

670
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,760
Today, some rooms became available.

671
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:55,150
Not even trying to make money.

672
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,110
Move aside!

673
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:15,750
Tonight, you're sleeping
in the carriage with Shangguan Tong.

674
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,750
Why?

675
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,520
Lin Wanci and the others can't know

676
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,982
that we stayed in the same room.

677
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:21,915
Then why don't you room with Lin Wanci?

678
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:22,840
What?

679
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,150
But what if she asks me why?

680
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,590
Wouldn't that expose everything?

681
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
That's your problem.

682
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,590
What's it got to do with me?

683
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,920
If my reputation as Young Lady Rong
of Yuchi Manor is ruined

684
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,048
and Leader Chu
calls off the engagement, how?

685
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:38,093
That won't happen.

686
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,070
How can you be so sure?

687
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,710
We've done nothing improper.

688
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,150
I can explain this to Leader Chu.

689
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,040
Look me in the eyes.

690
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,880
Was it you
who told the child to say that

691
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,320
about the room last night?

692
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,800
It truly wasn't me.

693
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:57,800
Fine.

694
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:04,750
