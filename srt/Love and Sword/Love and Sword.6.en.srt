Isn't it March now?

20
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:07,671
Why is it so hot?

21
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,650
Yan Shao.

22
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,370
What is it?

23
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,440
What's wrong?

24
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,970
It's so hot.

25
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,810
Hot?

26
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:37,050
Is the poison acting up again?

27
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:39,448
Do you feel uncomfortable?

28
00:02:39,737 --> 00:02:41,982
It seems like
you've been poisoned again.

29
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,970
You smell really nice.

30
00:02:49,515 --> 00:02:50,826
Are you back to your senses now?

31
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,000
I am sorry.

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:53,970
Sorry?

33
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,770
About what?

34
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,050
Everything. I was wrong from the start.

35
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,720
I never should have come here.

36
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,120
If you hadn't saved me,

37
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,090
I would've gone back a long time ago.

38
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,810
Here and there?

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,560
Where exactly are you talking about?

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,370
I don't even know

41
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,120
if this world is a dream

42
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,970
or some time warp.

43
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,982
Anyway, I never should have come here.

44
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,560
If I hadn't,

45
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,330
none of this trouble
would have happened,

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,210
and I never would have met you.

47
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,090
Yan Shao,

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,280
am I just trouble to you?

49
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,840
Do you want me

50
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,400
to just disappear from your sight?

51
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,280
No.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,210
Liar.

53
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,120
I'm not lying.

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,048
I am willing
from the bottom of my heart.

55
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,920
If I never get my memories back,

56
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,360
doesn't that mean
I am going to be useless?

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,650
Then

58
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll take you away from Yuchi Manor,

59
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,160
and we'll disappear together.

60
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,471
Your heart?

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,570
Where is your heart?

62
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,720
I can't even see you through clearly.

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,280

Why am I here?

75
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,040
You were poisoned.

76
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
Again?

77
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,160
Seriously, who keeps poisoning me?

78
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,240
Am I some kind of test subject?

79
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,400
I... I feel fine now.

80
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,570
Sure?

81
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
So can I get out now?

82
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,130
Yan Shao.

83
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:14,650
I'm here.

84
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,280
I feel safe

85
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
when I call your name.

86
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,970
Maybe your name

87
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,040
is my lucky charm.

88
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,400
Don't be scared.

89
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,040
I'm here.

90
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,360
Have you been here this whole time?

91
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,010
Yes, always.

92
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,040
Yan Shao,

93
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,240
come and have some tea.

94
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,920
Yan Shao, you look pale.

95
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,280
Did you not sleep well last night?

96
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:15,920
I...

97
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:17,720
There was a stray cat last night.

98
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,130
Shukuang, why don't you join us?

99
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:23,626
Shukuang, come and join us.

100
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,240
Come on.

101
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,930
It looks like
you didn't get much rest either.

102
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,810
A stray cat kept me up all night.

103
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,880
Since you had a hard time sleeping,

104
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,720
how did you pass the time?

105
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,290
Young Lady Lin, you're so concerned.

106
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,693
Were you woken up by the cat too?

107
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:50,690
There was no cat.

108
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,810
Two frogs croaking by the water

109
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,760
all night.

110
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:56,604
All right then.

111
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,930
I'll go catch the cat and the frogs
after lunch.

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,690
So that everyone can finally sleep
in peace.

113
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,448
Young Master Lin,

114
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,690
what woke you up?

115
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,640
I'll catch that too.

116
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,693
I didn't hear a thing,
so I slept just fine.

117
00:09:06,893 --> 00:09:08,093
You all continue chatting.

118
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,450
I'm going for a walk.

119
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,520
I can't believe this.

120
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,240
Rong Shukuang,

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
what on earth did you do last night?

122
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:36,240
Are you just hormonal deficient
or what?

123
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,330
That was so awkward and so embarrassing.

124
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,640
What are you doing?

125
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,640
I feel ashamed.

126
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,026
You don't need to avoid me.

127
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,050
Last night,

128
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,290
I didn't take advantage of you.

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,410
You didn't?

130
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:03,640
Why not?

131
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:05,050
Why the hell not?

132
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,720
What's wrong with you?

133
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,760
I...

134
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,520
have manners.

135
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,026
I won't take advantage
of someone else's misfortune.

136
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,330
I'm young and beautiful.

137
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,560
In the middle of the night,

138
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:21,240
we were under the moonlight
with the perfect romantic atmosphere.

139
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,626
Even the cats were calling out to mate,
and the mood was right!

140
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:24,804
You still have manners?

141
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:26,337
You don't take me seriously at all.

142
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,720
I'm so disappointed in you.

143
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,360
Disappointed?

144
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,450
Are you saying you wanted me
to take advantage of you?

145
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:36,471
What are you trying to do?
Act like a beast?

146
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,915
That's why I didn't do anything.

147
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,480
You're even less than a beast.

148
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:42,404
So whether I did anything or not,
I'm still wrong.

149
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:43,648
What do you even want?

150
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,170
Forget about what happened last night.

151
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,720
Anyway,

152
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,240
it wasn't entirely your fault.

153
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,170
Let's just say it was an effect
of the poison.

154
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,360
But speaking of that,

155
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,840
what kind of poison is it this time?

156
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,810
This is...

157
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:01,360
Something from the Tang Family.

158
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,170
Tang Yingluo?

159
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,599
(Forgive me, Sister Rong.)

160
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,780
(I don't know if fighting poison
with poison will work.)

161
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:07,648
(But I have to try.)

162
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,360
This lady...

163
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,840
Does she want to save me or kill me?

164
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:18,226
This won't do. I need an explanation.

165
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,760
Tang Yingluo, come here.

166
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,871
I have a score to settle with you.
Come here.

167
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,120
Oh, caught you.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,880
What on earth are all these?

169
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,090
Don't tell me

170
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,671
you used all these poisons on me!

171
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,410
Well, these poisons are meant for you.

172
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,090
But I was helping you!

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,840
(Since I promised
Yan Shao not to tell anyone)

174
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
(about the second poison,)

175
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:49,226
(I'll just have to make up something.)

176
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,930
Helping me?

177
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
It's also helping Brother Shaoci.

178
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Sister Rong, think about it.

179
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,170
Ghost Valley Sect
is against Yuchi Manor,

180
00:12:03,204 --> 00:12:05,450
and even the Six Great Sects
are at odds with each other.

181
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,410
Shaoci has too much on his plate.

182
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,204
To deal with...

183
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,640
Don't touch me.

184
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
When you still have your martial arts,

185
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,330
you can fight alongside him
and share the burden.

186
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,520
But ever since you lost your abilities

187
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,170
after Shen Zuitian injured you,

188
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,120
you couldn't help out.

189
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,290
He's left to deal with everything alone.

190
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,640
He's really struggling,
and I sympathize with him.

191
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,137
But what does that have to do
with you poisoning me?

192
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,480
I was trying to fight poison
with poison!

193
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
Tang Yingluo,

194
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,248
I'm warning you anyway.

195
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,404
If you do this again,

196
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:40,170
our friendship is over.

197
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,120
I won't talk to you anymore.

198
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,240
How is that funny?

199
00:12:47,115 --> 00:12:48,048
No, it's just...

200
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,050
Sister Rong, you used to be so cold

201
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,170
and fierce.

202
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,000
But just now,

203
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:53,880
you said

204
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,330
we're friends.

205
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,640
I never dared to think of you
as a friend before.

206
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,410
But I like this version of you better.

207
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,240
Was I really

208
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,930
that scary before?

209
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,410
Actually, Shaoci used
to be a little scared of you, too.

210
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,330
He was scared of me?

211
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,450
He thought his martial arts
weren't as good as yours.

212
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,690
Even the hall masters
respected you more than him.

213
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,000
He admired you,
but he was afraid of you.

214
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,520
He cared about you,
but didn't dare to get too close.

215
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,810
(No wonder he rejected
Rong Shukuang's proposal.)

216
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,050
(What kind of man would want)

217
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,410
(a terrifying woman?)

218
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:37,720
Fine.

219
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:38,970
No more next time.

220
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:39,760
I'm leaving.

221
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,000
But you seem different

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,840
after you return.

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,810
If you regain your abilities

224
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,120
and help Shaoci manage the manor,

225
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,293
that would be even better.

226
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,360
I'd like to.

227
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,810
You're right to trust her.

228
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,330
I know.

229
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,760
Her poor poisoning skills,

230
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,810
out of not wanting to harm you,

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,290
just took half your life.

232
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,050
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

233
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,810
But your body is strong enough.

234
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,737
So you will be fine.

235
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:13,880
(Of course, she's going to be fine.)

236
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,137
(I was the one who ended up taking)

237
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,210
(on all the poison
while trying to draw it out of her.)

238
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,330
Rong. Yan Shao.

239
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,170
You're all here.

240
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,170
Yingluo, we should go now.

241
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,240
I almost forgot.

242
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,880
Today, I'm supposed to inspect

243
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,160
the arrangement
of Zhonghe Festival with Brother Shaoci.

244
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,720
What's there to inspect?

245
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,970
I thought you enjoyed
Zhonghe Festival,

246
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,480
especially the Red Banner Flower Fair.

247
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,970
It's the only time

248
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,410
I've ever seen you smile so happily.

249
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:36,960
Am I right?

250
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes.

251
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,720
The Zhonghe Festival

252
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,493
is a long-standing tradition
held in the city every year.

253
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,182
The highlight for Yuchi Manor
is the Red Banner Flower Fair.

254
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,930
You have always taken the top prize
at the fair,

255
00:14:48,937 --> 00:14:50,937
and been admired
by heroes across the world.

256
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,527
(Yuchi Manor)

257
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,970
You don't usually go out much.

258
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,760
It's windy today.

259
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,290
Maybe you should stay home.

260
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,720
It's fine.
I've been frail since childhood.

261
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,720
I'm used to it.

262
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,600
With the treats going on,

263
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,426
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

264
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,290
Besides, the Red Banner Flower Fair
is my responsibility.

265
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:12,309
I'll only feel at ease
if I inspect it myself.

266
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,040
I'm just worried
you'll overexert yourself.

267
00:15:16,737 --> 00:15:17,450
Shukuang!

268
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,760
Every year, the Zhonghe Festival

269
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,410
is the one day she's happiest.

270
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,360
Let her go this time.

271
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,840
Sister Rong wants to come with us too.

272
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,690
I was just telling Shaoci

273
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,160
that we shouldn't keep you cooped up
in the manor forever.

274
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:33,204
You were ambushed
the last time you went out.

275
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:34,450
I just can't rest easy.

276
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,450
We've got so many people this time.

277
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,582
Besides, Yan Shao's with us.

278
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,693
So nothing will happen.

279
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,450
Just let her go.

280
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:42,000
The city is packed

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,690
with martial artists
from all sects today.

282
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,970
It's a mixed crowd, so stay on guard.

283
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:46,930
Got it. Let's go.

284
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,640
Let's go!

285
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,640
This shop just opened recently.

286
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,120
Their crystal goose is famous.

287
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,290
Let's eat here.

288
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:00,137
That sounds great.

289
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,760
Let's order the stuffed crab too.

290
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,120
Yan Shao seems
especially protective of you

291
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,671
and always looking out for you.

292
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,120
Well, I did pay him.

293
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,210
It's his job to protect me.

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,050
But Yan Shao possesses
an extraordinary demeanor,

295
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,210
not like an average swordsman.

296
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,000
He doesn't seem like someone
who'd be driven by money alone.

297
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,600
Wanci, listen to yourself.

298
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,570
I'm the fifth-ranked martial artist

299
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,450
in the martial arts world,

300
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,360
the legendary swordswoman,

301
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,880
and Yuchi Manor's Young Lady Rong.

302
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,604
With all these impressive titles,

303
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,960
are you telling me
none of them are enough to impress him?

304
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,450
Have you ever been here before,
Yan Shao?

305
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,690
Zhonghe Festival is the busiest time
of the year in this city.

306
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,690
Yuchi Manor's Red Banner Flower Fair

307
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,970
is the highlight.

308
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,090
Shukuang used to win the competition

309
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,240
every single year.

310
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,410
She was an unstoppable force
whom people admired.

311
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:52,120
It's a pity you can't compete this year.

312
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,090
If Yan Shao enters,

313
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,840
the winner's prize will be
my personally brewed Baihua Brew.

314
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,880
Yan Shao, do you dare to compete?

315
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,170
Sure.

316
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,693
Then let's hope
you come out on top tomorrow night.

317
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:05,893
All right. Enough talking.

318
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:06,760
Don't catch a cold.

319
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,320
Close it.

320
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,040
Let's go.

321
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,450
Hey, come here.

322
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:28,970
Young Master Lin.

323
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,970
Are those

324
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,720
Hall Master Feng and Hall Master Lu?

325
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,410
It's to prevent anyone
from sneaking into the Fair

326
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,320
with bad intentions.

327
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,450
With such strict precautions,

328
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,410
everything should go smoothly.

329
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,410
I hope so.

330
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,210
But why is there a checkpoint

331
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,850
between the East and West Markets?

332
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,480
I never arranged it.

333
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,720
Father personally ordered it.

334
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,982
He's worried someone might slip in
and cause trouble

335
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:00,360
at the Red Banner Flower Fair.

336
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,370
But

337
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,690
won't some people say
we're overreacting

338
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,280
for being too cautious

339
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,080
and afraid of conflict?

340
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,850
Father must have his reasons.

341
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,248
Come on, Feng.

342
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,520
What a grand setup!

343
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:22,370
Look over there.

344
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:28,370
Even in ancient times,

345
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,890
their festivals
were like grand opening ceremonies.

346
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,930
Everything is ready.

347
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,315
Everything is already in place.

348
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,080
Let's go.

349
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,130
As you've mentioned,

350
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,360
most of the defenses are concentrated
in the inner city.

351
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,910
There are fewer crowds
in the outer city,

352
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:44,537
so there's no need
for extra precautions.

353
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,970
Let's go.

354
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:50,182
The festival is a time for honoring
the harvest god, praying for prosperity,

355
00:18:50,182 --> 00:18:51,130
brewing Yichun Wine,

356
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,315
and holding poetry contests

357
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,000
or martial arts tournaments
for entertainment.

358
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,650
Yuchi Manor hosts
Red Banner Flower Fair every year,

359
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:00,137
attracting countless martial artists
from the martial world.

360
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:02,690
But this year, the elders
of Six Great Sects gathered here

361
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,240
are likely due to the conflict between
Yuchi Manor and Ghost Valley Sect.

362
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,800
Are all Six Great Sects

363
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,560
on Yuchi Manor's side?

364
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,240
Hard to say.

365
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,650
Because of Shen Zuitian,

366
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:15,240
the entire martial world suspects

367
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,450
that Yuchi Manor holds the key
to the Fuxian Treasure.

368
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,320
Freshly-made roujiamo!

369
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,240
I came up with it in the desert.

370
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,240
Now, it's already spread here.

371
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,690
Hold it.

372
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:27,780
Merchants are after profits.
So it'll spread quickly.

373
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,404
I should have charged a franchise fee!

374
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,210
But don't worry.

375
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,370
You'll always be the first person
in this world

376
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,240
to have tasted roujiamo

377
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,890
made by me, a genius!

378
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:41,280
I was the one
who funded the ingredients.

379
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,000
I talk about friendship,
and you bring up money?

380
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,370
It goes both ways.

381
00:19:46,204 --> 00:19:47,915
No rush. There's enough for everyone.

382
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:51,760
- There you go.
- Here's the money.

383
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,370
It can be used during the tournament?

384
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,293
What are they selling?

385
00:20:00,293 --> 00:20:02,471
- A gourd as a weapon? It's unheard of.
- Sister Rong.

386
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,760
How does one use a gourd
in a tournament?

387
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,648
Just chant some spells
and trap them inside.

388
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,690
Wanci.

389
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:12,871
Thank you, Yan Shao.

390
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:13,760
No problem.

391
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,240
Wanci, are you all right?

392
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,410
I am a little tired
from all the walking.

393
00:20:18,537 --> 00:20:19,930
There's a tavern in the West Market.

394
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,982
How about we stop there and rest?

395
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,293
The West Market is too far.

396
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,937
Let's go to Blossom's Smile instead.

397
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,650
All right.

398
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:27,720
Let's go.

399
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,170
Feng, come on.

400
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,370
Flirting all you can, huh?

401
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:47,300
(Blossom's Smile)

402
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,800
This place looks familiar.

403
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,515
Is it the place
where you sobered up last time?

404
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,850
What? You don't like it?

405
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,760
Yes, I do.

406
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,810
(Secrets of Fate Revealed)

407
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:06,760
(Blossom's Smile)

408
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,720
My last visit here was exciting.

409
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,040
The inner city is heavily guarded.

410
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,093
Are you saying Yan Shao...

411
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,890
Guards are stationed at the corners
of the loft and the outer city

412
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,426
with a flexible defense strategy.

413
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:21,004
If anything happens in one area,

414
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,280
nearby guards can quickly
move in to help.

415
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,970
You planned it out well.

416
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,410
One jar of Hundred-Year Brew
and three side dishes.

417
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:37,130
(Fragrance Miles Away)

418
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,890
Hundred-Year Brew?

419
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:46,240
Why is the wine called that?

420
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,450
This wine was crafted
by both the owner and his wife.

421
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,650
They share a deep love.

422
00:21:49,693 --> 00:21:51,848
Since their ages combined
are nearly a hundred years,

423
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,610
the wine is called Hundred-Year Brew.

424
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,850
Shaoci said

425
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,715
we shouldn't drink
while handling business.

426
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,850
Let's guess

427
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,560
how old the owner is.

428
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:05,850
Do you know?

429
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,280
This wine carries the depth of time.

430
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,930
A sip feels like gaining insight
into life itself,

431
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,130
and like watching the clouds drift by
without worry.

432
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,130
So, I'd say the owner is over sixty.

433
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,240
Then his wife is probably
in her thirties.

434
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,890
Feng, you're the smart one.

435
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,560
Smell that.

436
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,690
There's a faint, fruity fragrance.

437
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:32,650
Adding fresh fruit notes to the wine

438
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,970
means the owner's wife

439
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,080
must be young and full of life.

440
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:38,690
Not necessarily.

441
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,040
Mister, Madam.

442
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,450
Your wine is truly excellent today.

443
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:47,800
As long as you enjoy it, sir.

444
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
A younger husband
with a much older wife?

445
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,480
Were ancient folks this open-minded

446
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
about age gaps?

447
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,000
The owner's wife, Lihua Bai,

448
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,130
is a master brewer.

449
00:22:57,315 --> 00:22:58,800
She dedicated her life to making wine

450
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,650
and refused to marry.

451
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,930
Until she met Qianjin Xiao

452
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,130
who is also her only apprentice.

453
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,450
The two fell in love,

454
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,800
and no one objected.

455
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:12,471
You knew that and didn't tell me?

456
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,210
Dear guests,

457
00:23:14,382 --> 00:23:15,715
how are you enjoying the wine?

458
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,130
I am Qianjin Xiao,

459
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,280
and this is my wife, Lihua Bai.

460
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,760
You're my idol.

461
00:23:24,293 --> 00:23:25,410
You two are perfect together.

462
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,560
It's rare to find a guest

463
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,848
who appreciates our wine so much.

464
00:23:28,915 --> 00:23:30,170
I'll treat you to a jar

465
00:23:30,515 --> 00:23:31,871
from my century-old collection.

466
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,930
Oh, that is so generous of you.

467
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,450
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

468
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:57,320
I'm not drinking.

470
00:24:11,382 --> 00:24:12,210
Welcome, mister.

471
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,240
May your business prosper.

472
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:15,493
Please come inside.

473
00:24:15,515 --> 00:24:16,271
Thank you.

475
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,720
Mister,

476
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,040
shall I bring you a fresh batch
of our latest brew?

477
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,410
That's exactly what I was hoping for.
And add two small dishes, please.

478
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,471
Coming right away.

479
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
- Here, Wanci.
- Thank you.

480
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,560
Look, there's a fortune teller there.

481
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,650
I've heard blind fortune tellers
are the most accurate.

482
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:43,930
Not necessarily.

483
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,040
Seems like you don't know.

484
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,800
Actually, not all fortune tellers

485
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:01,560
are blind.

486
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,970
See? I can see.

487
00:25:04,293 --> 00:25:06,160
Mister, what kind of reading do you do?

488
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,410
I may not be the best.

489
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,850
But I understand the mysteries of fate.

490
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,850
I can foresee both fortune
and misfortune in life.

491
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:15,040
With the sun and moon in my palm

492
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,720
and the universe hidden within,
nothing escapes my sight.

493
00:25:23,226 --> 00:25:24,130
Go on, take a seat.

494
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,280
Then foretell

495
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,850
what I want to ask.

496
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,520
How about this?

497
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,040
Whether it's love, wealth,

498
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,970
blessings, or spirits,

499
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,280
I can answer anything
honestly and fairly.

500
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:40,426
What do you think?

501
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,720
That impressive?

502
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,370
Then tell me about my wealth.

503
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,320
Your finances?

504
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,610
Yes.

505
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,170
Easy.

506
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,690
Then please

507
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,040
draw a fortune slip.

508
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,404
Please draw one.

509
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:54,970
Give me a good draw.

510
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,370
Give me

511
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,890
a good draw.

512
00:25:58,048 --> 00:26:00,080
Drifting like falling petals,
carried by the wind?

513
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,610
Let me take a look.

514
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:04,890
Drifting like falling petals,
carried by the wind.

515
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,426
Sweet at first but
with a subtle bitterness.

516
00:26:08,426 --> 00:26:10,420
Blown away by the wind.

517
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,000
It means a life of wandering
with no place to call home.

518
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,930
You probably grew up
without many family members,

519
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:22,000
without inheritance or land,
and without elders to take care of.

520
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,370
So

521
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,850
it means leaving the past behind

522
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,800
and marrying far from home.

523
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,480
So, I have no home, no elders,

524
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,471
and I'll be sent far away in marriage?

525
00:26:35,048 --> 00:26:36,071
That's a terrible fortune.

526
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,760
Well, a bad draw could be a lucky draw.

527
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,000
Haven't you heard

528
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,930
that a bad fortune
can be a blessing in disguise?

529
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,800
Wanci, let's go and check it out too.

530
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,800
Come on. It looks interesting.

531
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,560
Marrying far from home
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

532
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,610
If someone never finds their true love,

533
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,280
what's the point
of having acres of land?

534
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,850
So it's a good draw.

535
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,080
You have a point.

536
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,240
Yingluo. Wanci.
Why don't you try as well?

537
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,480
Feel free to draw one.

538
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,930
Wanci, here.

539
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:16,720
(Spring crabapple blossoms
under the moon.)

540
00:27:18,469 --> 00:27:20,020
(A person gazing at flowers
by the water.)

541
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,280
How about letting me read it?

542
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,080
Here, mister.

543
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,650
Spring crabapple blossoms
under the moon.

544
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,410
The book says it clearly.

545
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,480
Unrequited love brings nothing
but heartbreak.

546
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,720
Looking back, the person you long
for is already far away.

547
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,210
Miss, if you hold onto this love
too tightly,

548
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,800
you won't just hurt yourself
but others as well.

549
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:45,930
It could even take a toll
on your health.

550
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,890
It's like poison.
Bitter yet willingly swallowed.

551
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:51,560
Good.

552
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,970
Well said.

553
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,080
Wanci, come.

554
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:55,850
Take a seat.

555
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,130
Have a seat.

556
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,850
Let's see what your fortune says.

557
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,690
All right.

558
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,080
Good.

559
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,040
Gazing at flowers by the water.

560
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,890
Gazing at flowers by the water,
slender willows swaying in the wind.

561
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,040
This means you were born
with a weak constitution.

562
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,410
But you come from a wealthy family.

563
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,690
So, in this lifetime,

564
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,520
you'll always be well provided for,
and your wishes will likely come true.

565
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,370
It's a good draw.

566
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,610
Thank you, mister.

567
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,890
No need to pay me yet.

568
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,520
What's on your mind right now

569
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,690
is like a mirage.

570
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,450
It's beautiful but out of reach.

571
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,690
Just a piece of advice.

572
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,850
If you become too fixated on it,

573
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,690
it might not end well.

574
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,450
It's just a few words.

575
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,810
So don't take it too seriously.

576
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,760
Yes, exactly.

577
00:28:54,671 --> 00:28:55,671
The food is getting cold.

578
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:56,650
Let's go back and eat.

579
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,210
Reality is what you choose to accept.

580
00:28:59,315 --> 00:29:00,310
That's right. Let's go.

581
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,210
Wanci, let's go. Don't dwell on it.

582
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,240
(Tiangang members have gathered.
Waiting for the next step.)

583
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,410
(Meet up with Feng Ming.)

584
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:13,410
How was the reading?

585
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,690
Not bad.

586
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,850
Waiter!

587
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:16,850
Go get your fortune read.

588
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,240
Sir, what can I do for you?

589
00:29:20,537 --> 00:29:21,520
A pot of fine tea.

590
00:29:21,537 --> 00:29:22,370
Coming right up.

591
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,671
The inner city gates now
have additional checkpoints.

592
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:11,248
It's being handled
by Hall Master Feng and Hall Master Lu.

593
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,170
