19
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,080
Father.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,609
The Ghost Valley Sect

21
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,871
is pressuring various sects.

22
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,050
Many have already wavered

23
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,640
and declared their allegiance to them.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,720
It seems a final battle is inevitable.

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,690
Master Lin.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,160
Master Lin,

27
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,671
someone sent Liu An back.

28
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:11,270
(Yuchi Manor)

29
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,770
Liu An?

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,210
Who could have done

31
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,800
Yuchi Manor such a huge favor?

32
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,360
Perhaps some mysterious benefactor.

33
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,610
Master,

34
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,520
could it be you?

35
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,582
Interrogate the traitor.

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,450
Find out exactly

37
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,680
how she colluded with Ghost Valley Sect.

38
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,890
Father,

39
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,120
be careful as this could be a trap.

40
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,182
We should imprison Liu An first

41
00:02:40,204 --> 00:02:41,693
and question her thoroughly later.

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,640
Take her away.

43
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,170
Still looking, huh?

44
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,050
You scared me.

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,080
What happened?

46
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,648
Go inside and see for yourself.

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,120
Who did this?

48
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,960
Ghost Valley Sect is bound
to make a move sooner or later.

49
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,170
Now, there's no avoiding it.

50
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,490
They're already at our doorstep.

51
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,604
What's there to run from?

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,170
We've always had a strong alliance
with Yuchi Manor.

53
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,840
Now that they've openly opposed
the Ghost Valley Sect,

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
we've become a target

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,560
as well.

56
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,680
Yuchi Manor is much stronger
than we are.

57
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,560
Now,

58
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,360
even they're struggling
to hold them off.

59
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,680
Right now,

60
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,800
we need to discuss a plan

61
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,330
with them.

62
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,626
I'm heading there now.

63
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,560
Linglong!

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Why isn't this working?

65
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't understand this thing either.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,610
Sister Rong, Brother Shaoci
is looking for us.

67
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,182
He says there's something urgent.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Yu is here.

69
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,120
So let her come.

70
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,782
Something happened at her sect.

71
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,490
Let's go.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,090
(Boardroom)
This is the current situation.

73
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,800
I don't wish for Yuchi Manor

74
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,560
to suffer further because of this.

75
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,490
Spirit Fox Sect
and the Yuchi Manor are sworn allies.

76
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,930
We have always supported each other.

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,960
Now that the Yu family is in trouble...

78
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,582
What's going on?

79
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:46,880
We should lend a hand

80
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,930
and fight Ghost Valley Sect together.

81
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,004
You have come all the way
to Yuchi Manor.

82
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,850
That alone proves your loyalty.

83
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,493
How could she possibly side
with Ghost Valley Sect?

84
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,090
Even so,

85
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,970
Yuchi Manor is struggling

86
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,360
to survive as it is.

87
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,440
How can we afford to help others?

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,120
If you ask me,

89
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,050
this might just be a diversion

90
00:05:10,137 --> 00:05:12,315
that Ghost Valley Sect set up
to lure us into a trap.

91
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,360
I came today

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,970
to seek allies,

93
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,970
not to drag Yuchi Manor into danger.

94
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,760
I understand
Hall Master Feng's concerns.

95
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,090
If anyone still has doubts,

96
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,930
then just pretend I was never here.

97
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,850
Yu, wait.

98
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,730
Everyone,

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,850
are we really not helping
Spirit Fox Sect?

100
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,930
Even if we only think
of protecting ourselves,

101
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,800
how will we establish ourselves

102
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,290
in the martial arts world in the future?

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,360
Young Master Lin has a point.

104
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,090
If the other sects fall
under Ghost Valley Sect's control,

105
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,120
the alliance will fall.

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,680
After that, Yuchi Manor may be

107
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,970
in a more dangerous situation.

108
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,530
At that point, they will be unstoppable.

109
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,410
Unless

110
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,200
Tiangang intervenes.

111
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,680
Father,

112
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,410
I wish to go with Yu to Spirit Fox Sect

113
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,537
and see the situation myself.

114
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,170
Go.

115
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,560
Yes, Father.

116
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,120
Yan Shao, are you interested
in coming along?

117
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,760
That's what I had in mind.

118
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,000
Same here.

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,200
We're going too.

120
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:58,648
I take full responsibility
for my actions.

121
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,170
So you don't have to worry.

122
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,360
Who captured you?

123
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,530
Was it Yan Shao?

124
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,915
He's even more unfathomable
than we imagined.

125
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,426
Young Lady Lin,
you should be more cautious

126
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,960
when you act alone.

127
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,440
I can handle it myself.

128
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,650
You don't have to worry.

129
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,560
Shaoci and Yan Shao
are not in the manor now.

130
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,650
You've worked for me,

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,680
so I won't abandon you.

132
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,360
Young Lady Lin, don't bother.

133
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,360
None of this matters

134
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,730
to me anymore.

135
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,970
What did Yan Shao say to you?

136
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:02,510
(Spirit Fox Sect)

137
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,640
(Four Seas Hall)
Second Brother.

138
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,182
Linglong.

139
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,170
Welcome, everyone.

140
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,737
Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner.

141
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,440
Please, come in.

142
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:12,515
Have a seat.

143
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,650
Make yourselves comfortable.

144
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,850
I have some matters to arrange.

145
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,960
Then I'll be back.

146
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:18,737
Second Brother,

147
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,090
where's Eldest Brother?

148
00:08:20,382 --> 00:08:21,715
He's out handling some matters.

149
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,000
What matters?

150
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,680
You'll know when he's done.

151
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,970
I'll be right back.

152
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Doesn't this all seem
a bit strange to you?

153
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,871
Second Brother.

154
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,982
Why are you here
instead of staying in the main hall

155
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,010
with the guests?

156
00:08:56,493 --> 00:08:58,440
I've never seen
those disciples outside before.

157
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,650
Are they new?

158
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,315
People come and go
in the martial world all the time.

159
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,448
Eldest Brother has always admired
Young Master Lin.

160
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,537
Now that they're here
to help Spirit Fox Sect,

161
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,840
it would be rude for him

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
not to greet them.

163
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,250
Eldest Brother...

164
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,320
What happened to him?

165
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,480
He has decided
to join Ghost Valley Sect.

166
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,960
I had no choice

167
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,250
but to imprison him
along with the disciples

168
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,170
who followed him.

169
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:25,010
You should go and see them.

170
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,290
Sister Rong,

171
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,840
why do you

172
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,010
keep pacing around?

173
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,770
What's taking Yu Linglong so long?

174
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,250
Perhaps she's been delayed.

175
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,537
I'll go look for her.

176
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,320
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

177
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:53,537
Please take a seat.

178
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:01,550
Our sect has suffered
a great misfortune.

179
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,893
We are grateful for your help.

180
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,604
Please, accept this tea as a token
of our gratitude.

181
00:10:38,893 --> 00:10:39,600
Please enter.

182
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,250
This way.

183
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,760
(Four Seas Hall)

184
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,890
The people you want are there.

185
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,440
Where is the thing
you promised to give me?

186
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,480
Attack!

187
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,050
Hey, Yellow-Robed!

188
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,515
Are you surrendering or not?

189
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,080
You dare betray Ghost Valley Sect?

190
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,290
Or was this all a trap you set together

191
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,410
from the start?

192
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:46,930
I...

193
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:47,804
Second Brother Yu,

194
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,720
we accept your goodwill.

195
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,800
But don't let that Yellow-Robed
hurt you.

196
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,250
You...

197
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,800
Kill him!

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,650
Someone, save me!

199
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,800
You...

200
00:12:11,604 --> 00:12:13,560
- Linglong...
- You still dare to show your face?

201
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,480
Linglong...

202
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,560
Their antidote...

203
00:12:57,004 --> 00:12:58,130
Stop chasing them.

204
00:12:58,226 --> 00:13:00,404
We don't know how many
of them are still outside.

205
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,650
You,

206
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,010
look at these dead bodies.

207
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,800
They all died because of you!

208
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,982
Ghost Valley Sect planted a spy
within Spirit Fox Sect

209
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
and poisoned everyone.

210
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,050
The poison wasn't lethal.

211
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,982
But it drained everyone's strength,

212
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:24,580
leaving them powerless
against the enemy.

213
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:25,271
That's right.

214
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,290
The moment Linglong left,
we felt weak all over.

215
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,930
But how did they manage

216
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,440
to poison so many people?

217
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:33,715
The water supply.

218
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,480
That's my guess too.

219
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,448
I had no choice.

220
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,200
So I made a deal with Ghost Valley Sect

221
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,800
to hand over Young Master Lin
and the others

222
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,448
in exchange for your survival

223
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,248
along with the rest
of our sect's disciples.

224
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,010
If Young Master Lin and Yan Shao

225
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,271
hadn't come prepared,

226
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:56,982
they would have died because of you.

227
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:59,293
Between saving our own people
and saving outsiders,

228
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:00,448
we could only choose one.

229
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,530
If it were you,

230
00:14:01,648 --> 00:14:02,982
what would you have chosen?

231
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:03,782
I...

232
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,530
You think you've done nothing wrong.

233
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,650
But after this incident,

234
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,648
how will Spirit Fox Sect set a foothold
in the martial world?

235
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,440
Look at the disciples
who got killed because of you.

236
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
How will you answer for their deaths?

237
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,200
Eldest Brother,

238
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,370
Linglong.

239
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,204
I have let you both down.

240
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,930
As for those who died because of me,

241
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,290
I will give them an answer myself.

242
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,930
Second Brother!

243
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,770
Second Brother!

244
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,930
Second Brother.

245
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:37,720
Second Brother!

246
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,800
Second Brother.

247
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,960
Second Brother...

248
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:43,770
Second Brother...

249
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,530
They have gone too far!

250
00:14:55,626 --> 00:14:57,800
Ghost Valley Sect stops
at nothing to achieve their goals

251
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:59,010
and is absolutely ruthless.

252
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,130
We should focus on strengthening
our defenses,

253
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,290
not act recklessly.

254
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,050
Have you gotten
too comfortable living in peace?

255
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,410
What are you saying?

256
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,800
I only say not to act rashly.

257
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,693
Hall Masters, please calm down.

258
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,770
Father and I both have a plan.

259
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,050
Reckless bravery

260
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,650
won't accomplish anything.

261
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,204
No matter how much we guard
against them,

262
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,290
we still keep suffering their attacks.

263
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,370
Shukuang,

264
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,290
what do you think about this?

265
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,093
(Why is he suddenly putting me
on the spot?)

266
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,250
I think

267
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,930
the best defense is offense.

268
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,680
It's time we plan a counterattack

269
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,770
against Ghost Valley Sect.

270
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,410
Yan Shao, what do you think?

271
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Throughout history,

272
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,890
there have been alliances like those

273
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,160
between Gongsun Yan and Su Qin.

274
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,080
To defeat the Ghost Valley Sect,

275
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,770
we need to form alliances
with various sects

276
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,680
and fight together.

277
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,382
Only then do we have a chance
of victory.

278
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
Well said, Yan Shao.

279
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:13,115
The various sects
in the martial arts world

280
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,026
are scattered.

281
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:15,050
If we want to unite them,

282
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,560
I fear only Yuchi Manor has
the influence to lead such an effort.

283
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Father and Shaoci

284
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,320
have great reputations
in the martial world.

285
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,770
If you rally the righteous sects,

286
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,410
I believe they will follow Yuchi Manor

287
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:27,093
in resisting the Ghost Valley Sect.

288
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,248
I am willing to fight
against Ghost Valley Sect.

289
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,080
I will follow Master Lin into battle!

290
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:37,600
Good!

291
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,082
(Boardroom)

292
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:45,720
What's wrong?

293
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,071
Are you scared?

294
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:48,960
No.

295
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:50,770
Shukuang,

296
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,530
has your martial strength recovered?

297
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,440
Not yet.

298
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,890
But I am learning blade techniques
from my master.

299
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,600
You were struck by Mystic Ice Jade Palm,

300
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,560
which severely damaged
your internal strength.

301
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,090
I've been giving you medicine

302
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,810
for some time now,

303
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,410
but why hasn't the cold poison
been purged yet?

304
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,090
Her condition has improved.

305
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,930
But she still needs more time.

306
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,330
By the way,

307
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,960
I heard Yan Shao risked his life

308
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,493
to save Shukuang at Spirit Fox Sect.

309
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:18,760
How touching.

310
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,280
If I'm in danger one day,

311
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,650
would you also risk your life
to save me?

312
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,130
Young Lady Lin,
you are exceptionally clever.

313
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,280
How could you possibly end up in danger?

314
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,480
A delicate lady always needs a hero

315
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,000
to rescue her.

316
00:17:32,493 --> 00:17:34,404
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

317
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,000
Saving a beauty

318
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,760
is an honor that I wouldn't mind taking.

319
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,890
All right, then it's settled.

320
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,410
If I ever find myself in trouble,

321
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,226
I'll simply call out for you to save me.

322
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Shukuang,

323
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,537
you wouldn't mind, right?

324
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,480
Of course not.

325
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,370
Why not just have
Yan Shao move into your courtyard?

326
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,480
For personal protection.

327
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,715
Wouldn't that be even better?

328
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,000
Are you upset?

329
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
How could I be?

330
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,890
Yan Shao is so capable.

331
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,480
If you are in danger,

332
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,890
he would surely rush to save you.

333
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,720
By the way,

334
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,000
make sure your voice is loud enough

335
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,330
when you call for help.

336
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,410
My chest is a little tight.

337
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,410
Yan Shao, could you...

338
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,048
What are you doing?

339
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,090
Shukuang...

340
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,370
Let...

341
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,160
Let go of me.

342
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm warning you.

343
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,370
Don't ever speak in that tone again.

344
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,293
What's gotten into you?

345
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,440
Don't all men love

346
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,520
to hear women talk like this?

347
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,520
Men?

348
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,570
Which men?

349
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,680
How many do you know?

350
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,680
Wait a moment.

351
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,130
You're messing with my thoughts.

352
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,650
You and Wanci were the ones

353
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:57,440
talking,

354
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,370
flirting back and forth,

355
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,715
and being all lovey-dovey.

356
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,520
Why am I the one getting lectured now?

357
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,930
There was no flirting

358
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,130
and no lovey-dovey nonsense.

359
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,650
You think I'm blind and deaf?

360
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,850
Rong Shukuang,

361
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,810
remember this.

362
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,520
I can save many people.

363
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:10,890
But the only one I want to save

364
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,960
is you.

365
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,093
Because I paid for it.

366
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,130
That little money isn't enough

367
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,520
to buy my unwavering loyalty.

368
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,240
Master,

369
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,280
should we...

370
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,248
Practice blade techniques.

371
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,480
Practice blade techniques.

372
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,570
Practice it yourself. I'm heading out.

373
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,626
Where are you going?

374
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:42,537
Take me with you.

375
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,715
Drinking at a pleasure house.
Not suitable for you.

376
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,810
Drinking at a pleasure house?

377
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,440
I'll beat you to death!

378
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,000
Drinking at a pleasure house, huh?

379
00:19:58,382 --> 00:19:59,410
- Yan Shao.
- Yan Shao.

380
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:03,293
Any progress on the antidote
for Crimson Lotus Heart poison?

381
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,810
We've looked into it.

382
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,360
The poison has been lost to history.

383
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
So it's not easy

384
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,960
to find a cure.

385
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,090
But don't worry.

386
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,480
The martial world is vast.

387
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,890
There must be a way.

388
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,537
Send a message to Ruthless Parlor.

389
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,720
Have Jin Buyao deliver it
to Helian Huanwu.

390
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,170
She might be able to find a cure.

391
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,370
Understood.

392
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,130
Impatience

393
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,130
and greed

394
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,850
are the greatest enemies
of a martial artist.

395
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,071
As a master,
you have no heart for teaching.

396
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,240
You're always thinking
about drinking at pleasure houses

397
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:09,000
and scolding me.

398
00:21:14,848 --> 00:21:16,293
Between a blade and the wielder,

399
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:18,160
it's not an opponent
to be fought against.

400
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,480
You must learn to see it

401
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,890
as a part of yourself.

402
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,040
Adapt to it

403
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,404
and understand it.

404
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:26,380
♪Spinning through my heart,
my dreams, the endless Jianghu♪

405
00:21:26,398 --> 00:21:29,408
♪A fateful turn,
where love and hearts collide♪

406
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,706
♪Ah, such a blissful tide♪

407
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,760
This blade feels like
it has a mind of its own.

408
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,090
It refuses to obey me.

409
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:39,740
♪Blades in chaos,
the world in turmoil, tangled ties♪

410
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,871
A blade isn't lifeless.

411
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,720
You must learn how to get along

412
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,410
and communicate with it.

413
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:48,887
♪One single glance,
my heart takes flight♪

414
00:21:49,669 --> 00:21:52,825
♪I've heard tales of love and vengeance,
left forgotten in the tide♪

415
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,293
♪And the first sight of starry rain
in desert brings a profound heartache♪

416
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:59,650
♪But I don't know, I don't know,
how long this moment will abide♪

417
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,626
♪Yet here and now,
for this one soul, I stand beside♪

418
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:05,040
I think I'm starting to feel it.

419
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:08,570
The more I try to control it,

420
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,170
the more it resists me.

421
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:12,610
Understanding that
is already impressive.

422
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:15,130
♪Yet this moment stirs the ache inside♪

423
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,982
Was the wine at the pleasure house good?

424
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,480
I take back what I said.

425
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,890
I meant

426
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,170
if you go drinking at a pleasure house,

427
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,040
why not bring me along?

428
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
When you've mastered
the blade techniques,

429
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,330
I'll take you.

430
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:32,582
Master, rest assured.

431
00:22:32,648 --> 00:22:33,680
I will work hard.

432
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,520
Master,

433
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,760
not just drinking.

434
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,137
And the red-light districts,
visiting the brothels,

435
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:39,604
and listening to music, or songs.

436
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:41,680
I'm interested in all of it!
Take me with you!

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,650
Tang Yingluo,

438
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,440
do you martial artists

439
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,810
have anything I could eat or drink

440
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,960
to greatly boost my strength?

441
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,440
Sister Rong,

442
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,810
you're scaring me.

443
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,370
Seeing your demeanor,

444
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,720
I thought you were going to ask me

445
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,715
for something
that could help you kill someone.

446
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,200
Either way, I just need something

447
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,160
that increases internal strength

448
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,560
to help with blade training.

449
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,515
Do you have anything?

450
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:10,048
Before I overheard Hall Master Song
and Hall Master Feng sneaking around

451
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:12,826
with some secret pill recipe.

452
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,130
They said taking it would cause
a sudden surge in martial power.

453
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,650
A sudden surge?

454
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,090
Was it made with this?

455
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,330
That's poisonous.

456
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,440
I've met Mrs. Feng before.

457
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,610
She's a remarkable woman,

458
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,610
a true martial heroine.

459
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,330
Hall Master Feng usually

460
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,930
gets completely overpowered by his wife.

461
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,240
But after taking that pill,

462
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,760
he actually defeated her.

463
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,000
That proves how effective it is.

464
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,370
Not that.

465
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,850
I need something
that will instantly boost

466
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,039
my internal strength.

467
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:44,782
Do you have it?

468
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,200
I don't have it.

469
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,480
Come on, Sister Rong!

470
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,650
But

471
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
I know a mysterious place

472
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,871
where you can find
the secret prescription you need.

473
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,720
Here?

474
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,182
Why didn't you just say so earlier?

475
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,650
All this disguise is for nothing.

476
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,330
I've been here before.

477
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,680
It's my first time here.

478
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,760
Wearing like a mysterious person

479
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,850
in my own house is suffocating.

480
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,520
Well,

481
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,330
dressing up is for the ambiance.

482
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,570
But

483
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,330
why did you come here last time?

484
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,200
One night,

485
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,570
I followed my master here.

486
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,760
In the middle of the night?

487
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,137
You and Yan Shao came here to...

488
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:39,760
It's not what you think!

489
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,410
Quit imagining nonsense.

490
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,720
I'm not imagining anything.

491
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,520
You don't have to be so flustered.

492
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,850
I won't ask

493
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,130
or say a word.

494
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,960
But

495
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,090
you know?

496
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,000
The look in your eyes doesn't lie

497
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,850
when you look at Yan Shao.

498
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,200
What look?

499
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,040
Sparkling eyes.

500
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,570
Your eyes sparkled with admiration,

501
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,804
like you were seeing stars.

502
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,960
Back then,

503
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,090
you looked at Brother Shaoci like that

504
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,200
sometimes.

505
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,090
Let's not bring up him.

506
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,810
But

507
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,440
ever since Yan Shao came along,

508
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,170
the only time I see your sparkling eyes

509
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,930
is when you look at him.

510
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,240
Sister Rong,

511
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,650
he's your master now.

512
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,915
You shouldn't have improper thoughts
about their master.

513
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,130
Says who?

514
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,200
So conservative at such a young age.

515
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,240
Sister Rong, look.

516
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:39,693
So many secret prescriptions
for strengthening the body here.

517
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,370
This one.

518
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,680
Five Venom Vitality Pill

519
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,930
requires extracting
the five deadliest poisons in the world.

520
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,440
In cases of inner strength deviation,

521
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,048
it uses poison to counter poison and...

522
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,520
You probably don't need this.

523
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,520
I'll keep looking.

524
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,130
Go on.

525
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,515
Golden Elixir Herbs' prescription.

526
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,271
Time to go.

527
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,520
Let's get out of here.

528
00:26:17,848 --> 00:26:19,026
What are you doing?

529
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,200
As a martial artist,

530
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,810
I'm still too weak.

531
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:26,280
What am I lacking?

532
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:30,026
(The antidote for Crimson Lotus Heart
hasn't been found yet.)

533
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,810
(I can't tell her about it yet.)

534
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:34,537
Your physical strength is unstable.

535
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:36,671
That's why you can't regulate
your breath properly.

536
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,000
Didn't you say my internal strength
wasn't completely gone?

537
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,280
If the Mystic Ice Jade Palm

538
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,520
was truly that powerful,

539
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,404
then why do I still have some
of my internal strength left?

540
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:49,480
I don't know.

541
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,515
Maybe your body constitution is special.

542
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,004
Then when
will this unreliable internal strength

543
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:55,440
of mine fully recover?

544
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:57,270
Before the battle
with Ghost Valley Sect,

545
00:26:57,271 --> 00:26:58,382
will I be able to fight?

546
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,280
Haste makes waste.

547
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,680
You must not be reckless.

548
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,000
But I'm Rong Shukuang,

549
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,930
the greatest swordsman in the land,

550
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,200
and the strongest heroine
of Yuchi Manor.

551
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,240
How can I not have martial arts?

552
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,315
Your duty is to protect me.

553
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,810
Shukuang's duty
is to protect all of Yuchi Manor.

554
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,090
When I first lost my memory,

555
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:25,960
I thought

556
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:29,000
the manor had nothing to do with me.

557
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,130
But now,

558
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:31,890
I don't know why

559
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,850
it feels like home

560
00:27:35,426 --> 00:27:37,093
and I have to protect it.

561
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,890
I also want
to be the real Rong Shukuang.

562
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,650
The real Rong Shukuang?

563
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,090
I am Rong Shukuang.

564
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,810
I have things to do. So I'm leaving.

565
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,370
Where are you rushing off to?

566
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:58,720
Some lady's things.

567
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,410
So don't ask.

568
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,680
The real Rong Shukuang?

569
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,930
- Come here.
- No, Yingluo.

570
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,890
I really don't want to eat
that giant toad!

571
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:11,404
- Forget it.
- It's not just a toad.

572
00:28:11,448 --> 00:28:12,471
It's a miraculous remedy.

573
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,715
Do it for your martial arts recovery
and Yuchi Manor!

574
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:15,680
No.

575
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,960
- Right here.
- Wait.

576
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,890
Can't we try something else?

577
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,650
This one is huge!

578
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,370
Look at it!

579
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,570
I got it!

580
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,130
No!

581
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,850
Tang Yingluo, put it down!

582
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,890
What? It looks fine to me.

583
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,715
Gallbladder of a patterned snake,

584
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:47,040
toad venom,

585
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,480
red spiders,

586
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
scorpions,

587
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,650
lizard tails,

588
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,570
and

589
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,000
a virgin boy's urine.

590
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,410
How is this Century Dawn Elixir?

591
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,720
It's more like a death pill.

592
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,090
If I swallow that down,

593
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:59,370
I'll be dead on the spot.

594
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,240
About that giant toad just now,

595
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,850
I swear, I saw it fly!

596
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,440
Its eyes

597
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,570
were bulging.

598
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,204
Like this. See?

599
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:06,250
It was looking at me like,

600
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,090
"You dare eat me?

601
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,170
Where are your manners?"

602
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,650
Just forget about it.

603
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,200
I should up martial arts.

604
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,315
Maybe I should learn
to use hidden weapons instead.

605
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,330
In that case,

606
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,240
I'll teach you lightness techniques.

607
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,930
Lightness techniques?

608
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,330
I could never fly over rooftops.

609
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,090
All those martial arts movies

610
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,170
where people just fly into the sky,

611
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,570
it was clearly fake.

612
00:29:28,004 --> 00:29:29,982
The lightness techniques
you have in mind

613
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:32,515
and the one I'm about to teach you
are two different things.

614
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,200
Oh? Then enlighten me.

615
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,760
Lightness techniques

616
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,200
boil down to speed and adaptability.

617
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,410
For example,

618
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,890
you run and I chase you.

619
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:47,890
Master,

620
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,280
come and catch me.

621
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,440
I like this!

622
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,826
I want to learn this technique!

623
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:05,930
All right.

624
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,680
Come.

625
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,515
Close your eyes.

626
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,293
Falling flowers chasing
the flowing water.

627
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,115
Think.

628
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:24,370
Is the flowers moving or the water?

629
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:29,560
Both the flowers
and the water are moving.

630
00:30:29,693 --> 00:30:31,090
No, think again.

631
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
The water moves.

632
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,200
The flowers just drift along.

633
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,370
Think again.

634
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,480
Got it?

635
00:30:49,293 --> 00:30:51,515
Falling flowers chasing
the flowing water.

636
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,930
They move together.

637
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,480
But because they move together,

638
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,720
they appear still.

639
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,226
Kites fluttering in the wind,

640
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:02,382
falling flowers chasing
the flowing water.
