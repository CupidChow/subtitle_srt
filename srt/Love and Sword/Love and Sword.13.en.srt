(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 13=

19
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,200
Master,

20
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:50,471
I have something to tell you.

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,360
You can't leave without any explanation!

22
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,920
Are you in such a hurry

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,240
because you have something urgent
to say to Yan Shao?

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,200
He already left the manor.

25
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:18,330
It's a pity that he didn't get to wear
the new clothes I prepared for him.

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,890
Did he tell you where he was going?

27
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,760
You look so lost.

28
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,240
Could it be you have feelings
for Yan Shao?

29
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,800
Too bad he's already gone.

30
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:37,220
(Bonded Contract)

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Where is he heading?

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
No one knows.

33
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,760
He didn't tell anyone.

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,450
I thought you would know.

35
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,290
But it looks like

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,410
you don't know either.

37
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,410
Shukuang,

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,330
Yan Shao may have stayed
by your side all this time.

39
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,330
But he never truly gave you his heart.

40
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,640
Most men are like that.

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,570
So don't be too sad.

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,010
Leader Shen,

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,330
someone sent a message.

44
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,410
"The fragrance of Fluttering Fragrance
lingers on Yan and Rong.

45
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,240
The butterflies can trace their path."

46
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,170
(Kindly Accept)
Using our own plan against us.

47
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,170
Interesting.

48
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,560
Very interesting.

49
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:01,071
Ever since Yan Shao left,

50
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,910
Young Lady Rong
seems like a different person.

51
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,093
She spends all day practicing
her blade techniques.

52
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
But

53
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,819
her movements
have grown faster and sharper.

54
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,893
Her martial skills
must have fully recovered by now.

55
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,150
They say Ghost Valley Sect
will besiege Yuchi Manor soon.

56
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,850
One more fighter means
one more chance at survival.

57
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,480
(Just focus on perfecting)

58
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,730
(the Starlit Descent.)

59
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:20,970
(Watch closely.)

60
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,210
(Relax)

61
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,290
(and focus.)

62
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,782
(Gather your strength in your hands.)

63
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,871
(You need to regulate your breathing,)

64
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,800
(and allow your blade to move
as your heart commands.)

65
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,010
(Marriage Proposal.
Chu Tianyao of Tiangang)

66
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,000
This demand is absolutely outrageous!

67
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,050
How can Yuchi Manor allow itself

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,730
to be ordered around like this?

69
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,920
The Leader of Tiangang dares

70
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,050
to make such a request?

71
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,410
Father,

72
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,360
we cannot accept this.

73
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,120
We still do not know
Shukuang's stance on this.

74
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Why are you so anxious?

75
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,880
You're saying we must rely
on a woman's marriage

76
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,530
to secure this alliance.

77
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
Martial Brother Chu's son

78
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,120
is not exactly an outsider.

79
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,800
No matter what,

80
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,048
I won't agree to this!

81
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,920
Shaoci.

82
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,320
Father.

83
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,610
Shaoci.

84
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,610
What's wrong?

85
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:43,800
Shukuang,

86
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,090
come.

87
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,360
Sit down.

88
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,920
The Ghost Valley Sect is about
to attack Yuchi Manor.

89
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,770
We've been negotiating an alliance
with Tiangang.

90
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,770
But their leader, Chu Tianyao wants

91
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,850
to form a marital alliance
with our Yuchi Manor.

92
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,320
He wants to marry you.

93
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,000
Marry me?

94
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,290
Don't worry.

95
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,610
We will never agree to such terms.

96
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,248
And I would never accept it.

97
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,440
You came here

98
00:07:16,515 --> 00:07:17,530
for other matters, right?

99
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,650
I want to ask you

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
where Yan Shao went.

101
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,920
I entrusted him

102
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,320
with the alliance negotiations.

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,050
It was his people

104
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,871
who delivered Chu Tianyao's
marriage proposal.

105
00:07:33,222 --> 00:07:36,050
(Marriage Proposal.
Chu Tianyao of Tiangang)

106
00:07:36,893 --> 00:07:40,610
He sent someone to deliver the proposal?

107
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,410
Yan Shao

108
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,120
is also a member of Tiangang.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,970
Who

110
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,530
is this leader?

111
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,240
His name is Chu Tianyao.

112
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,240
He lives in seclusion at Mount Moye

113
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:56,560
and is my martial brother's adopted son.

114
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,360
He's an elusive

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,560
and mysterious person.

116
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,320
Only a few have ever seen him.

117
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,090
A few years ago,
he founded the Tiangang organization.

118
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,000
They know every hidden secret

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,530
of the martial world
and they can accomplish things

120
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,770
that ordinary sects cannot.

121
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,050
So

122
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,240
with the Six Great Sects divided,

123
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:22,530
they are unable to unite.

124
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,240
Only Tiangang

125
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,440
can truly aid Yuchi Manor?

126
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,480
At the very least,
Tiangang is trustworthy.

127
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,080
Do you want me to marry their leader?

128
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,600
Of course,

129
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,800
I want you to marry
the one you truly love.

130
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,320
Father,

131
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,370
I'd like to discuss this
with you in private.

132
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,130
So this is what Ghost Valley Sect
has been after all along.

133
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:20,650
The key to unlocking
the Fuxian treasure?

134
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,920
Yes.

135
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,370
When Misty Moon Village
was massacred years ago,

136
00:09:25,871 --> 00:09:27,130
you were the sole survivor.

137
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,560
I brought you to Yuchi Manor

138
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,890
and hid one of the keys here.

139
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,650
I had planned to give it to you
once you were grown.

140
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,800
One of the keys?

141
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,080
Outsiders don't know

142
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,010
that there are two keys.

143
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,490
Only by combining them

144
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,720
can the treasure's
mechanism be unlocked.

145
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,130
Where is the other key?

146
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:48,170
It's in the hands
of the Tiangang's leader.

147
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,050
He proposed

148
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,960
that as a betrothal gift,

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,530
only by marriage with Yuchi Manor

150
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,130
can our sects form an alliance

151
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,720
and unlock the treasure together.

152
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,250
( I knew it.)

153
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,050
(This so-called leader)

154
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,320
(is only after the treasure.)

155
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,770
(Marriage?)

156
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:06,050
(What a nice way to put it.)

157
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,170
(He just sees me as a pawn.)

158
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,650
You said

159
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,050
Yan Shao is part of Tiangang.

160
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,600
That means he serves Chu Tianyao.

161
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,490
Tiangang may be enigmatic

162
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,560
and unpredictable.

163
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,680
But whenever the martial world
is in crisis,

164
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,080
they always intervene to help.

165
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,800
I've long suspected

166
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,890
that he wasn't an ordinary wanderer.

167
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,320
What did Father say to you?

168
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,170
I will never stand by

169
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,915
and watch you be used
as a bargaining chip.

170
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,050
Shukuang!

171
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,130
I'll marry you.

172
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,410
Have you forgotten?

173
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,370
You once publicly rejected my proposal.

174
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:29,890
Back then, I saw you as family
and as a sibling.

175
00:11:30,115 --> 00:11:31,600
I had no romantic feelings for you.

176
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,960
But ever since you returned
to the manor,

177
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,370
I realized you've changed.

178
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:41,370
I catch myself looking at you
without realizing it.

179
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,600
I find myself thinking

180
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:45,920
about you for no reason at all.

181
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,770
Shukuang,

182
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,800
can you...

183
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,080
Stop, Shaoci.

184
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
We are family.

185
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,960
We always have been
and we always will be.

186
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,550
You're not actually considering marrying
Chu Tianyao, are you?

187
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,720
Are you really going to marry a man

188
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,170
you've never even met?

189
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,320
Did Father force you into this?

190
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:16,680
I'll go talk him out of it.

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,530
Shaoci.

192
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,320
This is something

193
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,530
I want to decide for myself.

194
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:56,600
(Rong Shukuang)
(Since he already left,)

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,650
(there's no reason for me to stay.)

196
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,290
Sending a marriage proposal?

197
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,170
Clearly, he has no feelings for me.

198
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,720
But Yuchi Manor

199
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:16,290
has been kind to me

200
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,050
and Rong Shukuang.

201
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:21,410
I should repay that kindness.

202
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,890
In any case,

203
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,890
marrying this so-called leader

204
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,080
allows me to repay my gratitude

205
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:31,600
and

206
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,010
unlock the treasure map.

207
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:35,490
It's not a bad deal.

208
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,170
Since I'm already here,

209
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,650
I might as well collect

210
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,750
some legendary experiences

211
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,320
to brag about.

212
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,182
(Rong Shukuang)
Since I can't see him anymore,

213
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,890
it doesn't matter where I go.

214
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,890
(When did the person)

215
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,320
(who unknowingly caused me heartache)

216
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,890
(stop being Lin Shaoci?)

217
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:00,800
(Instead...)

218
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,170
(Forget it.)

219
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,080
(He left so ruthlessly)

220
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:07,309
(and sent a marriage proposal
to hurt me even deeper.)

221
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,950
(What's the point of thinking
about him?)

222
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:22,770
Father.

223
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,720
Shukuang?

224
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:31,960
Father,

225
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,890
you have cared for me all these years

226
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,010
as if I were your own.

227
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,320
I will never forget that kindness.

228
00:14:39,826 --> 00:14:41,170
There's no need for such words

229
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:42,920
between father and daughter.

230
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:46,170
I've made my decision.

231
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,560
I will marry Chu Tianyao.

232
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,320
Are you certain?

233
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,080
For Yuchi Manor's sake

234
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,650
and for myself, I am willing.

235
00:14:59,530 --> 00:14:59,960
Also,

236
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,650
when I leave for my wedding,

237
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,440
please spread the word

238
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,130
that Rong Shukuang
is taking the treasure key

239
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,170
and going to Mount Moye.

240
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,410
That way,

241
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,600
Yuchi Manor will no longer
be the primary target

242
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,050
of the Ghost Valley Sect.

243
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,560
You're planning

244
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
to use diversion tactics?

245
00:15:16,693 --> 00:15:18,626
Father, your kindness meant
everything to me.

246
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:22,010
It's only right that I do something
for Yuchi Manor in return.

247
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:25,170
This concerns the fate
of the martial world.

248
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,130
How can I let you, a lady,
bear this burden alone?

249
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,250
Shukuang,

250
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,490
you've already sacrificed too much

251
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,130
for Yuchi Manor.

252
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,370
I've made up my mind.

253
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,770
Please make the arrangements.

254
00:15:40,737 --> 00:15:42,080
I want to leave for Mount Moye

255
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,250
as soon as possible.

256
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,370
All right.

257
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,960
We'll do as you say.

258
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,440
I'll handle everything

259
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,960
for your departure.

260
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,410
(Rong Shukuang, don't take it too hard.)

261
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:57,937
(Once I get the treasure key,
I'll find a way to escape.)

262
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,170
(I'm smart)

263
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,515
(so I'll figure something out.)

264
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,010
Is everything ready?

265
00:16:04,826 --> 00:16:06,680
Yes, everything is set
according to plan.

266
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,010
Shaoci and Yingluo
have already left the city.

267
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,550
I've also arranged for disguised guards

268
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:11,471
to ride ahead

269
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,915
and lure Ghost Valley Sect away.

270
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
All we need to do is travel
with the main convoy

271
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,170
and meet up with Shaoci.

272
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,137
The journey will be long and arduous,

273
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,770
and returning won't be easy.

274
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:25,960
Shukuang,

275
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,582
I packed some dried fruits
and money for you.

276
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
The journey will be exhausting.

277
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,370
So keep these just in case.

278
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:36,080
Thank you for your concern.

279
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
With you gone,

280
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,130
I'll have no one by my side anymore.

281
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,170
I'll miss you.

282
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:43,800
Take care of yourself and rest well.

283
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,200
If I get the chance,

284
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,290
I'll come back to see you.

285
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:48,530
The wind is strong outside.

286
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,600
Go inside before you catch a cold.

287
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,680
Wanci, don't worry.

288
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,440
We'll take good care of Rong.

289
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,440
All right.

290
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,650
Let's go.

291
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,010
Yingluo,

292
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,800
what are you doing?

293
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,880
Sister Rong told me to make sure

294
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,690
the carriage is soft and comfortable.

295
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,493
She said despite having no money,

296
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,160
the most important thing when traveling

297
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,800
is to enjoy the comfort of the journey.

298
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,530
She really never fails

299
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
to surprise anyone.

300
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,600
I'll help you.

301
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,970
Thank you.

302
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:55,800
Brother Shaoci,

303
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,640
Sister Rong has always been this way.

304
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,290
She's carefree and bold,

305
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,560
living life as she pleases.

306
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,450
I really wish I could be like her.

307
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:13,450
I need some fresh air.

308
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,770
Be careful.

309
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,250
Shaoci, take a break first.

310
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,490
Sending the bride
will be full of obstacles and dangers.

311
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,400
You shouldn't have come

312
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,490
on this dangerous journey.

313
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,530
It's all right.

314
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,320
I'm not scared.

315
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,200
I'm the Thirteenth Young Lady
of the Tang Clan.

316
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,640
I know how to protect myself.

317
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,360
Well, you already know

318
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,930
why I came along.

319
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,640
But

320
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,360
don't feel pressured.

321
00:18:59,826 --> 00:19:01,204
Feelings aren't like herbs.

322
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:03,093
You don't just plant them
and expect a harvest.

323
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,910
Some people may see it as suffering.

324
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,315
But as long as it feels right to me,

325
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,271
it's all good to me.

326
00:19:10,226 --> 00:19:11,010
Someone is coming.

327
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,290
They are here.

328
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,320
Sister Rong,

329
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,730
how was your journey?

330
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,800
I can finally get out of here.

331
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,690
I've already set up your carriage.

332
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,840
Let's go.

333
00:19:47,848 --> 00:19:49,530
Everything is arranged just as you want.

334
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:50,880
Take a look.

335
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:51,730
Are you satisfied?

336
00:19:58,871 --> 00:20:00,560
Not bad. I'm very satisfied.

337
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,120
Shukuang.

338
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:08,248
You're not trying to make me
back out of this marriage, are you?

339
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,970
I just feel it's rushed.

340
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,737
If you regret it,
it's not too late to change your mind.

341
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,290
It's not rushed.

342
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,970
Stop being so fussy.

343
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,250
Let's go already.

344
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,450
Sister Rong, what's this?

345
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,770
For protection.

346
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,490
Have some water.

347
00:20:52,693 --> 00:20:54,260
They've been traveling for a while now.

348
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,204
There's still no sign
of the Ghost Valley Sect.

349
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:57,770
It looks like they won't be coming.

350
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,490
Let's go.

351
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,071
We should make a move too.

352
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,730
Feng Tingxie,

353
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,930
based on my experience,

354
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,250
there are definitely snakes

355
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,800
in this bamboo forest.

356
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,730
I'm not scared.

357
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,160
But I'm not so sure about you.

358
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:16,490
Tang Yingluo,

359
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:17,790
are you trying to scare me again?

360
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:18,840
Brother Shaoci, here.

361
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,120
Thank you.

362
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,400
Rong, say something to her.

363
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,360
Behind you!

364
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,640
You...

365
00:21:32,848 --> 00:21:34,010
Tang Yingluo, come here.

366
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,730
Stop scaring him.

367
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,400
But I heard

368
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,210
this forest really has monsters.

369
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,050
And they especially like to eat
those who are timid.

370
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,848
You're too old to be trying
to scare people.

371
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,530
I'm not the timid boy I used to be.

372
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:48,010
Tomorrow, we'll take this route instead.

373
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,730
The villages along the way
are abandoned.

374
00:21:56,804 --> 00:21:57,970
So fewer people travel there.

375
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,400
It should be safer.

376
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,560
That works.

377
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,160
Once we pass the town,
we'll reach the dock.

378
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,600
- Eat this.
- Thank you, Sister Rong.

379
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,080
Get some rest.

380
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:11,626
We will switch shifts in four hours.

381
00:22:12,315 --> 00:22:12,880
All right.

382
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,560
Let's go.

383
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:29,080
(The last time I watched the stars)

384
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,080
(was in the desert.)

385
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,560
They're so beautiful.

386
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,690
I wish I could take one home.

387
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,250
One,

388
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,320
two, three, four...

389
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,770
Young Lady Lin, do you need me
to do anything for you?

390
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,490
You don't need to do anything.

391
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,560
Liu, you know this.

392
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:35,050
Father and Shaoci always favored
Rong Shukuang.

393
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,210
Father trains her,

394
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,600
Shaoci cherishes her,

395
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,050
and even Yingluo and Feng

396
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,290
love following her around.

397
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,770
Now,

398
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,320
even Yan Shao is devoted
to protecting her.

399
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,360
But me?

400
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,600
I have nothing.

401
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,970
Since childhood,

402
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,640
whenever I was upset,

403
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,400
you were the one
who took care of me.

404
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:00,530
Then Shukuang saw
how clever you were and took you away.

405
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,530
But in my heart,

406
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,050
I've always seen you as my real sister.

407
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,360
So, how could I just watch

408
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,800
you stay trapped here forever?

409
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,160
Go.

410
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,400
Go as far as you can.

411
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,250
Make sure they never find you.

412
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,640
You can't beat Yan Shao.

413
00:24:18,404 --> 00:24:19,970
He's also from Misty Moon Village.

414
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,970
He was the disciple
of Rong Shukuang's mother, Su Shiyu.

415
00:24:23,782 --> 00:24:25,400
They grew up together,

416
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,360
and he has always protected her.

417
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,290
If I leave,

418
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:31,880
Master Lin and Young Master Lin
will suspect you.

419
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,770
As long as you escape safely,

420
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,880
I don't care.

421
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:55,690
(Qiutong Town)

422
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,450
Mister,

423
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:03,530
bring a pot of hot tea.

424
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,290
Why did they come here?

425
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:13,800
This road has fewer travelers.

426
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,730
It helps avoid unnecessary trouble.

427
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,970
Thank you.

428
00:25:20,604 --> 00:25:21,400
Mister,

429
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,840
this tea is cold.

430
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,360
We're closing soon.

431
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,400
Drink it or don't. I don't care.

432
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,450
Excuse me,

433
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,010
we've been traveling for a long time.

434
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,360
We just need some hot tea to warm up.

435
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,640
I like how you speak politely.

436
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:44,010
Let's find somewhere to rest
for the night.

437
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,050
We'll leave early tomorrow.

438
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,560
Shukuang, what do you think?

439
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,490
I think

440
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,800
we don't need to look for one anymore.

441
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,770
Formation!

442
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,930
Wuwang Pavilion's Cross Formation?

443
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:34,970
Attack!

444
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:38,120
Watch out!

445
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,640
Be careful!

446
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,880
Again?

447
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:04,800
Stay there!

448
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,690
You coward!

449
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:13,730
You cheated!

450
00:30:13,737 --> 00:30:14,648
So, how do you like

451
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,080
my homemade Eight Immortal Powder?

452
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,320
It's cheap, effective,

453
00:30:19,404 --> 00:30:20,490
and quite the smell, right?

454
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,880
Are you all right?

455
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:28,320
Take her away.

456
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,490
Let's go.

457
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,400
Since they're out of danger,

458
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,770
why are they taking one of them?

459
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,930
Such recklessness

460
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,730
really leaves me feeling uneasy.

461
00:30:54,915 --> 00:30:56,382
Capturing a Wuwang Pavilion disciple

462
00:30:56,426 --> 00:30:57,360
will bring more trouble.

463
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,889
It's not safe for them to stay longer.

464
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,848
They should head to the dock
as soon as possible.

465
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,970
Every time,
our plans get delayed because of her.

466
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,210
Follow from a distance.

467
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,530
Stay on guard tonight.

468
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,730
Qi?

469
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,800
Is your last name Qi

470
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:23,010
or is your name Qi?

471
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:33,450
What's with that scoff, huh?

472
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,600
I was mocking you.

473
00:31:34,671 --> 00:31:36,360
Wuwang Pavilion's Soul-Cutting Umbrella

474
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,960
can cut through iron,
and its sharpness can split a hair.

475
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,471
How could someone worthless like you
be worthy of using it?

476
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,360
Why does a proper young lady spend

477
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,080
all day fighting and killing?

478
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,010
Also,

479
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,290
do you think tying your hair up
in a bun will fool anyone

480
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,600
into believing
you're not disguised as a man?

481
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,880
We are not foolish.

482
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,560
I knew you were a girl

483
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,530
the moment I saw you
among all those men.

484
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:58,800
If I didn't capture you...

485
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:06,226
What are you doing?

486
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:07,770
Don't try to scare us.

487
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,320
She's poisoned.

488
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,930
How did you react so fast?

489
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,010
It wasn't me.

490
00:32:15,693 --> 00:32:17,730
It's the Wuwang Pavilion's poison,
Peaceful Death.

491
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,640
Only Master has the antidote.

492
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:20,970
If we fail our mission,

493
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,530
we don't get the cure.

494
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,880
The poison flares up every two hours

495
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,600
until it kills us in agony.

496
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:34,930
If they had just left
after escaping death

497
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,550
instead of wasting time capturing
and interrogating her,

498
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:39,448
they would've reached the dock by now.

499
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,730
What's...

500
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,010
Master,

501
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,930
please give me the antidote.

502
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,360
Don't give it to her.

503
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,450
You failed your task
and still expect a cure?

504
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,600
The Wuwang Pavilion never meddles
in worldly affairs.

505
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,080
Master Hua, if you let us go,

506
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,880
we'll return this girl to you.

507
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,530
Bargaining

508
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,770
with a useless girl?

509
00:33:21,826 --> 00:33:23,560
Wouldn't it be easier
for you to cooperate?

510
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,880
You can leave.

511
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,010
But the key has to stay.

512
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,690
What if I say there is no key?

513
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,840
Will you wipe us all out?

514
00:33:34,004 --> 00:33:35,250
Why don't you ask it instead?

515
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:10,450
Run!

516
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,370
This town is full
of Wuwang Pavilion's spies.

517
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,640
There's a hidden passage
that only I know about.

518
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,640
Follow me.

519
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,160
Wait a minute.

520
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,080
Why are you helping us?

521
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:07,960
You endangered yourself
to get me the antidote.

522
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,010
I, Hua Qi,
may be a Wuwang Pavilion disciple.

523
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,050
But I still know right from wrong.

524
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,330
So your name is Hua Qi.

525
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,720
Your name sounds pretty.

526
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:23,760
Did you just smile?

527
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,280
No, I didn't.

528
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,869
You did.

529
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:25,330
I did not.

530
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,240
Yes, you did.

531
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,330
This is a trap, isn't it?

532
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,450
If we go inside,

533
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,640
we'll fall into your trap.

534
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,680
Wuwang Pavilion's disciples
will wait to ambush us.

535
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,240
Am I right?

536
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,490
Fine, I'll go in first.

537
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:36,560
If there's an ambush,
I'll be the first to die.

538
00:35:36,693 --> 00:35:38,080
You are just too scared, right?

539
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,120
I...

540
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:43,050
She nearly died
from the poison just now.

541
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,760
It shouldn't be fake.

542
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:49,970
Let's go.

543
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,560
Master, we caught one.

544
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:03,004
Send a message to the Ghost Valley Sect.

545
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:05,160
Tell them I've found the person
they're looking for.

546
00:36:05,471 --> 00:36:06,204
Take her away.

547
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:06,720
Yes, Master.

548
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,490
Move it.

549
00:36:39,553 --> 00:36:42,499
♪Spinning through my heart,
