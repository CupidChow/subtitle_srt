(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

=Episode 18=

19
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:52,930
Yan Shao!

20
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:53,980
Yan Shao!

21
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:56,900
It's fine.

22
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,382
Young Master Lin.

23
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,850
There's something you need to do.

24
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,570
Only then can we escape.

25
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:04,540
We're not far from Ruthless Parlor.

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,460
Go find Jin Buyao.

27
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,290
He will help.

28
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:07,715
He values money above all else.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,626
He swore a deadly oath

30
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,204
and would never leave Ruthless Parlor.

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,530
Why would he help?

32
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,810
Tell him this.

33
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,770
"The bones by the Lotus Pond,

34
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,810
Yan Shao buried them himself."

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
He will come.

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,690
All right.

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,250
Yan Shao.

38
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,340
Hide, quickly!

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,140
Hurry!

40
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,620
Search in groups!

41
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,370
They won't get away!

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,580
Go!

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,620
Move!

44
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,140
This way.

45
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,460
Over here!

46
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,460
That way!

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,340
Find anything?

48
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,382
Nothing here.

49
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,490
You two, keep an eye on her.

50
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,650
Yes!

51
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,020
Are you all right?

52
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,460
I'm fine.

53
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:55,860
Leader Shen.

54
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,970
Leader Shen,
the sandstorm is too strong.

55
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,300
We can't see them at all.

56
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
The storm is coming.

57
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,060
We should take shelter.

58
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,090
No.

59
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,930
Dead or alive, we must find them.

60
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,900
Search everywhere. Now!

61
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:09,930
Yes!

62
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,020
Go!

63
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,370
Move! This way!

64
00:04:15,604 --> 00:04:16,490
Check over there!

65
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,420
Yes!

66
00:04:18,137 --> 00:04:19,130
Nothing here.

67
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:20,960
- Hurry! Over here!
- Nothing here either!

68
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,515
Young Master Lin, you've forgotten,

69
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,660
I have stayed out of martial affairs

70
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,130
for many years now.

71
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,450
This is an emergency.

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
If it weren't urgent,

73
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,890
I wouldn't have come.

74
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,570
Tonight, your stay

75
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,660
at Ruthless Parlor is on me.

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,740
My treat.

77
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,490
The bones by the Lotus Pond,

78
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,660
Yan Shao buried them himself.

79
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,740
A lotus in the desert is priceless.

80
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:15,540
Boss Jin values money above all else.

81
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,930
Yet he is a man of deep affection.

82
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,810
The Leader of Tiangang sent me
with a message for you.

83
00:05:26,648 --> 00:05:28,620
The remains of your master
and junior sister

84
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:31,071
have been retrieved
from the enemy's lair.

85
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:32,900
They were interred near the lotus pond

86
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,315
that your junior sister loved most.

87
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,220
Every summer, the pond overflows
with blooming lotuses.

88
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,420
The scenery is exceptionally beautiful.

89
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,330
You are...

90
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,370
Let the departed rest in peace.
The vendetta is ended.

91
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,300
For Boss Jin's wish,

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,540
Tiangang spared no expense
to make it come true.

93
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,450
When Tiangang needs me,

94
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,010
no matter when,

95
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,450
I will risk my life without hesitation.

96
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,270
(Ruthless Parlor)

97
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:37,740
There are so many of us,

98
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,620
why don't we charge out and fight them?

99
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:42,130
Ghost Valley Sect
has mustered many forces,

100
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,130
so we are outnumbered.

101
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,100
When dusk falls further,

102
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:46,860
Young Master Lin brings reinforcements,

103
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,130
only then can we escape.

104
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:50,060
You protect Young Lady Rong.

105
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:51,471
Meet at the town gate.

106
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,180
All right.

107
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,300
Yan Shao!

108
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,490
Move.

109
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,740
Leader Shen.

110
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,570
No need to search any further.

111
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,300
Hiding around is pointless.

112
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,540
Why not have one proper fight?

113
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,860
Sounds good.

114
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,450
You are already at the end of your rope.

115
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,890
Jin Buyao.

116
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,980
Yan Shao!

117
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,010
Yan Shao, over here!

118
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,930
The sandstorm is here.

119
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,782
Take Lin Wanci with you.

120
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,248
Let's get out of the storm first.

121
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,220
Keep up.

122
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,500
Senior.

123
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,540
Hurry, this way.

124
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:44,937
Quickly.

125
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,090
Immortal Spring's Master Healer?

126
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,850
Hurry, get in.

127
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,420
How is it?

128
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,850
Everyone, I've prepared
guest rooms over here.

129
00:09:05,182 --> 00:09:06,260
For those covered in sand,

130
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,730
why not take a rest?

131
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,500
Yan Shao and I need to speak privately.

132
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,090
I need to see him too.

133
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,500
Shukuang.

134
00:09:14,515 --> 00:09:16,140
Let Boss Jin take care of Yan Shao.

135
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,570
We all go rest.

136
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,780
Don't worry.

137
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,180
Chai Hu, lead everyone
to the guest rooms.

138
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:21,930
Yes.

139
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,570
Please.

140
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,180
Sister Rong, you've been
on the move all this way.

141
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,930
Let's go and rest.

142
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,020
Dantian refines the spirit.

143
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,450
Energy sinks into the lower sea.

144
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,930
Inhale through the throat.

145
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,090
Gradually collect it at the base.

146
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,060
Heaven and Earth are in harmony.

147
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,330
Inhale, and fire rises.

148
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,610
The ribs lift together.

149
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,300
Exhale, guiding the breath out.

150
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,937
Where are you going?

151
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,137
I'm going to find Yan Shao.

152
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,260
Don't go yet.

153
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,026
Shaoci.

154
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,900
You and Yan Shao...

155
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,690
What secret are you hiding from me?

156
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,730
Jin Buyao has stepped out
of Ruthless Parlor.

157
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:57,804
He's broken the rules.

158
00:10:58,093 --> 00:10:59,810
Ruthless Parlor
is no longer a safe place.

159
00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:01,990
Ghost Valley Sect
is trapped by the sandstorm.

160
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,090
But it won't last long.

161
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:04,850
Wanci is still in Shen Zuitian's hands.

162
00:11:05,182 --> 00:11:06,360
How do we rescue her?

163
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,570
All of this

164
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,330
requires careful planning.

165
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,610
Shouldn't we discuss this together?

166
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:12,850
He has his reasons.

167
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,330
Since when

168
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,500
did you start trusting
Yan Shao this much?

169
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:34,090
Thank you, Senior.

170
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,300
Hero.

171
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,380
Brother.

172
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,260
Great hero.

173
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,180
Why didn't you thank me?

174
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,210
That desert town isn't far from here.

175
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:45,893
The sandstorm could stop at any moment.

176
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:47,204
What if Ghost Valley Sect arrives?

177
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,380
What happens to my Ruthless Parlor?

178
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,660
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,960
Don't apologize to me.

180
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,782
The ones you should apologize to

181
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:55,382
are the dozens of old folks downstairs

182
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,848
who will never leave Ruthless Parlor.

183
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,810
Where do they go now?

184
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,930
If Tiangang agrees...

185
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,330
Don't talk to me about Tiangang.

186
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,380
Aren't you one of them?

187
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,570
Yet look where you are now.

188
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,090
Boss Jin.

189
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,450
Together, we can take on Shen Zuitian.

190
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,260
Listen, it's just you.

191
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,300
Just me.

192
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,500
There is no "us" here.

193
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,850
How much will it take?

194
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,500
This is for a life-and-death matter.

195
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,180
It's priceless.

196
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,180
Forget it.

197
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,780
Just cure his poison first.

198
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,900
After all,

199
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,330
as long as he lives,

200
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,730
those chaotic people
next door have a chance.

201
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,500
If Shen Zuitian comes,

202
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,690
you're on your own.

203
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,930
That girl in yellow,

204
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,830
isn't she the Tang family's
Thirteen Young Lady?

205
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:53,180
She is Tang Yingluo.

206
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,780
She was still young
when you left the Tang Clan.

207
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,330
She and Chanyi are both
my elder brother's daughters.

208
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:00,850
They have the same eyes.

209
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,730
I recognized her at a glance.

210
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,248
Senior, you were dragged
into this because of me.

211
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,140
Otherwise, you would have long left
the martial world behind.

212
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,060
Years ago, to escape my enemies,

213
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Tiangang once escorted me
deep into the desert.

214
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,420
Tiangang never questions
the outcome of their tasks.

215
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,610
I cannot forget that kindness.

216
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,690
Your poison has seeped into your bones.

217
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,260
The attacks are becoming more frequent.

218
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,210
However...

219
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,560
The only cure
for Crimson Lotus Heart is mayapple.

220
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,140
Mayapple only grows
in bitterly cold regions.

221
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,450
It takes ten years to bloom,
ten to mature,

222
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,782
and another ten to bear fruit.

223
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,810
I went through
great lengths to find one.

224
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,140
But I have only one.

225
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,300
You and Miss Rong...
Only one of you can be saved.

226
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,450
But remember,

227
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,690
even if you take it,

228
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,715
you won't regain
your martial strength immediately.

229
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,930
There will be side effects.

230
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,500
Well...

231
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,300
You must be prepared for.

232
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,300
I suppose you'll choose to save her.

233
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:19,780
Yes.

234
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,900
Then what about you?

235
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,500
As long as she lives, I live.

236
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:52,810
Come.

237
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,090
Bottoms up.

238
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,500
Senior, my internal strength is lacking.

239
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,540
Do you have a way to make me stronger

240
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:11,970
even if just temporarily?

241
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,730
There is.

242
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,260
But you are already
a flickering candle in the wind.

243
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,660
Even if there's a way
to condense your spirit

244
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,730
and mobilize your meridian energy,

245
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,450
the backlash will be severe.

246
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,970
Your body won't be able to withstand it.

247
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,337
Ghost Valley Sect
could arrive at any moment.

248
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,540
I must protect them.

249
00:15:31,582 --> 00:15:32,660
Please, Senior, guide me.

250
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,210
This is Revival Acupuncture,
soaked in medicine.

251
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:40,930
Pierce it into the Tianchi acupoint.

252
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,610
It will grant you
immense strength for an hour.

253
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,690
A fleeting surge of power

254
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,500
comes at Heaven's cost.

255
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,780
Once used,
your body will weaken further.

256
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:54,930
It can only be used twice at most.

257
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,180
That's enough.

258
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,420
They've all escaped.

259
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,900
What now, Leader Shen?

260
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,090
Leader Shen, they followed Jin Buyao.

261
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,737
They must have gone to Ruthless Parlor.
They can't run far.

262
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,500
Take Lin Wanci
and head to Ruthless Parlor.

263
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:29,610
Are you feeling better?

264
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:31,315
What about you? Are you all right?

265
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,060
Did Shen Zuitian injure you?

266
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:33,970
Where are you hurt?

267
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:34,930
I'm fine.

268
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,180
The most urgent matter now
is leaving Ruthless Parlor.

269
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,140
Wanci is still in their hands.

270
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,610
For us to escape,

271
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,180
we need someone's help.

272
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,420
And it has to be him.

273
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,020
Everyone.

274
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,540
This jar of wine

275
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,060
was buried by my own hands

276
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,780
the day Ruthless Parlor first opened.

277
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,090
Tonight, we share a drink.

278
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,850
By dawn, we part ways.

279
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,330
Boss Jin.

280
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,090
Ruthless Parlor
can no longer shelter you all.

281
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,170
I have offended the Ghost Valley Sect.

282
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,130
Ghost Valley Sect?

283
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,937
Ghost Valley Sect
will soon come for revenge.

284
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,460
To avoid unnecessary casualties,

285
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,610
please leave this place
as soon as possible.

286
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,004
You're suddenly driving us away?

287
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:19,890
Boss Jin!

288
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,020
Everyone who paid,

289
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,740
I will return your money.

290
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,810
I came to Ruthless Parlor

291
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,090
to rid myself of my killing intent.

292
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,330
Because there were
too many people I wanted to kill.

293
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,460
So

294
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm not leaving.

295
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,130
You...

296
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,448
I'm not leaving either.
Whoever wants to leave, just leave!

297
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:38,330
I won't go.

298
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,570
You're all seeking death.

299
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,570
I won't be joining you.

300
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:42,940
Hey!

301
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,540
At least here,
someone will give you a proper burial.

302
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,220
But once you step out that door,

303
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,260
I fear you won't even have a grave.

304
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,060
You...

305
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,610
Shen Zuitian has arrived.

306
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,780
Jin Buyao.

307
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,130
You truly surprised me.

308
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,740
Seems like Ruthless Parlor

309
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,890
never really mattered to you.

310
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,537
Since that's the case,

311
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,260
why keep it at all?

312
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,020
Today, I only want one person.

313
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,650
Rong Shukuang.

314
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,740
Hand over Rong Shukuang.

315
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,060
No one else here will be harmed.

316
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,980
Even this Young Lady Lin
will leave safely.

317
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,650
By nightfall,

318
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,650
if you refuse
to hand over Rong Shukuang,

319
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,650
I'll flay this Young Lady Lin alive.

320
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,410
Drain her blood,

321
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:53,700
and then burn Ruthless Parlor
to the ground.

322
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,780
None of you will escape!

323
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:05,982
Where are you going?

324
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,980
He only wants me.

325
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,500
If I go, everyone will be safe.

326
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:11,220
Otherwise, we'll all be trapped here

327
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,060
with no way out.

328
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,260
You can't go.

329
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,090
Wanci is still in their hands.

330
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:16,693
Do you not care
whether she lives or dies?

331
00:19:16,693 --> 00:19:18,330
She cannot die and neither can you.

332
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,780
If you go,

333
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,090
he might not keep his word.

334
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,410
Sister Rong.

335
00:19:28,782 --> 00:19:30,537
- Young Master Lin.
- Young Master Lin.

336
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,650
What are you doing?

337
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,370
What is this?

338
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:40,900
A pill to restore internal strength.

339
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:41,940
The situation is dire.

340
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:43,810
It will fully restore your martial arts.

341
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,170
There's only one.

342
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,500
Did you take one?

343
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,220
It's for you.

344
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:57,310
You're my master.
You're stronger than me.

345
00:19:57,448 --> 00:19:58,130
You should take it

346
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,160
to have a better chance
against Shen Zuitian.

347
00:20:00,493 --> 00:20:01,471
I already took one.

348
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,410
Every time you lie to me,

349
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,700
your eyes always look down first.

350
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,850
Don't you want to regain your strength?

351
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,220
The Cloud-Slicing Sword is ready.

352
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,271

00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,780
You are the daughter
of my master, Su Shiyu.

374
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,650
(She took me in and raised me.)

375
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:25,650
(I promised your mother)

376
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,170

378

379
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,220

382

I'm not the person you're looking for.

383
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,650
You are.

384
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,130
With danger looming, I won't lie to you.

385
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,740
I'm not

386
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,740
the Fang family girl you grew up with,

387
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,300
nor am I Rong Shukuang from Yuchi Manor.

388
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,500
Then who are you?

389
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,090
My name is Fang Yi.

390
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,570
The Fang Yi
from Misty Moon Village is you.

391
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,090
No, it's not. It really isn't!

392
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,020
I came from a very distant place.

393
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,890
I don't know why...

394
00:22:26,182 --> 00:22:28,080
Perhaps some disruption
in time and space...

395
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:30,130
It was the white jade on your sword.

396
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,540
The white jade brought me here.

397
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,700
I know this is hard for you to believe

398
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,130
but...

399
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,740
I truly am not
the person you're searching for.

400
00:22:40,804 --> 00:22:42,220
The person you're looking for...

401
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,540
I don't even know

402
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,740
if she's still alive in this world.

403
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,090
I don't want to see you
risk your life for me again.

404
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,650
What I just said

405
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,090
is the truth.

406
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,740
Sister Rong!

407
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,540

408

Go!

409
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,780
Shaoci!

410
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,890
Shaoci, don't rush.

411
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,300
We'll find a way to save her.

412
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,570
Young Master Lin,
don't fall into their trap!

413
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,650
Shaoci, let me
go in exchange for Wanci.

414
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,740
No!

415
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:41,220
I don't want to drag anyone else down.

416
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,850
You already have.

417
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,610
If you want to fight,

418
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,810
do as you please.

419
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,940
I'm going out there!

420
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,330
No! Don't go!

421
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,650
I'm going! Don't stop me!

422
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,540
I have to go!

423
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,604
I need to talk to you.

424
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,570
There's no time. Take this first.

425
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,570
Yan Shao.

426
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,610
I don't know

427
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,260
if we'll make it out alive today.

428
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,060
So there's something
I must tell you now.

429
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,540
I may not be the Rong Shukuang
you're looking for,

430
00:24:17,982 --> 00:24:20,130
but from the moment
I first saw you in the desert

431
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,260
until now...

432
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,890
I...

433
00:24:23,693 --> 00:24:24,848
There's no need to say it.

434
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,130
Since you're not her,

435
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:28,060
we have nothing to do with each other.

436
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,940
Once you reach Mount Moye, take care.

437
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,610
The world is vast. Let's not meet again.

438
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:42,410
Charge!

439
00:24:47,715 --> 00:24:49,026
It has nothing to do with me.

440
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,810
Keep an eye on Yan Shao.

441
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:23,760
His poison flared up
in the desert town.

442
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,020
When it strikes again,

443
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,130
that's when we'll make our move.

444
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,940
Shaoci, leave me behind.

445
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,020
Just go!

446
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,700
Wanci, we will save you.

447
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:36,610
Listen up!

448
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,740
This is between
Ghost Valley Sect and Yuchi Manor.

449
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,300
Anyone who wants to live, leave now.

450
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,220
Otherwise, I'll slaughter everyone
in Ruthless Parlor today!

451
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,810
No one will escape!

452
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,890
What do we do?

453
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,540
Go.

454
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:28,460
You go first.

455
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,780
Attack!

456
00:27:13,804 --> 00:27:15,760
There's a secret passage
over there! Go now!

457
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:22,940
Take them and leave!

458
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,740
Go!

459
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,937
Shaoci, hurry and save Yan Shao!

460
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:27,937
Are you all right?

461
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:29,448
Thank you, Master Healer.

462
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,260
Go!
