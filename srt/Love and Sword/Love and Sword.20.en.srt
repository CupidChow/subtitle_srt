17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 20=

19
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,730
Sister Rong.

20
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,426
I just went to look for you,
but you weren't there. Where did you go?

21
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,170
I went to see Chu Tianyao.

22
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,860
How was he?

23
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,170
What did he look like?

24
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,140
Don't mention it.

25
00:02:01,404 --> 00:02:03,660
There was a screen between us.
I couldn't see a thing.

26
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:05,500
How disrespectful
of the Leader of Tiangang.

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Truly outrageous.

28
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,020
By the way,

29
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,650
Chu Tianyao said
he received a letter from Yan Shao.

30
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,330
Wanci is recovering well.

31
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,737
Then where is Yan Shao?

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,420
He refused to tell me
where Yan Shao went.

33
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,140
How old do you think
this Chu Tianyao is?

34
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,450
His father was my sworn father's senior.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,420
Logically, he shouldn't be too old.

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,540
But his voice just now
was weak and frail.

37
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,980
Like an old man.

38
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,050
Chu Tianyao is incredibly mysterious.

39
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,300
No one in the martial world
seems to know his true face.

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,540
No one knows?

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,450
I need to think this over.

42
00:02:52,337 --> 00:02:53,271
Yan Shao.

43
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,730
I have returned Liu An
to Misty Moon Village for burial.

44
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:59,860
On the way, I learned
of the fall of Junshan Sect.

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,930
Junshan Sect is no more.

46
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,820
Shangguan Tong.

47
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,580
There's you in Junshan Sect.

48
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,650
Junshan Sect has me.

49
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,490
Once all the sects gather at Mount Moye,

50
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,140
we will discuss together

51
00:03:34,226 --> 00:03:36,182
how to eliminate the Ghost Valley Sect.

52
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,580
To avenge Junshan Sect.

53
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,048
They've always been
all show and no unity.

54
00:03:40,448 --> 00:03:42,210
Why would they stand up
for Junshan Sect?

55
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:44,537
They understand that their fates
are tied together.

56
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,330
They won't ignore this.

57
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,820
Yan Shao, what's wrong?

58
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,860
Why do you seem so weak?

59
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,170
I'm fine. I'll recover soon.

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,300
He is the Leader of Tiangang.

61
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,610
Yan Shao is the Leader?
The Leader is Yan Shao?

62
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,770
Greetings, Leader.

63
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,330
Does Miss Rong know?

64
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:15,770
Has she reached Mount Moye?

65
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:18,580
Remember.

66
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,500
Miss Rong must never
find out about this.

67
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,260
Never forget.

68
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:33,210
Leader Shen.

69
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,500
Jiang Ruhai has sent word.

70
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,650
He failed to stop
Rong Shukuang at Tang Clan.

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,890
She has already arrived
at Moye Manor.

72
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,740
Since Yan Shao left Ruthless Parlor,

73
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,580
no one knows his whereabouts.

74
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,410
I've brought a letter
from Young Lady Lin.

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,620
She's still alive?

76
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:53,210
Leader Shen was injured by Yan Shao.

77
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,530
She is also involved!

78
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:55,850
She better not cross my path again!

79
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,090
Young Lady Lin said,

80
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,620
no matter what she has done,

81
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,700
her goal and Leader Shen's
are one and the same.

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,410
Green-Robed.

83
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:23,820
(If you seek the treasure,
meet at Mount Moye.)

84
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:30,920
(Shuxin Pavilion)

85
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,890
You're just in time.

86
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,500
Tell me,

87
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,210
you grew up on Mount Moye.

88
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,410
You must have seen
Chu Tianyao's face, right?

89
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,330
Is he an old man, past his prime?

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,650
A toothless elder?

91
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,140
Miss Rong.

92
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,770
The Leader is in his prime.

93
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,140
He is not an old man.

94
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,650
As for his appearance,

95
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,500
everyone has different tastes.

96
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,090
I find him to be rather distinguished.

97
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,090
Quite remarkable among men.

98
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,770
You're saying something,
yet nothing at all.

99
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,090
Besides, in marriage,

100
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,450
is appearance and age all that matters?

101
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,500
Miss Rong isn't such a person.

102
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,970
Those things are important.

103
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,500
That's not what I meant.

104
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,820
You're confusing me.

105
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,850
I meant,

106
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,850
you know Yan Shao, right?

107
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,700
What about him?

108
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,140
I suspect Yan Shao
is actually Chu Tianyao.

109
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,020
Miss Rong, are you joking?

110
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,140
Leader Chu is Leader Chu.

111
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,260
Yan Shao is Yan Shao.

112
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,060
While Yan Shao is indeed

113
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,580
a dashing young man,

114
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,180
Leader Chu has a far
more commanding presence.

115
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,330
Are we even talking
about the same person?

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,330
Come here.

117
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,180
Come.

118
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,180
Come on.

119
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,740
Dress me up.

120
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,620
Make me look like a proper young lady.

121
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,020
Shaoci...

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,580
This outfit today...

123
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,500
What about it?

124
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:23,700
It suits you.

125
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,580
Good.

126
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,380
Alright. You may leave.

127
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,890
You usually wear martial attire.

128
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Rarely like this.

129
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,260
Well, I'm married into Mount Moye now.

130
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,210
No need to wander
the martial world anymore.

131
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,060
So, I may as well dress differently.

132
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,140
This is for you.

133
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,330
This is...

134
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,090
Yingluo has one too.

135
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:51,290
She said you'd like it.

136
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,410
So I bought it for you.

137
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:56,090
Thank you, Shaoci.

138
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,140
Does it look good?

139
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,330
Then I'm off to see Chu Tianyao.

140
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,140
Why are you dressed like that here?

141
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,290
Yan Shao?

142
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,650
Your figure resembles Yan Shao.

143
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,690
You're not the only one who says so.

144
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,530
It's just a resemblance.

145
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,020
To you,

146
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,810
Yan Shao is important.

147
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,140
That hairpin is unique.

148
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,100
It looks like...

149
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,871
Falling snow.

150
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,100
Lin Shaoci gave it to me.

151
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,248
Does that bother you?

152
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,810
Why should it?

153
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,140
Once, I created snowfall.

154
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,140
Just for someone to see.

155
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,460
That hairpin on my hair
looks just like that snow.

156
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:37,382
It must have been beautiful.

157
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,340
That person was lucky.

158
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,530
Leader Chu.

159
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,380
Who exactly are you?

160
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,930
The rainbow is nice.

161
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,530
Since you're here, stay and watch.

162
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,650
Consider it me sharing
Mount Moye's scenery with you.

163
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,890
Why do you wear a mask, Leader Chu?

164
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,140
Scars, sickness, it's an unsightly face.

165
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,410
It's better not to frighten you.

166
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,260
It's fine.

167
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,690
We are to be married.

168
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,848
We should be honest with each other.

169
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,740
Miss Rong, you're impatient.

170
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,570
Before I remove my mask,
I have one condition.

171
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,220
Say it.

172
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,860
If I take off this mask,

173
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,810
I will never answer

174
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,340
another question about Yan Shao.

175
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,170
Think carefully.

176
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:50,930
Where is he?

177
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:53,382
You're very concerned about him.

178
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,071
I'm asking about Yan Shao.

179
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,890
Where is he?

180
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,770
You are persistent.

181
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,460
Yan Shao...

182
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,810
Where is he?

183
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,500
It seems you're

184
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,290
not marrying me willingly.

185
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,770
Nor do I believe

186
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,740
you're marrying me willingly.

187
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,493
I am sincere about you, Miss Rong.

188
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,620
If you are hesitant,

189
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,500
I can wait.

190
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,737
Until you let go
of the one in your heart.

191
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,860
Until you willingly become my wife.

192
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,050
You haven't answered me.

193
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,690
I only said I wouldn't answer
if you removed it.

194
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:33,804
I never said anything
about keeping it on.

195
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,260
You...

196
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,500
Liar.

197
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,050
Foxie.

198
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,188
(Shuxin Pavilion)

199
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,410
Height 1.9 meters.

200
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:45,490
(Yan Shao VS Chu Tianyao)

201
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:46,737
Yan Shao is quite fair-skinned.

202
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,439
From Chu Tianyao's neck and hands,

203
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,537
he doesn't seem dark either.

204
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,290
(Skin tone, fair as snow)

205
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,529
Chu Tianyao is aloof and taciturn.

206
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,050
Yan Shao is reserved and soft-spoken.

207
00:11:57,186 --> 00:11:58,260
(Score. Personality.)

208
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,111
(Score. Voice.)
But one has a strong voice,

209
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,770
while the other sounds weak.

210
00:12:02,604 --> 00:12:03,260
Points deducted.

211
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,690
(Score. Physique)
Both have well-proportioned physiques.

212
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,930
No way...

213
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,260
Judging by how ridiculous my life is,

214
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:15,410
this might actually be possible.

215
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,220
If Yan Shao is really Chu Tianyao

216
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,450
and just using a different
identity in the martial world,

217
00:12:21,604 --> 00:12:22,410
then all this time,

218
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,620
why hasn't he told me?

219
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,340
And I'm already at Mount Moye.

220
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,570
I even agreed to marry him.

221
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,770
Why is he still hiding things from me?

222
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
It doesn't make sense.

223
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,410
Could I be mistaken?

224
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:42,620
Miss Rong has been
in the kitchen all morning.

225
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,570
She hasn't come out yet.

226
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,860
We couldn't even cook lunch.

227
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,226
What is she doing in there?

228
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,782
No! My pancake!

229
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:50,671
Don't go in there.

230
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,260
Come out.

231
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,860
Where is she?

232
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,140
Inside.

233
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,890
What happened?

234
00:12:59,340 --> 00:12:59,930
My pancake!

235
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,100
Sister Rong.

236
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,620
You're finally safe.

237
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,980
That was really close.

238
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,315
Where's Yan Shao?

239
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,100
I didn't see him.

240
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,140
Feng Ming was the one
who brought you back.

241
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,100
He saved you.

242
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,340
Feng... Feng Ming?

243
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,460
Miss Tang, the medicine
you requested is ready.

244
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:39,740
Sister Rong, hurry.

245
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,530
The smoke you inhaled is bad for you.

246
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,404
Drink this medicine.

247
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:43,604
More medicine again?

248
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,460
Thank you.

249
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,290
The Leader heard
that you injured your hand.

250
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,770
He specially sent me
to bring you this medicine.

251
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,810
Leader Chu sure is attentive to you.

252
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,140
If he were,
why wouldn't he bring it himself?

253
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,460
The Leader said

254
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,930
he would personally visit you later.

255
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:06,860
No need.

256
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,690
Since he won't come, I'll go myself.

257
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,137
Where's my roujiamo?

258
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,640
(Ruthless Parlor)

259
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:22,050
Father.

260
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,770
Wanci?

261
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,290
Father.

262
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,380
Father.

263
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,050
Wanci, why did you sneak out

264
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,220
without telling me?

265
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,170
It was my fault.

266
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,020
I made you worry.

267
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,140
Wanci, as long as I'm here,

268
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,220
you'll be safe.

269
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,100
I wonder if Shukuang and the others

270
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,170
have safely arrived at Mount Moye.

271
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,410
Hall Master Feng and Hall Master Hai

272
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,410
will escort you back to the manor.

273
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,980
I must go to Mount Moye

274
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,050
to discuss with the other sects

275
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,410
how to deal with the Ghost Valley Sect.

276
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,050
I left home

277
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,020
and endured all kinds of hardship

278
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,620
just to attend Shukuang's wedding.

279
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,530
Father, please take me
with you to Mount Moye.

280
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,260
But this...

281
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,930
I don't want to be apart
from you anymore.

282
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,740
Father...

283
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,020
All right.

284
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,690
You may come with me.

285
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,380
How long do you intend
to keep Miss Rong in the dark?

286
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,500
As long as I can.

287
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,340
A mask can hide a face.

288
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,380
A figure can be passed off as similar.

289
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
A voice can be disguised.

290
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,570
But to someone who truly cares for you,

291
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:50,460
one glance is enough to see through it.

292
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,980
You can't fool her forever.

293
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,426
Then I'll find another way
to deceive her.

294
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,050
Only as the wife
of the Leader of Tiangang

295
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,290
will people truly fear her.

296
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,471
No one will dare lay a finger on her.

297
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:02,770
And the treasure key...

298
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,260
The sects of martial world
need a resolution.

299
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,570
Only then will this matter end.

300
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,170
So have you

301
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,290
already accepted
that your time is short?

302
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,100
I only focus on the present.

303
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,220
The future doesn't
need to be overthought.

304
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,220
Is Leader Chu here?

305
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,220
Miss Rong.

306
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,100
You've just had quite a scare.

307
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,690
You should rest for a few days.

308
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,170
Seeing Leader Chu is far more urgent.

309
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:39,530
Oh right.

310
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,140
I heard you saved me.

311
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,570
Thank you.

312
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,582
No need to thank me, Miss Rong.

313
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,471
Please, go ahead.

314
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,100
Miss Rong.

315
00:16:52,204 --> 00:16:53,515
Sorry, but you must stay here.

316
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,050
Leader Chu, I personally made some food.

317
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,530
I'd like to share it with you.

318
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,180
You nearly burned down
the entire kitchen

319
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,130
just to make this?

320
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,180
Considering I nearly died in the fire,

321
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,050
you should at least try it.

322
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,530
We are not yet husband and wife.

323
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,290
We should observe propriety.

324
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,500
That is the rule of Mount Moye.

325
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,740
Fine.

326
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,420
I only came to tell you

327
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,382
a story about roujiamo,
a pulled pork sandwich.

328
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,850
I despise listening to stories.

329
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,740
But perhaps after hearing it...

330
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,420
Miss Rong.

331
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,900
It won't be so unpleasant.

332
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:40,980
I have a friend.

333
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,260
One day, she woke up

334
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,180
to find herself
in a completely unfamiliar place.

335
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,330
She was left hanging
in mid-air for three days and nights,

336
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,660
barely clinging to life.

337
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,530
(Then, three people
claiming to be her enemies)

338
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,900
(came to take her life.)

339
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,660
Just as death seemed imminent,

340
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,460
a swordsman in red arrived in time.

341
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,660
And then?

342
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,770
Later, in the Immortal Spring,

343
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,826
they created a dish,
one that was both delicious

344
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:18,004
(and convenient
for the caravans of the desert.)

345
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,370
Is that the end?

346
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,530
Not yet, the best part is still ahead.

347
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,370
If I eat this,

348
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,810
will you leave?

349
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,370
Fine.

350
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,940
Old fox.

351
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,020
I knew it was you.

352
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,020
Fine.

353
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,020
What?

354
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:02,610
Do you expect me to feed you?

355
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,740
On this journey,

356
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,660
you never know
when you'll run into a thief.

357
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,700
Be careful.

358
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,530
Since you were young,

359
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,180
you've rarely left the manor.

360
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,220
This time, you've endured
so much hardship.

361
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,180
It was my failure as a father.

362
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,850
But since I was a child,

363
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,090
what I longed for most

364
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:40,260
was to be like Shaoci and Shukuang,

365
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,420
free as the wind, unrestrained.

366
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,500
If not for your frail health...

367
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,460
If not for my frail health,

368
00:19:48,515 --> 00:19:50,420
Father would have
taught me martial arts,

369
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,530
taught me swordplay,

370
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,204
and let me roam
the martial world freely.

371
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,260
To live a life of my own choosing.

372
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,050
Right?

373
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,180
Yes.

374
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,137
Maybe in the next life.

375
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,980
I hope that in my next life,

376
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,980
I can be someone like her.

377
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,420
Let's keep moving.

378
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,700
All right.

379
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,130
Let's go.

380
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:26,570
What are you trying to do?

381
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,020
She is starting to suspect me.

382
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,370
If I want her to let go of her doubts,

383
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:33,180
there is only...

384
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:34,900
She needs to see Yan Shao.

385
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,570
That way, she won't doubt you, right?

386
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:51,940
Yan Shao?

387
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,290
Yan Shao!

388
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,660
Miss Rong.

389
00:20:57,848 --> 00:20:59,090
Yan Shao asked me to tell you,

390
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,940
that he sincerely
wishes you and Leader Chu

391
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,770
a harmonious and joyful union.

392
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,940
If that was truly Yan Shao,

393
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,460
then Chu Tianyao...

394
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:30,804
You've been in this room the whole time?

395
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:31,810
Where else would I be?

396
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,660
You didn't step out?

397
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,570
Where would I go?

398
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,460
I just saw Yan Shao.

399
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,770
It's late at night. You're alone

400
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,180
and still wearing a mask?

401
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,530
I'm used to it.

402
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,980
Even with me barging in,

403
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,460
you remain this calm?

404
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,850
How else should I react?

405
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,290
Throw you out?

406
00:21:53,804 --> 00:21:54,693
Say what you like.

407
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,370
Tonight, I'm going to see your face.

408
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,980
Let's see where you run.

409
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:16,980
- You're laying on my hair.
- My hair...

410
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,530
Ow, ow, ow!

411
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,260
You're laying on my hair!

412
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:27,850
Yan Shao?

413
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:46,810
Miss Rong?

414
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,570
You and Leader...

415
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,382
Nothing happened.

416
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,420
Your Leader is perfectly fine.

417
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,940
Don't worry.

418
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,330
As for his face,

419
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,900
I'm not interested anymore.

420
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,220
No one is allowed inside.

421
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,570
Everything can be faked.

422
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,180
But a person's feelings toward another,

423
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:26,850
cannot be faked.

424
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,460
Yan Shao, huh?

425
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,570
That heart of yours

426
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,740
is pounding for me.

427
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,770
You can't fake that rhythm.

428
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,810
Chu Tianyao.

429
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,260
I know who you are now.

430
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:46,300
(Shuxin Pavilion)

431
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,260
What does he usually do?

432
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:58,130
Matters of the martial world.

433
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,130
What does he like?

434
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:04,850
No idea.

435
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,848
I don't like prying
into people's private affairs.

436
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:10,004
With such an eccentric
and secretive personality,

437
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,290
he must not have many friends.

438
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,850
Who says so? I'm his friend.

439
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,610
You've only known
Leader Chu for a few days.

440
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:18,020
And you're already his friend?

441
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,530
You're talking about Leader Chu?

442
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,220
Who else?

443
00:24:22,915 --> 00:24:24,090
Who did you think I meant?

444
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,090
You little trickster.

445
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,770
Go find out for me

446
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,220
about what Leader Chu likes.

447
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,940
If he likes sweets,
I'll make him desserts.

448
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,940
If he likes wine, I'll drink with him.

449
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,530
In short,

450
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,330
I will get along

451
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,610
with my husband.

452
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,404
That means you
don't want Yan Shao anymore?

453
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,460
Yan Shao and I...

454
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,220
We've already left each other behind.

455
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,426
From now on, don't mention
his name in front of me.

456
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,740
We've completely severed ties.

457
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,290
All ties are broken.

458
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,850
Utterly shattered.

459
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,220
Like a broken mirror.

460
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,850
She said

461
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,260
she wanted to sever ties

462
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:09,660
with Yan Shao completely.

463
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,740
Sever what? Shatter what?

464
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,980
Something about breaking
and something about a mirror...

465
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,180
Shattered and broken?

466
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,090
Yes, those two phrases.

467
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,220
I don't understand,
so I couldn't remember it exactly.

468
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:27,940
Well.

469
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,420
Very well.

470
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:31,900
You heard that?

471
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,660
I didn't hear anything.

472
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,130
But what Miss Rong said...

473
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:37,937
It must have been out of anger.

474
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:39,248
Just out of anger.

475
00:25:41,448 --> 00:25:42,537
What else did she say?

476
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,530
Miss Rong also said

477
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,610
she wants to
get along well with Leader Chu.

478
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:49,626
Well, you are Chu Tianyao anyway.

479
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,220
Getting jealous of yourself,

480
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,570
isn't that unnecessary?

481
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:57,671
Rong Shukuang has always
been devoted to Yan Shao.

482
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,982
Agreeing to this marriage
was merely out of necessity.

483
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,660
Yet after arriving at Mount Moye,

484
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:05,020
she's suddenly fallen for someone else,
fickle and changeable.

485
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,271
No, but...

486
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:09,420
It's always been you,
from the beginning to the end.

487
00:26:09,426 --> 00:26:10,660
So what exactly do you want?

488
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,530
You don't understand.

489
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,493
They may seem like the same person,

490
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,530
but in fact,

491
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,530
they're clearly two different people.

492
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,420
Either way,

493
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,530
you are him, and he is you.

494
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,090
I was him in the past.

495
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,570
But now he is not me.

496
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,048
The person she
once longed for was me, not him.

497
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,850
Yet now the one she cares about

498
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,220
is him, not me.

499
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,130
I... I don't understand
what you're saying.

500
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,420
If you're troubled by this,

501
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,026
why not just tell her the truth?

502
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:36,337
Since she's already decided
to let go of Yan Shao,

503
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,420
why make her see him again?

504
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,500
Wait...

505
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,530
Yan Shao, you...

506
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,700
Since when did you become so stubborn?

507
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,900
Miss Rong is still waiting for my reply.

508
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,220
She asked what kind
of woman Leader Chu likes.

509
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,700
Tell her,

510
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,980
I like a woman who is well-read,

511
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,740
and skilled in music and dance.

512
00:26:57,939 --> 00:27:01,360
(Shuxin Pavilion)

513
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,420
Sister Rong.

514
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,660
What are you doing?

515
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,130
Can't you see?

516
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,900
Practicing calligraphy.

517
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,900
Done!

518
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,810
(Kuang)
Here, take this to Leader Chu.

519
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:19,020
Be careful.

520
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,090
Yingluo.

521
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,050
Come here.

522
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,130
You came just in time.

523
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,940
There's something I need your help with.

524
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,020
What is it?

525
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:39,560
(Kuang)

526
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:42,130
What are you looking at?

527
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,500
Kuang?

528
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,050
What do you think?

529
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,804
Very wild.
[*Kung can be understood as "wild"]

530
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,610
It's clearly Miss Rong's handwriting.

531
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,050
She asked me to deliver a message.

532
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,460
At dusk,

533
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,648
meet her at the waterfall
in Fengxi Valley.

534
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,900
Is she planning to show off

535
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,290
her singing and dancing skills?

536
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,610
You know about fragrant powders, right?

537
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:20,893
The kind that attracts butterflies.

538
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,330
Wanci is skilled in floral scents.

539
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,500
What I know is more suited
to venomous insects. It's different.

540
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,220
If she can do it,

541
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,915
then you, Thirteenth Young Lady
of Tang Clan, can do even better.

542
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,700
You've got this.

543
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,460
Good luck.

544
00:29:48,337 --> 00:29:50,248
What did you do
to attract so many wasps?

545
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,220
Flower... Flower powder.

546
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:52,360
Yingluo's flower powder.

547
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:52,940
Where?

548
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,850
On my clothes.

549
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:54,810
Take it off.

550
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,260
Hurry, take it off!

551
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,980
Yan Shao, why did you save me?

552
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,671
Because you are Rong Shukuang.

553
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:26,810
Don't... Don't move.

554
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,220
If there's a gap,
the wasps might get in.

555
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
They should be gone now.

556
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:33,090
Let's wait a little longer.

557
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,740
What if some are still there?

558
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,982
Thanks.

559
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,850
You didn't get stung, did you?

560
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,940
I had my mask, so no stings.

561
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,090
You?

562
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,530
I don't think I did either.

563
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,660
To come up with such a plan,

564
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,500
Miss Rong, you're truly one of a kind.

565
00:31:04,826 --> 00:31:06,271
Not many butterflies showed up,

566
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,500
but plenty of wasps did.

567
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,130
I suppose this is what it means
to "attract bees and butterflies."

568
00:31:12,982 --> 00:31:14,426
That was eye-opening.

569
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,330
I went through so much trouble

570
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,610
just to make you happy.

571
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,050
I've received

572
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:22,260
your kind gesture.

573
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,290
Oh, right, I also prepared a picnic.

574
00:31:26,537 --> 00:31:27,570
It's all the wasps' fault.

575
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,570
A picnic?

576
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,290
Still up for it?

577
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,090
Of course.

578
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,220
What is this?

579
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,740
This is called rainbow cake.

580
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,850
A type of pastry.

581
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,500
Doesn't it look like

582
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,330
the rainbow we saw that day?

583
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,770
Our fates are sealed,
and our hearts are aligned.

584
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,660
My heart,

585
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,660
is completely devoted to you,
Leader Chu.

586
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,370
Although we're not yet married,

587
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,370
in my heart,

588
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,570
I already see you as

589
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,315
the husband
who will accompany me for life.

590
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,610
Whatever you want me to do,

591
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,570
I will listen to you.

592
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,740
In my heart, there is only you.

593
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,130
No one else.

594
00:32:23,782 --> 00:32:25,271
Here, have a taste.

595
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,740
Oh, I forgot. You can't eat this.

596
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,570
Fine then.

597
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,090
Take the whole plate back with you.

598
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,900
When you're alone,

599
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,530
you can enjoy it slowly.

600
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,420
(You keep thinking about Leader Chu,)

601
00:32:44,248 --> 00:32:46,090
(but where exactly
does Yan Shao fit in?)

602
00:32:47,248 --> 00:32:48,260
I'll take my leave.

603
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,980
Well, this will drive you mad.

604
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:03,180
I'll let you see how deeply in love

605
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,290
Chu Tianyao and I are.

606
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,900
Let you drown in jealousy.

607
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,180
Seething with envy.

608
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,090
So long...

609
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,460
What is this...

610
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,660
Shaoci.

611
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,500
I ran into a little accident.

612
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,290
Luckily, Leader Chu was there.

613
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,370
What kind of accident

614
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,020
required you to change into his clothes?

615
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,610
Wasps.

616
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:38,610
Wasps?

617
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,740
Where exactly did you go?

618
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:43,560
And why were there wasps?

619
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:45,226
And how did you end up with Leader Chu?

620
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,980
That's between me and him.

621
00:33:48,404 --> 00:33:49,460
Not worth mentioning.

622
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,940
Shukuang.

623
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,050
What about Yan Shao?

624
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,826
You spend all your time
with Chu Tianyao now.

625
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:56,160
You don't even mention Yan Shao.

626
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,980
Have you truly let go of him?

627
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,960
I've already decided
to move on from him completely.

628
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,130
From now on,

629
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,740
I am the wife of the Leader of Tiangang.

630
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,370
Yan Shao and I have nothing
to do with each other.

631
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,650
Fickle and heartless.

632
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,380
You met her once,

633
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,610
and even lost your clothes?

634
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,420
Because of wasps.

635
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,940
Now, her heart is entirely
set on Chu Tianyao.

636
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,210
To be honest,

637
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,460
you should just come clean already.

638
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,980
Save yourself from being jealous
of yourself all day.

639
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,420
Take this and feed it to the dogs.

640
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:34,460
Fine. Feed it to the dogs.

641
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,170
Leader.

642
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:40,380
Young Master Lin
will be visiting tomorrow.

643
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,848
They've been here for a few days.

644
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,182
It's about time we meet.

645
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,737
I have matters
to discuss with him anyway.
