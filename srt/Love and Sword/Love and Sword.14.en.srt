17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 14=

19
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,440
How come it's you?

20
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,600
Yan Shao, you finally came.

21
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,410
How did you get that whistle?

22
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,650
Shukuang gave it to me.

23
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,290
Water supply.

24
00:02:38,404 --> 00:02:39,130
Shukuang, stop.

25
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,600
Yingluo.

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,130
Got it.

27
00:02:49,893 --> 00:02:51,640
Don't worry.
The water is not poisoned.

28
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,515
It's safe to drink.

29
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,810
Can you untie me now?

30
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:05,010
I'll go start a fire.

31
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,090
All right.

32
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm so sleepy.
I need to sleep for a bit.

33
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:50,920
Shaoci.

34
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:52,200
Have some wild fruit.

35
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
Thank you.

36
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:08,560
I'll take a nap.

37
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,893
Young Lady Lin, what are you doing here?

38
00:04:37,915 --> 00:04:40,280
I wanted to go to Mount Moye
with Shukuang and the others.

39
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,730
But Father and Shaoci
would never allow it.

40
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,760
So I followed them in secret.

41
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,930
You rarely ever leave Yuchi Manor.

42
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,490
This is quite the exception.

43
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,382
I'll arrange for someone
to take you back.

44
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,550
Yan Shao, don't send me back.

45
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,010
They never let me go anywhere.

46
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,250
But I want to see the world too.

47
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,930
Besides, I'll be safe with you around.

48
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,080
And what does that have to do
with me?

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,370
You're a highly skilled martial artist.

50
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,280
You're also with Tiangang.

51
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,715
So you won't stand by
and watch me die, right?

52
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,130
Besides, Shukuang has left.

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,880
Are you willing to become my bodyguard?

54
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,690
No.

55
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,400
Whatever Shukuang offered you,

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I'll double it.

57
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,050
Or if you have any wish,

58
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,320
I can make it come true.

59
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,010
Are you really going

60
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,730
to abandon me in the wilderness?

61
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,610
What if something happens to me?

62
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:30,400
Well, that would be pretty dangerous.

63
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,570
You're awake.

64
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,170
Little liar.

65
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,840
You were tricking me this whole time.

66
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:13,370
So, what do you think?

67
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,200
My acting was pretty convincing, right?

68
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,010
Yingluo...

69
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,840
Feng...

70
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,320
(The sound of the flute
messed with our minds,)

71
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,930
(the miasma in the air,)

72
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,440
(and even poisoned yourself)

73
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,200
(just to trick us.)

74
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,930
You're indeed clever.

75
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,610
So after all that,

76
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,640
you're the Master of Wuwang Pavilion.

77
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,080
That's right.

78
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,080
I'm Hua Sixue.

79
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm both
the Umbrella Ghost Lord and Lady.

80
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,200
Hua Qi was a name given to me
by Zuitian.

81
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,320
I really like it.

82
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:19,337
Fleeting beauty of the flowers
and the slow maturation of the wine.

83
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,130
Drunken slumber cannot compare
to the gentle fall of flowers.

84
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,250
Sounds nice, doesn't it?

85
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,490
(I knew he had something
to do with this.)

86
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,250
(You two really are a perfect match)

87
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:32,271
(like a pair of troublemakers fated
to meet.)

88
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,050
Why do you like him?

89
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,960
You have a thing for sneaky bad guys?

90
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,271
Don't talk about him like that.

91
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,610
Well,

92
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,370
he did capture me twice
but never killed me.

93
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,570
Maybe he has a soft spot for girls.

94
00:07:52,782 --> 00:07:54,048
Did you find them?

95
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,520
We searched everywhere.

96
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,604
But there's no sign of them.

97
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,370
Hua Qi played us from the start.

98
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,640
What do we do now?

99
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,370
Head to Xifeng Dock

100
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,760
and meet up with Tiangang.

101
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,490
Hua Qi.

102
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,930
Zuitian, save me.

103
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,170
Hua Qi got jealous

104
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,689
and nearly cut me down with her blade.

105
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,680
If you let that happen,
you'll lose me and the key.

106
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:22,320
Zuitian,

107
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,810
this woman is a smooth talker.

108
00:08:24,915 --> 00:08:27,026
Why not just cut off her tongue
and give it to Lie?

109
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,880
Maybe then it will finally speak
like humans.

110
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,130
No need for such drastic measures.
I'll just tell you.

111
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,048
You're giving away that easily?

112
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,920
You better not start spewing nonsense.

113
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,250
Sure, Yuchi Manor

114
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,880
did raise me.

115
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,160
But I'm only an adopted daughter.

116
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,280
Lin Qianyi won't give me
the manor's master position

117
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,040
he promised.

118
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,130
Lin Shaoci publicly rejected
my marriage proposal.

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,490
Do you really think

120
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,760
they would entrust me
with the treasure key?

121
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,370
Besides, I'm a coward
and I value my life more than anything.

122
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,880
Wealth tempts me,
and I submit to power.

123
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,210
So what kind of secret
do you think I can keep for them?

124
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,010
Keep talking.

125
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:09,130
To put it mildly,

126
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,850
even if I refuse to talk today

127
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,040
to keep their secret safe,

128
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,448
and let them get the treasure,

129
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,640
do you think

130
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,370
they would share some with me?

131
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:20,248
I haven't even asked anything yet,

132
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:21,982
and you're already spilling everything?

133
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,280
It's the usual set of questions,
isn't it?

134
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm just saving you some time.

135
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,520
So you're saying...

136
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm saying

137
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,330
that you...
You all caught the wrong person.

138
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,210
That's impossible.

139
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,490
If I don't say it outright,

140
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,610
will you ever notice

141
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,640
Miss Hua's little crush on you?

142
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:48,450
What nonsense are you talking about?

143
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:49,537
Then answer this question.

144
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,610
When Zuitian walked up the steps,
which foot did he step with first?

145
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,520
Right foot.

146
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,250
See?

147
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,640
Only people with feelings for someone
notice such small details.

148
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,450
I get it.

149
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,010
Oh.

150
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,370
Do you know

151
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,382
why the Leader of Tiangang insists
on marrying me?

152
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,920
Because there are two keys.

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,370
He has the other one.

154
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,370
Here.

155
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,090
We found it.

156
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,970
Double Nine?

157
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,970
Brother Shaoci,

158
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,160
how are you so sure

159
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,515
this is Tiangang's contact?

160
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:28,600
Double Nine adds up to 18.

161
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,926
The characters one and eight make a tree,

162
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:31,890
and two trees make a forest,
forming the character "Lin."

163
00:10:31,893 --> 00:10:35,000
Double Nine has arrived. I seek guidance
and assistance from Divine General.

164
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,026
Greetings, Young Master Lin.
I'm Feng Ming of Tiangang.

165
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,610
Miss Tang and Mr. Feng.

166
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,560
Shukuang was taken by Wuwang Pavilion.

167
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:46,850
Shaoci.

168
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,040
Wanci?

169
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,090
Wanci?

170
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:51,471
What are you doing here?

171
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,250
I wanted to see you off.

172
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,920
So I followed along.

173
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,090
I didn't expect

174
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,730
to fall into Wuwang Pavilion's hands.

175
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,490
Luckily, Yan Shao saved me.

176
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,210
So I made it here safely.

177
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,400
Did Rong Shukuang really give
this eagle-bone whistle to you?

178
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,515
What do you think?

179
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,010
They are...

180
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,850
Take her to the dock.
I'm going to rescue her.

181
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,400
Yan Shao?

182
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:19,920
Where is he?

183
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,850
He went to save Shukuang.

184
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,160
If I make it to Tiangang

185
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,680
and get his key,

186
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,871
wouldn't that be easier
than whatever you're planning?

187
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,490
Do you really think

188
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,090
I'd believe you would ally with me?

189
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,400
Well, if you kill me now,

190
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
you still won't get the key.

191
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,920
But if I make it to Tiangang,

192
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,970
there's a chance
I could get one for you.

193
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,560
The key isn't on you.

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,610
But Hua Qi found this on you.

195
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,760
Between this and the key,

196
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:56,330
which do you think is more valuable?

197
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,490
It's just a little trinket

198
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,040
from a friend.

199
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,160
It's not valuable.

200
00:12:03,582 --> 00:12:04,982
A lover's gift, perhaps?

201
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
The Leader of Tiangang, Chu Tianyao,

202
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,330
is unpredictable and full of tricks.

203
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,970
If you join him in Mount Moye,

204
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,490
I'll have no way to control you.

205
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,250
I, Shen Zuitian, always make sure

206
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,800
everything is foolproof,
leaving no loose ends.

207
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,920
So, what do you suggest?

208
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,920
You agreed to marry him

209
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,210
to divert the Ghost Valley Sect's
attack away

210
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,160
from Yuchi Manor,

211
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,090
using yourself as bait
and luring them away.

212
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,640
If I take you with me
to attack Yuchi Manor

213
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,760
and steal the key,

214
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,626
all I have to do is wait patiently

215
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:43,450
for Chu Tianyao to come looking for me.

216
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,520
Isn't that an easier plan?

217
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,680
Yan Shao, you're finally here.

218
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,850
You really are impossible to get rid of.

219
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:07,680
Let's go.

220
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,640
Zuitian!

221
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,490
Zuitian!

222
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,130
Yan Shao.

223
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,280
Are you all right?

224
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,370
I'm fine.

225
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,800
Get up.

226
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:03,093
There's a cave over there.

227
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:03,970
Let's go.

228
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:19,970
Just let him die.

229
00:15:37,182 --> 00:15:37,920
Make it tight.

230
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,130
Of course.

231
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,280
Shen Zuitian struck you
with his palm earlier.

232
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:42,560
How are you feeling?

233
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm fine.

234
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:47,880
Darn you.

235
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,090
If you wanted to kill him,
why bother saving him?

236
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,850
I...

237
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,680
I want to keep him alive
so I can torture him.

238
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,370
Fair enough.

239
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,730
You have a point.

240
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:01,109
Come help me up.

241
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,520
All right.

242
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,800
Hit me, huh?

243
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,730
Take this!

244
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,410
- I'll kick you to death.
- That's enough.

245
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,370
I thought I'd never see you again.

246
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,210
If I weren't in danger,

247
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,040
would you have ever come to find me?

248
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,026
If you had gone straight
to the dock as planned

249
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,382
and hadn't delayed on the way,

250
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:23,826
none of this would have happened.

251
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,490
So you really didn't want to see me.

252
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,920
I just don't understand

253
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,370
why we always meet
under such terrible circumstances.

254
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,450
You're injured,

255
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,680
and your wounds got wet.

256
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:42,010
In a place like this,
it's easy for it to get infected.

257
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,560
It can get serious and even be fatal.

258
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,160
It's not that easy to die.

259
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:49,330
How come you didn't faint
at the sight of blood now?

260
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,400
You're right.

261
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:52,090
I don't know either.

262
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,010
And last time,

263
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,010
I even used
the Flowing Cloud Finger.

264
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,730
Maybe my body and I
are finally getting used to each other.

265
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,210
Getting used to each other?

266
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,250
When we came in, I looked around.

267
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,650
The terrain outside is rough.

268
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,010
Both of you are injured.

269
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,080
So we probably won't be able

270
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,800
to leave for a while.

271
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,340
Let's start a fire and dry our clothes.

272
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,110
Once the bleeding stops
and we recover a bit,

273
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,271
we'll leave as soon as we can.

274
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,360
Wait here.

275
00:17:20,404 --> 00:17:21,930
I'll go find something to start a fire.

276
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,410
All right.

277
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,890
Wait.

278
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,410
Take this for protection.

279
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:50,930
Why did I even bother saving
Shen Zuitian?

280
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,840
I finally got to see Master,

281
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,560
but he was injured.

282
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,840
If we were alone,
we could spend more time together.

283
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,760
Tonight, I should just kill Shen Zuitian

284
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,210
and enjoy some quality time with Master.

285
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,080
Here you go.

286
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,890
Do I really have to bandage him up?

287
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,800
Is it necessary?

288
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,490
Since you saved him,

289
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:33,690
are you just going
to let him bleed to death now?

290
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:37,170
Aren't we being too kind to a villain?

291
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:49,760
(Young Shen Zuitian)

292
00:18:58,826 --> 00:19:00,490
Young Master, is there anyone there?

293
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,760
No one is here. Check over there.

294
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,410
Got it.

295
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,930
I see now.

296
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:42,930
You're drawing the poison out for her.

297
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,600
What poison?

298
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,840
Crimson Lotus Heart?

299
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:03,360
How did you know about it?

300
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,120
I also know

301
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,730
that once poisoned,

302
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,450
the pain will eventually seep
into the bones,

303
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,970
making you want
to rip your own flesh apart.

304
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,740
Have you seen
someone poisoned by it before?

305
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,970
Is there a cure?

306
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,210
No.

307
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,360
(This poison has no antidote.)

308
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,930
Leader, this woman is dangerous.

309
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,280
You must keep your distance.

310
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,690
Why would I, the Leader
of the Ghost Valley Sect,

311
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,210
be afraid of a dying woman?

312
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,010
So you're the Leader
of the Ghost Valley Sect?

313
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,410
Tell me

314
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,080
where are the map and the key?

315
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,730
The key...

316
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,080
The map...

317
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,010
Speak!

318
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,280
They're at...

319
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,600
Leader! Leader!

320
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,890
Who was that person?

321
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,450
My father.

322
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,450
The person who poisoned him

323
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,010
was Su Shiyu.

324
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:27,120
Master.

325
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,560
Master, we've searched everywhere
at the bottom of the cliff.

326
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,810
There's no sign of Leader Shen.

327
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,782
(Hua Qi, Wuwang Pavilion)
Did you check all along the river?

328
00:22:32,804 --> 00:22:33,293
Yes, we did.

329
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:35,537
The current at the point
where he fell is too strong.

330
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,840
He was probably swept
further downstream.

331
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:40,120
Then search further downstream.

332
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:42,426
Whoever finds him first
will be rewarded handsomely.

333
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,520
If you fail,

334
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,350
don't even think
about getting the antidote.

335
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,210
Yes, Master Hua!

336
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:53,930
Search carefully.

337
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,210
We must find Yan Shao before they do.

338
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:57,600
Understood.

339
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,210
You're still alive, huh,
you big villain?

340
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,280
I'm not that easy to kill.

341
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,210
But your beloved

342
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,320
might not be so lucky.

343
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,040
His wound is infected.

344
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,760
My master is just tired.

345
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,160
He wants to sleep a little longer.

346
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,560
Is that so?

347
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,040
Before you woke up,

348
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,280
I called him several times.

349
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,450
But he didn't respond at all.

350
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,560
He's in a deep sleep.

351
00:23:55,026 --> 00:23:56,080
None of your business!

352
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:57,970
If it weren't for you,

353
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,930
we wouldn't be in this mess.

354
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,337
He was already seriously injured,

355
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:04,330
and he's forced his internal energy
to circulate.

356
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,600
If the Yunmen and Zhongfu acupoints
aren't sealed in time,

357
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,320
his life will be in danger.

358
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,826
When did he circulate
his internal energy?

359
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,490
Where are the acupoints you mentioned?

360
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:19,410
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

361
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,120
Hurry up and untie me.

362
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,800
I'll do it.

363
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,800
Rong Shukuang!

364
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,650
You're a bag of tricks.

365
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,040
Sorry to say that your trick won't work.

366
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:55,210
You should think carefully.

367
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,250
At this place,

368
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,930
you can't save him yourself.

369
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,040
What? Are you scared?

370
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,360
You'd better behave and...

371
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,890
Remove the bandage.

372
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,840
Don't worry.

373
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,080
I won't kill a dying man.

374
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,840
This cave is like Ruthless Parlor to me.

375
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,490
Inside it,

376
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,890
I won't kill anyone.

377
00:25:52,604 --> 00:25:53,826
Remove the bandage now.

378
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,010
You better keep your word.

379
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,890
Your method is pretty primitive.

380
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,320
It looks like you're more
seriously injured than I thought.

381
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,970
So the only reason

382
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,360
you agreed not to kill in this cave

383
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,490
is to protect yourself, huh?

384
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,930
In your condition,

385
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,650
you can't leave this cave either.

386
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,120
Rong Shukuang.

387
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,210
If I wanted you dead,

388
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,080
you wouldn't have lived to see today.

389
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,490
Oh? Should I thank you then?

390
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:40,930
You...

391
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,930
Lie...

392
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:54,970
I need to find that dog first,

393
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,560
or we will be in danger.

394
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,040
You're awake.

395
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,490
Soon, you'll get to taste

396
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,520
a meal personally cooked by me.

397
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,170
By the way,

398
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,730
that Lie of yours is not bad at all.

399
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,320
Lie?

400
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,600
Rong Shukuang! I will kill you for this!

401
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,730
Rong Shukuang!

402
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:36,520
You said it yourself.

403
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,410
No fighting inside this cave.

404
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:39,560
You must keep your word.

405
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,010
Stop provoking him already.

406
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,650
Go.

407
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,800
Lie.

408
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,210
I have to say

409
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,170
your little cutie is really something.

410
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,490
He even scraped his legs
on tree branches

411
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,410
just to bring us some grilled food.

412
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,690
Such loyalty is truly touching.

413
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Master, eat more meat.

414
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,182
It'll help you recover faster.

415
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,170
All right.

416
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,337
Master, there's still no sign of him.

417
00:28:14,337 --> 00:28:15,848
Lie is the most intelligent dog.

418
00:28:15,893 --> 00:28:18,493
Even if it didn't find anything,
it would've come back to report.

419
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:19,840
Unless

420
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,120
someone has confined it.

421
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:23,650
Notify the Ghost Valley Sect.

422
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,280
Have them send out
every available person

423
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:26,490
to search along the riverbank.

424
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:29,320
I want him found, dead or alive.

425
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:29,960
Yes, Master.

426
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,890
I'm the Leader of the Ghost Valley Sect,

427
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,840
and you want me to catch fish?

428
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,040
If you don't eat, you'll starve anyway.

429
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,170
Take these.

430
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,970
Lie and I will wait in the cave.

431
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,930
Today, whoever catches the most fish

432
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,271
will be the number one warrior
of Shaokuangtian Mansion.

433
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,690
Shaokuangtian Mansion?

434
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,800
Yes, I named our cave.

435
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,600
All three of our names
are included in it.

436
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,490
Impressive, right?

437
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,450
Not bad.

438
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,650
Stop wasting time. Catch some fish.

439
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,048
You can do it!

440
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,450
The Ice Jade Sword
truly lives up to its name.

441
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:18,604
Leader Shen, you are unmatched
throughout the land.

442
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:21,226
Consider me taught.

443
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:24,337
I got a taste of yours too.

444
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,930
Am I interrupting something?

445
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,800
If so, I'll leave.

446
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,360
Can you walk with your injured leg?

447
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,600
To be honest, it wouldn't be so bad

448
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,019
if we could stay here forever.

449
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,810
Are you trying to run away
from your wedding?

450
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,450
Do you want me to?

451
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,040
That's your choice.

452
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,890
Then let's just roam the world together,

453
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
live in seclusion,

454
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,650
and forget about the treasure
and the manor.

455
00:30:01,915 --> 00:30:02,915
What about Leader Chu?

456
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,210
I don't even know him.

457
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,600
He can do whatever he wants.

458
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,730
And Shen Zuitian?

459
00:30:10,582 --> 00:30:11,893
He won't be easy to deal with.

460
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,650
Then why don't we wait

461
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,426
until he falls asleep tonight
and we can...

462
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,650
I was joking.

463
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:28,800
Master.

464
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,560
Before you left the manor,

465
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,450
there were still things
I hadn't told you.

466
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,560
When I went looking for you,

467
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,600
you were already gone.

468
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:39,120
What did you want to say?

469
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,520
I wanted to tell you

470
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,170
that I...
