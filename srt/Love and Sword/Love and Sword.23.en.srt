Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

=Episode 23=

19
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:44,866
(Hanyu Pavilion)

20
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:45,500
Come here!

21
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,199
- I'm still grinding it.
- Get over here.

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,182
Why are you holding that?

23
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:49,071
Stand still.

24
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:49,810
What now?

25
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:50,860
Hold still.

26
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,940
And then,

27
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:52,648
crouch.

28
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:53,530
Raise your hands.

29
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,300
Raise your chest and lift your chin.

30
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,515
What are you up to this time?

31
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,450
I can't take my wedding photos now.

32
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,170
Can't I at least get a portrait?

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,500
A portrait of me?

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,100
That pose just now wasn't nice.

35
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:09,490
What if...

36
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,540
Your hand...

37
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,450
I told you to crouch.

38
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,210
Fine.

39
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,100
Raise your hand.

40
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,048
Hand at your waist.

41
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,210
Hold still.

42
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,170
Good.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,930
Crouch.

44
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:20,730
Fine.

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,730
Are you doing what Jin Buyao does?

46
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,890
After I die,

47
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:31,050
will you carry the portrait with you?

48
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,450
Nonsense.

49
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,450
Don't jinx yourself.

50
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,300
Having a place in each other's hearts
and no secrets

51
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,100
is the true meaning of happiness.

52
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,650
I just want

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,450
to record every second
and every wonderful moment

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,260
we've had.

55
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,420
Alright, stop dillydallying.

56
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,980
Go on.

57
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,860
Alright.

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:56,700
Stand here.

59
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,715
- Fine.
- Stand still.

60
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:00,820
This should do it.

61
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,860
The usual pose.

62
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,020
You look cool this way.

63
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,420
Do not move.

64
00:03:11,337 --> 00:03:12,540
I'll start drawing now.

65
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:13,730
Stay still.

66
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:40,740
(Shuxin Pavilion)

67
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,540
Brother Shaoci,
Sister Rong is not back yet.

68
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,050
I'll ask Chu Tianyao.

69
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,140
I'll go too.

70
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,770
Young Master Lin and Miss Tang.

71
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,380
Yesterday

72
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,860
was the wedding

73
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,610
of our Leader and Madam.

74
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,820
As of now,

75
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,820
the ceremony has been completed.

76
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,890
Young Master Lin and Miss Tang,
you need not worry.

77
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,050
A wedding with no guests?

78
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,140
Not bad, Sister Rong!

79
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,330
A secret wedding?

80
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,300
This is rushed and inadequate.

81
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,890
You misunderstood.

82
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,380
The ceremony was done

83
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,850
according to Miss Rong's requirements.

84
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:20,450
What's wrong with Shukuang?

85
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
Sister Rong and Leader Chu are married.

86
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,210
They didn't tell us

87
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:26,180
or invite any guests.

88
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,090
Just the two of them.

89
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:27,940
Impossible.

90
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,020
This is unorthodox.

91
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,410
According to Miss Rong,

92
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,450
the wedding was a matter

93
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,450
between her and Leader Chu.

94
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,850
The others shouldn't be concerned.

95
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,890
Besides,

96
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,180
Leader Chu has a message for all of you.

97
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,770
When the Six Great Sects gather
at the Moye Manor,

98
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,060
he will hold another

99
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,380
grander and more formal wedding.

100
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:54,620
Therefore,

101
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,580
there is nothing to worry about,
Young Lady Lin.

102
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,500
I've delivered the message.

103
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:00,940
I take my leave now.

104
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,090
Brother Shaoci, are you alright?

105
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,770
Yes.

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,290
I wish I could give them my best wishes

107
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:12,940
in person.

108
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,260
But...

109
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,330
(Why would she marry Chu Tianyao?)

110
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,210
(Is it a plot to get the key?)

111
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,410
Stay still!

112
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,290
How long is this going to take?

113
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,770
You're a great hero.

114
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,060
It's going to take some time.

115
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,210
Just hang in there.

116
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,700
Wait! Stop right there!

117
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,140
- I'm not done yet!
- Let me see it.

118
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,060
Don't come any closer.

119
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,410
- Come on, show it to me.
- I'm not done yet!

120
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,410
Let me see it.

121
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:50,740
No!

122
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,290
You can see it later!

123
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,970
Stop running.

124
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,330
Settle down.

125
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,330
I'll show it to you in a moment!

126
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,290
Let me see it now!

127
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,770
Darling!

128
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:03,740
Show it to me.

129
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
It took you an entire day

130
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,650
just to draw this?

131
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,060
It looks remarkable.

132
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,180
It's special.

133
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,530
You don't like my drawing.

134
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,700
It's fine.

135
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,700
If anyone ever asks you

136
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,210
what your husband looks like,

137
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,180
show them this drawing.

138
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,330
I bet they will say,

139
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,140
"This guy?

140
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,150
"This guy married the daughter
of the Yuchi Manor?"

141
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,260
"He must be very capable."

142
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,020
Then, I'll say,

143
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,580
"What would you know?"

144
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,620
"My husband is a young hero in red

145
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,450
with an honorable poise."

146
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,290
"He's saved me from perils

147
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,530
and shown me so much joy."

148
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,770
A dream in the martial arts world.

149
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,450
You drew this?

150
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,210
This is when we first met
in the desert.

151
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,650
I kept asking you to strike
different poses.

152
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,180
Are you mad at me?

153
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,620
Actually, I've finished

154
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,890
all of these images

155
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
in my mind.

156
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,380
Father, this way.

157
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,770
Shukuang.

158
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,020
Are you...

159
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,820
I brought you here

160
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,580
to explain something to you.

161
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,850
Is there a problem

162
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,450
with the Mount Moye?

163
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,460
This is Leader Chu's room.

164
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,340
We've already married.

165
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,220
When did you get married?

166
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,410
Why wasn't I told?

167
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,810
Just yesterday.

168
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,140
Tianyao and I are meant for each other.

169
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,170
We feel connected.

170
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,810
I didn't want to wait any longer.

171
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,100
We secretly got married yesterday.

172
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,620
There is another matter

173
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,810
I must tell you.

174
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:23,570
Yan Shao?

175
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,170
Leader Chu, you're Yan Shao all along?

176
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,020
Over the years,

177
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,770
no one knew Chu Tianyao

178
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,860
because I roamed the martial arts world

179
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,020
as Yan Shao.

180
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,810
I'm surprised.

181
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,500
You...

182
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,570
You did this for Shukuang.

183
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,260
Indeed.

184
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,290
Su Shiyu is my master.

185
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,337
Shukuang and I grew up together
in Misty Moon Village.

186
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:47,930
After my master passed away,

187
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,530
I promised her

188
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:52,020
I'd keep Shukuang safe
as long as I live and breathe.

189
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,260
My martial brother's adopted son

190
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,770
was Shiyu's disciple all along.

191
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:00,648
When Ghost Valley Sect
slaughtered the village,

192
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,530
Master gave me and Shukuang

193
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,340
the keys to the treasure.

194
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,100
The keys are now combined.

195
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,170
Shukuang agreed with me.

196
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,100
We will destroy the key

197
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,650
with everyone witnessing it.

198
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,410
I never asked for any conflicts
or disputes.

199
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,170
I agreed with my husband.

200
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,050
This is the only way

201
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,290
to completely

202
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,290
cut off the people's source of greed.

203
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,100
It should make the evildoers give up

204
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,140
on finding it.

205
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:31,620
Very well.

206
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,915
Did you learn anything?

207
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,530
Mount Moye is crawling with guards.

208
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,100
It's best to tread carefully.

209
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:08,340
The alliance formation gathering
is in two days.

210
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,340
We can't afford more mistakes.

211
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,620
Dismissed.

212
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,290
Why did you tie my servant up?

213
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,740
Did he do anything

214
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,020
to upset you?

215
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,930
He is no servant.

216
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,515
He is the Wailing Phantom
of the Ruthless Parlor.

217
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,050
He lost his home
after what happened to Ruthless Parlor.

218
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,650
He asked me to take him in.

219
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,770
So, I made him my sidekick.

220
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,650
I had no idea

221
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,220
who he was before this.

222
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,930
I had Father's permission.

223
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,340
What did you mean

224
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,648
there could be no more
mistakes at the alliance formation

225
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:52,493
gathering?

226
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,650
I asked him to learn more
about the gathering

227
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,860
because if I fall sick again
and can't attend it,

228
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,340
I still need to know
what happens at the gathering.

229
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,620
And why do you ask?

230
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,260
Shaoci.

231
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,570
I am still a member of the Yuchi Manor.

232
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,690
You and Shukuang always got to attend

233
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,460
important events like this.

234
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,220
But I could only wait in my room.

235
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,340
When I wake up in the morning,

236
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,500
I stare at the pagoda tree
outside my window.

237
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,810
You can leave the manor
and even the city.

238
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,770
You're free to roam the world.

239
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,760
You are free to witness
the wonders of the world.

240
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,160
You meet all kinds of people.

241
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,650
But all I have is a tree.

242
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,980
Wanci.

243
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,050
It can't be helped
that your body is frail.

244
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,260
The same excuse again.

245
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,290
I grow up hearing the same excuse.

246
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:40,890
I'm tired of it.

247
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,500
I told myself

248
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,380
to never get disheartened.

249
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,340
I can contribute to the manor too.

250
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,100
Wanci.

251
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,500
Don't push yourself too hard.

252
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,690
Shaoci.

253
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,690
You still have no idea

254
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,290
what I yearn for.

255
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,460
You are homesick.

256
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,460
I'll inform Father tomorrow

257
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,340
to send you home as soon as possible.

258
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm not going back.

259
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,810
I want to stay with you and Father.

260
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,570
I'm safer with you.

261
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,582
How would you like me
to handle this person?

262
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,930
He is just a man without a home.

263
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,460
If you don't trust him,

264
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,650
you can send him away.

265
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,740
Sir, thanks for taking care of me.

266
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,050
I'm feeling better now.

267
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,620
I should be able
to attend the gathering.

268
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,650
They want to destroy the keys.

269
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,380
Do you serve Wanci

270
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,980
because you're plotting something?

271
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,170
I'm a homeless person.

272
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,460
Young Lady Lin took me in.

273
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,220
Why would I harm my benefactor?

274
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,650
I am the Wailing Phantom.

275
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,620
But I am not an ingrate.

276
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,570
Shaoci, don't worry.

277
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,530
With my health,

278
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,220
what could I possibly do?

279
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,620
The gathering

280
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,204
of the Six Great Sects is coming soon.

281
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,740
I don't want Father to be
bothered by trivial matters.

282
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,890
Once the gathering is over,

283
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,620
I'll return to the Yuchi Manor.

284
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,100
Head Yu.

285
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,770
The people from
the Yuchi Manor are here?

286
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,380
Yes.

287
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,100
This way, please.

288
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,570
Greetings, Madam Xing and Head Tang.

289
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,050
Welcome to Tiangang.

290
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,690
Please proceed.

291
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,530
My concern is
that Madam Xing is cunning.

292
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,020
Can you really convince her?

293
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,170
There must be a way.

294
00:15:10,604 --> 00:15:12,404
Well, as the First Young Lady
of Tang Clan,

295
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,050
you certainly have your own plans.

296
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,500
It's not what you think.

297
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,290
You're not using poison?

298
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,570
The one thing

299
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,020
more powerful than poison

300
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
is taking advantage of others' fears.

301
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,220
You're one step ahead.

302
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,020
I came

303
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,690
because I need some Heart Devourer.

304
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,020
Make sure everything is foolproof.

305
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,290
This poison is unusual.

306
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,460
Prolonged consumption

307
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,020
might actually endanger
your uncle's life.

308
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:46,570
When you become the alliance leader,

309
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,410
and when we have the treasure,

310
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,740
can we forsake him?

311
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:55,890
Eldest Brother,

312
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,690
who will you nominate

313
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,530
as the alliance leader tomorrow?

314
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,140
Master Lin has always
favored the Spirit Fox Sect.

315
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:07,050
But he is advanced in his years.

316
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,260
The Tang Clan could be
a potential candidate.

317
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:13,050
Eldest Brother,
this concerns a lot of people.

318
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:13,530
We should...

319
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,740
Go and get some rest.

320
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,380
Why did you

321
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,740
come to see me in person?

322
00:16:54,804 --> 00:16:55,860
Where is Wailing Phantom?

323
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,860
He's been caught by Shaoci.

324
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,170
He can't just leave now.

325
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,690
The gathering is tomorrow.

326
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,500
What is the plan, Leader Shen?

327
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,850
When the Six Great Sects gather,

328
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,700
I will infiltrate Tiangang
and launch a pincer attack.

329
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,610
We can take them all out.

330
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,570
You must not.

331
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,530
The sects' elite warriors

332
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,050
will attend the gathering.

333
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,220
Besides, Chu Tianyao will be there.

334
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,604
Brute force isn't going to work.

335
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,940
Chu Tianyao resides on Mount Moye

336
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,740
because of Yan Shao.

337
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,130
But Crimson Lotus Heart
had caused Yan Shao great damage.

338
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,770
A dead man walking is no threat.

339
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,290
What? Do you feel sorry for him?

340
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,330
You seem rather devoted to Yan Shao.

341
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,050
What a shame.

342
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,660
You still lost him
after you risked your life for him.

343
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,330
There's more to the Six Great Sects
than meets the eye.

344
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,530
Leader Shen, we must change our plan.

345
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,180
Rong Shukuang and Chu Tianyao

346
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,980
are going to destroy the keys.

347
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:05,370
(Shuxin Pavilion)

348
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,570
Shukuang.

349
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,740
Your wedding gown looks gorgeous.

350
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,020
After just one glance,

351
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,130
I couldn't help but try it on.

352
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,420
Can I help you with anything?

353
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,260
Unfortunately for me,

354
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,460
I might not live

355
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,900
to see my own wedding.

356
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,740
Rong Shukuang.

357
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,330
In what aspect are you better than me?

358
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,370
I am the Young Lady Lin
of the Yuchi Manor.

359
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,090
But why do people like you instead?

360
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,900
Ever since you came to the Yuchi Manor,

361
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,500
my father, brother,

362
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,980
and everyone only care about
the girl named Rong Shukuang.

363
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,220
They don't care about me.

364
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,500
It's you.

365
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,370
You took everything
that was rightfully mine.

366
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,610
Do you remember that fortune teller

367
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,940
at Blossom's Smile?

368
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,050
Remember what he said?

369
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,810
I'm destined to live without
a home or family.

370
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,570
I was to cast my past aside
and marry a man from far away.

371
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
Is that the life you long for?

372
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,180
You only see your own suffering.

373
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,570
You always overlook

374
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,220
how much I've lost.

375
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,770
Loss?

376
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,130
Who are you to talk about losses?

377
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,610
When you were the hero
in everyone's eyes,

378
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,900
I could only be in the company
of plants in my room.

379
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,050
Everyone I've ever cared about

380
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,180
only cares about you.

381
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,090
Even Yan Shao

382
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,220
ingratiated himself with me
just to deceive me.

383
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,420
He tricked me into telling the truth.

384
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,220
He never cared about me.

385
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,850
Even if I were gone,

386
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,260
you'd never have his love.

387
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,330
Why?

388
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,370
Your family name was Fang!

389
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,660
Why do you get to use
my mother's family name?

390
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,020
I could risk my life for Yan Shao,

391
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,130
but he wouldn't bat me an eye.

392
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,420
He loves you so much

393
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,330
that he would transfer
Crimson Lotus Heart

394
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,770
to his own body.

395
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,290
Tell me.

396
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,660
Should I kill you

397
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,700
for a chance to have his love?

398
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,770
Killing me won't cure him

399
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,810
of the poison.

400
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:43,770
Why you...

401
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,500
Spare me the false kindness!

402
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,740
Why did you come here?

403
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,740
I'm here to offer a deal.

404
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,220
I can help you unlock
the Fuxian treasure.

405
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,460
I've made up my mind.

406
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:02,940
I won't open it.

407
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
What if Yan Shao needs you to unlock it?

408
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:06,980
He won't.

409
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,020
You claim to love him,

410
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,740
but you don't seem to
understand him at all.

411
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,020
He won't risk unlocking the treasure

412
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,850
for another age of conflict.

413
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,180
He will never

414
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,530
let someone like you have the treasure.

415
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020
Yan Shao won't do it,

416
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,940
but you will.

417
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,530
You will unlock the treasure
for Yan Shao's sake.

418
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,050
I am the wife of Tiangang's Leader.

419
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,810
Yan Shao means nothing to me now.

420
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,500
Please leave.

421
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,020
Chief Jiang
of the Seven-Star Hall arrives.

422
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:38,570
What is this about?

423
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,330
Uncle!

424
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,660
He fell terribly sick all of a sudden.

425
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:45,515
Young Master Ruhai is the only
candidate from the Seven-Star Hall.

426
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,050
I only followed

427
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:49,500
my uncle's instructions.

428
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,460
I infiltrated the Ghost Valley Sect
to earn their trust.

429
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,700
But I've been serving
the Six Great Sects all along.

430
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,050
How touching.

431
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,460
You're quite a filial son.

432
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,460
Uncle!

433
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,050
The Leader of Tiangang is here.

434
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,130
Everyone,

435
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,740
this is Chu Tianyao,
the Leader of Tiangang.

436
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,460
All Six Great Sects gather
on Mount Moye.

437
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,700
I am honored by your presence.

438
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,160
I apologize for the lack
of a proper welcome.

439
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,530
So, the rumors are true after all.

440
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,260
You are a mysterious figure.

441
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,940
Just some baseless rumors.

442
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,370
I hope you don't mind.

443
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,220
Leader Chu and I invited all of you

444
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,330
to use the wedding as an opportunity

445
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,090
to quell the evils lurking on our land
and uphold justice.

446
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,900
The Six Great Sects are here.

447
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,330
The Six Great Sects?

448
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,530
Master Lin, you can't be serious.

449
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,500
The Six Great Sects are gone.

450
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,570
I'm still here.

451
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,180
What?

452
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,460
The Junshan Sect is here.

453
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,850
Him...?

454
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,660
As long as I live,
the Junshan Sect lives.

455
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,050
As long as I breathe,

456
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,810
the Junshan Sect stands.

457
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:17,130
I am my own sect.

458
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,570
I thought the sect was wiped out.

459
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,980
This is the traitor who is wanted
by the Junshan Sect

460
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,770
for killing their chief,

461
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,090
Shangguan Tong.

462
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,370
Shangguan Tong didn't kill their chief.

463
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,460
Indeed.

464
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,900
The Ghost Valley Sect killed my master.

465
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,740
The Ghost Valley Sect bribed our people

466
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,770
to poison my master

467
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,370
and kill him.

468
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,660
Why do you wait until now
to tell us the truth?

469
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,900
He didn't tell anyone

470
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,500
because he thought his master

471
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,220
became deranged from an accident

472
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,740
during cultivation.

473
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,570
He hid the truth to preserve

474
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,900
his master's reputation.

475
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,050
He sought Tiangang's help to uncover

476
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,460
the truth of his master's death.

477
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,980
And he learned the truth.

478
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,090
The Ghost Valley Sect
bribed our disciples

479
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,050
to put poison in my master's tea,

480
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,530
causing him to hallucinate
and become deranged.

481
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,370
I even brought

482
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:10,740
the letters they exchanged.

483
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,500
These secret letters

484
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
were found by the disciples of Tiangang

485
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,700
after the Junshan Sect was wiped out.

486
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,050
Tiangang can guarantee

487
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,850
that these letters

488
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,050
are all authentic.

489
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,220
Shangguan Tong,

490
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,260
if your master could see
how much you've done,

491
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,900
he'd gladly entrust the sect to you

492
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,420
so you could rebuild it.

493
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,420
My sect was slaughtered
by the Ghost Valley Sect.

494
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,700
Unless you learn from this tragedy,

495
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,180
and see who the enemy is,

496
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,260
you will be massacred

497
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,290
just like the Junshan Sect.

498
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,900
The Ghost Valley Sect incites chaos.

499
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,740
Only by forming an alliance

500
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,260
and fighting as one

501
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,220
to quell the Ghost Valley Sect

502
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,290
can we ensure peace.

503
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,370
We need an alliance leader

504
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,460
to lead us.

505
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:30,700
The Yuchi Manor has always
led the Six Great Sects.

506
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,660
In terms of experience and reputation,

507
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,290
Master Lin is the best candidate.

508
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,850
I beg to differ.

509
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,130
Head Tang is meticulous
and excels in martial arts.

510
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,610
She is a better leader.

511
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,130
Is that your sister's goal?

512
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,420
My sister wouldn't be so reckless.

513
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,693
Given the circumstances,
I can't be too sure.

514
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,220
We'll wait and see.

515
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,330
Jiang Ruhai.

516
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:55,900
Do you think we will
take your word for it

517
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,090
because you claim to be a spy?

518
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,330
I explain the matter about
the Yu family to your eldest brother.

519
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,180
It's not your place to speak here.

520
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,810
Why you...

521
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:05,740
Linglong.

522
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:08,115
There must be a misunderstanding.

523
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,530
I was poisoned by the Ghost Valley Sect.

524
00:27:10,848 --> 00:27:12,290
I must take an antidote regularly.

525
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,940
Mr. Jiang stole it from
the Ghost Valley Sect

526
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
and sent it to me.

527
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,660
Otherwise, I'd be dead already.

528
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,500
I never told you
because I knew you'd be worried.

529
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,500
You never mentioned that to me.

530
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,980
I agree

531
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,370
to let the Tang Clan lead the alliance.

532
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,850
If you think so,

533
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,900
you must have considered

534
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,940
all the pros and cons.

535
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,220
Indeed.

536
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,260
Very well.

537
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
As of now,

538
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,500
the Junshan Sect nominates Master Lin,

539
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,530
while the Seven-Star Hall

540
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,850
and the Pure Sword Sect
nominate Head Tang.

541
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,382
And the Spirit Fox Sect?

542
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
What is your decision?

543
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,700
The Spirit Fox Sect...

544
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:56,020
We are willing to follow
Head Tang's leadership.

545
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,700
Very well.

546
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,660
You've all made your decision.

547
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,740
Congratulations, Head Tang.

548
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:07,900
You are the alliance leader
of the Six Great Sects.

549
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,530
Congratulations, Head Tang.

550
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,980
You shall lead us on a conquest
to eliminate the Ghost Valley Sect.

551
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
As you know,

552
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:20,940
I, Tang Chanyi,

553
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,420
have always steered clear
of conflicts and disputes.

554
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,570
However,

555
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,220
upholding the peace
of our martial arts world

556
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:32,420
is the duty of all my predecessors.

557
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,700
Since I am elected
as the alliance leader,

558
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:37,570
I won't fail you.

559
00:28:38,248 --> 00:28:39,770
Let's make use of this opportunity.

560
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,940
With you as our alliance leader,

561
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,260
we can discuss

562
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,570
how to unlock the Fuxian treasure.

563
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,050
Alliance Leader Tang,
the alliance has formed.

564
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,260
What will you do with the treasure?

565
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,940
Any propositions?

566
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,610
Ambition and greed

567
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,050
will only bring endless
bloodshed and sorrow.

568
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,530
Master Lin, Shukuang, and I
discussed the matter.

569
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,610
We plan to destroy the keys

570
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,770
with everyone here as our witnesses

571
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,330
to avoid more bloodshed.

572
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,660
You can't be serious!

573
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,740
You can't destroy the keys!

574
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:15,130
Could we speak with Young Lady Lin?

575
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,570
Wanci is unwell.
If we send for her now...

576
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,260
Very well.

577
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,530
Bring Young Lady Lin here.

578
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:21,530
Yes.

579
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,810
The treasure key was

580
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,180
the cause of discord
among the Six Great Sects.

581
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,770
I've decided.

582
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,500
We'll do as Leader Chu proposed.

583
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:35,770
We'll destroy the keys
to avoid more bloodshed.

584
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:36,900
Chanyi, you can't...

585
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:37,900
As you all know,

586
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,260
I've always hated defeat.

587
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,980
I took an oath

588
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,537
to become the Head of the Tang Clan.

589
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,020
I swore to never get married

590
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,810
or have children.

591
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:53,500
And today, you've made me
your alliance leader.

592
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,090
I'm truly honored.

593
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,370
Ruhai.

594
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,900
Someone once told me

595
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,130
as long as

596
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,260
you have your legs,

597
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,180
you'd never rest.

598
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,570
What?

599
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,180
- What happened?
- He just collapsed!

600
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,090
Everyone,

601
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,940
Jiang Ruhai's legs have been crippled.

602
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,900
This is justice for the Six Great Sects.

603
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,537
Eldest Brother.

604
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,980
The antidote!

605
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,700
Take this.

606
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:43,130
Chief Jiang became sick

607
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,090
because of Jiang Ruhai.

608
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,740
The medicine I gave him

609
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,020
only caused temporary damage.

610
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:49,370
Take it regularly.

611
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,850
He will get well.

612
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:53,900
Chanyi!

613
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,810
How could you lie to me?

614
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,850
You are prudent,
and you work in the dark

615
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:04,900
for the sake of the Six Great Sects.

616
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,020
On behalf of Tiangang,

617
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,570
I thank you.

618
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:12,420
Each sect has its own goals.

619
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,220
We loathe each other

620
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,290
while worrying about

621
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,940
getting overshadowed
by the other sects.

622
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:19,090
But when a common enemy rises,

623
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,740
we band together as an iron wall.

624
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,290
I have never

625
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,900
considered the other sects my equals.

626
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,220
But I do understand that our fates

627
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,530
are tied together.

628
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,770
Jiang Ruhai thinks his lies

629
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,180
could instigate the Tang Clan
to fight the other sects.

630
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,090
He overestimates himself.

631
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,330
After years of fighting,

632
00:31:40,671 --> 00:31:41,850
I've grown sick and tired.

633
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,290
Leader Chu, you know me well.

634
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,130
I will agree to assist you,

635
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,940
but on one condition.

636
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,570
All right.

637
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,048
I agree with your condition.

638
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,980
You have my thanks, Leader Chu.
