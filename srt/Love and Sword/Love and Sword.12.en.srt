17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,480
(Adapted from Shen Cangmei's novel
Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,010
=Episode 12=

19
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,980
So the legendary lightness techniques

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,260
mean reacting faster than normal people.

21
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,020
Not bad.

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,648
I should make a video breaking down
this technique when I get home.

23
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:53,582
What did you say?

24
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,050
Nothing.

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,690
Master,

26
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,180
where is your hometown?

27
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,620
My master raised me.

28
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,180
Then your master

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,210
must be amazing.

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,180
My master is a woman.

31
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:09,780
But she was incredibly intelligent,
quick-witted, and adaptable.

32
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:11,540
Ordinary fighters were no match for her.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,890
She also taught me

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,170
the lightness techniques.

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,690
If your master was that skilled,

36
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,471
she must've been famous
in the martial world.

37
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,660
You should introduce me

38
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,260
if we get the chance.

39
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,820
She rarely roamed around,

40
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,540
and she passed away a long time ago.

41
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,660
Hearing you talk about your master

42
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,010
makes me feel a little sad.

43
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:36,604
You remind me of her

44
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,850
in some ways,

45
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,170
especially your eyes.

46
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:41,760
They look just like hers.

47
00:02:41,848 --> 00:02:42,471
Me?

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,780
Stop joking.

49
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,115
It would be great
if I were as strong as your master.

50
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,220
I mean if...

51
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,980
If I weren't Rong Shukuang,

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,890
but a completely different person,

53
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,780
would you still treat me this nicely?

54
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,850
How could you be someone else?

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,130
Well,

56
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,290
what if

57
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,980
I only ended up here by accident?

58
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,890
What if I don't even belong here

59
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,130
and I'm just passing through?

60
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,100
Would you still save me,

61
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,690
teach me martial arts,

62
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,940
and protect me?

63
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,730
Then

64
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,570
have you ever considered

65
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:26,260
that I am only passing through too?

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,170
That one day,

67
00:03:28,337 --> 00:03:29,915
I won't be by your side anymore?

68
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,380
Are you leaving?

69
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,660
All things must come to an end.

70
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,660
But you're my bodyguard.

71
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,730
I forbid you from leaving.

72
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,260
I'm just a bodyguard.

73
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,410
I'm not your family,

74
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:44,293
and I don't belong
in Yuchi Manor either.

75
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:45,940
You're still my master, aren't you?

76
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,340
That makes us family.

77
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,220
Think about it.

78
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,010
Lin Qianyi is only your adoptive father.

79
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,410
Unless you marry Lin Shaoci,

80
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,100
or

81
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,060
you're just a guest of Yuchi Manor,

82
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,260
who is no different from me.

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:00,940
Master.

84
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,450
Master.

85
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,690
Master,

86
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,260
you won't leave me behind, right?

87
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:05,248
No matter where you go,

88
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,260
take me with you.

89
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:07,520
That wouldn't be appropriate.

90
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,780
Why not?

91
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:10,271
I'll listen to whatever you say.

92
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,610
I can cook, clean, and do laundry.

93
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,130
I'll do whatever you need.

94
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,220
Aren't you determined
to be Rong Shukuang

95
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,410
to protect Yuchi Manor?

96
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:18,537
How does running away with me
help you do that?

97
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,020
I'm just afraid no one will protect me

98
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,540
if you leave.

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,050
You can always find another bodyguard.

100
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,170
No!

101
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,537
I don't want another bodyguard.

102
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:31,250
I only want you.

103
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,460
Master,

104
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,580
you're not really leaving, are you?

105
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,340
You can't just abandon me.

106
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,250
Leader Shen.

107
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,490
Leader Shen,

108
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,700
we messed up.

109
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,340
Please punish us.

110
00:05:09,271 --> 00:05:10,700
Yuchi Manor has been on high alert

111
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,540
since the Zhonghe Festival.

112
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,900
The Lin father and son are too cautious.

113
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,340
It's hard to get close to them.

114
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,850
Yan Shao went to Spirit Fox Sect too,
right?

115
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,250
Yes.

116
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,020
Getting exposed was expected.

117
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,700
Whoever he is

118
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,140
and whatever he's plotting,

119
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,850
he's cunning

120
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,170
and full of tricks.

121
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,290
What an interesting opponent.

122
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,730
Wanci, what brings you here?

123
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,100
Sit.

124
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,610
Shukuang,

125
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,370
I wanted to ask

126
00:05:46,426 --> 00:05:47,804
what you'd like for your gift.

127
00:05:47,826 --> 00:05:49,093
So I can prepare it in advance.

128
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
A gift?

129
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,782
Your birthday is in two days.

130
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,900
It was either a fine bottle of wine
or a belt in previous years.

131
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,020
But after surviving
such a close call this time,

132
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,540
we should celebrate properly.

133
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,460
You're right.

134
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,730
Birthdays

135
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,580
should be celebrated well.

136
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,340
Do you have any wishes
or something you've been wanting?

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,537
Why don't you sit down?

138
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,850
(But)

139
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,900
(I wonder what Yan Shao will get me.)

140
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,930
I want a new outfit.

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,740
Something practical

142
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,380
and easy for me
to practice martial arts.

143
00:06:17,382 --> 00:06:19,250
Also, make it red.

144
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,580
You usually dislike bright colors.

145
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,980
I did survive a near-death experience.

146
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,460
I can afford to change my style a bit.

147
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,140
Yan Shao often wears red.

148
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,980
Are you trying to match him?

149
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,170
Yes.

150
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,220
He's my master, after all.

151
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,537
Wearing the same style and color

152
00:06:36,537 --> 00:06:38,300
makes us like a true master
and a disciple.

153
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:38,950
That'd be nice.

154
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:39,850
All right.

155
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,250
I'll have a red outfit made

156
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,540
as your birthday gift.

157
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,460
No, I can't do this.

158
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,850
How do I tell him that it's my birthday?

159
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,050
I can't just openly ask for gifts.

160
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:55,100
No, I can't do that.

161
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,020
I will look shallow.

162
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,660
But if I don't tell him,

163
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,980
he won't know.

164
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:04,490
Are you reciting scriptures?

165
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,730
Master,

166
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,410
I was...

167
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:09,980
Go and train.

168
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:10,850
Huh?

169
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,930
Wait, I was...

170
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,760
Master, hold on.

171
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,448
I was just thinking.

172
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,580
Since you don't know
where your hometown is,

173
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,140
that must be lonely, right?

174
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,730
So from now on,
my hometown will be your hometown too.

175
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,340
How about that?

176
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,490
Your hometown?

177
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:27,250
But I thought you didn't
remember your childhood?

178
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,340
I remember bits and pieces,

179
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,580
especially the traditions.

180
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,540
Tell me about them.

181
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,980
Well, during festivals,

182
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,370
everyone would gather

183
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,250
and hold special ceremonies.

184
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,780
Also,

185
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,580
on birthdays,

186
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,980
the person celebrating
would receive lots of gifts.

187
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,610
Then everyone

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,780
will light the candles,
make wishes, sing songs,

189
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,540
and many more.

190
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,660
Are you sure

191
00:07:57,071 --> 00:07:58,780
that's a tradition from your hometown?

192
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,810
Of course!

193
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:02,410
All right.

194
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,250
Then tell me

195
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,100
where your hometown is?

196
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,490
It doesn't matter where I was born.

197
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
Yes, it does.

198
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:10,930
Everyone has a place they come from

199
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,410
and a place to return to.

200
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,660
Rong Shukuang,

201
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,460
you must never forget
where you come from.

202
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,780
Yes, Master.

203
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
Then

204
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,730
do you know where my hometown is?

205
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,340
Misty Moon Village.

206
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,220
And what happened

207
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,810
to Misty Moon Village?

208
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,650
That...

209
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,650
I am not certain.

210
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,340
All I know

211
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,980
was something happened there
when you were a child.

212
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:43,100
After that, Master Lin took you in
and raised you at the manor.

213
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,060
I know about that.

214
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,250
Father told me about it.

215
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,730
Misty Moon Village...

216
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,610
Wait a minute.

217
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,770
I'm not here to talk about that today.

218
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,850
I came to tell you it's my...

219
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,980
Oh, you know.

220
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,300
Do you get it?

221
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,460
What does it have to do with me?

222
00:09:02,493 --> 00:09:03,700
We don't have much time left.

223
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:04,890
So focus on your training.

224
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,180
Wait.

225
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,890
Master!

226
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,940
Have I not hinted enough?

227
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,530
Are you waiting for me, Young Lady Lin?

228
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,370
Yan Shao.

229
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,340
Aren't you going to invite me in?

230
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,490
If I don't,

231
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,820
will you stay outside?

232
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:53,650
Do you need something?

233
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,100
In two days,
it'll be Shukuang's birthday.

234
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,100
I promised to make her a red outfit

235
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,370
as her birthday gift.

236
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,220
You're very thoughtful.

237
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:08,370
I figured you've been here

238
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,610
for a while now.

239
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,448
You've been a great deal of help
to us too.

240
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,130
So I wanted to make an outfit for you

241
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,060
as a token of appreciation.

242
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:15,890
Sure.

243
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,370
Then I'll gratefully accept.

244
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,940
Since it's a new outfit,

245
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,071
it has to be tailored
according to your measurements.

246
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,250
How can I trouble you

247
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,700
to take my measurements?

248
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,730
It doesn't matter.

249
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,610
You have done a lot for the manor.

250
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,350
It's only right
that I express my gratitude.

251
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,610
What's that smell?

252
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,460
It smells nice.

253
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,100
Perhaps it's the fragrance from my robe.

254
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,490
No need to take measurements.

255
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,300
You can refer to this one
for the measurement.

256
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,220
That works too.

257
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,250
Is there anything else?

258
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,890
I shall take my leave now.

259
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,760
Young Lady Lin,

260
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:05,610
there's no need for you to come
to take my measurements next time.

261
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,448
I'll have someone send them over.

262
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:23,890
(Zhiyuan Pavilion)

263
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,610
You fell asleep?

264
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,980
I told you to stay alert.

265
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,820
Young Master said
things aren't safe lately.

266
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,890
You're scaring yourself for nothing.

267
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,100
The Ghost Valley Sect
isn't that capable.

268
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,420
Come on.

269
00:11:43,465 --> 00:11:47,770
(Yuchi Manor)

270
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,010
(Whatever Rong Shukuang has,)

271
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,650
(I can have it too.)

272
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:29,448
Before Ghost Valley Sect
makes a move,

273
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,420
they always send a crimson feather.

274
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,871
Now, they have issued their challenge.

275
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,460
Their ambition isn't just
about treasure.

276
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,530
It's said that the Fuxian treasure
contains countless riches.

277
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,370
It also holds martial arts secrets
sought by all.

278
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,890
Behind this,

279
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,826
Ghost Valley Sect clearly dreams
of ruling the martial world.

280
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,060
Years ago, Shen Ao sought
to dominate the land.

281
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,770
But his wish went unfulfilled.

282
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,490
Now, his son, Shen Zuitian,

283
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,940
is carrying on his ambition.

284
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,340
The Yuchi Manor

285
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:01,204
is the top manor in the martial world.

286
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,730
It's our duty to stand

287
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,890
against the Ghost Valley Sect

288
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:05,271
and uphold righteousness.

289
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,650
But...

290
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,490
As long as the treasure is involved,

291
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,250
we will never live in peace.

292
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:16,248
Go ahead and speak.

293
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,671
No need to hold back.

294
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,890
I want to know

295
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:21,700
if you ever

296
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,060
desired the treasure.

297
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,850
The Misty Moon Village is hidden deep
within the mountains.

298
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,426
Ordinary people wouldn't even know
of its existence.

299
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:41,820
Unless someone...

300
00:13:44,982 --> 00:13:46,360
I suppose you have been carrying

301
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,250
this doubt for years, right?

302
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:48,850
Yes.

303
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,404
When you saved the daughter
of the Fang Family back then,

304
00:13:55,271 --> 00:13:57,760
was it truly out of goodwill,
or was it for the treasure?

305
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,580
One day,

306
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,010
I will answer your doubts one day.

307
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,940
To me,

308
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:14,626
you have always been an upright
and honorable man.

309
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,250
Perhaps

310
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,340
we can form an alliance with Tiangang.

311
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,940
That won't be easy.

312
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,130
We need to send someone suitable

313
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,460
to Mount Moye first.

314
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
I will take care

315
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:30,820
of this matter.

316
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,060
Yes, Father.

317
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,490
Fluffy.

318
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,250
Fluffy.

319
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:44,700
Fluffy.

320
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,180
You two go ahead.

321
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,890
Where did it go?

322
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,100
Shaoci.

323
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:53,760
What are you looking for?

324
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,420
My rabbit, Fluffy is missing.

325
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:56,982
I'll help you look for it.

326
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,580
Fluffy.

327
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,180
Fluffy.

328
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,890
Fluffy.

329
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:11,700
Here.

330
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,340
Thank you, Shaoci.

331
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,560
It's windy today, and you're
not in the best health.

332
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,804
Don't wander outside too much.

333
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,490
Were you and Father discussing

334
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,980
something important?

335
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,610
You look so serious.

336
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,770
What's wrong?

337
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,250
I want to share your burdens too.

338
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,220
Why don't you tell me?

339
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,730
Come on.

340
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,460
What's really going on?

341
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,960
The manor has received
Ghost Valley Sect's crimson feather.

342
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,340
You know

343
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,130
what that means.

344
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Surrender

345
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,100
or be wiped out.

346
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,180
Only Father and I know about this.

347
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:53,250
The two gatekeepers
who discovered the feather

348
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,271
have also been warned

349
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,980
to keep it secret.

350
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,850
What is Father's plan?

351
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:02,204
He plans to form an alliance
with Tiangang

352
00:16:02,315 --> 00:16:04,048
to stand against the Ghost Valley Sect.

353
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,940
Then who does Father plan to send

354
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,580
to contact Tiangang?

355
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,010
I'm not sure.

356
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,180
Don't worry too much.

357
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,460
Justice always prevails.

358
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,915
The righteous sects of the martial world
will come to our aid.

359
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,250
Master Lin.

360
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:30,226
Please have a seat.

361
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,010
No matter the time,

362
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,826
you always seem
to have the leisure to enjoy yourself.

363
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,370
Drinking alone can be lonely.

364
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,220
I was just waiting for you to join me.

365
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,890
Yan Shao, did you already know

366
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,060
that I would come?

367
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:53,250
The Ghost Gold Sheep constellation
appeared yesterday.

368
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,840
It means it's not a good day for guests.

369
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,420
But since the entire manor is yours,

370
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,060
that makes me the guest.

371
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,890
The manor is at a critical juncture now.

372
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,420
I figured you'd come looking for me.

373
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,380
Meeting someone clever

374
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:07,700
sure is satisfying.

375
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,180
Today,

376
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,380
I'll go straight to the point.

377
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,090
The Ghost Valley Sect
is preparing to attack.

378
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,460
So the Yuchi Manor is in danger.

379
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,220
Can we request Tiangang's help?

380
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
Are you certain that I am from Tiangang?

381
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,570
Yes.

382
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,250
I may not know your background,
your origins,

383
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,220
or your sects or schools.

384
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,940
But I am certain

385
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,620
you are from Tiangang.

386
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,660
What do you hope

387
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Tiangang will do for Yuchi Manor?

388
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,570
I would like you
to deliver a message on my behalf

389
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,490
to contact Tiangang's leader

390
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,730
and propose an alliance.

391
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,460
Will you help me?

392
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,290
I am willing to make this trip for you

393
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:06,660
and help forge the alliance.

394
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:08,180
Great.

395
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,290
Many thanks for your assistance.

396
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,900
You're too kind.

397
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:16,648
I will depart as soon as possible.

398
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,940
I am deeply grateful.

399
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,460
Not bad. It looks splendid.

400
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,570
As expected,

401
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,050
girls' love for new clothes
despite the era never changes.

402
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:36,620
Wanci,

403
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,330
I shall call you Miracle Wanci.

404
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,290
I'm glad you liked it.

405
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,980
What happened to your eyes?

406
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,940
They're so red.

407
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,460
Don't tell me

408
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,380
you stayed up all night sewing
this for me.

409
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,420
Oh, no. It's not that.

410
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,420
My rabbit, Fluffy,

411
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,490
suddenly got sick and died.

412
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,940
I was heartbroken

413
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,330
and cried all night.

414
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:02,620
That's why my eyes are swollen.

415
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,448
Life and death are unpredictable.

416
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:05,770
Don't be too sad.

417
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,900
I also made one for Yan Shao.

418
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,330
But it's not even his birthday.

419
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,826
Why are you giving him a gift?

420
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,010
Wanci,

421
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,530
don't tell me you have feelings
for Yan Shao...

422
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,010
Well,

423
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,330
you don't have to worry about this.

424
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,980
He has shown kindness to me
and to the Yuchi Manor.

425
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,980
I have nothing to repay him with.

426
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,010
I only hope he will wear
the outfit I made for him.

427
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,980
He told you he cares for you?

428
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,860
Did he say it himself?

429
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,250
When?

430
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,290
He didn't have to.

431
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,180
I know it in my heart.

432
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,620
We understand each other.

433
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,004
So words are unnecessary.

434
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,810
Happy birthday, Shukuang.

435
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,050
I'll take my leave first.

436
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,730
Why did Sister Rong suddenly ruin

437
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,620
these flowers for no reason?

438
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,220
What strange hidden weapon is this?

439
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,460
Oh, this?

440
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,290
It's a flying kite
I made a long time ago.

441
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:18,790
(Two hearts longing drenched in snow.
Consider it to have grown old together.)

442
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,180
I once heard

443
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,620
that Misty Moon Village
is most beautiful at dusk

444
00:20:22,715 --> 00:20:23,700
when the snow falls.

445
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,330
All right, that's enough.

446
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,050
Don't spoil it.

447
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:34,730
Look.

448
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,810
What does it remind you of?

449
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,900
Snow!

450
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,460
You're so clever.

451
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,420
Later,

452
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,490
we'll place snow chrysanthemums
inside the kite.

453
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,248
When it soars through the sky,

454
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:48,000
the petals will scatter
like falling snow.

455
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,420
Just imagine that scene.

456
00:21:01,548 --> 00:21:05,950
(Kuang: At sunset, please meet me
at the Waterside Pavilion.)

457
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:08,604
A person's handwriting reflects
their character.

458
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,900
Isn't it a little crooked?

459
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,010
No, it's not.

460
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,140
No need to fix it anymore.

461
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,050
It's already perfect.

462
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,420
Hurry and get ready.
He will be here soon.

463
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,620
Are you ready?

464
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,900
(Billow Viewing)

465
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,290
(Rong Shukuang, I'm sorry.)

466
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,010
(I can't follow your wishes anymore.)

467
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,826
(The person I want to watch
the snowfall with)

468
00:21:56,826 --> 00:21:58,026
(is not the one you chose.)

469
00:21:58,048 --> 00:21:59,271
(Please forgive me.)

470
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,460
Three.

471
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,490
Two.

472
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,180
One.

473
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,330
Two hearts longing drenched in snow.

474
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,290
Consider it to have grown old together.

475
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,810
In a turbulent world,

476
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:49,848
as long as I have you, it's enough.

477
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,290
Shukuang...

478
00:23:02,493 --> 00:23:04,648
I shouldn't have treated you
that way before.

479
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,380
Your feelings, your sincerity...

480
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:08,115
I was the one who failed you.

481
00:23:08,693 --> 00:23:10,100
I shouldn't have hurt you like that.

482
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,730
Shaoci, it's not like that.

483
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,380
I... I...

484
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:16,620
This is Yuchi Manor's
heirloom soft armor.

485
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,250
It's impenetrable.

486
00:23:18,404 --> 00:23:19,620
It can protect you from harm

487
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,804
and also put my heart at ease.

488
00:23:20,848 --> 00:23:21,515
A gift for you.

489
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,250
Yan Shao!

490
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,026
Yan Shao, let me explain.

491
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:35,380
Why not call
me "Master" anymore?

492
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,448
Now isn't the right time
to call you that.

493
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,250
None of what you saw just now was real.

494
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,140
I can explain.

495
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:40,900
Go on.

496
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,530
I know

497
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:44,729
this kind of plot
is a common scenario nowadays.

498
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,580
One doesn't ask,
and the other doesn't explain.

499
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:48,380
And a misunderstanding
turns into a regret.

500
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,940
But today,
I have to make sure you understand.

501
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,570
Did you receive the letter
I left for you?

502
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,010
So

503
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:01,770
the person I wanted to meet was you.

504
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,700
No one else.

505
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,980
That snowfall just now

506
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,220
was prepared for you.

507
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,810
Because right here, you once told me

508
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,490
that my hometown,

509
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,380
that village

510
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,940
is the most beautiful when it snows.

511
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,330
You also said you have no hometown.

512
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:24,010
So I wanted to give you
a snowfall of your own.

513
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,220
I wanted to tell you

514
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,090
that from now on, you're no longer
someone with no home

515
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,660
and no place to return to.

516
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,050
My hometown

517
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,490
is your home.

518
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,770
And I am

519
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,860
who you return to.

520
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,620
Did I explain it clearly?

521
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,330
Do you believe me?

522
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,180
I do.

523
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,290
Yes, that's great!

524
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,180
I was scared to death just now.

525
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:05,226
But as long as you believe me,

526
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,420
that's all that matters.

527
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,660
Anyway,

528
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,220
I've expressed

529
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,770
my feelings and sincerity

530
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,660
clearly and openly.

531
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,330
If you have any doubts,

532
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:16,900
just tell me.

533
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,860
I can explain it again.

534
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,180
Excuse me?

535
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,010
Can you at least say something?

536
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,330
If you keep quiet like this,

537
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,620
it'll make me anxious.

538
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,490
I have to leave.

539
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,620
Where are you going?

540
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,330
I can't tell you.

541
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,730
Why not?

542
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,093
The Ghost Valley Sect
is about to attack Yuchi Manor.

543
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,770
When?

544
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:47,050
It could be tomorrow

545
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,137
or the day after tomorrow.

546
00:25:48,204 --> 00:25:48,730
I don't know.

547
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,940
So,

548
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,460
is this the part where everyone flees
for their own survival?

549
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,220
That's just human nature.

550
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,330
No.

551
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:01,620
You wouldn't do that.

552
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,620
You didn't flee back in the desert.

553
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,180
You didn't flee
during the Flower Fair.

554
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,360
You didn't flee
when Spirit Fox Sect was in danger.

555
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:08,530
Now you want me to believe

556
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,180
that you're abandoning everything

557
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,620
just to save yourself?

558
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,620
Say something.

559
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,770
Explain it to me!

560
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,140
I have nothing to say.

561
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,770
What do you mean by that?

562
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,220
I just told you

563
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,660
how I really felt.

564
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:34,900
What about you?

565
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,250
Since the day we met,

566
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,490
you were never honest with me

567
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,848
and always behaved mysteriously.

568
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,700
When will you ever be truthful with me?

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,330
And then?

572
00:26:53,848 --> 00:26:55,090
Someone will come to save you.

573
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,150
Where are you going then?

574
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,330
Where can I find you?

576

we'll meet again.
