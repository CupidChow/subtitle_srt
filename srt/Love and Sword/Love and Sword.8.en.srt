I don't doubt you.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,480
I never have.

21
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,670
Thank you, Young Lady Rong.

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Can you give me

23
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:01,515
the flower ball?

24
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,160
What is he...

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,880
No!

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,710
That's beautiful.

28
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,760
Who's there?

29
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:16,880
Someone is causing trouble
at the flower fair.

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,782
Go and check it out.

31
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:20,360
(Blossom's Smile)

32
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:49,200
It's the Tang Clan's hidden weapon.

33
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,920
What did you add to the wine jar?

34
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,360
When did you find out

35
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:03,670
that I'm from the Ghost Valley Sect?

36
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:11,550
Jade Leaf Golden Blossom Wine?

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,440
You

38
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,760
drank the poisoned wine you brew...

39
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,240
It is fine

40
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,640
for me to repay with my life

41
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,200
to those who perished

42
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,680
at your hands.

43
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,350
That jar doesn't contain wine.

44
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,880
It's poison.

45
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,590
The Celestial Maiden's Blossom.

46
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,950
Thank you for granting my request.

47
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,240
So this was all part of your plan.

48
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,320
On Zhonghe Festival,

49
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,160
it's a sign of good fortune
when the sky lanterns light up the land.

50
00:05:19,204 --> 00:05:21,350
Consider this my gift to Yuchi Manor.

51
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,760
Who are you?

52
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,120
A friend, not foe.

53
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,440
That's all you need to know.

54
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,800
How is someone like you

55
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,950
willing to serve as a mere guard?

56
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,680
Everyone has their own path.

57
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,830
Tonight, Yuchi Manor was careless.

58
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,120
With Young Lady Rong here,

59
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,150
not necessarily.

60
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,640
She sees everything,
quick-witted and sharp.

61
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,680
Even without her martial skills,

62
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,910
her skills in strategies
are truly impressive.

63
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,080
Since we're all safe now,

64
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,390
shall we take this wine downstairs

65
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,950
and drink it while we chat?

66
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,950
Sounds great.

67
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:51,640
Yuchi Manor isn't being very honest.

68
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,680
This festival is a trap!

69
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,315
It's an ambush by Ghost Valley Sect!

70
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,320
Everyone, be careful!

71
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,150
Brother!

72
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,150
The wine!

73
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,880
They are targeting the wine.

74
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:31,000
It's not wine inside.

75
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:31,893
It's likely poisoned.

76
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:33,120
I'll take it away from here.

77
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,440
Tell everyone to evacuate.

78
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,120
All right.

79
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,150
The wind direction!
Go against the wind direction!

80
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:46,604
Evacuate the people immediately!

81
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,226
All right.

82
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,359
(East Market)

83
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,337
- Go!
- Get out of here!

84
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:58,248
Hurry! Get out of here!

85
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,590
Stay safe!

86
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,200

Rong Shukuang.

90
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,630
If I die from poisoned,

91
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
will you cry for me?

92
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,520
Stop spouting nonsense.

93
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,750
You won't die.

94
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,440
I won't allow you to die!

95
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,200
Sister Rong.

96
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,350
The wine jar contains

97
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,200
Celestial Maiden's Blossom!

98
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,590
All right.

99
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,400
Celestial Maiden's Blossom
can be neutralized with water.

100
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:21,470
Evacuate the people.

101
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,560
Move upwind.

102
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,400
Yan Shao,

103
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,440
you have to come back alive!

104
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,080
Help!

105
00:09:57,648 --> 00:09:58,630
Are you all right?

106
00:11:42,543 --> 00:11:44,610
(Red Banner Flower Fair)

107
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:46,710
Is everyone all right?

108
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,470
Someone.

109
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,750
Master Lin,

110
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,230
how do you explain
what happened tonight?

111
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,110
Rest assured, I'll handle the aftermath

112
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,200
and get to the bottom of this.

113
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,080
Father,

114
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,590
the city is still in chaos.

115
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,200
I ask that you and the elders

116
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,710
help protect and evacuate the people.

117
00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:09,909
I'll take a team to track down

118
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:11,737
the remaining
Ghost Valley Sect infiltrators.

119
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,950
Since that's your plan,

120
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,990
the Junshan Sect will lend you a hand.

121
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,710
Thank you, everyone.

122
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,630
Chief Jiang,

123
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,830
your son was seen
with the Ghost Valley Sect.

124
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,590
If he really has sided with them,

125
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,920
the Seven-Star Hall won't stand by
and do nothing.

126
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,280
Shaoci,

127
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,040
I leave this place to you.

128
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,115
Yes, Father.

129
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,520
Let's go.

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,870

131
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:40,830
Yes, Young Master.

132
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,360
Count the injured
and help the people settle down.

133
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,315

I'm the heartless swordsman,
Rong Shukuang.

Don't say I never give you a chance.

148

Once I draw my Cloud-Slicing Sword,

149

there's no turning back!

150
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,040
Listen up!

151
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,950
I'm really skilled.

152
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,893
I've cut down countless foes
without mercy!

153
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,950
My sword knows no mercy!

154
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,920
Sister Rong!

155
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,440
Sister Rong is over there!

156
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,710
Are you all right?

157
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,800
I'm fine.

158
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,160
Now go! Get moving!

159
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:03,626
Where's the jar
of Celestial Maiden's Blossom?

160
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:04,782
I threw it into the river.

161
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,320
Then why are you here?

162
00:15:06,582 --> 00:15:07,830
When we were at the pavilion,

163
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,382
the arrow came from this direction.

164
00:15:09,404 --> 00:15:10,915
That's when I suspected Shen Zuitian.

165
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,680
Unfortunately, he got away.

166
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:14,404
What about the flower fair?

167
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,750
The people are safe.

168
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,071
But my father saw Qianjin Xiao,

169
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,920
the owner of Blossom's Smile,

170
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,350
trying to set fire to the scene.

171
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:22,870
Unfortunately, he got away too.

172
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,040
Qianjin Xiao...

173
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,950
He's with Ghost Valley Sect.

174
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:38,520
And Madam Lihua

175
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:40,982
is definitely no ordinary woman.

176
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:44,560
I think Qianjin Xiao
must have felt regret

177
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,440
before he died.

178
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,582
But he never got the chance
to make amends.

179
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,870
Even if you could forgive them,

180
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:58,350
they would never be able
to face each other again.

181
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,520
In love and in duty,

182
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,830
their only path was death.

183
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,080
Was it you?

184
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,560
Why?

185
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,200
What do you think?

186
00:16:22,471 --> 00:16:24,160
The Six Great Sects won't let you go.

187
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,160
Your uncle has already ordered
your capture.

188
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,280
You can't escape now.

189
00:16:27,537 --> 00:16:28,715
What are you going to do?

190
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,520
I'm taking you back to Yuchi Manor.

191
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,830
It's been ten years.

192
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,990
I think about you all the time.

193
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:42,320
Do it.

194
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,230
I swore to help Ghost Valley Sect

195
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,590
wipe out the Six Great Sects.

196
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,337
Do what you think is righteous now.

197
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,040
Just go.

198
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,800
It's my fault.

199
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,582
Last night,
I couldn't catch my breath well.

200
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:19,404
So I stepped out of the carriage
for some air.

201
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:21,382
I didn't expect the streets
to be in chaos.

202
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,720
Sorry for making you all worry.

203
00:17:22,893 --> 00:17:25,071
As long as you're back,
that's all that matters.

204
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,480
How should we appease
the five sects now?

205
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,080
They might suspect
we had ulterior motives.

206
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,870
Father, people from the five sects
are in the Boardroom,

207
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,004
waiting to see you.

208
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,604
Don't worry about anything.

209
00:17:38,715 --> 00:17:39,760
Just focus on recuperating.

210
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:40,982
I'll take care of them.

211
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,080
Master Lin,

212
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,430
why did you suddenly disappear
last night?

213
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,000
Wanci went missing.

214
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,830
In a moment of panic,

215
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,204
I fell into their trap
and was lured away.

216
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,320
How convenient for you
to leave at the time of disaster.

217
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,670
What is Yuchi Manor really up to?

218
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,250
Are you trying to eliminate us
and keep the treasure for yourselves?

219
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:08,660
That so-called treasure was nothing

220
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,760
but a false lead planted
by Ghost Valley Sect

221
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,110
to turn the Six Great Sects
against each other.

222
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,430
Do you have proof?

223
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,480
I trust Master Lin.

224
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,320
I swear

225
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,110
to everyone here

226
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,560
that I will investigate
this matter thoroughly

227
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:26,248
and ensure there are no further threats.

228
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,190
Please explain what happened

229
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,915
on the night of the Zhonghe Festival.

230
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,915
It can represent the pavilion
at the flower fair.

231
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,480
Here is the viewing platform.

232
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,010
Over there is Blossom's Smile.

233
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:52,160
The distillery
on the city outskirts.

234
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:52,871
Ghost Valley Sect

235
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:54,715
had captured
the distillery owner and workers,

236
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,204
(using it as their hideout.)

237
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,280
(They filled wine jars with kerosene)

238
00:18:59,537 --> 00:19:01,337
(and mixed them
into the delivery carts.)

239
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,520
(That distillery
was their gathering point.)

240
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:06,520
Before the oil could be ignited,

241
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:08,648
sky lanterns were released all
around the city.

242
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,240
Was it your people who secretly switched
the jars and avoided the crisis?

243
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:13,630
That's right.

244
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,390
You knew about the kerosene.

245
00:19:16,537 --> 00:19:19,240
But you didn't know the wine contained
Celestial Maiden's Blossom.

246
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:21,760
The real question is,

247
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,390
when was Baihua Brew swapped?

248
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,000
Someone saw

249
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,190
Young Lady Lin nearly crash
her carriage into someone

250
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:30,960
on the way to the flower fair.

251
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,382
She stopped for a moment on the street.

252
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,560
I believe

253
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,048
that was when the switch happened.

254
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,590
Are you hurt?

255
00:19:45,426 --> 00:19:46,000
It hurts!

256
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,480
It hurts so bad!

257
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:49,320
Which part of your body is painful?

258
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,390
You bumped into me so hard.

259
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:51,648
You have to compensate me!

260
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:53,337
How about we go see a physician first?

261
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,093
What do you say?

262
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,960
It hurts!

263
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,280
Ghost Valley Sect won't stop here.

264
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,720
This plan has failed,

265
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,150
so they'll try something else.

266
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,240
And after what happened,

267
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,910
doesn't that make you suspect

268
00:20:09,048 --> 00:20:10,515
that Ghost Valley Sect members

269
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,110
are hiding inside Yuchi Manor?

270
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,830
That was what happened that night.

271
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,320
If not for Yan Shao
and his friends in the city,

272
00:20:29,026 --> 00:20:30,071
the Six Great Sects

273
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,280
and countless civilians
would have suffered great casualties.

274
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,320
Thank you for your help, Yan Shao.

275
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,115
Master Lin, it was nothing.

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,960
A man of your talents

277
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
shouldn't be stuck as a mere guard.

278
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,870
It's a waste.

279
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,560
I've been too discourteous.

280
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,480
Don't worry about it, Master Lin.

281
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,520
Father.

282
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,190
Ever since
Shukuang returned to the manor,

283
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,000
Ghost Valley Sect's spies
have been watching us closely.

284
00:21:14,226 --> 00:21:15,737
What do you mean by that, Wanci?

285
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,830
I'm worried

286
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,150
that Ghost Valley Sect won't let you go.

287
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,720
But fortunately,
you have a guard like Yan Shao,

288
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,000
who is skilled in martial arts.

289
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,110
If you were in danger,

290
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,910
I would help as well.

291
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,000
Wanci is weak and constantly anxious.

292
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,537
You should go back and rest.

293
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,240
I'll take her to her room.

294
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,520
Father, what should we do next?

295
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,480
Such a shame.

296
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,337
- Young Lady Lin...
- What is?

297
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,830
I put so much effort

298
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,280
into brewing the Baihua Brew.

299
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,040
A good drink reflects

300
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,240
the heart of its maker.

301
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,870
Losing it

302
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:07,720
is indeed a shame.

303
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,430
But with your skills,

304
00:22:09,515 --> 00:22:11,550
I'm sure it's not the only fine wine
you can create.

305
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,560
If given the chance,

306
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,430
I'd love to try another.

307
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,150
You flatter me, Yan Shao.

308
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:17,590
It's just a minor craft.

309
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:19,426
There's nothing worth bragging about.

310
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,800
You're intelligent
and full of surprises.

311
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,040
Every skill you possess
is worth anticipating.

312
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:29,830
Oh, great, now we're showing off
with fancy words?

313
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,982
Why don't you two just play
a game of idioms?

314
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,720
I'm leaving.

315
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,910
Shukuang never used to be so impatient.

316
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,080
She was always the calmest among us.

317
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:45,604
Sometimes even more composed
than Shaoci.

318
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,630
I heard Shaoci interrogate
a Ghost Valley Sect member last night

319
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,560
and got nothing.

320
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,870
He said he was just a child.

321
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,430
I need to see who this person is.

322
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,720
By the way,

323
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,630
my father is best at using

324
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,800
the Mountain Shifting Palm.

325
00:22:58,137 --> 00:22:59,893
His internal energy flows endlessly,

326
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,893
often injuring opponents
from the inside.

327
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,715
Master Lin's palm technique
is indeed powerful.

328
00:23:05,937 --> 00:23:07,469
We didn't get to spar properly today.

329
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,537
But I look forward to learning more
from him later.

330
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,590
You truly are different from the rest.

331
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,390
I'll take my leave now.

332
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,350
Hold balance.

333
00:23:26,026 --> 00:23:27,537
No, no. That's not right.

334
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,040
Azure Dragon Claw.

335
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,110
What kind of idiom dictionary is this?

336
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,000
At least give me an explanation!

337
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,910
Yan Shao.

338
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,800
Yan Shao.

339
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:51,626
What's the matter?

340
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,271
Come with me.

341
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,040
No, I'm meditating.

342
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,630
Oh, come on. I have a surprise.

343
00:23:58,626 --> 00:23:59,320
Just come with me.

344
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,071
What are you up to?

345
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:00,960
Hurry.

346
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,110
Walk faster.

347
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,760
We're almost there.

348
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,630
As per tradition,

349
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,204
I offer this gift to my master.

350
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,590
I, Rong Shukuang,

351
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,590
sincerely bow

352
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,910
and request Yan Shao to take me
as his disciple.

353
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,160
Why the sudden decision
to become my disciple?

354
00:24:24,582 --> 00:24:26,960
After what happened that night,
I finally understood.

355
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,480
Without martial arts,

356
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,590
there's no way to survive in this world.

357
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,080
Besides,

358
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,800
my sword technique manual
is full of complicated idioms

359
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,320
that I don't understand one bit.

360
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,870
Fair point.

361
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,080
You may rise.

362
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:39,720
All right.

363
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:50,960
You can't just stop eating and drinking.

364
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,630
You still need food to survive.

365
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,910
You're still just a child.

366
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,390
I once had a rabbit.

367
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,670
It had long ears and was very obedient.

368
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,480
Its fur was soft

369
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,040
and felt smooth to the touch.

370
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,520
But one day,

371
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,910
it suddenly threw a tantrum.

372
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,240
It refused to eat or drink

373
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,320
and was so stubborn.

374
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,830
So someone took a needle

375
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,560
and thread and stitched up its orifices.

376
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,720
It suffocated to death.

377
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,800
The saddest part is

378
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,150
that right before it died, it went mad.

379
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,800
It kept scratching at its belly
over and over

380
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,800
until it tore

381
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,350
a hole right through its own skin alive.

382
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,320
Tell me.

383
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,280
Wasn't that rabbit pitiful?

384
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,480
Who did it?

385
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,760
Come on, Master. Hurry up.

386
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
I'm already up.

387
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:21,515
But why are you slacking off, Master?

388
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,800
How are you up even earlier
than the roosters?

389
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,040
Master, you need to address me
as your disciple now.

390
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:29,110
The morning is the best time
for practice!

391
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,110
I'm all set, Master.

392
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,720
Let's begin.

393
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,320
All right.

394
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,760
Come on.

395
00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:40,448
What are we practicing?

396
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,150
The first move is the Starlit Descent.

397
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:45,715
Let's get started.

398
00:26:54,537 --> 00:26:55,630
Your stance is wrong.

399
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,240
Ouch, Master.

400
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,800
Again.

401
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:06,893
Lower your stance.

402
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:08,026
Straighten your arms.

403
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:09,000
Keep them firm.

404
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,226
Relax your shoulders.

405
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,000
Keep them level.

406
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:13,537
Okay, now do it again.

407
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:17,520
What's this?

408
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,590
A real punch!

409
00:27:26,293 --> 00:27:28,493
Now, understand
why protecting your head is important?

410
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,150
(Oh, Rong Shukuang.)

411
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,560
(You're so unlucky)

412
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:42,320
(to have ended up with such
a useless successor like me.)

413
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,390
Master,

414
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,450
every time I try
to gather energy and exert force,

415
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,240
I feel this strange pressure swirling
around my chest and stomach.

416
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,910
It leaves me feeling weak all over.

417
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,720
That's probably because of the injuries
you sustained from Shen Zuitian.

418
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,315
Don't use your internal energy for now.
Just focus on perfecting

419
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:01,280
the Starlit Descent.

420
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:02,150
Watch carefully.

421
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,760
(Did people in ancient times
use perfume too?)

422
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:35,937
(Every time I catch a whiff
of Yan Zhao's scent,)

423
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,830
(my heart starts racing.)

424
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,760
Relax

425
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,560
and focus.

426
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:42,626
Gather your strength in your hands.

427
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,390
(Rong Shukuang,)

428
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,430
(could it be that you have)

429
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,190
(improper thoughts about Yan Shao?)

430
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,999
(No, that's not right.)

431
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,670
(Since I have sought him
to be my master,)

432
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:26,582
(I must respect him)

433
00:29:26,648 --> 00:29:27,760
(and not overstep my bounds.)

434
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,590
Calm your mind.

435
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,760
Don't let it wander.

436
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,560

00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,800
I am pregnant?

474
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:29,830
It's just exhaustion.

475

Go and get some rest.
