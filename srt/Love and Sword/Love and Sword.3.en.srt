Sleeping Beside Yan Shao)

=Episode 3=

19
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,248
Young Master Lin, this way, please.

20
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,893
- Young Master Lin.
- Yes, it's him.

21
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:49,226
Young Master Lin.

22
00:01:49,448 --> 00:01:50,730
Let's go and take a look.

23
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,090
Okay.

24
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,810
Shaoci.

25
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,610
Young Master Lin.

26
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,140
Right, Brother Shaoci,

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,730
look!

28
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,610
Sister Rong is fine

29
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,660
and well.

30
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,940
You can rest assured.

31
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:08,730
Young Master Lin,
you're a natural born with affection.

32
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,610
I'm really impressed.

33
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,693
You take Thirteen Lady of Tang family
with you you're on business.

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,100
Even Yu Linglong, Twin Autumn Swords,

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,530
is willing to work for you.

36
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,490
You are really something.

37
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:22,404
What's it got to do with you?

38
00:02:22,448 --> 00:02:24,300
If it wasn't for the rules
of Ruthless Parlor,

39
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,980
I'd get rid of you right now.

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,300
My pleasure.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,820
You...

42
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,170
What's going on? Let's take a look.

43
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,020
Leader Shen,

44
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:36,537
it's an honor to meet you at last.

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,650
Young Master Lin,

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,730
nice to meet you.

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,300
Who do you think would win in a fight

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,100
between these two?

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,610
Young Master isn't as good as you,

50
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,020
but you're a good match
for Shen Zuitian.

51
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,610
Of course

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,100
that's before you got hurt.

53
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,770
I used to be so good?

54
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,210
Do I rank in some kind
of martial ranking or something?

55
00:02:56,582 --> 00:02:58,248
You were ranked fifth.

56
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,930
Gosh.

57
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,050
I'm a loser now.

58
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,700
As the leader of the Ghost Valley Sect,

59
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,700
you set up a trap to take away a woman

60
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,330
while my dad and I were out on business.

61
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,700
What kind of morality is that?

62
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,871
The Ghost Valley Sect
has always done whatever we want,

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,330
and we don't care about morality.

64
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,610
Fuxian treasure has been taken over
by Yuchi Manor.

65
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,580
Did you ask the heroes of the world

66
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,540
if they would agree?

67
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,490
Of course not.

68
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,860
False rumors

69
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,380
are not to be trusted.

70
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,770
There's no smoke

71
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,420
- without fire.
- Yes.

72
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,540
Yes, hand over the key!

73
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,980
What keys? There's no such thing.

74
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,100
Okay.

75
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,700
I'll get the answer

76
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,820
when I've invaded Yuchi Manor.

77
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,820
Come on. Come here.

78
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,980
Come on. Let's go.

79
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,610
Go.

80
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,930
Come on, Hero.

81
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,650
Rong Shukuang.

82
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,610
Mis... Mister.

83
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,930
Don't be angry.

84
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,650
I'm sorry to disturb you.

85
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,730
Let's go.

86
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,450
They've left?

87
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,650
What did you just throw?

88
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,450
It doesn't matter.

89
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:16,982
What are you trying to say
by pulling me away

90
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,090
from Lin Shaoci?

91
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,740
I... I want you

92
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,820
to go back to Yuchi Manor with me.

93
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,500
Young Master Lin is here.

94
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,260
Why do I have to go with you?

95
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,700
I need you.

96
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,180
Why?

97
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,140
I'm confused.

98
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,290
I don't remember anything.

99
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,740
That's the top manor
in the martial world.

100
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,820
If I go back there like this,

101
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,448
without knowing anything
and without martial arts skills,

102
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:45,820
it's not going to work.

103
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,410
You think it's dangerous?

104
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,180
Why?

105
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,650
A woman's intuition

106
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,850
is very accurate.

107
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,620
I've been rejected for marriage

108
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,450
by Young Master Lin.

109
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:59,804
I don't know who I can trust
and who I can't trust

110
00:04:59,826 --> 00:05:00,515
in the manor.

111
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,410
Besides, Ghost Valley Sect

112
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,060
will attack the manor soon.

113
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,890
It's going to be very dangerous.

114
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,180
You've thought of everything.

115
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,740
So

116
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,140
I need someone I can trust

117
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,850
to follow me,

118
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,180
to protect me, and to help me.

119
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,140
Why do you think I'm trustworthy?

120
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,740
There's still

121
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,260
something about you
that I can't figure out,

122
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:28,740
but

123
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,650
my instincts tell me

124
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,180
you won't hurt me.

125
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,770
Your martial arts skills look good too.

126
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,210
You'll be a good bodyguard for sure.

127
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,530
One thousand gold.

128
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,620
Okay.

129
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,330
Every month.

130
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,410
Every...

131
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,500
You think I'm going back
to my inheritance?

132
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,620
Why don't you just marry me

133
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,820
and live with me?

134
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,380
It would be easier for me
to marry the second young lady

135
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,380
of the manor, Lin Wanci.

136
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,020
You still have this idea?

137
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,180
As a martial arts hero,

138
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,890
shouldn't you be an upright gentleman?

139
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,650
All humans have lust.

140
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,140
How am I not upright?

141
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,410
Fine.

142
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,450
I'm on my own.

143
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,140
I'm on...

144
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,210
Well... I will...

145
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,530
be going...

146
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,020
Five hundred.

147
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,180
Deal.

148
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,330
Let's go.

149
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:39,970
Young Master Lin,

150
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,380
Yuchi Manor has a big appetite, huh?

151
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:46,500
For the legendary Fuxian treasure,

152
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,826
you want to take it all for yourselves?

153
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,740
Yes.

154
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,700
Back then, Yuchi Manor

155
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:56,700
persuaded everyone in the martial world

156
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,180
to stop searching for the treasure,

157
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:02,330
saying that the Fang Clan
had no descendants left.

158
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,850
Unexpectedly,

159
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,650
it was to get the key
to the treasure for yourselves.

160
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,970
That's a brilliant plan of Master Lin.

161
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,020
What treasure? What key?

162
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,404
It's a groundless accusation.

163
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,580
There's no such thing.

164
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,500
Guys,

165
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,410
do you believe that?

166
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,820
Of course not.

167
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,260
Of course we don't believe it.

168
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,330
Guys,

169
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,060
Yuchi Manor has always
been open and honest.

170
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,337
We don't hide any treasure.

171
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,290
Don't believe the rumors.

172
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,850
Young Master Lin,

173
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,315
whether or not the people
in Ruthless Parlor believe you

174
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
is not important.

175
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,820
The top manor in the world

176
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,210
has long been a target for everyone.

177
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,180
It's important to make everyone
in the martial world believe in you.

178
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,500
Or...

179
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,450
Or what?

180
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,770
There'll be no peace

181
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,060
at Yuchi Manor.

182
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,140
Young Master Lin.

183
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,715
How dare you try anything
in Ruthless Parlor?

184
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:04,182
Yeah.

185
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,740
Young Master Lin,

186
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,410
don't forget

187
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,290
that this is Ruthless Parlor.

188
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,180
We can only fight over wine,
not physically.

189
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,770
Young Master Lin,

190
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,848
Shukuang has been waiting
for you upstairs for a long time.

191
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,650
Who is this?

192
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,050
Where is Shukuang?

193
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,071
I haven't seen you for a few days.

194
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,410
You've lost a lot of weight.

195
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,890
(Have I lost that much weight?)

196
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,810
(This person knows me very well.)

197
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,220
Yuchi Manor will always

198
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,890
remember the kindness of your help.

199
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:01,515
Don't mention it, Young Master Lin.

200
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,220
Yan Shao,

201
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,469
Shukuang and I haven't seen
each other for a long time,

202
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,782
and I'd like to talk to her alone.

203
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,570
Young Master Lin...

204
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,340
What?

205
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,100
How can we be so distant?

206
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,690
You don't even call me Shaoci?

207
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,260
Shaoci,

208
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,570
Yan Shao is my bodyguard.

209
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,530
But you've always been a loner.

210
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,460
Wasn't I

211
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,170
injured by Shen Zuitian's

212
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,050
Mystic Ice Jade Palm?

213
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,737
I've lost all my martial arts skills.

214
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,690
Naturally, I don't feel safe.

215
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,271
When we get back to Yuchi Manor,

216
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,650
I'll get you the best doctors

217
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,382
to heal you and help you recover
your strength as soon as possible.

218
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:38,410
Yan Shao has already treated me.

219
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,530
Shaoci,

220
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,650
I've decided

221
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,810
to ask Yan Shao to be my bodyguard.

222
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,570
He... He will protect me.

223
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,690
If that's the case,

224
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,570
Yan Shao, please return

225
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,460
to Yuchi Manor with us.

226
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,460
Shen Zuitian is right downstairs

227
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,380
and won't move an inch.

228
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,140
What's your plan, Young Master Lin?

229
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,220
The disciples of Yuchi Manor

230
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,570
are on their way.

231
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,290
Shen Zuitian can't do anything alone.

232
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,290
There are so many of us,

233
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,810
why don't we just rush out?

234
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:09,100
There are people from
Ghost Valley Sect all over outside.

235
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,570
We need to come up with a good plan.

236
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,570
The people who you asked me to watch

237
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,570
are preparing to leave Ruthless Parlor.

238
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,604
They say those
in Ruthless Parlor are ruthless.

239
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,140
People may be ruthless,

240
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,810
but gold

241
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,170
never lies.

242
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,170
Gold is always the most sensible.

243
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,460
Am I right, Boss Jin?

244
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,690
That's so generous of you.

245
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,100
It's the same if someone pays
for information

246
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,410
about you.

247
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,260
It's all business.

248
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,750
(Ruthless Parlor)

249
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,100
Just sleep.

250
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,380
I won't hurt you.

251
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,410
People are bad, but dogs are good.

252
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,170
Just sleep.

253
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:13,671
It's all about money in Ruthless Parlor.
It's so good.

254
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,980
Take her away first.

255
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,810
Rong Shukuang

256
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,260
won't hide behind Lin Shaoci.

257
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,740
Rong Shukuang,

258
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,740
come out!

259
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,570
Coming.

260
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,890
I'm coming.

261
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,740
Sister Rong.

262
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,340
Lie!

263
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,290
Shen Zuitian,

264
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,050
let us go now

265
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,650
or

266
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,680
I'll kill Lie.

267
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,860
Let go of Lie.

268
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,460
Yingluo,

269
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,770
come here.

270
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,500
One more step forward

271
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,604
and I'll kill it right now
and make soup out of it.

272
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,650
Let's go.

273
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,170
Leader Shen!

274
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:02,570
Leader Shen,

275
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,170
our barriers in the desert

276
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,220
have been attacked.

277
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,050
Who were they?

278
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,500
A man and a woman.

279
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,170
They brought a few experts with them,

280
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,650
but we couldn't beat them.

281
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,170
Looks like they're from Tiangang.

282
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,500
Let's take care of Tiangang's men first

283
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,890
and then come back to deal with them.

284
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,410
Yes.

285
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,140
How is it?

286
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,170
My trick of getting away with Lie

287
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,226
was a good one, wasn't it?

288
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,380
When did you learn so many tricks?

289
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,140
We were at the end of our tether.

290
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,260
I had to be smart about it.

291
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,530
Rong Shukuang,

292
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,890
you've learned a lot

293
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,220
of cunning tricks lately, huh?

294
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,620
Sister Rong, you're amazing.

295
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,740
You're much smarter than before.

296
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,380
My hostage...

297
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,860
My dog hostage.

298
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,220
A dog is no threat to Shen Zuitian.

299
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,410
Let it go.

300
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,770
Ghost Valley Sect has a lot of men.

301
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,315
Sooner or later, they'll catch up.

302
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,582
They won't catch up again.

303
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,020
Why?

304
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,690
Sit down.

305
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:17,337
I've marked the locations
of Ghost Valley Sect's barriers

306
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:18,140
along the way.

307
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,050
Gather some men

308
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,380
to get rid of them.

309
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,100
Didn't you save the person

310
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:24,560
and bring her to Ruthless Parlor?

311
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,860
We've already finished the task.

312
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,170
Not yet.

313
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,100
It's not a good idea
to stay here for long.

314
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,690
Let's go.

315
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,570
A little further on,

316
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,860
our men will be there to meet us.

317
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,500
By the way,

318
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,570
why did Yu leave
without saying anything?

319
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,170
She's really weird.

320
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:56,071
She always comes and
goes as she pleases.

321
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:58,050
And she didn't want me
to say thanks to her,

322
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,340
so she left first.

323
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,170
Brother Shaoci,
you really know her well.

324
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,650
I really envy Yu.

325
00:16:21,968 --> 00:16:23,940
(Favorable Weather)

326
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,770
Yuchi Manor?

327
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,260
Have you memorized the characteristics

328
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,650
of the four hall masters
that I taught you yesterday?

329
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,140
Why is she still following us?

330
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,515
Tang Clan's experts specialize
in eliminating poisons.

331
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,810
Young Master Lin keeps her

332
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,620
to help you with your cold poison.

333
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,100
You're all I need.

334
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,500
I don't need anyone else.

335
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,530
Father.

336
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,410
Master Lin.

337
00:16:59,290 --> 00:16:59,980
Father.

338
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,740
It's good that you're back.

339
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,620
Young Lady Rong.

340
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,090
Who is this?

341
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,740
This is Yan Shao.

342
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
My bodyguard.

343
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,660
Master Lin.

344
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,220
Yan Shao has helped us a lot
along the way.

345
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:34,889
Is it because you've been traveling
hard these past few days

346
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,004
that you're too fatigued?

347
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:37,179
It's the cold poison attack.

348
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,080
This is Heart Protector Pill. It
can protect her heart's vascular system

349
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,160
to keep the poison
from attacking her heart and lungs.

350
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,648
But someone needs to dispel
the cold poison with internal energy.

351
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:45,937
- I will do it.
- Let me do it.

352
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,850
Yan Shao,
please help Sister Rong to heal.

353
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,570
Young Master Lin, go and stand guard

354
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,671
in case Ghost Valley Sect
comes after us.

355
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,020
Don't worry.

356
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,570
Yan Shao won't hurt Sister Rong.

357
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,090
I don't know him after all.

358
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,700
Besides,

359
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,900
I think there's something wrong
with him.

360
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,740
Moreover,

361
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,610
I didn't expect Mystic Ice Jade Palm
to be so fatal.

362
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,915
The cold poison is persistent
and difficult to abate.

363
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,340
Ghost Valley Sect seldom comes here.

364
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,329
I don't know much
about this palm technique either.

365
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,160
I have to go back
and read more medical books.

366
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,700
She's awake.

367
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,570
Sister Rong.

368
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,980
What just happened to me?

369
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,500
You probably had an attack
of cold poison and fainted.

370
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,330
It was Yan Shao who saved you.

371
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,330
Thank you.

372
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,740
Yan Shao,

373
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,260
I'm not wary of you.

374
00:19:06,448 --> 00:19:08,471
It's just that I don't know anything
about you,

375
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,810
so I've got to be on my guard.

376
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,020
Whether you're wary or trust me

377
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
is none of my business.

378
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,900
I'm Rong Shukuang's bodyguard,

379
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,850
not one of Yuchi Manor's men.

380
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,330
Since you're from the martial world,

381
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,850
please come in.

382
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:22,900
Thank you.

383
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,570
Liu An,

384
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,180
take care of Rong.

385
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,180
Yes, Master Lin.

386
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,740
Why is Wanci not here?

387
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,220
Perhaps

388
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,700
she can't be here.

389
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,810
She can't be here?

390
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,004
(Boardroom)

391
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,810
Shukuang,

392
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
you were injured by Shen Zuitian

393
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,004
but you don't have to worry.

394
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,020
Recuperate well.

395
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,850
Miss Tang and Wanci are here.

396
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,020
You'll get better with time.

397
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,090
Yes.

398
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,740
I'll go and check the medical books

399
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,940
with Wanci.

400
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,850
Sister Rong, don't worry.

401
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,500
I'll help you get rid
of the cold poison.

402
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:00,940
Yan Shao can help me with this.

403
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,020
Yan Shao, you've saved my daughter

404
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,180
and brought her back.

405
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,850
You've done Yuchi Manor a favor.

406
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,740
I can't thank you enough.

407
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,093
Don't mention it.

408
00:20:13,226 --> 00:20:14,460
You're too kind, Master Lin.

409
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,260
You're the benefactor of Yuchi Manor.

410
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,090
Shaoci, arrange

411
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,700
for a big reward

412
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,980
and a few days
of warm hospitality for Yan Shao.

413
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,220
Father,

414
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,180
Yan Shao is my bodyguard.

415
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,850
I'd like him to stay in the manor.

416
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,020
Don't worry.

417
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,980
I'll arrange for someone to protect you.

418
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,500
Here's the thing.

419
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,020
I think there's something fishy
about me being taken

420
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,020
by the Ghost Valley Sect.

421
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,940
It's possible that someone in the manor

422
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,980
is colluding with the Ghost Valley Sect.

423
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,420
Hence,

424
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,740
I think it's better to have a stranger

425
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,500
by my side.

426
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,420
Yan Shao,

427
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,660
Shukuang wants to keep you
as her bodyguard.

428
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,850
It's really too much to ask.
Forgive us for requesting this.

429
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:17,610
I'm grateful
for Young Lady Rong's honor,

430
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,980
so I'll do as I'm told.

431
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,180
Shaoci,

432
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,610
Miss Tang must be tired too.

433
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,150
Go and arrange for her to get settled.

434
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,180
Yes.

435
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,570
Master Lin, Young Lady Wanci
has fainted again.

436
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,900
Wanci.

437
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,980
Father.

438
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,370
If you didn't come,

439
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,460
you'd never see me again.

440
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,500
If I don't come,

441
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,260
you're going to get sick.

442
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,050
Enough. Stop pretending.

443
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,020
Don't I know

444
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,420
what's wrong with you?

445
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,500
I just think

446
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,090
you're so busy you've forgotten
about me.

447
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,810
Wanci,

448
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,090
I have to keep an eye on everything

449
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,700
inside and outside the manor.

450
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,360
When I don't come here often enough,

451
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,810
you get angry with me.

452
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,460
You're biased.

453
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,220
You think I'm not important

454
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,530
and won't let me go out.

455
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,900
It's not that you're not important,

456
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,980
but you've been weak
since you were little.

457
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,900
The doctor said
you shouldn't move around.

458
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,980
Be obedient.

459
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,420
Stay in your room and rest.

460
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,810
Come on. Stop being so grumpy.

461
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,700
Your sister is back.

462
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:07,980
Shukuang.

463
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,050
Shukuang, have you forgotten

464
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,180
that you used to pinch my purlicue

465
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,330
every time I had a bad cough?

466
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,980
That made me feel better.

467
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:28,900
I feel better now.

468
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,570
You still love me the most.

469
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,850
It's been a long time

470
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,130
since you two were so close.

471
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:36,130
Shukuang's had some rough days.

472
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,660
Don't pester her.

473
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,090
Let her go back to her room and rest.

474
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,770
Okay.

475
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,770
Let's go, Shukuang.

476
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,420
Please visit me often with Father.

477
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,900
Shukuang,

478
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,260
come with me to the study first.

479
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,020
(Is there really a secret room)

480
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,460
(like in the TV show?)

481
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,900
(Well, with this plot,)

482
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,330
(when we get in there,)

483
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,220
(you're going to have
to tell me some secrets.)

484
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,330
I promised your mother

485
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,180
I wouldn't tell you this secret,

486
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,020
but you found out after all.

487
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,980
You were too young
when I brought you back

488
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,330
to the manor.

489
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,740
After a serious illness,

490
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,460
you couldn't remember a lot of things.

491
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,370
I wanted

492
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,700
to tell you about the past,

493
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,810
but I was afraid you'd act impulsively.

494
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,180
Mother,

495
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,290
I'm back.

496
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,810
You don't have to worry about me.

497
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,220
Father,

498
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,660
I'm ready.

499
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:40,900
Please say it.

500
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,330
I won't act on impulse.

501
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,940
Back then, me, your mother, Su Shiyu,

502
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,370
Shaoci's and Wanci's mother, Rong Li,

503
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,850
and my senior brother, Chu Moxiong,

504
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,420
were under the same master.

505
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,770
Then Shiyu married into the Fang family,

506
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,020
and I brought Li back to the manor

507
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,560
to take over the position of Master.

508
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,090
Not long after,

509
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,370
we received a message from Shiyu

510
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,500
that the Fangs
were being chased and killed.

511
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,370
So the three of us rushed
to rescue them.

512
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,220
It was only then that we learned

513
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,610
that the Fang family was
once a fallen royal family

514
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,370
who had been guarding

515
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,180
the key and map to the Fuxian treasure
for generations.

516
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,940
But the news

517
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,460
- was spread by someone,
- Fuxian treasure...

518
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,090
attracting a lot of hunters
from the martial world.

519
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,130
We were late.

520
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,460
Your father was killed on the way.

521
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,660
So the three of us agreed

522
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,090
to settle you, your mother
and the Fang family's guards

523
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,370
in a secluded mountain village.

524
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,290
I remember it was called

525
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:54,337
(Misty Moon Village)
Misty Moon Village.

526
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:55,850
Misty Moon Village?

527
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,090
But I didn't expect

528
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,700
someone to find Misty Moon Village

529
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,330
where you lived

530
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,980
when you were five years old.

531
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,180
By the time I got the message from Shiyu

532
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,260
and arrived there,

533
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,660
you were the only one left
in the village.

534
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,460
So I brought you back to Yuchi Manor.

535
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,260
In order to conceal your identity,

536
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,180
I let you take Li's surname

537
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,290
and claimed you were
the daughter of Li's cousin.

538
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,290
Do you remember

539
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,420
how you were injured and taken away

540
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,337
by Shen Zuitian?

541
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,330
My head hurts.

542
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,370
Yes.

543
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,900
You've suffered a lot these days.

544
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,050
Get well first.

545
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,500
We'll talk about this

546
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,980
when you're better.

547
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,700
You're right, Father.

548
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,020
Well, I...

549
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:43,770
Go ahead.

550
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,143
(Lingering of Music and Reading)

551
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,370
That's a lot of information.

552
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,740
In ancient times, my last name is Fang.

553
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,460
In modern times,
my last name is also Fang.

554
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,260
My name is Fang Yi.

555
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,740
The ancient me wouldn't
be called Fang Yi, would it?

556
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,050
Isn't this

557
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,130
the other me in a parallel dimension?

558
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,090
(This mansion)

559
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:23,530
(is better than the one)

560
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,700
(I'm renting outside the East 5th Ring.)

561
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,130
(Since I've decided to stay,)

562
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,290
(I'll pretend all the way through
and I can't get caught.)

563
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,290
My books haven't been touched?

564
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,220
(This doesn't look like
a young lady's room.)

565
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,570
(Is this a man's room?)

566
00:29:37,648 --> 00:29:39,426
Is there any problem, Young Lady Rong?

567
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:43,980
Young Lady Rong's cold poison
hasn't kicked in yet,

568
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,420
but there seems to be a change
in her temperament

569
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,610
and style of behavior.

570
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,330
Even her appetite

571
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,220
is different from before.

572
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,940
After so many days in the desert,

573
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,330
my skin is too dry.

574
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,740
Bring me some skin care products,

575
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,220
jasmine-scented.

576
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,180
You never used these things.

577
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,050
You rarely even looked in the mirror.

578
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,270
Yingluo made me use it.

579
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,530
You've always called her Miss Tang.

580
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,290
When did you become so close to her?

581
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:13,315
We've been through thick and thin,

582
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:14,900
so we're close.

583
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,330
My skin is so dry.

584
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,940
I must have a spa treatment.

585
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,050
Young Lady Rong, what "pa"?

586
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,290
Nothing.

587
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,810
By the way, where's all my money?

588
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,570
We'll take care of everything
if you ask us.

589
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,050
You don't have to pay for it.

590
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,290
Okay.

591
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,770
And bring me something to eat.

592
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,090
More vegetables.

593
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,740
I'd like to have a slim waist.

594
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,370
Some fruits too.

595
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,330
Young Lady Rong has always loved meat,

596
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,537
especially dried meat.

597
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,269
I've been eating too much meat
in the desert.

598
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,026
It's made me heaty.

599
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,460
It's normal for her

600
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,493
to have a change of temper
after a serious injury.

601
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,900
Just tell me

602
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,980
what Shukuang needs.

603
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,290
She suffered a lot at the hands
of Ghost Valley Sect.

604
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,370
I wonder when the cold poison
of Mystic Ice Jade Palm

605
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,770
will be lifted

606
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,530
and when she can recover
her martial arts.

607
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,090
Yingluo said she'll do her best.

608
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:05,115
I'll ask her to work
with you to figure it out.

609
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:05,770
Okay.

610
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,770
Young Lady Rong

611
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,740
and the guard she brought back,
Yan Shao,

612
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,050
seem to have an unusual relationship.

613
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,980
She seems to be a different person

614
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,130
when talking to him.

615
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,020
Look at the girl behind me.

616
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,330
She seems to be strange.

617
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,050
Since I promised to protect you,

618
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,020
I'll do my best.

619
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:24,050
But you have to be careful
with your words

620
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,180
and take precautions.

621
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,660
Are you saying that someone here
will harm me?

622
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,500
Because of the treasure,

623
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,020
Yuchi Manor has become a target.

624
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:35,448
You must be careful both inside
and outside the manor.

625
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,090
Teach me some martial arts.

626
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
You need to eat, sleep
and go to the toilet.

627
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,660
If I'm in danger while you're pooping,

628
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,982
I need to be able to fight back.

629
00:31:44,982 --> 00:31:45,770
Nonsense!

630
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,471
You need to poo.

631
00:31:46,493 --> 00:31:47,090
You don't poo?

632
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,337
If not, you'll die
of holding it back, won't you?

633
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,180
Teach me.

634
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,530
Yan Shao is very secretive

635
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,204
and we don't know his background,

636
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,370
so we can't be completely at ease.

637
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,940
Wanci,

638
00:32:01,426 --> 00:32:04,180
you're familiar with the origins
and moves of those martial artists.

639
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:07,260
I'll leave it to you
to find out more about him.

640
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
I got it.
