1
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,510
Hang in there, Milady.

2
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,280
Think of your beloved lady.

3
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,080
Should we run away together?

4
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,479
Piangrawee.

5
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,080
I have the same dream again.

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,560
I knew that you'd have a nightmare.

7
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,650
So I came in to light up aroma oil for you

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,050
to calm you down and have a good night sleep.

9
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,280
Here some warm milk.

10
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,360
I warmed it up for you.

11
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,800
Thank you.

12
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,470
I look that bad?

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,880
Not really.

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,199
But the anniversary of your grandma's death is close.

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
And it caused you to be like this.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
You're right. You all must be used to it by now.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,079
Thir is waiting for you in the office.

18
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,079
Here's your phone,

19
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,720
fully charged.

20
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,440
Here. / Thanks.

21
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,400
Tell him that I'll be ready in a minute.

22
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,640
What's up, Kong?

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,600
I miss you so much.

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,920
Let's get serious.

25
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,800
About the new product, right?

26
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,120
I know M.L. Kassakorn,

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,050
she's so witty.

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,920
Well, I called to apologize

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,200
and thanks about signing the contract.

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,560
My pleasure. But I need to talk to you about this.

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,520
It can't be this sudden next time.

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,280
Shun told me that you let Thir take care of this project.

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
That's right.

34
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,760
Thanks for lending me your top right-hand guy.

35
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,720
I'm glad to have Thir, now I don't need to worry.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll hurry up and finish my work

37
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,400
then I'll rush back to you.

38
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Sure.

39
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,770
What's next?

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,480
The meeting about medical center of

41
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,480
regional genomics  and precision medicine is ready.

42
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Are we ready to invite investors to invest with us?

43
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,680
Our company's potential in

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,760
medical supplies and biotechnology

45
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,240
can help out Singapore at this moment.

46
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,209
Okay.

47
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,920
What level of readiness are we on?

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,050
Our drug company is listed top-ten most revenue worldwide.

49
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,560
The other seven drug companies are from Singapore.

50
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Good.

51
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,250
Let's start the meeting.

52
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,360
Good morning, ma'am. / No need to be formal.

53
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,650
This is my house.

54
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,760
Don't forget that before you work for me,

55
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,360
we went to school together.

56
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,710
Got it.

57
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,920
Why're you here so early?

58
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,320
Gift told me that there's work in the afternoon.

59
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,800
Don't worry, your assistant is quite good.

60
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,200
Don't you have to take care of Andy's project?

61
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,840
There's some urgent papers.

62
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,120
They're for The Cloud's meeting

63
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,040
from Methakorn Group Public Company Limited,

64
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,320
at 2 P.M. today.

65
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,120
General meeting will be held in 7 days.

66
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Tian?

67
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Why did I see you a lot lately?

68
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Right.

69
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,520
Can you check

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
how Tian is related to Utsanakhorn Palace.

71
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Got it.

72
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,760
I mean…

73
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,160
You don't like Andy, do you?

74
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,120
Just hang in there.

75
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,200
If he is our presenter, our product will go viral.

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,120
You've been here since early morning because of this?

77
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,200
The other subjects are just excuses, aren't they?

78
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Please, I beg of you.

79
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,840
I don't mind working harder.

80
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,000
But this…. / If you want to be better, you need to take care of this.

81
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,280
Think of it like a project to test you.

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,840
In the future, you can work somewhere else

83
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:42,440
and take care of other projects for our companies.

84
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,200
It'd be better to support him.

85
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,200
Don't ruin it for me.

86
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,070
Got it.

87
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,520
Where are you? Why didn't you pick up the phone?

88
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,680
Such a tough job.

89
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,760
Prey.

90
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
She won't read and she won't reply back.

91
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,000
Perhaps she's busy working.

92
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,280
What are you whining about?

93
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm whining about a mean person.

94
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
I got butterfly pea, I should go and make some desserts.

95
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,730
Sure. / Thanks.

96
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,120
Oh my,

97
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
why did you make so many of these?

98
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,760
I'll offer them to my dear great-grandmother,

99
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,920
my grandpa and to…

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
Tian.

101
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,280
You can share it with our people.

102
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,880
That's so nice.

103
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,800
They must be so full

104
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,920
from this, all of them.

105
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,840
Oh, stop it.

106
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Let me help you pack.

107
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,280
Okay, thanks. / No problem.

108
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,640
She didn't even read my texts, nor pick up her phone.

109
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,400
She's playing hard to get.

110
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Prey

111
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,650
It'd be better if you weren't

112
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
one of Utsanakhorn

113
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,680
Damn you Utsanakhorn.

114
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,880
Please calm down, honey.

115
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,160
I don't think they intended to hurt you.

116
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,080
You don't think so?

117
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,000
They intended to hurt me.

118
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,960
I designed this hotel,

119
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,720
instead of making me their partner,

120
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,520
they claimed their sole ownership.

121
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,360
They even tore hotel's blueprint right in front of me.

122
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,320
They didn't care about my art.

123
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,720
Let's get some snack, let's go.

124
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,000
Come on.

125
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,920
Being upset like this won't help.

126
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,720
You're gonna disagreeing with me all the time, aren't you?

127
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,120
I just want you to calm down.

128
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,480
Calm down so you can think straight

129
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,200
then we can decide our next move.

130
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Song.

131
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,520
You need to make a proposal to Utsanakhorn's hotel.

132
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,040
I don't care what you'll do.

133
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,560
You can lobby all of shareholders.

134
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,880
Do whatever it takes,

135
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,200
I need to get that hotel, you hear me?

136
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,330
What's with the rage?

137
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,160
It's been ages already.

138
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,640
The owner of this bed must be in deep sorrow

139
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,400
to give this bed

140
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,040
to her lover

141
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,480
on wedding day.

142
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,080
Why do I feel so depressed?

143
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,720
It's because I feel bad for you, right?

144
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,600
If being in love means to get hurt,

145
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
it'd be better to end this way.

146
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Auntie,

147
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,120
let me ask you something, why did people from

148
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,680
Utsanakhorn palace hate us so much?

149
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,050
None of your business.

150
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,520
It doesn't concern the help like us.

151
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,320
If you refuse to tell me,

152
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,960
I'll call Ms.Earl's mother, she asked me to be a spy.

153
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,600
I need to call her and report about Earl.

154
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Well, she

155
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,600
must be worried about Ms. Earl.

156
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,000
I feel bad for her.

157
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,360
She was punished from things that she didn't do.

158
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,920
Who started it?

159
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,150
Us or them?

160
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,760
Nobody.

161
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,800
It's the purest form of love

162
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,600
that happened with the wrong people, wrong age,

163
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
wrong place and wrong time.

164
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,800
It caused damaged among both of them.

165
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,050
They blamed people who were alive.

166
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,840
Those who were alive

167
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,880
still lived in sorry

168
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,320
until their last days.

169
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,040
What's going on?

170
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,680
Why did good form of love bring us sorrow?

171
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,840
If Earl is in love,

172
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,720
I'll help her and prevent her from being hurt,

173
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,080
I won't even call her mother.

174
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,480
I hope so.

175
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,560
But Earl sad that

176
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,040
she met a person from Utsanakhorn Palace

177
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
and she looked just like M.J. Sasinapa

178
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,120
For real?

179
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
That's right.

180
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,480
My dear great-grandmother,

181
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
I don't know what's wrong with Earl.

182
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,160
I can't reach her.

183
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,680
Perhaps she blocked me.

184
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,720
That's too bad.

185
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
I really wanted her to meet you.

186
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,920
Well, I won't give up.

187
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm one of Utsanakhorn so I can't give up.

188
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,200
You're not gonna say something?

189
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,840
Fine, I'll bring desserts to Tian.

190
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,800
See you later.

191
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,440
Chil, where's the meeting room?

192
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,320
9th floor. / 9th floor? Thanks.

193
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,320
Hello, Chil. / Hello, Ms. Prey.

194
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,600
Are you here to see Ms.Tian? / That's right.

195
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,720
I also brought you something.

196
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
It's called Bulan Dan Mek.

197
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,080
Wow! Thanks.

198
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,680
You prepared budget documents, didn't you?

199
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
All done.

200
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Earl!

201
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,720
Where's the meeting room? / 9th floor.

202
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,880
Earl!

203
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Fire exit.

204
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,700
Hello,

205
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
please come to the meeting room.

206
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,780
This way.

207
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
9th floor.

208
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,360
I woke up so early and the meeting was cancelled.

209
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,280
Why did they cancel it all of a sudden?

210
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,200
A shareholder got COVID.

211
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,400
That's too bad.

212
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Parking lot.

213
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,640
To the parking lot.

214
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
Earl!

215
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,280
Earl!

216
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,480
Wait for me.

217
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,720
Earl!

218
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,080
Prey?

219
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,480
Are you okay?

220
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,920
What happened?

221
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,600
Are you feeling better?

222
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,360
Can you tell me

223
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,920
what's going on?

224
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,320
I wanted to give you some desserts.

225
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
But

226
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,280
I saw Earl.

227
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,440
I tried to follow her.

228
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,400
I wanted to see her.

229
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,680
You can just call her, you didn't have to run after her.

230
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,720
She blocked me.

231
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,160
I don't know why.

232
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,320
Since she dropped me off at my place,

233
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,160
she's been acting weird ever since.

234
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,960
She must be

235
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,320
busy, I think.

236
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,840
The important meeting was cancelled today,

237
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,840
everyone went back to plan

238
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,960
and start over with limited time.

239
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,520
I can promise you that

240
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,480
I will ask her about this.

241
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,960
But you're busy.

242
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,640
Yeah, it could take a while.

243
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,120
Please hang in there.

244
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,600
I'll ask her about it right after I'm done with work.

245
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,870
Sounds good?

246
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
Thanks.

247
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,040
What about this?

248
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
Should we go to see Milin today?

249
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
A famous singer named Andy will be there.

250
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,440
Looking at hot guy could cheer you up.

251
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,680
I don't think so.

252
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,000
I want to go home.

253
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Well,

254
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,200
I'll give you a ride home, okay?

255
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,240
I'm not wearing this.

256
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,520
You have to.

257
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,640
You changed five outfits already.

258
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,440
The whole crew members are waiting for you.

259
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,200
Look at this.

260
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,050
It sucks.

261
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,760
If I wear this,

262
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,160
it will ruin my taste completely.

263
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,280
They're all the same.

264
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,840
Can you stop being dramatic? / That's enough.

265
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,720
Pookie. / Yeah?

266
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,880
Where's my assistant?

267
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,450
Assistant?

268
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,360
Assistant? / Assistant?

269
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,480
Kanthir? / Yep.

270
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,400
Wearing your clothes got

271
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,280
nothing to do with him.

272
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,360
Well, Kong asked

273
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,920
that Kanthir guy

274
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
to take care of me. Where is he?

275
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
Where is he?

276
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,360
Kanthir? Where are you?

277
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Hello.

278
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,320
You're here.

279
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,040
Why don't you rest at the waiting room?

280
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,120
Well, I….

281
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:08,560
I have a bone to pick with him, just a little.

282
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,160
Oh, come on.

283
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
You're exaggerating.

284
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,800
I can wear this.

285
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,280
But…

286
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,680
Kanthir needs to put it on for me.

287
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,920
Are you crazy?

288
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,800
He just got here and you asked him to do this?

289
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Yes.

290
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,720
I'm having a headache. I'm fainting.

291
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,520
Just put this on for you, right?

292
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Yep.

293
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,360
Prey?

294
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
What?

295
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,520
Why did you look like wilted flowers like this?

296
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,760
I have a headache.

297
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,700
I need to lie down.

298
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
Okay.

299
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
What?

300
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,160
She was so lively when she left.

301
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,360
Why did she come back and look like

302
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,360
a sad little bug?

303
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,560
I know, right.

304
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,960
I think it's weird too.

305
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,840
You think so?

306
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,280
Prey is a girl

307
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,440
who likes to keep her sorrow

308
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,320
down inside, not sharing it with us.

309
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm so worried about her.

310
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,800
What about this?

311
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,320
You can talk to her grandpa.

312
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,440
It's better than being worried about her from afar like this.

313
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,000
It's a good idea.

314
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,280
Thanks.

315
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
My pleasure.

316
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,520
If the beautiful flower

317
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,360
of Utsanakhorn Palace got upset,

318
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,680
all of us

319
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,600
will be in deep sorrow as well.

320
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,760
Your lunch is here.

321
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,480
What is for lunch?

322
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,280
Massaman curry with chicken paired with Roti,

323
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,800
cucumber slices in vinegar and pork satay.

324
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,880
Prey made Bulan Dan Mek for dessert.

325
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,720
You know me so well.

326
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,840
What books are you reading today?

327
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Have you done reading Sherlock Holmes?

328
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,480
I didn't get anything done.

329
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,120
I haven't started anything yet.

330
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,720
Is something bothering you?

331
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
This is.....

332
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,920
golden ring with rubies.

333
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,480
It belongs to my aunt,

334
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,440
M.J. Piangrawee Utsanakhorn.

335
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,040
I've never seen this one.

336
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,080
My dad told me that

337
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,440
my aunt loved this ring so much.

338
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,240
So I keep it seperately.

339
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,050
It's a family heirloom.

340
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,720
I want to give

341
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,720
this to Prey on her birthday.

342
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,880
That's a great idea.

343
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,520
One thing. / Yeah?

344
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:56,360
I was born and raised in the palace.

345
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,480
I heard about our dispute with Sittalrat Palace.

346
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,960
What's the real reason?

347
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,720
The death

348
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
of my aunt

349
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,880
caused by someone in Sittalrat Palace.

350
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,720
My dad and my grandma

351
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,880
couldn't forgive people from that palace

352
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,320
because of the incident.

353
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,280
All done.

354
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,640
You look so pretty, Milady.

355
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,760
I don't think so.

356
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,920
I'm not that pretty.

357
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,120
Also, you're not my servant.

358
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,120
You're working for me.

359
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,250
Got it.

360
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,840
You're going to the party? Really?

361
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,360
I promised my dad.

362
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,960
I can't break my promise.

363
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,040
Besides M.J.Paksathorn

364
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,080
visited our palace when he was young for so many times.

365
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,800
I know but I'm still worried.

366
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,400
You're not feeling well.

367
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,760
You could get sick if you're exposed to the wind.

368
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
I'm not that weak.

369
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,160
I just used my health condition as an excuse not to get married.

370
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,250
How are you feeling, my dear?

371
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,640
If you're not feeling well,

372
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,720
you can stay here.

373
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,640
We can go with Ratchanon.

374
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,360
My throat is a little bit irritated.

375
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,600
Don't you worry.

376
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,250
How could I not worry about you?

377
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,080
You're my heart and my soul.

378
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,640
This is a blessing event.

379
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,000
Why're you trying to ruin it?

380
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,440
A party at Sittalrat Palace

381
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,050
is a gathering of royal family members,

382
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,960
our relatives.

383
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,760
You know it well.

384
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,600
Our daughter have been avoided it for so long.

385
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,620
Now it's time for her to get married.

386
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,080
There're rumors flying around

387
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,400
that she's severely ill.

388
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,240
I want to show you off.

389
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,680
I want to show how pretty you are.

390
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
As you wish, my father.

391
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,360
That's more like it.

392
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,960
You're truly my daughter.

393
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,840
You need to be strong and determined,

394
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,100
both mentally and physically.

395
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,520
Thank you all for coming to my party.

396
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,280
I don't care about you.

397
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,520
I heard that your sister is so pretty

398
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,160
that a moon needs to hide behind clouds.

399
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,240
M.J. Chalothorn,

400
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,680
you're making enemies with men around Phra Nakhon.

401
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Well, we haven't seen each other for such a long time.

402
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,120
Cheers!

403
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,050
Agreed.

404
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,720
If I'm a grown-up like all of you,

405
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,800
I'd try to date M.J. Sasinapa as well.

406
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,360
Wow,

407
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,760
M.J.Ratchanon, you should

408
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,050
start thinking about this

409
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,800
when you stop drinking milk and trying champagne with us.

410
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,920
Age doesn't matter, it's all about the heart.

411
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,480
Radis, you're a son of a millionaire

412
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,480
but you could lose to a young fella like me.

413
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,120
Sir? / Yeah?

414
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,800
If you support me in this,

415
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,480
I'll give my sister to you.

416
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Well said.

417
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,520
But you're all dreaming.

418
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,400
What? / My sister went to various parties

419
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,050
but she's so shy.

420
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,880
She doesn't like talking to men.

421
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,760
She likes to hang out with women instead.

422
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,720
Playboys like all of you

423
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
should stop dreaming.

424
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,719
You hear me.

425
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,920
Right?

426
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,560
Where're your parents?

427
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,000
They should be here soon.

428
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,679
They're coming with my sister.

429
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,639
Is that so?

430
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,560
Today is the day

431
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,520
that I get to see the face of Piangrawee

432
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,880
Who're you looking for, Milady?

433
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,800
M.J. Piangrawee Utsanakhorn

434
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,120
Is she the one who is

435
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,520
as pretty as the moon?

436
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
That's right.

437
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,650
She has been a pretty girl since she was young,

438
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,520
and she is a pretty lady now.

439
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,000
I feel bad for her.

440
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,240
I heard that her health is a problem.

441
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,720
So she doesn't leave her palace too often.

442
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,560
She's pretty and she was born in a good family.

443
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,400
But noone wants to marry her.

444
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,720
Perhaps Piangrawee

445
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,880
is no man's soulmate.

446
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,960
I want to look into her eyes

447
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,960
when we're alone just for once.

448
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,640
I want to know if moonlight

449
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,960
can shine in a cloud like my heart.

450
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:50,640
I don't quite get your poem.

451
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,720
I just feel bad for her.

452
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,600
She still can't find someone to marry her.

453
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,520
Maybe it could be good news here.

454
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
Why's that?

455
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,920
I heard Imm said that

456
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,440
Ms. Rung is looking for

457
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,400
someone for her son.

458
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:18,800
That lucky woman could be M.J. Piangrawee.

459
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,520
The moon will stay by the cloud,

460
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,130
that I'm sure of.

461
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,160
Sir?

462
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,360
Prince Rojsuriya Utsanakhorn

463
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,800
and his wife are here.

464
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,480
How are you?

465
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm good.

466
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,100
Department of Consular Affairs isn't that busy.

467
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,440
We just raised duties from foreigners,

468
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,680
the ones who wanted to start a war.

469
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,000
Can we stop talking about politics?

470
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,280
I'm with you.

471
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,880
Where's M.J. Piangrawee?

472
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,880
I'd like to introduce her to M.J. Paksathorn.

473
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,320
They can be acquainted, about other topic

474
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,840
we need to wait

475
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,520
until the parents are talking.

476
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,640
Thank you.

477
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,840
Why don't you get M.J. Piangrawee for me?

478
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,210
Got it.

479
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:50,280
It's been 7 days that I tried to reach her.

480
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,640
She didn't even read my texts.

481
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,840
I asked Tian to talk to her

482
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,080
and she didn't get back to me.

483
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
Or…

484
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,050
should I call her

485
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,920
and tell her

486
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,720
that I want to return her handkerchief? Souds good?

487
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,160
What do you think? Is it a good idea?

488
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,160
What about this?

489
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,400
They said silence is the best answer.

490
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,920
You can just be silent.

491
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,720
I'd assume that you agree with me.

492
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,440
I'll call her right now.

493
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
Ms. Prey,

494
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,680
your grandpa wants to see you in his library.

495
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,720
Okay. I'll be there.

496
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
Talk to you later.

497
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,000
But she looked so sad this morning.

498
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
What can I do?

499
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,400
Young people are full of hormones.

500
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,150
She's here.

501
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Tar said that you'd like to see me.

502
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,430
Nothing much. I just wanted to know

503
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,360
if your parents called to say happy birthday.

504
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,160
They should call tonight.

505
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,360
We are 7 hours apart.

506
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,560
I guess they're still sleeping.

507
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,320
Well,

508
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,050
don't you want to go anywhere on your birthday?

509
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,280
I approve.

510
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,320
You do? / Yep.

511
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Well,

512
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,360
I need to call Tian's friend first.

513
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,400
If she's free, I'll talk to you again.

514
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,240
What? She's moving so fast.

515
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,800
I didn't get a chance to say something important.

516
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,320
She'll be back soon.

517
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,000
Hello, Earl?

518
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,360
This is Prey.

519
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,600
Ms.Prey, what can I do for you?

520
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,520
Well,

521
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,760
I'd like to know

522
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,200
when the two of us

523
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,680
can meet again?

524
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,250
I want to give you back your handkerchief.

525
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,440
It's okay. You can keep it.

526
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,360
But…

527
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,680
it's yours.

528
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,600
I don't want to keep it.

529
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,800
You can just throw it away.

530
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,080
It's just a handkerchief.

531
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,520
You don't have to bring it back to me.

532
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
I…

533
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
I mean…

534
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,080
If that's all, then I gotta go.

535
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,300
Was I too harsh?

536
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,840
Khunying Kotchakorn Utsanakhorn,

537
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,920
her maiden name is Rattikul.

538
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,600
She's a younger sister of Chartchai Rattikul,

539
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,120
a father of Tian Tawanin Rattikul.

540
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,050
Prey's mom is Tian's aunt?

541
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,650
Why didn't I know about this?

542
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,080
Surprise!

543
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,000
What's going on? Why're you crying?

544
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,320
Nothing.

545
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,160
Just dusts in my eyes.

546
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,520
Stop it. I know that you're crying.

547
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,360
Well, lately

548
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,120
weather's changing

549
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,880
as well as people's mind.

550
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,800
I told you that I'm not crying.

551
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,280
If you're not sad,

552
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:42,800
then we should go.

553
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,960
We thought we'd take you out to enjoy some macaroni and cheese

554
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,840
to cheer you up. But you're doing fine,

555
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,040
then we should go. / Wait.

556
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,360
Macaroni and cheese?

557
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,560
That's right, I'm here

558
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,680
to take you out to lunch.

559
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,880
I already talked to your grandpa, don't worry.

560
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,280
But I'm so sad right now.

561
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm super sad.

562
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,360
Now you're sad?

563
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,760
Should we get going?

564
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,250
I made a reservation at 12.30.

565
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,050
Let's go. /Okay.

566
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,520
Stop, both of you.

567
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,320
Don't you forget that her grandpa wants

568
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,200
to give her a birthday present?

569
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,880
Why don't you try it on?

570
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
Do you like it?

571
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,200
It's so pretty.

572
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,160
I like it so much, thanks.

573
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,800
It's time for this ring to find a new owner.

574
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,440
And it suits you well,

575
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,900
right?

576
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,200
You're right.

577
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,480
It suits you well and it looks good on you.

578
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,760
Whose ring is it?

579
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,600
I've never seen such a beautiful ring like this.

580
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,680
I didn't know we have this ring.

581
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:51,880
If I had known,

582
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,320
I would have asked to buy it for an engagement ring already.

583
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,300
Come on.

584
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,760
The ring

585
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,360
belongs to

586
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:14,240
a person that you offered food to almost everyday.

587
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,200
What do you think?

588
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,320
Do you like it more than a condo in Asoke

589
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,250
that your grandpa gifted you for graduation?

590
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,840
I like the ring more.

591
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,400
I rent out a condo.

592
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,280
I'm not living there.

593
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,680
I feel more comfortable living here with you.

594
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,160
Let me see.

595
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,600
This is so delicately beautiful.

596
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:03,920
It must be a masterpiece of top jeweler back in the day.

597
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,840
Here's your black coffee.

598
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,080
Thank you so much.

599
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,250
Piangrawee will like it so much.

600
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,160
It's one of a kind

601
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,960
and it's so unique.

602
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,840
I should hurry to Utsanakhorn Palace.

603
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,040
Thief! Help!

604
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,240
Thief! / What's going on?

605
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,880
He's going there! / Please help her! Come on!

606
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,720
Help! Thief!

607
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,200
Such a nice weather. / Help!

608
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,960
Hey!

609
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,680
There!

610
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Hey!

611
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:18,940
Hey!

612
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,120
Hey!

613
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,000
Help me!

614
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,440
Hey! / Help!

615
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,580
How're you feeling?

616
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,000
My stomach is hurt.

617
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,640
Thank you so much.

618
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,960
If you didn't help me, it'd have been bad for sure.

619
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,800
Don't worry about it.

620
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,600
I needed to help those in need.

621
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,660
Thank you again.

622
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,360
What's inside the bag is so important to me.

623
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,480
There you go.

624
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,080
M.J. Sasinapa ?

625
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,960
M.J.Paksathorn's younger sister?

626
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,400
My name is Radis, I'm your brother's friend.

627
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,250
This is M.J.Chalothorn.

628
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,320
He's also your brother's friend.

629
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
Thank you

630
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,480
both of you so much.

631
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,160
I need to go.

632
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,560
I need to visit Utsanakhorn Palace.

633
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,640
Can I give you a ride?

634
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,240
I can visit M.J. Ratchanon.

635
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,600
I think we should go seperately.

636
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,600
I asked someone to give me a ride already.

637
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,600
Excuse me.

638
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,520
Good bye.

639
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:11,200
I guess you'd like to visit Sittalrat Palace more often.

640
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,520
From what I heard,

641
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,760
Tian made a reservation at American style restaurant in Asoke.

642
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,920
Do you want me to give you a ride for personal activity?

643
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,680
No need to.

644
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,840
You already had a hard time taking care of Andy.

645
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,560
Gift told me about it.

646
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,720
You even needed to put on watch and clothes for him.

647
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,760
Just hang in there.

648
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,680
This too shall pass.

649
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,650
From what I heard,

650
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,250
Prey's mom is more than Tian's aunt.

651
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,680
She helped supporting Methakorn Group Public Company Limited

652
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,840
until Tian became an adult

653
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,050
then she transferred all ownership to her

654
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:10,000
since Tian's a freshmen in college.

655
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,050
If I had known that I would have lunch with one of Utsanakhorn,

656
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,120
I would have said no to Tian already.

657
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,840
I need to talk to Tian about this.

658
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,320
I'll eat so much.

659
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Tian.

660
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,920
I need to talk to you.

661
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,600
Can you go outside?

662
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:01,040
Why did we have dispute with Sittalrat?

663
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,520
Keep that in your rotten mind.

664
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,840
If Earl told me to die, then I would.

665
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,680
You visit her house everyday,

666
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,480
she'd be so cruel if she didn't get back to you.

667
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,360
If I called you informally,

668
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,720
it'd be disrespectful to you.
