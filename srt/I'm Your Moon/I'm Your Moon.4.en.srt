1
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,840
I put a towel and my clothes here.

2
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
Thank you.

3
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,800
I'll feel better after a warm shower.

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,800
Don't forget to wash your hair or you'll get sick.

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,520
Got it.

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Prey?

7
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,220
Earl?

8
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
Can I shower with you?

9
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,000
Ms. Earl? Ms. Earl?

10
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,640
Ms. Earl.

11
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,360
Yeah? What is it?

12
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,700
Did she watch me shower?

13
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Ms.Earl.

14
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,160
What's up?

15
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,840
You were soaked up as well.

16
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,440
So I drew you a warm bath in your grandmother's room.

17
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,920
That's great.

18
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,720
Please take care of Prey.

19
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,120
Sure. Don't worry.

20
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,160
Just take a shower already.

21
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,840
You could get sick.

22
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,200
About your friend's clothes,

23
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,840
I told Saly to take care of them.

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,960
If you got time, find her something to eat.

25
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,360
I already prepared warm milk

26
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,960
and some snacks.

27
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
Okay.

28
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Thanks.

29
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,840
Where's Earl, auntie?

30
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,840
She's in the shower. What?

31
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,200
In….

32
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,960
In…. / Which room?

33
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
That room.

34
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Thank you.

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,840
They look so much alike.

36
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Oh my!

37
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,380
Milady.

38
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,200
Why are you torturing yourself like this?

39
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,120
This is the last thing

40
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
that I could do for her.

41
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,960
By giving her this bed?

42
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,520
For her wedding gift?

43
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,760
We can't be in love.

44
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,480
I need to let her marry another man.

45
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,080
Oh, Milady.

46
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,600
Please just burn it down.

47
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
Don't let it hurt you like this.

48
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Kwan,

49
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,159
she will belong to someone else.

50
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
At least,

51
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,200
when she closes her eyes every night,

52
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
or wakes up,

53
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,520
my beloved lady

54
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,080
can lie down under

55
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,960
warm blanket

56
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,320
in bed that I made for her

57
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,800
with the mix of love

58
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,840
and sorrow.

59
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,880
Prey?

60
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are you okay?

61
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,540
I'm fine.

62
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
Let's go.

63
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,650
Here's some milk.

64
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,760
Wow!

65
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,050
Oh my!

66
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,960
Auntie!

67
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,560
She's there!

68
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,640
I'm not a ghost.

69
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,560
I just look like M.J. Sasinapa.

70
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,640
Don't be scared.

71
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,480
Ms.Prey

72
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,440
just looks like M.J. Sasinapa.

73
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,920
Perhaps she is M.J. Sasinapa

74
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,050
in this life. / Auntie? Saly?

75
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,200
Yes?

76
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
Don't you have something else to do?

77
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,680
Sure. / Just go.

78
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
Let's go.

79
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,520
They must be so frightened

80
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,200
that I look so much like M.J. Sasinapa.

81
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,650
Or maybe I am

82
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,840
M.J. Sasinapa in this life for sure.

83
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
That's just nonsense.

84
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,080
It's just a coincidence.

85
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,960
But I believe that

86
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
there's no such thing as coincidence

87
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,000
but it's destiny.

88
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,280
I made this Sam Pan Nee dessert for you.

89
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,360
Who told you to drink this much?

90
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,760
Who drunk? Not me.

91
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
I can still drink some more.

92
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,560
Nope. No more for you.

93
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,670
Just go to sleep.

94
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,240
Where're you going?

95
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,840
Are you going to that Phanit?

96
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,640
Where is she, baby?

97
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
You kept drinking with her

98
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,520
until she passed out in the restaurant.

99
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,920
She deserved it.

100
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,000
She tried to steal my girl

101
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,680
this is what she gets.

102
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,840
Ms. Tough Girl, no one is tougher than you.

103
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Please go to sleep.

104
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,760
I'll need to take a shower.

105
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,520
I'll have a meeting since early morning tomorrow.

106
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,650
Okay? / Sure

107
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,640
Thank you for loving me.

108
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,920
You think you can say you love me

109
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,760
and leave me just like that.

110
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
No way!

111
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,160
Well, then

112
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,680
no shower.

113
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
No!

114
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,880
I need to take a shower.

115
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,800
You're heating up.

116
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,320
I think you could have a fever.

117
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,440
Let's go see a doctor.

118
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,360
But I don't want to go.

119
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
I'm afraid of needles.

120
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Can I just take a pill and lie down for a minute?

121
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,720
I'm afraid that your family will be worried

122
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,050
if you go home late.

123
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,360
You don't feel sorry for a sick girl?

124
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,720
I just want to watch the moon

125
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,440
with you here.

126
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Please?

127
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
I really want to watch it here with you.

128
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,720
Then you should call your house

129
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,050
that you'll be home late.

130
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,200
I'll get some meds and ginger tea.

131
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Sure.

132
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
Hello, grandpa?

133
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,030
Hi, darling.

134
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,680
Can I sleep over somewhere else?

135
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
You're not coming home?

136
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,680
Where're you staying?

137
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,400
At Tian's place?

138
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,520
I'm staying over at a friend's house.

139
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
A friend?

140
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,360
A friend that Tian introduced you to?

141
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,680
That's right. Can I?

142
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,200
If she's Tian's friend,

143
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,250
then I'm fine with that.

144
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,920
Just take care, darling.

145
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,920
Sure, I will. Thank you.

146
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Here.

147
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,250
Drink some tea

148
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,560
it could sooth your fever.

149
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,270
And take

150
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,760
these pills after.

151
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,410
My grandpa really loved nature, you know?

152
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
He adored daylight

153
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,680
and loved light at night.

154
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,160
He built this observatory

155
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,560
for his alone time.

156
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
Do you like it?

157
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,320
If we turn off the light,

158
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
we could see the moon better, right?

159
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,080
Do you think

160
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
the moon is so beautiful from here?

161
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,480
No matter where you are in the world,

162
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,080
the moon is always beautiful.

163
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,550
I think the sky will look prettier as it's getting late.

164
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,160
We could see meteors here sometimes.

165
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,840
Can I stay here until late?

166
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,600
What about 9 P.M.?

167
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,800
That's not late.

168
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,880
What time is late for you?

169
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,440
Around midnight.

170
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,250
It's too late, your family could be worried.

171
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,320
Don't worry.

172
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,200
I told my grandpa that I'll sleep over at a friend's house.

173
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,560
Well,

174
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,760
I'll drop you off tomorrow morning.

175
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,609
Okay.

176
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,119
That's what

177
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,040
I really

178
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,000
want to hear.

179
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,640
Hey! I called you for a hundred times.

180
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,000
If there's fire,

181
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,600
you could be dead by now.

182
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:07,760
Andy? What's wrong with you?

183
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,440
It's my day off.

184
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,250
So you didn't read an email from Kong's agency?

185
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Email?

186
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
What email?

187
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
From Google Mail.

188
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,400
You really need to clean up your junk emails.

189
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
So people can send you emails.

190
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,280
What is he yelling about?

191
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,080
The latest one?

192
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
That he sent

193
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,680
about shooting location of Kong's commercial?

194
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,880
That's right.

195
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,760
What's your problem?

196
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,800
It's not in the mountains.

197
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,110
Andy!

198
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,080
You're working, not walking on runways.

199
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,960
I don't want it.

200
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
I won't go if it didn't go as planned.

201
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,600
If you're not going,

202
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,120
I'll tell Earl to stop sending Kanthir to take care of you.

203
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,280
You want that? Should I call her now?

204
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,200
Well, Tian. I'm just kidding.

205
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,600
Fine, I'll go.

206
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,240
So where

207
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,720
is the new location?

208
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,960
Do you want me to drive you there?

209
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
No need to.

210
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,400
I can go with Pookie.

211
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
You're busy already.

212
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,600
Tell me, where's the new location?

213
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,320
They dropped a pin at

214
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,480
Crawford Hotel.

215
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,680
Crawford?

216
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Yep.

217
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
Nillanate?

218
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,920
I think it's Fierce's hotel.

219
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,080
Fierce who?

220
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,160
You knew the hotel's owner?

221
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Your secret girlfriend?

222
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,680
Huh? / What? Are you crazy? She's my friend.

223
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,360
Stop saying that. Disgusting.

224
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,600
How did you know her?

225
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,840
In UK?

226
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,800
If you met her here, I'd have known her already.

227
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,880
That's right. From studying in the UK.

228
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,880
I'm about to visit her place as well.

229
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,680
I need to attend new wine's taste

230
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,120
that we partnered with.

231
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,560
Should we invite Prey to join us?

232
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,120
I'll have more buffer

233
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,840
to stop Phanit

234
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,120
while I work.

235
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Sure.

236
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
But you don't need any buffer really.

237
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,880
I'm so crazy about you right now.

238
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,080
If you don't believe me,

239
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,400
we can have another round.

240
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,920
Is it a challenge? Cause I'm always ready.

241
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,000
Well, ladies?

242
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm still here.

243
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,720
Why didn't you hang up already?

244
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,680
You want to try?

245
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,050
Sure.

246
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,880
I want you to choose for me.

247
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
Okay, I'll choose it for you.

248
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,400
It smells good like your handkerchief.

249
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,870
But I don't think this scent quite suits you.

250
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,600
I didn't suit me,

251
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,680
but the wearer is cute.

252
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,320
Sure. Cute.

253
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,800
We should get going, I don't want to be late.

254
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
I like the smell from your shirt.

255
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,680
What scent did you use?

256
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,400
I mixed it with many brands.

257
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,240
Can you take me to buy one?

258
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,760
I don't think I can.

259
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,960
If you can't take me,

260
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,760
I can go there by myself.

261
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,400
Now I know that people from Sittalrat Palace

262
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,050
are so mean.

263
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,550
Fine,

264
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,360
I'll take you there.

265
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,200
I don't want to be called mean.

266
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,320
I'm so happy.

267
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,250
You're so nice to me.

268
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,560
I can drop you off here.

269
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,320
Can you stay and help me pick out my perfume?

270
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Please?

271
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,490
I..

272
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Please

273
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,000
If it's not too long, then fine.

274
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Let's take a selfie.

275
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,280
1..2…3….

276
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,160
Let's go inside.

277
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
I can't believe it

278
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,300
that I'd meet someone who looks so much like M.J. Sasinapa.

279
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,160
If you met Prey,

280
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,880
you would be stunned like I did for sure.

281
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,120
Please take care

282
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,250
of Earl,

283
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,960
don't let any bad things happen to her.

284
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,120
Can I try Love Don't Be Shy scent?

285
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,840
Sure, wait a minute please.

286
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,760
Do you think it smells good?

287
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,960
Yep, I really like this one.

288
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,250
Well, I'll take this one. / Okay.

289
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Wait,

290
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,720
you're not gonna try other scents.

291
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,520
You made up your mind already?

292
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,250
Yes, you said that you like this scent.

293
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,840
Can I pay for this?

294
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,570
Here it is.

295
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,250
Please wait for a second.

296
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
Prey,

297
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,440
can I ask you something?

298
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,880
Sure, what is it?

299
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,200
Why did you pick the scent that I liked?

300
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,360
Why didn't you wait to smell all the notes?

301
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,080
In case you didn't like it.

302
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,920
Are you saying that

303
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,560
I chose this scent

304
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,100
to imply that

305
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:51,000
I like you?

306
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,360
Well, you're right.

307
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Prey.

308
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,360
What is it? I'm listening.

309
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,040
Do you really like women?

310
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,800
Cause I'm a woman.

311
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,400
I like you.

312
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,480
What if I didn't like you like that?

313
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,440
It's fine.

314
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,520
But..

315
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,520
don't fall for me, okay?

316
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,800
I can drop you off here.

317
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,360
Thank you so much.

318
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,000
We should hang out more.

319
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,660
Sure

320
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,450
Bye.

321
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,360
Watch out!

322
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm sorry.

323
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,840
Watch for the cars!

324
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Thank you.

325
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,800
And I'm sorry.

326
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,250
What'd I do if something happened to you?

327
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,920
It hurts so bad if you got hit by a car.

328
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,720
I know.

329
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,680
You need to look around before crossing the road.

330
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,960
I'll give you a ride.

331
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,720
Soft-boiled eggs.

332
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,880
You know me so well.

333
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,050
Tian,

334
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,000
do you think Prey is acting weird lately?

335
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,680
I think it's you who's acting weird lately.

336
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,840
When you had problems, you called me so sweet.

337
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,160
When I'm not important anymore,

338
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,440
you'd call me harshly.

339
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,650
Can you stop talking about me?

340
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
I'm serious about this, I'm worried about Prey.

341
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,360
What do you mean by weird?

342
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,840
Tell me more about it.

343
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,080
It's like

344
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,050
she's in love.

345
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,140
Yeah?

346
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,800
Who do you think she has a crush on?

347
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Well,

348
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,040
Earl.

349
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Seriously?

350
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,240
Yep. You didn't know?

351
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,560
She told me that

352
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,800
she had a crush on Earl.

353
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,800
If they really like each other,

354
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,480
I can only imagine

355
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,680
what they will end up with.

356
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,390
Right,

357
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,680
Earl

358
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,640
wouldn't leave her perfect fiancé like Kong.

359
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,600
I'm sure that you

360
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,960
can fix all the problems.

361
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Right?

362
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,720
But I'm not so sure

363
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,250
about this problem.

364
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,100
This is the last project

365
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,160
that I'd pull you away from that superstar

366
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,560
You don't like him, the ladies are crazy about him.

367
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,640
Well, I like him.

368
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:34,050
But I want you to come back to work.

369
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,040
Come on, just hang in there.

370
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,040
After shooting this commercial,

371
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,160
I'll be back to work with you.

372
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,040
Good. I'm about to go insane

373
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,880
from covering your work here.

374
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,920
Suddenly, they changed location.

375
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,120
Good thing that you were around the area.

376
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,960
I felt so much better having you close.

377
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,000
The original plan was to go to Khao Yai.

378
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,480
That's weird. Andy didn't call to yell at me.

379
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
That's right.

380
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,600
And our boss is so quiet about this.

381
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,650
I heard that

382
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,560
the owner of this place

383
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,050
knows Kong and Tian.

384
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,560
It's normal for them to be acquainted.

385
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,000
But it's not normal

386
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,000
that Andy didn't call to yell at me

387
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,200
about the change of location.

388
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,250
I think it's good.

389
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,880
You won't see him again, after this project.

390
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,600
And I will be your assistant.

391
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,960
I can't take care of Ms.Earl all by myself.

392
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm so exhausted.

393
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,440
The last project?

394
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,240
Please take care of Prey.

395
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,670
I'm busy lately.

396
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,900
Don't you worry about that.

397
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,560
She's like my sister.

398
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
One more thing.

399
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,480
I think I'll go to the resort late for sure.

400
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,960
I need to take care of something at the company first.

401
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,280
Sure, I'll take care of it.

402
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,800
Hello, Fierce?

403
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,880
I'll visit your resort a little late tomorrow.

404
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,770
I have a meeting in the morning.

405
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,350
Not a problem.

406
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,790
Will your pretty sister be here too?

407
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,520
You mean Prey?

408
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Are you trying to hit on her?

409
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,800
Nope, just asking.

410
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,880
She posted photos on Instagram and tagged you quite often.

411
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Glad to hear that.

412
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,840
If my sister arrives there before me,

413
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,790
please take care of her.

414
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,720
Sure, see you later.

415
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,400
Don't be so overprotective.

416
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,239
Well, I have a pretty little sister.

417
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,440
Besides, Fierce

418
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,280
can be just a friend who talks

419
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,870
mainly about benefits.

420
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,199
We need to be careful

421
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,440
not to get close to

422
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,159
someone like her.

423
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,280
Your Sam Pan Nee dessert, Ms.Fierce.

424
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,120
Thank you.

425
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,400
I wonder if

426
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,920
you'd be as sweet

427
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,920
as this dessert in real life.

428
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,560
This will be the last time

429
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,960
that I can drop you off here.

430
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
Why's that?

431
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,400
Where're you going?

432
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,000
I need to tell you again that

433
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,880
I'm one of Sittalrat.

434
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,320
And you're from Utsanakhorn.

435
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,920
I'll be better if we don't see each other anymore.

436
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,600
I don't care.

437
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,640
I want to be with you.

438
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,120
Do you hear me?

439
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,200
I want to be with you.

440
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,600
Earl! / Stop whining already.

441
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,000
It's impossible.

442
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,760
You want to be with me

443
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,250
but I don't want to be with you.

444
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,120
You hear me?

445
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,920
Get off my car already.

446
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,600
I did the right thing.

447
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,760
Prey?

448
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:49,960
What happened?

449
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,400
Why? Why?

450
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,240
Why?

451
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,280
Why can't we be in a relationship

452
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,440
just because our families have feuds?

453
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,880
Why did their anger run so deep?

454
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Prey?

455
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Prey

456
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,910
Prey,

457
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,320
I don't know what happened.

458
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,680
Do you believe in destiny?

459
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,920
Destiny?

460
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
That's right.

461
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,160
Just like me and your grandpa.

462
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,520
Who'd have known

463
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,080
that a help in the house

464
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,040
would be your grandpa's life partner one day.

465
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,840
Trust me,

466
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,520
if we're born to be together,

467
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,360
no matter how many obstacles there are,

468
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,380
one day,

469
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,960
we'll be bound to meet again.

470
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,000
Bound go meet

471
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,600
again?

472
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
That's right,

473
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,640
if you're meant to be together.

474
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,800
What should I do next?

475
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Should I wait?

476
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,680
Or should I let it go?

477
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,680
Time

478
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,840
will give you the best answer.

479
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,250
For now,

480
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,400
you need to make yourself happy

481
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,760
and enjoy your life.

482
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,880
Go on a trip.

483
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,680
Didn't Tian invite you to join

484
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,320
the opening of her friend's hotel?

485
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,960
Your grandpa already gave a permission.

486
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,920
You should go so you won't think about it.

487
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,520
You'll feel lonely staying home.

488
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,090
Okay.

489
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,640
Stop crying.

490
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,760
It will be okay.

491
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Have fun with your friends.

492
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,200
Make sure that everything is perfect.

493
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,520
There're many VIP guests coming.

494
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Sure, I got this.

495
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
Hello, Tian?

496
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,200
I just finished my meeting.

497
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,320
My sister should be there before me, please take care of her.

498
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,520
You must be so worried about this sister of yours.

499
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,560
You called to tell me twice already.

500
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,120
Don't worry.

501
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,050
She'll be safe with me.

502
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
This way, please.

503
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,440
Hello, Prey.

504
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,880
Hello.

505
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,920
Are you Fierce?

506
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Well done.

507
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,720
You know me?

508
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,890
Yes.

509
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,200
Tian didn't tell me

510
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,640
that you'll look so elegant like this.

511
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,680
You're such a sweet talker.

512
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,000
That's why people fall in love with you.

513
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,360
I'm not a sweet talker

514
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,680
but you really are beautiful.

515
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,920
I think many people will try to flirt with you.

516
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,640
Well, I don't like men.

517
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,600
But if it's you,

518
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
I'll let you flirt with me.

519
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Let's go.

520
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,120
We should wait for Tian in the restaurant.

521
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Okay.

522
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
Thank you.

523
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:02,280
Did you eat already, beautiful?

524
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,560
I haven't.

525
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,760
Who could

526
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,720
let you be hungry like this?

527
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,460
Here.

528
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,440
What're you favorite dishes? I can order them for you.

529
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,480
Anything, really.

530
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,920
You can pick.

531
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,010
Sure, then I'll order

532
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,520
special dishes for

533
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,360
my special guest.

534
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,700
Excuse me, miss.

535
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,480
Can I get

536
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,200
the special dishes of this place.

537
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,560
I think you're gonna like it.

538
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Sure.

539
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,880
Kanthir prepared a suite for you.

540
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,760
Would you like to go see your room?

541
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,200
I'm fine.

542
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,040
I'll walk around first.

543
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,520
Can you get her bags to the suite?

544
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,640
Really? Tian really did that?

545
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,920
That's right. She looks so calm and collected

546
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,720
but she's really scared of Milinth.

547
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,000
I've never seen that side of her.

548
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,760
So weird.

549
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,120
What about you? If you have a girlfriend,

550
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,520
will you be scared of your girlfriend like Tian?

551
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,960
You really want to know?

552
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,400
If you do,

553
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,680
then you have to date me.

554
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,880
I'm talking to a cute lady.

555
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,480
Of course, I'm in a good mood.

556
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Prey!

557
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,880
How did you get here?

558
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,640
Why are you sitting with a stranger?

559
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,160
Why can't I?

560
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,720
I'm Fierce's girlfriend.

561
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Girlfriend?

562
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,120
You said that you loved me.

563
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:40,040
It's been only a day and you're someone else's girlfriend?

564
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,440
You acted like a jellyfish.

565
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,080
You looked so innocent but you're full of venom.

566
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,360
Hey,

567
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,120
you're working so hard that your brain doesn't function anymore?

568
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,960
She's saying it loud and clear,

569
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,080
it means that she doesn't love you.

570
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,960
Your brain doesn't function well.

571
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,680
Your parents didn't teach you to not interrupt

572
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,680
when people're talking? Back off! / Wow!

573
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,500
Please stop fighting, both of you!

574
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,480
Stop fighting! Stop it!

575
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,760
Calm down, Fierce!

576
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
That's right.

577
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,520
Just try it.

578
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,550
Prey?

579
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,440
Hi, Earl.

580
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,600
You're here to work with Tian?

581
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,800
Yes.

582
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,520
What about you?

583
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,480
What're you doing here?

584
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,400
Well, I….

585
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,080
Tian invited me here to rest.

586
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,440
Can I sit here?

587
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,080
Sure.

588
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,800
M.L. Kassakorn Sittalrat / Where's Tian?

589
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,250
She'll be here soon.

590
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,400
She asked Fierce to take care of me in the meantime.

591
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,920
So she thought this through.

592
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,120
Please excuse me.

593
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,400
Where're you off to? We haven't greeted each other properly.

594
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,080
Hello,

595
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,400
Ms.Lillian Nillanate Crawford

596
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,680
What should I call you?

597
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,360
So many names, I can't decide.

598
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,800
It's normal.

599
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm a halfie.

600
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,400
I have Thai name, middle name and English name,

601
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,720
it's so normal.

602
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,040
Are you a halfie?

603
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:51,280
That's right.

604
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,560
I'm a quarter of English.

605
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,080
Wow! That's so cool.

606
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,720
You two seem to get along really well,

607
00:48:01,230 --> 00:48:02,440
excuse me.

608
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,040
Are you checking up on Tahwang's set?

609
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,680
I heard it's a set

610
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,960
of someone who're very familiar with,

611
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,180
right?

612
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,440
That's right. I'm familiar with them.

613
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,520
I hope that the wine event tonight

614
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,320
would go so smoothly.

615
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,360
Otherwise,

616
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,400
Crawford Hotel will be marked as unprofessional.

617
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Okay?

618
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,400
I made sure that it's perfect in every little detail,

619
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,800
especially

620
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,040
for special guests.

621
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:52,140
Earl?

622
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,320
Excuse me, I need to follow her.

623
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,520
Well,

624
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:03,800
don't take too long. I'll wait for you.

625
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:06,720
You don't have to wait for me.

626
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:09,120
I gotta go.

627
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,460
Earl?

628
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:14,890
Earl?

629
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,120
Earl?

630
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,810
Earl?

631
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,680
Why're you following me?

632
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,280
Won't you have lunch with her?

633
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,720
You're the most important

634
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,920
person for me.

635
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,440
I really missed you.

636
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,760
You missed me?

637
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,800
We just met yesterday.

638
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,920
Well…

639
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,760
Well what? / I can't even

640
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,440
miss you?

641
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,080
I'm just wondering

642
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,680
that we met yesterday and you missed me already?

643
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,200
I'm not like you.

644
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,680
You don't even miss me.

645
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,440
Who said that

646
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,760
I didn't miss you.

647
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,200
Ms.Fierce, would you like me to serve

648
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,640
special set right now?

649
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,720
No need to.

650
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,840
I don't think Prey will come back to eat with me.

651
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,370
Okay.

652
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:29,720
Wait,

653
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,000
if Prey gets to her room,

654
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,200
just serve her the food.

655
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,460
Got it.

656
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,320
So beautiful.

657
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,400
Me?

658
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,680
The sun.

659
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:58,440
Fine.

660
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:02,280
I know that I'm cute.

661
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,400
Why're you laughing?

662
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,760
Fine, you're cute.

663
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,640
Aren't you gonna get ready for the evening party?

664
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,720
Sure, but

665
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,080
I'm waiting for sunset.

666
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,120
If it takes too long, Nillanate will be waiting.

667
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,800
Stop talking about others when we're together.

668
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,800
I want to stay here longer.

669
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,880
I want to spend longer time with you

670
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,250
as long as I can.

671
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,240
I don't know

672
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,720
if I can still be here with you later.

673
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,840
So I want to spend the longest time with you.

674
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,480
We can go back after sunset.
