1
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Good morning M.R. Ahatsakorn and Miss Sinee.

2
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:32,520
Welcome everyone to Crawford Hotel.

3
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,740
This resort is located amidst nature,

4
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,250
so serene and fresh.

5
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,000
If I was younger, I'd say that

6
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,759
this is a perfect place for

7
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
honeymoons.

8
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,930
You're right.

9
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,520
Many couples fall in love when they are here.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Right, Prey?

11
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,690
Prey,

12
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,080
I'll sleep in your room tonight.

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,120
What?

14
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,389
You're not gonna stay with Tian?

15
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,440
I can stay with Prey tonight.

16
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,440
It's okay. I can stay by myself.

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
No, you can't.

18
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,280
So many thieves here.

19
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,120
Besides Earl will be mad when

20
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,360
she comes back and finds out

21
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:32,040
that I don't take good care of you.

22
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,720
Please come and rest inside.

23
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,520
Thank you for giving me a chance.

24
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,079
Chance?

25
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
What chance?

26
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,560
Come on! / Come here.

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
What is it? / Tian!

28
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,940
What is it?

29
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,560
You need to tell me.

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
What chance did you give to your pervert friend?

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,200
Don't you think it's too harsh?

32
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,050
She finds places for us and takes good care of us.

33
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,760
It's not too harsh. Tell me.

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,120
What chance did you give her?

35
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Earl and Kanthir went missing

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,000
only Kong is safe.

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,600
Thanks for telling me this.

38
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
You can leave now.

39
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,520
I'm here to apologize to both you and Prey.

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,720
I think

41
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,720
you should take Prey to stay somewhere else.

42
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,960
It could heal her soul.

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,560
As my way to apologize for what happened,

44
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,680
I'd like to invite you and Prey's family

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,200
to stay at my resort

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,640
for as long as you want.

47
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,400
Why should I give a chance to a bad friend like you?

48
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
Please?

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,680
Give me a chance to make it up to you.

50
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,959
Fine.

51
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,120
On one condition,

52
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
we need to make a contract.

53
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Write this down.

54
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,910
Yes, boss.

55
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,640
One, I will organize the company's seminars

56
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,680
at Crawford Hotel

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
for three years, twice a year.

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
It means that we will pay

59
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,860
hotel rooms, ballroom,

60
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,159
and three meals a day

61
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,250
for 452 permanent employees

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,560
of Methakorn Group.

63
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,680
And two,

64
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,120
if Prey stays at your hotel,

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,880
you can't get closer to her unless being accompanied by someone else.

66
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,400
If you can't keep your promise

67
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,320
or something happens to Prey,

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,680
I will revoke the contract

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,440
and you will pay a hefty sum of compensation.

70
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,360
Also, you won't be able to invest

71
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,480
in any companies under Methakorn Group ever again.

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
What do you say?

73
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,090
You're the best.

74
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:43,960
Miss Sinee already asked you to take care of accommodation here.

75
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,650
You're a genius.

76
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,640
This is a good chance.

77
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,720
I need to let Fierce know how much

78
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,960
she will pay if she touches my sister.

79
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
You're the best.

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,520
You always misunderstand me.

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I'm sorry.

82
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
The best.

83
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,840
Here's some warm tea to destress.

84
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,160
Thank you.

85
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,920
When you come to Thailand,

86
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,250
I'll take care of you really well.

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Thank you in advance.

88
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,320
What's bothering you?

89
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,680
Your fiancé?

90
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,480
I guessed it right.

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,960
You don't want to get married?

92
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,200
I already have someone I love.

93
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,760
If he believes that I'm dead,

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,440
perhaps I could be free from this marriage.

95
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,760
That's so romantic.

96
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,480
I wish I had someone who'd love me enough

97
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,120
to do that for me.

98
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,720
But you pretending to be dead like this,

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,600
your lover could change their minds like Mr.Kong.

100
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,800
The bond between

101
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,200
me and my lover is so deep that no one would understand.

102
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,360
Even when we're not together,

103
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
our hearts keep on calling each other.

104
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,360
We'll find each other

105
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,050
in every life.

106
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,880
I can't accept your love.

108
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
Sasinapa,

109
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,880
when we love someone

110
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:01,040
as if they're living in our hearts,

111
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,120
there's no way we can share this love to someone else.

112
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,160
Nothing wrong.

113
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,600
Don't worry.

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,080
My love is not

115
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,800
about possession.

116
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,520
It's a kind of love to cherish.

117
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,960
Even one day,

118
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,120
I'd become a person who watches your love from afar.

119
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,799
Even I'm not alive anymore,

120
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,040
I will not stop loving you.

121
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,600
When I'm not here anymore,

122
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,520
please don't let your beautiful love

123
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,160
die with me.

124
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,800
Please, I beg you.

125
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,250
Mom, you're so mean.

126
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,080
I can't even stand to look at you.

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm so disgusted of myself because of you,

128
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,720
so much that I can't look at anyone in this world.

129
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,080
I want to apologize to your mom

130
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,560
for one more time.

131
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
I'm doing this for Chalothorn,

132
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,280
he begged me because his wife is dying.

133
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,080
I'm sorry.

134
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,480
You don't have to forgive me.

135
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,520
This world is so cruel

136
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,440
for taking away your daughter.

137
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,400
I'd like to wish

138
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,440
for us to meet again.

139
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,320
Please let me love Piangrawee again.

140
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,600
Please let me be her

141
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,400
one and

142
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,080
only girl.

143
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,880
Sasinapa! / Sasinapa!

144
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
Sasinapa! / Sasinapa!

145
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,320
My dear daughter

146
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,610
Sasinapa!

147
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,600
Wake up.

148
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
Children are like your heart and your soul

149
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,480
despite your status in this society.

150
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,840
Sittalrat Family

151
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,920
really crushed my heart to pieces

152
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,320
with no mercies.

153
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,320
You made a wish

154
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,840
to love my daughter for one more time?

155
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,240
If loving one another means to be death,

156
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,320
then don't bother.

157
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,560
I don't encourage this type of love

158
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,480
whether in this life or next life.

159
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,150
Sasinapa!

160
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,360
Stop crying too hard or you'll lose your beauty.

161
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,280
Your eyes will be puffy like goldfish.

162
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,170
When Earl comes back,

163
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,250
she could be too stunned to speak.

164
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,000
You sounded just like Earl.

165
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,760
Well, I'll stop crying.

166
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,160
I don't want to look like a goldfish.

167
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,480
You need to be patient.

168
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,920
If M.J. Sasinapa really reincarnated

169
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,280
as you,

170
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
then you need to fight for it.

171
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,960
Don't give up on your faith like before.

172
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,050
I understand that everyone is worried about me,

173
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,760
but I need more time.

174
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,360
Earl is like my light

175
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
to guide my life.

176
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,160
Suddenly,

177
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,000
my light is gone.

178
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,400
No matter what happens,

179
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,920
even sky will collapse, or land will slide,

180
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,840
the moon will remain in the same place.

181
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,960
I believe that your Earl

182
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,200
will stay somewhere in this world

183
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,600
and she is waiting for the right moment

184
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,600
to come back to shine

185
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
for you again.

186
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,600
I need to get through this

187
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,600
waiting for Earl to come back.

188
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,720
I need to live with hope.

189
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,720
This is great.

190
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,670
Hey,

191
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
who's that?

192
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,480
It's Andy. / Andy?

193
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,080
That's right, can you take a picture for me?

194
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,680
Can I get a picture?

195
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,520
Are you Thai? / That's right.

196
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,970
Sorry for taking your pictures earlier.

197
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,400
That's fine.

198
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,640
You two are soothing me.

199
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm glad to meet Thai people to talk to.

200
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,000
Are you here on vacation?

201
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,040
Not really. Actually, I'm here

202
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,280
to find my lover.

203
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Is your lover Thai?

204
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,320
I found someone around here.

205
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,520
But it's a man.

206
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,760
Yeah? Where..where is he?

207
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,440
On the beach over there.

208
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,560
But you should leave him alone.

209
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm not sure if he's a scammer.

210
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,720
He told me that he was in a shipwreck and tried to call back to Thailand.

211
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,760
He asked to borrow my phone, who would do that?

212
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
Okay, thanks.

213
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Thir!

214
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Andy!

215
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Thir!

216
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,440
It's really you.

217
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,760
Are you looking for me?

218
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Of course, I am.

219
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,040
I don't know if you're dead or alive.

220
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,680
How could I do nothing?

221
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,680
You know what?

222
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,440
You will be in trouble for doing this.

223
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,680
I don't care

224
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,120
as long as I found you.

225
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,200
You talked about troubles.

226
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
What troubles?

227
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Well, I will never

228
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
let you go

229
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,260
for all my life.

230
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,210
Mr. Kong

231
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,600
it's almost a month, I think.

232
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,880
And we still can't find her body.

233
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,500
How could we know

234
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,320
if she's dead?

235
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,050
Fine.

236
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,200
Your dad has been calling for so many times

237
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,500
about your job at Tahwang.

238
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,380
Let someone else do it.

239
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,640
The company will survive without me.

240
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
But you've never come back to the company since the accident.

241
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,800
It could affect the board

242
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,560
and our shares.

243
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,360
My fiancée is missing.

244
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm not telling you to stop looking

245
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,880
but you can let someone else do it.

246
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,270
Mr. Kong

247
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,240
please see your dad for once.

248
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,240
I think everything will be better.

249
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,490
Fine

250
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,080
I get it,

251
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,680
what Earl is trying to escape.

252
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,840
To love someone

253
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,800
or to put so much effort

254
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,720
for someone I love,

255
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,680
and I still can't do it.

256
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Earl,

257
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,280
I don't know if you're listening,

258
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,560
I don't know if you're dead

259
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
or you're alive,

260
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,360
but you're free now.

261
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,320
I want to tell you

262
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,080
that I love you.

263
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,600
Do you hear me? I love you.

264
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
I love you, Earl.

265
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,250
Your snacks.

266
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,680
It seems like you like this place.

267
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Thanks.

268
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,680
I really like this place.

269
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,200
Actually,

270
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,360
we should buy a place here.

271
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,400
We can stay here just the two of us.

272
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,160
Good idea.

273
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,680
There's no love, no revenge,

274
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,320
no curses and no hatred here.

275
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,520
But I can't go anywhere

276
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,080
not until Prey finds her happiness.

277
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,910
How is she?

278
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
She's getting better.

279
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,480
She can eat more.

280
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,320
She talks to people.

281
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,780
But she is still quiet

282
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,680
when Tian and Milinth go back to work.

283
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,680
Still, she became live when

284
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,840
she heard that Thir came back safe and sound.

285
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,080
She still has hopes.

286
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,040
When I talked about going back to the palace,

287
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,360
she refused to go.

288
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,040
She said that she couldn't face her great-grandmother.

289
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,440
It's been three months already.

290
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,120
I need to apologize to you

291
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,000
for dragging you into this loop.

292
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,880
I want to.

293
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,560
I don't care about any obstacles,

294
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,440
as long as you walk by my side,

295
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm willing to face any problems.

296
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,250
You decided to

297
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,720
come back to work after your leave for a while,

298
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,480
let me inform you about your schedule.

299
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,310
Go ahead.

300
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,800
You need to look at documents

301
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,240
that needed your approval the day after tomorrow.

302
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,680
And during lunch,…

303
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,920
What's going on?

304
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,280
You'll have a lunch date with Dr.Yong and his daughter.

305
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
What?

306
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,200
Dr.Yong

307
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,880
is an owner of Sahavej Hospital Group.

308
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,440
It's a large hospital group

309
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,200
in the northeast part

310
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,050
of Thailand, with more than 10 branches.

311
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,170
Wait.

312
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,480
I didn't make an appointment.

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,480
I don't even know them.

314
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,800
I….

315
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Dad!

316
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,360
That's right. He took care of everything.

317
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Dad?

318
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
Dad!

319
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,760
Why did you do that?

320
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,520
You saw the news?

321
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,600
They should have used better photos.

322
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,040
I won't get married to someone I don't even know!

323
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,600
Don't be stupid.

324
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,000
It's been three months already.

325
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
She should be dead by now.

326
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,250
You should accept that.

327
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,440
You need to get married to Mei Li,

328
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,960
Dr.Yong's daughter.

329
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,640
He's your friend?

330
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,560
Nope, listen to me.

331
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,440
I won't get married to your friend's daughter, ever.

332
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,680
You said as if Earl would get married with you

333
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
if she was alive.

334
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,280
You two were engaged for a long time.

335
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,160
You're in your thirties.

336
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,320
Why didn't she get married to you?

337
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,120
Think about it.

338
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,240
You know what?

339
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,600
When you searched for true love,

340
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,560
how many shares have dropped?

341
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
You searched for her

342
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,960
just like finding needles in the ocean.

343
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,250
It was a waste of time.

344
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,440
I did everything for you

345
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
and Tahwang.

346
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,080
Thank you so much.

347
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,600
My pleasure.

348
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,920
I feel better when you're around.

349
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,880
Did you see any news from Thailand?

350
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,550
What news?

351
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,880
It may not be good news.

352
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,720
I still need to hear it.

353
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,680
Tahwang Company

354
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,400
announced new fiancée of Kong Kidakorn.

355
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,800
That's really great news, isn't it?

356
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,160
Can I borrow your phone? / Sure.

357
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,800
Hello, sir.

358
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,680
You arrived late for months.

359
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,240
It takes time for me to heal

360
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,280
enough to come back to this place.

361
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,670
Auntie,

362
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,320
Earl has been missing for months.

363
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,930
Why is her mom still wearing black outfit?

364
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,800
They're parents.

365
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,200
She must be in grief.

366
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,080
Don't you worry.

367
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,320
When you're dead,

368
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,440
I'll wear black for three years.

369
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,360
What? You want me to die sooner?

370
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,640
Go back to work.

371
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,200
Fine, I'll go back to work. / Hey!

372
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,120
Prey?

373
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,120
Kanom Hun Tra,

374
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,560
Miss Sinee asked me to give you this.

375
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,200
She said this dessert has good meaning.

376
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,880
She even baked it herself.

377
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,800
I never saw it in Bangkok.

378
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,640
Do you know the meaning?

379
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,080
I have no idea.

380
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,280
But I guess

381
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,480
the meaning must be so nice.

382
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,600
That's why she

383
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,800
told me to ask you.

384
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,000
The meaning of Kanom Hun Tra

385
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,680
is engagement.

386
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,440
What is Miss Sinee

387
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,610
trying to say?

388
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,800
I love Earl.

389
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,400
No matter where she is in this world,

390
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,880
I will still love her.

391
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,760
I belong to her,

392
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,400
with my heart and my soul.

393
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,480
Even if she's dead?

394
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,440
You will love her?

395
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,200
I will still love her.

396
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,760
To announce to the world

397
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,960
that I will not stop loving her,

398
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,560
her name

399
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,690
will engrave in my heart

400
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,440
and it won't delete.

401
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,040
Why's that?

402
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,560
I love you as much as Earl did.

403
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,280
Why didn't you give me a chance?

404
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,320
What I can give you right now

405
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,500
is not love

406
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,720
but it's something out of pity.

407
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Prey?

408
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,000
Please don't leave.

409
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,840
You should stop wasting your time.

410
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,720
She refused you, you should stop asking her.

411
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,450
Earl?

412
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,600
Earl!

413
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,650
Earl!

414
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,160
Earl!

415
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Earl!

416
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,600
You're back!

417
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,400
I can hear your heartbeat.

418
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,320
Is it really you?

419
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,680
What about my body?

420
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,120
Is it warm?

421
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,480
Really warm.

422
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,520
It can confirm that

423
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
this is really me.

424
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,080
You know what?

425
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,450
How hollow my life was

426
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,120
when you were gone.

427
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,480
When you come back to me,

428
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,250
that's when I realized

429
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,040
my whole world

430
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,360
depended on one person.

431
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,400
And you know what?

432
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,840
That one person

433
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,920
is you.

434
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,640
Please let me wipe away

435
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,000
your tears from now on.

436
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,920
Thank you so much

437
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,400
for loving me this much.

438
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,560
I need to thank you

439
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,440
for coming back to me.

440
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,650
Thank you so much.

441
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,480
Sittalrat Palace

442
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,440
without Earl is so quiet.

443
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,860
I know.

444
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,680
So quiet.

445
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,250
Here some tea.

446
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,250
It could sooth you.

447
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,320
When Earl was so stressed,

448
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,250
she asked me to brew some tea for her.

449
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Don't go.

450
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,840
Let's chat.

451
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,640
I want to know more about our daughter.

452
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,960
I mean…

453
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,600
It's been months for us

454
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,600
to come back here.

455
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,800
And you want to be drown in sorrow.

456
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,679
Isn't it because of you?

457
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,960
You forced our girl to get married.

458
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,199
If Kidakorn wasn't the right match,

459
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,880
then who do you think is the perfect one.

460
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,040
Look at you,

461
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,480
you never disagreed of what I decided to you.

462
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,719
We're both someone to blame at.

463
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Come on,

464
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,650
I'm sorry.

465
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,120
How about this?

466
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,360
I promise you.

467
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,760
If I could turn back time,

468
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,320
I wouldn't have forced my girl to marry

469
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,440
or forced her to do something she didn't want to.

470
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm sorry.

471
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,560
Auntie Jang,

472
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,440
Sir? Madame?

473
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,280
Auntie Jang, Miss Earl. / Miss Earl?

474
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,920
What is it? / She's back.

475
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,800
She's alive, look!

476
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,920
So many reporters are around her.

477
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,440
Miss Earl? / Let me see.

478
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,800
Can we ask you something?

479
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,480
How did you get back?

480
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,800
It's complicated but

481
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,020
it takes time.

482
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,360
Now I'm back with her.

483
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,250
My girl.

484
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,360
You're not dead!

485
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,840
Is this really you?

486
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,640
I'm so happy.

487
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,280
See? I told you that Earl's not dead.

488
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,880
I'm not dead but

489
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,120
I will if you and your girlfriend keep hugging me like this.

490
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:03,400
I'm sorry. I'm so glad.

491
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,120
How did you survive?

492
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,880
I survived because of your sister's love.

493
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,200
Well, that's too sweet.

494
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,280
What're you doing next?

495
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,000
Should we leave now?

496
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,440
Leave? Where to?

497
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,720
You just got back. Where are you going?

498
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,880
Who said I will go by myself?

499
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,800
I'm taking you with me.

500
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,800
We'll see my parents.

501
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,760
Hello, sir. Hello, Miss Sinee.

502
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,360
Can I take Prey to Sittalrat Palace?

503
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:03,500
Her heart belongs to you.

504
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,320
What could I do?

505
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,600
Please take care of her,

506
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,640
M.L. Kassakorn.

507
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,600
Thank you, sir.

508
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,840
You can call him grandpa.

509
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,640
You're gonna be one of his granddaughters soon, aren't you?

510
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,960
Thank you, Miss Sinee.

511
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,800
Thank you, grandpa.

512
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,360
May I?

513
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,720
You have no idea how happy I am

514
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,440
to see Prey's smile like that again.

515
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,360
Keep on fighting.

516
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,600
I believe that your love will win.

517
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,520
I'm so happy that you're back.

518
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,280
I'm back now.

519
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,280
Your parents are waiting in the living room.

520
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Let's go.

521
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm so scared.

522
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
Don't be.

523
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,440
I'll be here with you.

524
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,560
They will accept us.

525
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,560
My girl.

526
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,720
Earl / Earl.

527
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,640
How are you? Are you good?

528
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,640
I'm good.

529
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,520
Grandma keeps you safe.

530
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,540
That's great.

531
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,650
Wow!

532
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,040
And you are?

533
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,850
Prey is my girlfriend.

534
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,640
That's why I can't marry Kong.

535
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,080
I love women.

536
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,160
Oh, my dear.

537
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,080
Why didn't you tell me?

538
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,560
From now on,

539
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,520
you can love who you want or do whatever you want,

540
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,680
I won't stop you.

541
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,220
You hear me?

542
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,360
Look at you,

543
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,080
you're so adorable.

544
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,800
You look exactly like my grandma.

545
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,520
Your name is Prey?

546
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,920
Yes, my name is Prey.

547
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,440
Please take us

548
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,320
to see your grandpa,

549
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
if it's fine with him.

550
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,200
He will be glad to.

551
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,200
Is the Utsanakhorn Family welcoming Sittalrat Family?

552
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,200
That's right.

553
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,320
Grandpa approved of this,

554
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,800
so we can meet.

555
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,600
That's great.

556
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,200
I'm glad that the dispute

557
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,720
between our families has come to an end.

558
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,960
I'm happy

559
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,900
that you can finally be with someone you love.

560
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,880
Thank you.

561
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,400
We

562
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,800
know how it felt to lose you.

563
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,000
We know how hurtful it was.

564
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,400
From now on,

565
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,080
I won't get in your way.

566
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,080
But I need to ask you one more thing.

567
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,640
You should tell Kong about this.

568
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,660
Kong,

569
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm sorry for making you worry about me.

570
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,300
If I didn't choose this way,

571
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,680
I would be…

572
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,600
If it's too much,

573
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,120
you don't have to explain.

574
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,250
I get it.

575
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,000
I know that

576
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,960
when we love someone

577
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,720
and to lose her,

578
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,040
it's tortured like crazy.

579
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,120
It's not weird that

580
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,080
you can't find a word to explain.

581
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,400
Please move on from me.

582
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,250
I can't love you like you want me to.

583
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:17,720
I know.

584
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,520
I can't make you change your mind.

585
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,800
If I force it,

586
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,320
it would just

587
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,250
make you feel uncomfortable.

588
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,840
The only thing

589
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,040
that I can do for you

590
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
is to move on

591
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,080
and part peacefully.

592
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,300
Thank you for understanding me.

593
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,580
You know what?

594
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:16,320
Love

595
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,120
is just like trees.

596
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,360
When they planted their roots,

597
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,080
there's no way we that

598
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
it can move.

599
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,200
It's like my love.

600
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,920
I know that

601
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,720
it means nothing.

602
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,520
But

603
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:47,650
I want to tell you

604
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,160
that I love you.

605
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,140
I love you so much.

606
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,650
I love you so much that I can sacrifice everything for you.

607
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:02,720
Please know that.

608
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
Thank you.

609
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,130
Okay.

610
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,560
Someone's love means

611
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,400
to speak the truth

612
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:33,040
and to free what captivated inside their hearts.

613
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,200
Is this official?

614
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
That's right.

615
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,440
Andy is my boyfriend.

616
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:45,880
Right, how did you two meet?

617
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,680
I met him at commercial's shooting.

618
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,840
I didn't like him at first. / What?

619
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,560
But when I spent more time with him,

620
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,000
I found out that he's a good guy.

621
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,800
I love

622
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,880
that he's positive

623
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,200
and he changes the color

624
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,220
of my grey life.

625
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,840
Wait, hold on,

626
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,040
this is not scripted. It's all him.

627
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,200
And I just stand still, look pretty.

628
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,680
Can I get the picture of you two?

629
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,440
With my pleasure. / Thank you.

630
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:38,960
This one.

631
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:46,560
All done.

632
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,470
Hey!

633
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,800
What're you doing?

634
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:12,560
It hurts.

635
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,160
Good. Now you won't give heart to someone else.

636
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,720
You're jealous?

637
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,200
Jealous? / Nope.

638
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:25,320
No, I'm not.

639
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,440
I love only you, I don't care about the others.

640
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,400
I just slipped and pressed heart.

641
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,880
Am I a joke to you? / Stop it, I don't want to fall.

642
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,640
Someone's love means

643
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,680
to put other's happiness over their own.

644
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,280
Because loving someone

645
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,360
makes waking up in the morning so worth it.

646
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,240
When you're around to love,

647
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,360
and to fight, it's so colorful.

648
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,520
Someone isn't ashamed to love

649
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,600
or to remember all beautiful memories,

650
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,280
even when they're hurt.

651
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:50,960
Thank you for everything.

652
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,840
Because of your help,

653
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,920
I have a new life

654
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,640
that I can destine.

655
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,360
I know how you feel about me

656
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,240
but I don’t think

657
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,320
I can love anyone but Prey.

658
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,720
And I believe that

659
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,880
you will find someone

660
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,360
just like I did.

661
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,200
Good luck my dear friend.

662
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:20,680
You held my hands for a short time

663
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,440
but you will hold my heart forever.

664
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,120
Finally, both of them

665
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,720
can be in love.

666
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:08,450
That's right.

667
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,360
From now on,

668
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,120
they will be in love forever.

669
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,100
My dear great grandma,

670
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,320
M.J. Sasinapa

671
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,650
comes back to be with you now.

672
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:37,600
Revenge from the past

673
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,680
has come to an end.

674
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,440
I promise

675
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,220
that I will love

676
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,200
and take care of her

677
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,720
as long as I live and breathe.

678
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,800
You promised to my great grandma,

679
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,720
you don't make a promise to me.

680
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,600
Nope.

681
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,960
Because words

682
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,640
and actions mean nothing,

683
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,480
as long as we keep holding hands

684
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,360
and walking together like this.

685
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:36,080
Thank you for loving me

686
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:38,420
Earl.

687
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,020
I know.

688
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,000
My love

689
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,800
is more than just bonding from the past

690
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:06,280
to present.

691
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,200
It's even more than what we've been through together.

692
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,920
I believe that

693
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,880
we've accomplished in love and we can stand side by side

694
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,880
because we

695
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,280
love each other with all our hearts.
