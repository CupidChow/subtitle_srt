1
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,710
This way, please.

2
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Tian?

3
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,640
I need to check on the set.

4
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,880
I'll rush back to you when I'm done.

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Sure.

6
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,360
I just need to call Pookie first.

7
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,190
Hello, Pookie?

8
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,039
They started rolling? Where is it?

9
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Got it.

10
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,880
Welcome buddy.

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,520
Where's Prey?

12
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,520
Your sister is pretty.

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,160
You didn't answer my question.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
Is she still single?

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,920
Yes, she's single.

16
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,480
I answered your question.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,720
Can you answer mine now?

18
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,010
Where is she?

19
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
With Mom Luang.

20
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,079
Mom Luang? You meant Earl?

21
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,510
Yup.

22
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,800
Well, I'm not worried if she's with Earl.

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,040
She spent the night at Earl's place.

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
Spent the night? / Yup.

25
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,640
I still remember what you did in the UK.

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,240
I don't care how messy you created for your life.

27
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,520
That's none of my business.

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,250
But I need to warn you,

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
as Prey's sister,

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,320
you can be a player to anyone,

31
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,680
but not with my sister, you hear me?

32
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,200
You're not following your sister?

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Nope.

34
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,079
Pretty.

35
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,360
This one, please.

36
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,760
Thank you. / Thank you.

37
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Here.

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,520
Thank you.

39
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,730
Congrats, Fierce.

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,250
You organized such a cool party,

41
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,720
launching new wine,

42
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,720
and opening new zone in the hotel.

43
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,200
Thank you.

44
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,040
I introduced this new area.

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
It's called entrepreneurial mindset.

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,880
Phanit also joint ventured in this.

47
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,480
You're close to her, aren't you?

48
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
I… / Tian!

49
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,760
What is it? / Watch her for a sec, okay?

50
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,460
Pookie!

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,360
Yeah? / Please watch her for me.

52
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Sure.

53
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,140
You're dead.

54
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,680
You're dead for sure.

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,160
Beautiful flowers.

56
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:36,200
I picked beautiful things for a beautiful lady.

57
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,000
I really like the new area.

58
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,720
You're so good at this.

59
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,600
I just arranged as the host requested.

60
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
You meant Earl?

61
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,640
Earl's special person.

62
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,800
He's a big partner of this wine.

63
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,690
There's someone else

64
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,120
being a partner besides Earl and Tian?

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
That's right.

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,440
He should be here with Earl in a minute.

67
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,200
Tian?

68
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,560
Who is he?

69
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I…

70
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,240
He is…

71
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,880
Earl's business partner.

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
Why don't you tell her the truth?

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
The truth?

74
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,920
He is Mr. Kidakorn or Kong.

75
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
He is M.L.Kassakorn's special someone.

76
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,800
He is her business partner

77
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,640
as well as

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,440
her life partner.

79
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,640
Life partner?

80
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,400
Hey! Too mush?

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
Not a life partner, just her fiancé.

82
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,400
I need to check on Andy behind the stage.

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240
Come here, Pookie.

84
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,960
Are you okay?

85
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,170
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,480
They look good together, don't you think?

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,720
It will be a talk-of-the-town wedding soon.

88
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,920
That's enough, why did you keep saying this for?

89
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,200
I forgot something in my room.

90
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,180
I need to get it.

91
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,720
I'll go with you.

92
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,600
It's okay. I can go by myself.

93
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,800
If I didn't care what people think,

94
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,720
I would have punched you already.

95
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,800
You know that when I want something,

96
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
I don't care how to get it.

97
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,320
And I like Prey.

98
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,120
But I don't like you, okay?

99
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,320
That's your problem.

100
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,240
You better keep your

101
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,800
sister away from me.

102
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
Is this the reason

103
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,320
why you keep pushing me away?

104
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,039
Because you have a life partner already?

105
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,520
My dear great-grandmother,

106
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,480
I saw that man

107
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,920
in my dream.

108
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,280
Are they a couple for real?

109
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
Why did I

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,240
feel so much pain like this?

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
It hurts so much.

112
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,520
You felt the same pain, right?

113
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
My dear great-grandmother.

114
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,560
What happened, Milady?

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,800
Sasinapa won't come here anymore.

116
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,680
They found out about our relationship.

117
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Oh my goodness!

118
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,360
She will get married in three months.

119
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,160
What should I do?

120
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,960
I should be happy for her, right?

121
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,050
Right?

122
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,680
That's right, Milady.

123
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,680
Because you

124
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,320
will also get married

125
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,480
to M.J. Paksathorn

126
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,640
according to your father's order.

127
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,200
That's right.

128
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Soon, I will be

129
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,280
her sister-in-law.

130
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,440
I can never be her lover.

131
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Never.

132
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,120
It's gonna be okay, Milady.

133
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Please welcome Andy Thakoon,

134
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,960
a superstar of M Group, to the stage.

135
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,880
Andy's singing? It wasn't in the schedule.

136
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, do you like it?

137
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
Is this the surprise you mentioned?

138
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
I can't believe that you can pull this off.

139
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
Of course, I have to show you this side,

140
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,840
I need to step up my game.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,560
I'd be so sad if

142
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,160
you look at someone else beside me.

143
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,640
I'm a jealous type.

144
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,160
I don't care if they're men or women,

145
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,120
if they're getting closer to you,

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,920
it'd hurt me so much.

147
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,520
Earl?

148
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,840
May I have this dance?

149
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Sure.

150
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,800
After you.

151
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Prey?

152
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,440
Are you okay?

153
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm fine.

154
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,040
If you want to talk,

155
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,800
I'm here.

156
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
They're engaged, aren't they?

157
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Yes.

158
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
They

159
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
have been engaged since they were so young,

160
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,170
their parents arranged it.

161
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,360
Earl didn't really want to

162
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,520
but she didn't seem to refuse it.

163
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,200
They're getting married, aren't they?

164
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,120
I'm not sure if

165
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,480
Earl would dare to disobey her parents.

166
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,800
But if there's someone

167
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,120
that she loves hard enough,

168
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,160
she will choose that person

169
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,680
over her parents' order for sure.

170
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,760
You're saying that

171
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,440
they might not get married, right?

172
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Prey

173
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,800
when you love someone,

174
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,480
it doesn't mean that

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
your love will find its happy ending.

176
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,050
You're willing to risk, aren't you?

177
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,400
I'm not sure if

178
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,200
my feeling for Earl

179
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,960
is real.

180
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,460
I just know that

181
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,160
when I'm with Earl,

182
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,960
it really warms my body

183
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,480
and my feeling,

184
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,120
just like sunshine.

185
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,040
When we're not together,

186
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,040
I felt like my soul left my body.

187
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,520
It's excruciating.

188
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,360
No more surprises, right?

189
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,960
Please give me some alone time.

190
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,920
With my pleasure.

191
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,040
Alright then, see you tomorrow.

192
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Sure.

193
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,960
Mr.Kong, can you give us a few words?

194
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,640
Sure.

195
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,160
Right this way.

196
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,220
Kanthir,

197
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,760
thank you so so much.

198
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,400
If you didn't help us out, we would be in big trouble.

199
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,560
It's quite sad.

200
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,360
You've been with us for almost five weeks.

201
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,880
What about you?

202
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,800
Will you be sad when you won't see us around?

203
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,800
I'm not disappeared or anything,

204
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
I'm still around.

205
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,120
You should say goodbye to Andy.

206
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,840
It seems like he really likes you.

207
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Okay.

208
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,000
It's strange.

209
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Well,

210
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,040
Andy seemed to be so happy

211
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,400
when he teased you.

212
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,360
His eyes sparkled

213
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,280
like when he was here for the interview.

214
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,540
Can you give me a reason

215
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,200
why you want to be our artist?

216
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
You're talented.

217
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,800
If I'm with you, I'll be famous for sure.

218
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
Why do you want to be famous?

219
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
You want money?

220
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Nope.

221
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,800
I just want to meet someone

222
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,160
who inspired me.

223
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
Milinth / Yeah?

224
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,040
Can I see Andy alone for a minute?

225
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,800
Sure.

226
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,720
Thank you. / Sure.

227
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,920
Please come inside.

228
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Where's Tian?

229
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,560
Who're you looking for?

230
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,920
Just be direct about it.

231
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,250
None of your business.

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Where's my friend and Prey?

233
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm not sure.

234
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,120
But one thing for sure,

235
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,200
Prey found out about your engagement.

236
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
She must be

237
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,720
somewhere crying her heart out right now.

238
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,250
If you don't want her anymore,

239
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,400
can I have her?

240
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
Let go.

241
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,360
You called for me? What's going on?

242
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
You were a singer in a restaurant around Ban Tad Thong, weren't you?

243
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Why did you ask me this?

244
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,880
Can you just answer it? I'm serious.

245
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,520
Cheers!

246
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,680
You're nobody! Why didn't you drink it?

247
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,880
You think you're good?

248
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,000
You think you're a superstar?

249
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,840
I'm nobody

250
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,320
but you can't force me.

251
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,440
You think you're cool?

252
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,360
You're cool, aren't you?

253
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,540
Really cool?

254
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,500
Stop! Right now!

255
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,680
He's a singer and he's a person.

256
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,960
None of your business, or you want some of these?

257
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
We don't want anything

258
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
but I'm not sure about my security guards.

259
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,770
What's going on?

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,120
It's your lucky day, loser.

261
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,400
It's nothing, just some misunderstandings.

262
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Nothing.

263
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,640
Are you okay?

264
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,000
Thank you so much.

265
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,870
But…

266
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
I…

267
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:32,960
I don't think I can come back to sing here.

268
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,920
Don't lose your hope.

269
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,440
My life was way worse than yours.

270
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,880
And I'm still here.

271
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,480
If you're trying hard enough,

272
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,600
and being a singer like this goes nowhere,

273
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,280
you need to find your way to be a superstar.

274
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,880
When you're famous, I'll ask for your autograph.

275
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,000
Can I have your autograph?

276
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
You remember me at last.

277
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,520
Don't cry, brother.

278
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,880
I don't want to be your brother.

279
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,160
I want to be your boyfriend.

280
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,560
Huh?

281
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,950
Want?

282
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,720
To be my boyfriend?

283
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,530
Yup.

284
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
Are you sure?

285
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,870
Yup.

286
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,040
If she loves you back,

287
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,280
then I won't stop you.

288
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,150
You're a smart girl,

289
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,320
you get what I said, right?

290
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,680
Then I'm a fool.

291
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,250
I know how to love,

292
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,800
but I don't know how to say goodbye.

293
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,360
Only time

294
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,760
can heal anything.

295
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,800
Earl must know how this will end

296
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
that's why she refused to start anything.

297
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Tian,

298
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,400
there's no reason

299
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,120
for me to love someone.

300
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,000
If this love

301
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,120
will cause me pain

302
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,480
like my heart's been shattered,

303
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,840
I will still

304
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,680
love Earl.

305
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,720
It's my fault

306
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,850
for introducing both of you.

307
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,880
Piangrawee is a woman,

308
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,720
how could she fall in love with M.J.Sasinapa?

309
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,680
I want all my children to be happy.

310
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,600
But her love is forbidden.

311
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,120
If the news is spreading around,

312
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,000
it will damage reputation of dad

313
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,640
and our family.

314
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,560
But if she gets married and stays at that palace,

315
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,160
she will become a sister of her own lover.

316
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,920
How can she live there?

317
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,320
She could be sorrow to death.

318
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,060
I believe that

319
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,160
M.J. Paksathorn's love will keep her happy.

320
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Besides,

321
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,250
you wouldn't be able to ask dad

322
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,320
to postpone this wedding.

323
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,720
Perhaps you're right.

324
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,800
And I don't see anyone more suitable for her

325
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
than M.J. Paksathorn.

326
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,840
Are you sure that you want to leave with me

327
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
and not wait for Tian?

328
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't want to trouble Tian.

329
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,800
She didn't even help out her girlfriend last night,

330
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,250
and I felt bad about it.

331
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,250
Would you like to eat something first?

332
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,280
We should find somewhere else to eat.

333
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,840
I'm not that hungry.

334
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,960
Okay, then.

335
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm not that hungry either.

336
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
Let's go.

337
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,880
It's not that tasty?

338
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,520
Or is it because you're here with me?

339
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm just exhausted from work,

340
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,840
don't mind me.

341
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,600
You're engaged to me,

342
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,400
of course, I care for you.

343
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,250
What about this?

344
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,280
I heard that there's a new garden full of flowers.

345
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,560
You want to check it out?

346
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,320
Watching something beautiful could sooth you.

347
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,920
Floral garden?

348
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,950
That's right.

349
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,960
It's not far from here, only 2 K.M.

350
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Sure.

351
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,600
My brain needs to rest before I go back to Bangkok.

352
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Sounds great.

353
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,280
We should get there after this.

354
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,840
Okay.

355
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,400
Let's eat.

356
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
You should eat something.

357
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,000
Good, I'll drop a pin of this location to Tian.

358
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,440
Sure, let's go.

359
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
Thanks.

360
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,440
Can I get shrimp with scrambled egg and shrimp sauce?

361
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,520
And iced Americano.

362
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,250
What'd like to eat?

363
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,440
Can I get

364
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,080
shrimp with holy basil?

365
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,800
Can I get extra shrimp?

366
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,360
Do they offer extra shrimp here?

367
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,920
Sure, anything for you.

368
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
What'd you like to drink?

369
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,360
Iced peach tea, please.

370
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,080
Mild sweet.

371
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Okay.

372
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,660
That's it.

373
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,120
Tian and her girlfriend should be here later.

374
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,520
They look so relaxed.

375
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,360
You should rest.

376
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,760
If you're exhausted, you can just rest.

377
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,120
It's not that simple.

378
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,040
I've got a lot to do.

379
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,720
You can make it simple.

380
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,400
We need to rest when we're too exhausted.

381
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,160
Or when you're stressed out, you need to destress.

382
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
You can talk to me

383
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,760
when work is too much for you.

384
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,520
I'm a good listener.

385
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,160
It's another way to destress.

386
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,800
You're cute.

387
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,920
Thanks.

388
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,520
I'll try to do as you suggested.

389
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,360
Wake up!

390
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,360
10 more minutes.

391
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,280
Wake up!

392
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,000
Tian! / Just wait.

393
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,840
Are we gonna go or not?

394
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,400
Nope, a little bit more.

395
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,120
Open your eyes to see this.

396
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,440
Come on, up! / Ow!

397
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,280
Here, take a look at this.

398
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,280
Prey is hanging out with your friend all alone, see?

399
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,580
See? / What?

400
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,760
She's hanging out with Fierce? / Yes.

401
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,160
Alone? / That's right.

402
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,880
You need to take a shower! Now! / Wait a second.

403
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,960
I already took a shower, and got dressed.

404
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,090
What about you?

405
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah? / Okay.

406
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,200
Wait for me. 10 minutes. / Just go!

407
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,300
Hurry up. / Be right back.

408
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,640
Earl agreed to come here with me

409
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,440
because you wanted to check out flowers

410
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,160
or found new business pattern.

411
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,880
Both of them.

412
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,080
It'd be better if there're floral gardens like this in Bangkok.

413
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,320
It's too bad

414
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,840
I can't find somewhere like this in Bangkok.

415
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,490
If you really want a land,

416
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:18,730
I think

417
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,000
I can find it for you.

418
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,520
That couple is so cute

419
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
they're hanging out before heading back to Bangkok.

420
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:50,770
Fierce?

421
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,600
Sinee's calling

422
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,640
I need to pick up this call.

423
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,580
Okay. / Well,

424
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,960
you don't need to follow me, I'll be right back.

425
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,080
Hello, Prey.

426
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Hello.

427
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,680
You called at the right time.

428
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,680
I looked for an excuse to ditch someone.

429
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,560
I should go back around 11 o'clock.

430
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,680
I should be home by one or two in the afternoon.

431
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,480
Sure.

432
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,720
I'll cook something for you.

433
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:35,440
Your favorite dishes.

434
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,480
Do you want Uncle Khum to go and pick you up?

435
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,280
No need to

436
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,960
I can go back with Tian.

437
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,000
Okay, enjoy.

438
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Talk to you later.

439
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,800
See you in the afternoon.

440
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,080
You seemed so chipper.

441
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,200
Prey's coming back today.

442
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,280
That's right, this afternoon.

443
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,320
She sounded so happy.

444
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,180
It shouldn't be any problem.

445
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,000
That's great,

446
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,500
so lively.

447
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,640
I need to cook something for her.

448
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,680
I'll cook her favorite dishes.

449
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,520
Sure, just go.

450
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,560
I need to continue on this Sherlock Holmes.

451
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,840
Got it.

452
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,640
I hope you're truly happy, Prey.

453
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,310
Earl?

454
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,840
Earl?

455
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,220
Earl,

456
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,480
Hello.

457
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Hello.

458
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,520
You're here by yourself?

459
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,640
I'm here with Fierce.

460
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,920
You two seem to get closer.

461
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,170
Good for you.

462
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,680
You're not walking with her?

463
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,610
I took a walk first

464
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,560
and she should follow me here in a minute.

465
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,120
And..

466
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,920
where's your someone?

467
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Kong needed to talk about work.

468
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,200
I can keep you company

469
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,080
until our persons

470
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,960
come here, okay?

471
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Sure.

472
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,920
You knew about it, right?

473
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,650
About what?

474
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,320
That I like you.

475
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,260
Perhaps.

476
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,250
I told you that already,

477
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,040
on the day that we went to shop together.

478
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,520
I bought a perfume called Love Don't Be Shy

479
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,239
and you didn't notice anything?

480
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,440
You didn't know how much I like you?

481
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,600
It's totally different.

482
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,000
Buying perfume has nothing to do

483
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,239
with any of this.

484
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,320
It wasn't exactly related.

485
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,160
I just wanted you to know

486
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,100
that I did what I did

487
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,920
because I tried to tell you how much I like you.

488
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,800
Why do you like me?

489
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,880
Did I do something to show my affection?

490
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,500
We just met.

491
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,160
You didn't know me well enough.

492
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,720
How could you like me?

493
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,840
It's because you're beautiful.

494
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,600
Just because of my look?

495
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,560
Not entirely.

496
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,040
There're millions of beautiful people on this planet.

497
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,160
But I only care for you.

498
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,360
What do you see in me?

499
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,400
We need a reason

500
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,000
to be interested

501
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,040
in a person?

502
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,120
Are you sure

503
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,360
that you really like me?

504
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
If you don't love her,

505
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,080
why did you do this to her?

506
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm sorry.

507
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,360
I really can't reciprocate your feeling.

508
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,480
I don't think we can't be in a relationship.

509
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,080
Please don't have any feeling for me.

510
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,160
We can be just acquaintances.

511
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,010
If you're not sure about this,

512
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,600
then stay away from her.

513
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,360
Are you interested in my offer?

514
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
What offer?

515
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,160
You can just

516
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,080
do anything to keep your girl away from Prey.

517
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
And I

518
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,960
will make Prey forget all about this.

519
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,210
What do you think?

520
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
Are you in?

521
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,280
Why would someone like me

522
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,650
be interested in your offer?

523
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,400
Because you fall in love with her already.

524
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
You don't want to lose her, do you?

525
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,200
Enemies of enemies

526
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,520
are friends, right?

527
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Sure.

528
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I'm in.

529
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,970
Let's go.

530
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Earl.

531
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,250
No matter what you think of me,

532
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
or who you love,

533
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,960
just remember

534
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,160
that you always have me.

535
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,800
Wow!

536
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,280
After you heard that she's gonna be home,

537
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,800
you only cooked her favorite dishes.

538
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,560
It's nothing.

539
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,680
There're some of your favorite dishes too.

540
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,320
Right,

541
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,620
what if Prey

542
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,480
fell in love with someone she shouldn't fall for,

543
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,680
what would you say?

544
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,880
Someone she shouldn't fall in love with?

545
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,000
Like me and you.

546
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,800
I grew up in this palace

547
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,640
it's already my honor

548
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,500
to have a chance

549
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,960
to take care of you.

550
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Come on now.

551
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Sinee,

552
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,100
what we have isn't just destiny.

553
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,120
You've taken such a good care of me

554
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,920
so I fell so much

555
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,160
in love with you and care for you.

556
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,160
Sir?

557
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,480
Prey, Tian and Milinth are here.

558
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,520
Well, I should welcome them.

559
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,540
Just go.

560
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060
Ms.Prey?

561
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,600
Everyone?

562
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,440
Would you like to eat now? We're ready.

563
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,280
I'm sorry.

564
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,000
I need to lie down.

565
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,120
I'm really exhausted.

566
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,440
Tian?

567
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,440
Can you tell me the truth?

568
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm not asking

569
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,280
what happened

570
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,760
because I know

571
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,160
that you tried your best.

572
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,200
If you're not asking,

573
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,080
how can we find out about this?

574
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,600
When you think it's the right time,

575
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,120
just tell me.

576
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,400
Heartbroken.

577
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,840
She got her heart broken.

578
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,320
She fell in love with someone who didn't love her back.

579
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,560
And you

580
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,120
let that person get away with this?

581
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,880
She slapped them hard.

582
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,000
And she took her home right away.

583
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,880
She warned them to stay away from Prey.

584
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,440
You must be so exhausted.

585
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,280
Thank you, dear.

586
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,130
I….

587
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm sorry.

588
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
It's fine.

589
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,760
The damage is done.

590
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:43,000
Now we need to think of what to do next.

591
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,400
I think we need to find something for her to do.

592
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,840
Something that you like.

593
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:48,810
Okay?

594
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,120
To keep her busy

595
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,130
so she won't think about it.

596
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,560
I….

597
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,560
I can't think of anything at the moment.

598
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,600
She likes to bake.

599
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,140
That's right.

600
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,040
She likes to bake so

601
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,480
we should organize a baking contest for her.

602
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,480
Sounds great.

603
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,920
Sinee can take care of Prey,

604
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
what do you think?

605
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,920
Good idea, I'll handle this.

606
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,460
Tian,

607
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,360
can you be a big sponsor for this event?

608
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,680
My grandmother,

609
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,120
I just fell for her

610
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,840
because she looked like you, right?

611
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,280
And she felt the same way as me.

612
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,720
We didn't really love each other, right?

613
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,840
Why did I feel like dying?

614
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,940
What's this?

615
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,280
Cloud wooden bed?

616
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,560
It referred to M.J. Sasinapa, didn't it?

617
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,360
Tell me the truth now.

618
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,920
I know that you love my daughter

619
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,400
and you can die for her.

620
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,920
You should know that

621
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,960
woman loving another woman

622
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,600
can't show their love publicly.

623
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,800
It's against the norms.

624
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,720
My daughter will be in pain

625
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,760
whether this type of love

626
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,360
is fulfilled or disappointed.

627
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,040
Mother,

628
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,280
my sister loves M.J. Sasinapa so much that

629
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,960
she ordered a bed as a wedding gift.

630
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:57,080
Please call off the engagement of her and M.J. Paksathorn.

631
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,040
Otherwise,

632
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,680
she will be sorrow for sure.

633
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,440
I know

634
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,320
but she will live like hell

635
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,840
if she gets married to that family.

636
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,760
What would both of us

637
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,880
tell the fathers?

638
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,300
If we tell them the truth

639
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,200
your sister won't be able to face anyone.

640
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,160
I can take care of her.

641
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,250
I'd rather have a spinster sister

642
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,560
than having a sorrowful one.

643
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,200
Moreover,

644
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,840
we can't let people from Sittalrat Palace

645
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,400
to get closer to her anymore.

646
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,600
How can you let this go so far?

647
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,000
Please, madame.

648
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,560
I really had no idea that they

649
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,440
would fall in love and plan to run away together.

650
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,560
My daughter is about to get married to the perfect man.

651
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,520
I won't let this stupid type of love ruin everything.

652
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,450
Tell me.

653
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,120
When are they planning to leave and how?

654
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,400
She planned to run away the day before her marriage.

655
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,000
And by boat.

656
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,720
Oh my goodness!

657
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,720
Why didn't you choose the heaven path?

658
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,840
Why did you choose to go to hell?

659
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,720
You forced me to do what I didn't want to.

660
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,520
To protect Sittalrat Family.

661
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,140
Not love me.

662
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,040
Just acquaintances.

663
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,400
You're so mean, Earl!

664
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,520
Ms.Prey,

665
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,040
everyone has their own

666
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,120
forms of love.

667
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,280
Why is my type of love

668
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,880
full of tears?

669
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,960
Before sadness

670
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,120
comes happiness.

671
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:56,520
It's up to us to choose

672
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,480
if we'd be selfish in love

673
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,040
to own someone

674
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
or we could

675
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,520
be valued in love.

676
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,000
Be valued in love.

677
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,380
That's right.

678
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:14,640
We didn't get

679
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,600
our love back,

680
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,760
but we can still smile

681
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,440
when we see them happy.

682
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,160
Don't let your love die with sorrow.

683
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,760
You should give yourself a chance

684
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,200
and use your love

685
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,160
to bring back your happiness.

686
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,360
I believe that

687
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,440
someone you love

688
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,250
must be a good person.

689
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,370
Yes.

690
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,960
She never lied to me.

691
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,840
She always told me

692
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,680
that we can't be together.

693
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,240
Right.

694
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,360
You don't have to cry

695
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,160
over someone who doesn't see you.

696
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,520
I get that

697
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
but my heart is longing for her.

698
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,360
It still misses her.

699
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
It still hurts.

700
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:43,160
I hurt so much I feel like I'm dying.

701
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,920
Oh my dear,

702
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:53,360
please stop crying.

703
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:54,960
It's okay.

704
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,120
It's gonna be okay.
