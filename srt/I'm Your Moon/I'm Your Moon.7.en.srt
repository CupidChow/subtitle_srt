1
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,240
What's up, handsome?

2
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,000
I heard you did so many nasty things.

3
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,640
News travels fast, I guess.

4
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,039
I really admire your effort.

5
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,479
But it's such a waste

6
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,759
and it ruins your reputation.

7
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,200
You're trying too hard.

8
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,720
Why are you calling me?

9
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,560
You're trying to mess with me?

10
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,360
Nope. I just want to tell you that

11
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,800
our deal remains the same.

12
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,759
But I'll use the cleaner way to do so.

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,640
You said that I used dirty way?

14
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,840
I hate you.

15
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
Kassakorn, you bitch!

16
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
I'll do anything

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,200
to steal Prey from you.

18
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,400
You…

19
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,680
must really like Earl.

20
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Earl?

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Our parents didn't just matchmake us

22
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,160
for business purpose only.

23
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,440
She's someone I love.

24
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Morning, grandpa. / Good morning.

25
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,250
How're you doing?

26
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,360
You're here altogether?

27
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I can't reach her.

28
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,250
I'm worried about her so I came here to see her.

29
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,150
She is grounded.

30
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,560
Grounded? / Grounded?

31
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,000
When will she call?

32
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,480
Is everything okay?

33
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
It's fine.

34
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Nothing.

35
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,480
You seemed so worried about something.

36
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Just a little.

37
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,650
What about your boyfriend?

38
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
My what?

39
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Andy. How is he?

40
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
Well..

41
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,560
I..

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,880
He's good.

43
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,480
Just like every couple, nothing special.

44
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,120
You look cute when you're blushing.

45
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,480
About a new hospital

46
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,650
opening party of Kong tomorrow,

47
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,560
can you send someone on behalf of me?

48
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,250
Are you sure?

49
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,920
You didn't attend his event last time either.

50
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,320
Mr.Kong even plans to visit

51
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,200
the event himself.

52
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,400
He's here already?

53
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,600
He's been flying all the time these days.

54
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
Tian?

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,650
Hello? How're you?

56
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm at Utsanakhorn Palace.

57
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,050
She…

58
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
She's grounded. / What?

59
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,440
How so?

60
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,440
Her grandpa finds out about everything.

61
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,360
And it upsets him

62
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,650
that you're from Sittalrat Family.

63
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,560
Tian, please?

64
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,050
I really need your help this time.

65
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,680
I really need to meet Prey.

66
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,000
Please ? I beg you.

67
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,960
You know that we can't fall in love with men.

68
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,480
You were the one who told me

69
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,920
to choose the path that we want.

70
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,920
With Sittalrat's honor,

71
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,250
I won't make Prey cry.

72
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,240
Fine. I get it.

73
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,680
You keep pushing me like this

74
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
there must be something in exchange.

75
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,800
If you can do it,

76
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,880
I'll give you 3-star hotel project in Krabi.

77
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,360
That's more like it, my old pal.

78
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,000
She lives up to her name.

79
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,680
Grandpa,

80
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,440
Prey has been sad for days.

81
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,960
Actually, what happened with older generations

82
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,200
shouldn't have anything to do with the younger one.

83
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,360
But this feud has passed on from generation to generation.

84
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,840
I saw my dad

85
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,880
suffer

86
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
from losing his sister.

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,440
M.J. Piangrawee ?

88
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,760
That's right.

89
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,920
I don't know if it's karma or curse

90
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,280
that Kassakorn looks just like my aunt.

91
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
They're like the same person.

92
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,880
And our Prey

93
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,000
looks just like

94
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
M.J.Sasinapa Sittalrat.

95
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,680
They weren't happy in love in the past,

96
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,080
maybe they came back

97
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
to make up for their tragic history.

98
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,200
They were in love?

99
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,400
That's right, they were in love.

100
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,920
And I believe

101
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,760
that they will do whatever it takes

102
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,840
to see each other again

103
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,760
just like they did.

104
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,080
In the past,

105
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,400
they underestimated their love.

106
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,800
Sir?

107
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
I believe that

108
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,800
you're open-minded enough

109
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,650
to embrace your granddaughter's love.

110
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,250
Please don't let dispute in the past

111
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,800
haunt your granddaughter in this lifetime.

112
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,000
Grandpa.

113
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,000
Please stop grounded her.

114
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,040
Can this feud

115
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,920
stop at your generation?

116
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,480
What about this?

117
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,720
Please leave me here alone

118
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,280
to think, okay?

119
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,540
sure.

120
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,070
Prey.

121
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,160
How're you? / Milinth?

122
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,120
Tian and I are trying to talk to your grandpa.

123
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,800
I hope that he

124
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,640
would give your phone back.

125
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,680
I don't get it.

126
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,680
Earl is from Sittalrat,

127
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,680
why did he keep us away?

128
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,520
It's hard to say.

129
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
But your grandpa listened to us.

130
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,400
Really? / Yep.

131
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,600
I just found out

132
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,720
that it was that bad.

133
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,290
I won't be surprised if they would hate each other that much.

134
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,600
But it's not your fault

135
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,440
to be in love with Earl.

136
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
I know.

137
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,440
Love is pure

138
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,360
it has no right or wrong,

139
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,360
it has no genders or families.

140
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,920
People from Utsanakhorn

141
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,760
can fall in love with people from Sittalrat,

142
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
trust me on this.

143
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,360
Thank you for trying to calm me down.

144
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,510
It's gonna be okay.

145
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,440
I heard that you want your phone back?

146
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,840
No, I didn't.

147
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,600
I want to be with Earl.

148
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,600
As what?

149
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,160
As her lover.

150
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,680
I heard that she's engaged to someone.

151
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,120
But she promised me

152
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,480
that she'd tell Kong

153
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
that she didn't love men directly.

154
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Well,

155
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,400
if she can do that,

156
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,360
that I'm happy for her.

157
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,560
And I'm ready to embrace Kassakorn to our palace.

158
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Really?

159
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,250
I love you the most.

160
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,120
Stop it right now.

161
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,760
I am spoiling you

162
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,800
but it doesn't mean that

163
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
I will let you sleep over

164
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
withour Tian.

165
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,920
Remember that I'm worried about you so much.

166
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
I know.

167
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,040
I pray for all holy spirits around the world,

168
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
angels who protect this palace,

169
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,440
and angels who stay in heaven and earth,

170
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,080
who have heard

171
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,520
wishes and curses

172
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,680
from our ancestors

173
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,960
to make them come true.

174
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:58,080
Right now, I, M.R. Assakorn

175
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,520
Utsanakhorn

176
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,440
would like to stop those curses

177
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,720
that have been made.

178
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,160
I'd like to stop hatred

179
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,360
and karma

180
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,960
towards Sittalrat

181
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,650
from now on.

182
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,860
Is she here?

183
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,840
She's waiting in the library.

184
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
I'm so happy that I can go out with you

185
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,400
with no worries.

186
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,040
It's not that easy, darling.

187
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,109
Why's that?

188
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,050
It's an order.

189
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,260
An order?

190
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,500
Fine, you have my permission.

191
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,080
Thank you so much, sir.

192
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
But

193
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,080
Milinth and Tian need to tag along.

194
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,520
You all are women

195
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,800
but Prey is so young.

196
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,480
I feel so much comfortable

197
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,280
if Tian and Milinth are there too.

198
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,120
Tian?

199
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,650
That's right.

200
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,960
You got a problem with that?

201
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
I..

202
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,440
Nope. No problems at all, sir.

203
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,800
Easy-peasy.

204
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,200
Tian is always hanging out with us.

205
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,760
Are you sure about that?

206
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,780
Yep.

207
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,920
But she will be playing it hard.

208
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,600
Well, I'm rooting for you

209
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,800
because you need to beg her

210
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,720
otherwise, you can't go on a date with me.

211
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,990
Fine.

212
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,280
I will try my best.

213
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,320
Let me recharge it for you.

214
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,640
Come on, I walk you to the car.

215
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,120
Okay.

216
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,560
Sure, grandpa.

217
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Got it.

218
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,960
Okay.

219
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,200
I'll take care of it.

220
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
Grandpa? What's going on?

221
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,730
It's not that easy

222
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,880
to be related to us, Earl.

223
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,720
Who're you talking to? Your guardian angel?

224
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,840
Oh, come on, don't distract me.

225
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
See?

226
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,800
She calls me right away.

227
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,520
You crazy friend.

228
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,600
Hello. / I..

229
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,810
Well..

230
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,640
You want to go on a date with my sister, don't you?

231
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,840
And I need to be there too.

232
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
Am I right?

233
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,840
Yep, how did you know?

234
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
What's going on?

235
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,400
Are you coming?

236
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,360
If not, then I'll hang up.

237
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,360
Fine, but you

238
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,560
need to beg me.

239
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,400
You can't just order me around.

240
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,470
Fine.

241
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,600
My lovely Tian,

242
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,120
please go on a trip with me and Prey.

243
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,760
Please my lovely Tian.

244
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
Please, please, please.

245
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm begging you.

246
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,800
I'm praying.

247
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,960
That's more like it.

248
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,400
Kassakorn.

249
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,040
So you're coming or not.

250
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Sure,

251
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,760
my soon-to-be an in-law.

252
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,960
Not a problem.

253
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
But

254
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,840
where are we going?

255
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,850
So cute.

256
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Do it properly.

257
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,280
Why're you here?

258
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,880
I'm waiting for you.

259
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,720
Why're you waiting for me?

260
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,480
I have something for you.

261
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,920
I love you.

262
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,960
And I love you.

263
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,720
How long are you gonna keep staring at my face?

264
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,200
Are you real?

265
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,160
What did you say?

266
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,560
To be with you like this,

267
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,960
it's like a dream comes true.

268
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,000
Can you hear my heartbeat?

269
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,400
Of course, I can.

270
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,960
It's so loud.

271
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,400
What about my body? Is it warm?

272
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,150
So warm.

273
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,600
Very warm.

274
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,440
It's the proof

275
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,200
that I'm real.

276
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
You know what?

277
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,880
When you were not around,

278
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,120
my world was so empty.

279
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,520
Thank you

280
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,680
for loving me this much.

281
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
And I need to thank you too,

282
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,440
for coming into my life.

283
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,440
Thank you for being my whole world.

284
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,280
And I need to thank you

285
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,720
for making me realize

286
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,520
how much I can love someone.

287
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,200
Stop being too cute.

288
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,800
Or you won't get any sleep tonight.

289
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,920
I want to wake up and see you

290
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,050
every morning.

291
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,120
Hang in there.

292
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,640
I'll make your dream come true.

293
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,760
Hello. / Hello, Thir.

294
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,370
Can you clear out your and my

295
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,480
schedule and call Kong for me?

296
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
Got it.

297
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,600
Mine as well? / Yep.

298
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,440
I can clear out the schedule for you.

299
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,240
But let me ask you something,

300
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,760
where are we going?

301
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,680
We're going to France in three days.

302
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,920
Sure, booking first class as usual?

303
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,120
As you wish.

304
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,520
Got it, I'll pick you up this Sunday.

305
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,000
It's almost over.

306
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,520
I miss you so much

307
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,880
You need to be there

308
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,320
for almost a week?

309
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,520
That's right.

310
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,960
I'll be there for 4-5 days, including traveling days.

311
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,640
I must be so lonely.

312
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,560
Do you trust me?

313
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
I do.

314
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,280
Don't worry about me.

315
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,960
Thir will be there with me.

316
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,120
I'll text you

317
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,480
when I reach Paris.

318
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,360
Thank you so much

319
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,760
for going all this troubles for me.

320
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,720
I do it for our love.

321
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,160
And I hope that Kong would understand.

322
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,080
I hope so too.

323
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,840
Please hurry back to me.

324
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,480
I need to head outside to the bow.

325
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,320
I'm afraid it won't be any receptions.

326
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,400
I'll keep texting you when I have a chance.

327
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,680
Don't worry.

328
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,500
Send me some pics of you at the bow of the yacht.

329
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,000
Sure thing, I'll send you the pics.

330
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,880
You don't like yachts?

331
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Nothing.

332
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,880
I just feel weird like I would fall all the time.

333
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
Earl?

334
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,160
Do you want to look around the yacht?

335
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,920
It's so pretty inside.

336
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,160
It's fine. I want to hang out here.

337
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,000
I bet that if you look around inside,

338
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,000
you will love it for sure.

339
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,560
Especially the bedroom,

340
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,600
the designer was inspired from

341
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,120
your dad.

342
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,880
Well, I guess I can have a look.

343
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,640
That's great, please follow me.

344
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Right.

345
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,680
Mr.Shun? / Yes?

346
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,050
Can you take Thir to look around?

347
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,050
And you can follow me inside after a while.

348
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,090
Got it.

349
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Let's go.

350
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,440
Soon

351
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:58,360
we both will meet so often.

352
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Yeah?

353
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,680
Well, our bosses

354
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,440
will get married soon.

355
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,820
And we will meet so often.

356
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,000
Excuse me,

357
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,560
I already have a boyfriend.

358
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,719
It's getting lonely when it's raining like this.

359
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,280
Of course, you do. Rain comes with grey

360
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,679
and grey symbolizes loneliness.

361
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
What is Earl doing now?

362
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,560
She could have fun time on the yacht,

363
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,400
she could go fishing or

364
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,080
enjoying beautiful view in the middle of the sea.

365
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,920
Why hasn't she send anything to me?

366
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,760
Where is Thir?

367
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,760
Earl?

368
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,320
He's having dinner inside the yacht.

369
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,800
Do you need something else?

370
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,280
That's it. I don't want anything else.

371
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,280
Well, you don't want anything else,

372
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,920
I still have something for you.

373
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,170
This is for you.

374
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Thank you.

375
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Will you marry me?

376
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,040
I'm sorry. I can't accept it.

377
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,400
Actually, do I have a choice?

378
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,880
I…. / If you ask me,

379
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,520
then I'd say no.

380
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,160
But I don't have any choice right now.

381
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,960
From now on, it's up to you to decide what we are.

382
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,440
I'm done.

383
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,400
Excuse me.

384
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
Sure.

385
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,810
Earl!

386
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,840
Earl!

387
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,760
What's going on?

388
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,360
The storm is hitting us, you need to go with me now.

389
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Wear this.

390
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,280
If we can make it to shore,

391
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,880
I'll deal with them. They should have told us about the storm.

392
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Hurry!

393
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,130
Sir?

394
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,880
What is it? What's with the rush?

395
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,360
The help forgot to close the windows.

396
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,480
The storm hits us and her portrait falls on the floor.

397
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,120
It was shattered to pieces.

398
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,480
Prey?

399
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,060
Great-grandma!

400
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,010
Great-grandma!

401
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,640
Grandpa! Sinee!

402
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,250
Her portrait fell.

403
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,440
Great-grandma!

404
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,240
Prey, oh dear.

405
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,360
Great-grandma!

406
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:07,360
What should I do?

407
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,800
Whatever will be, will be.

408
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,360
No one can stop

409
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,240
wheel of karma.

410
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,160
But I believe that

411
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,680
karma always brings justice.

412
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,440
Great-grandma!

413
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,840
Great-grandma!

414
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,280
Great-grandma!

415
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,880
What should I do? / I'll take care of it.

416
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,880
Please calm down.

417
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,720
You're here.

418
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,720
I'll prepare prawn congee for you.

419
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,640
No fried garlic, okay?

420
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,800
Thank you.

421
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,840
Hot news! Officers and shore patrol

422
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,160
in France

423
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,640
can save the crew.... / What is it?

424
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,880
Turn the volume up.

425
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Got it.

426
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,000
The storm in Cannes hit the yacht,

427
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,520
speed 207 kmph.

428
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:35,300
From the incident, we found out

429
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
that there were

430
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,080
two Thai millionaires on board.

431
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:43,120
They are Mr.Kong Kidakorn,

432
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,360
the owner of Tahwang Pharmaceuticals,

433
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,680
and his fiancée,

434
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:52,200
M.L.Kassakorn Sittalrat,

435
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,400
including 9 crew members.

436
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,940
Oh my!

437
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,520
Prey! Sir!

438
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,500
Tar, where're you?

439
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,200
Come here right now, Prey is fainted.

440
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,840
Prey!

441
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,100
Hey

442
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,160
Hey, are you okay?

443
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,160
Can you hear me?

444
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,020
Hey

445
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,320
Hey, are you okay?

446
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,000
Oh my god!

447
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,440
You're not dead yet.

448
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,760
You okay?

449
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,200
I know that you're crazy about my sister

450
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,440
but you should have controlled yourself.

451
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,000
This is unlike you.

452
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,560
So you don't hear about it, do you?

453
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,640
I don't want to hear anything about you.

454
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,480
And I don't want to talk to you.

455
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,480
Are you gonna walk out here by yourself or should I call someone?

456
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,440
You can be mad at me all you want

457
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,050
but you need to listen to this. / I won't.

458
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:45,160
Kwang, call security to drag her out of here.

459
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,800
Listen to me carefully.

460
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,320
M.L.Kassakorn Sittalrat was in a shipwreck in France.

461
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,000
They still can't find her body.

462
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,000
Use your thick skull to think.

463
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,160
What would Prey react if she found out about this?

464
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,720
Kwang, check it for me.

465
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,560
Yes, boss.

466
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,040
You're up?

467
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,650
This is yours.

468
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,480
You can speak Thai?

469
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,780
That's right.

470
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,560
I heard you talked Thai in your sleep.

471
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,050
My mom is Thai.

472
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,360
How did I get here?

473
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,480
This is my dad's vacation house.

474
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,960
It's on a private island.

475
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,650
Trust me.

476
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,040
I'm not a bad person.

477
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,320
I saw you lying on the beach.

478
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,560
It's good that you didn't hurt much.

479
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,040
Otherwise, I needed to take you the mainland

480
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,600
to see a doctor.

481
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,600
How many days have I passed out?

482
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,320
Just a day.

483
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,840
Actually,

484
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,800
I'm here to ask

485
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,480
if you're Ms.Kassakorn.

486
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,280
They're searching for you.

487
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,320
Don't tell them.

488
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,920
Please? / Are you sure?

489
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,600
I....

490
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:58,250
It's fine.

491
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,080
I'll help you as much as I can.

492
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,480
You can stay here as long as you want.

493
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:07,960
Thank you.

494
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,760
I'll trouble you as little as I can.

495
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,600
No worries.

496
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,120
My name is Marlinth.

497
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,320
It's nice to meet you.

498
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,000
You're…. ? / Earl.

499
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,040
Nice to meet you.

500
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,200
How is she?

501
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,400
She's lying in bed so still.

502
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,360
She's crying all the time.

503
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:56,480
Since she heard the news,

504
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,240
she hasn't eaten anything.

505
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,120
It's been two days.

506
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,360
I…. I'm scared.

507
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,480
No need to be scared.

508
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,400
If I'm still alive, I won't let

509
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,050
anything happen to her.

510
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,680
Sir?

511
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,120
Is it because that

512
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:21,620
we

513
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,200
we cared so much about their happiness

514
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,520
and we neglected ancestors' wishes?

515
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,290
This is how they punished her… / Sinee

516
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,280
We need to believe in power of love.

517
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,720
Love will conquer rage.

518
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,520
But this type of love

519
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,280
destroys everything.

520
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,120
One person is nowhere to be found

521
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,600
and another person

522
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,080
is like she's dead already.

523
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,090
I'm scared

524
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,920
I'm scared that Prey will end up

525
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,920
like M.J.Sasinapa.

526
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,360
I can't live with that. / Sinee!

527
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,960
We can't change the past,

528
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,440
but we can create the future.

529
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,160
We need to create hope for Prey

530
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:23,960
that Earl will be back soon.

531
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,600
How? How so?

532
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,640
I see no way out of this.

533
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,360
Well, we need to separate Prey from

534
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,250
Utsanakhorn and Sittalrat.

535
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,560
We need to take her

536
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,840
to a place where her hope lies.

537
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,960
A resort of Tian's friend.

538
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,080
Do you think this is a good idea for her?

539
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,920
I'm not so sure

540
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,080
but it's better than

541
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,520
her being drown in sorrow at Utsanakhorn Palace.

542
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,440
But….Earl made her cry

543
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:26,640
at Fierce's hotel.

544
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,480
That's right.

545
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,250
She was so sad that

546
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,160
Earl refused to be in a relationship with her.

547
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:40,600
But she got her first kiss from someone she loves.

548
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,270
That's right.

549
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,130
Who would forget

550
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,400
their first kiss place.

551
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,600
Right,

552
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,120
Andy also confessed his love to Thir there.

553
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,080
And he had no idea

554
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,160
that Thir disappeared along with Earl.

555
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,980
Hey!

556
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,160
You haven't told him yet?

557
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:10,600
That her boyfriend went missing?

558
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,880
Yeah, I haven't told him.

559
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,050
He's on tour

560
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,680
so I wouldn't dare.

561
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,780
I…. / You didn't want to

562
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,400
or you only think about benefits.

563
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:29,440
That's right.

564
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,250
I care about benefits.

565
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,880
But I also care about your feeling.

566
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,100
My feeling?

567
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,050
Then why didn't you tell me?

568
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,800
Because I know how much you love Thir.

569
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,560
And I'm scared

570
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,360
that if you heard about the news

571
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,920
you'd be depressed like Prey.

572
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,560
You think that I can stand to see someone I love

573
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,200
like my two siblings

574
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,920
to be suffered like that?

575
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,000
What do you want me to do?

576
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,920
What if something happened to him?

577
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,320
I can't keep singing for sure.

578
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,040
You gotta have hope.

579
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,760
Someone could save him.

580
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,360
It's been three days only.

581
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,420
Three days.

582
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,520
Three days!

583
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,600
He could survive somewhere.

584
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:06,920
Hey,

585
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,520
I need to take a long vacation leave.

586
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,920
What?

587
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,080
I need to search for my boyfriend. / What?

588
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,280
See you later. / Wait, Andy.

589
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,460
Hey,

590
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,680
just let him go.

591
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,800
I believe that

592
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,880
if it was me who went missing,

593
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,560
you would be in pain just like him right now.

594
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,640
Earl.

595
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:55,100
Kanthir.

596
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,560
You need to survive

597
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,920
for people that you love.

598
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,560
I wish we could meet again

599
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,320
so I can love you one more time.

600
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,600
Earl is like a light

601
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,120
to guide my life.

602
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,720
All of a sudden,

603
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,560
that light is gone.

604
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,840
Why don't

605
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,080
you stay here with me?
