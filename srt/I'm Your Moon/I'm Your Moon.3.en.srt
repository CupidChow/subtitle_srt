1
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
Can we do barbecued ribs,

2
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,200
Australian Angus Chuck Roll steak, spaghetti and meatballs,

3
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,440
and spaghetti carbonara?

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,600
And… / Can I get macaroni and cheese please?

5
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,200
That's right, one mac and cheese.

6
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,400
Hey,

7
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,200
if you can't eat it all, you need to pay.

8
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
Come on,

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,600
you told me that it's your treat.

10
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,840
One Caesar salad.

11
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,320
One glass of water and two glasses of orange juice please.

12
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
That's all.

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,480
I'll eat them all.

14
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Tian.

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,040
I need to talk to you.

16
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,680
Can we talk outside?

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Sure.

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,079
You know that we have dispute with Utsanakhorn Palace.

19
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
Why did you set me up with Prey?

20
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Earl.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,200
My aunt was married to Utsanakhorn as well.

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,120
Are you gonna end our friendship because of this?

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,480
It's different.

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,400
It happened such a long time ago.

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,760
It should have ended two generations before you already.

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,560
Does Prey know who I am?

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
She doesn't.

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,360
Or you want her to?

29
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Come on.

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,120
Think about it

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,840
Since you were born,

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,360
haven't you pleased your family members well enough?

33
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,040
We can barely be ourselves,

34
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,720
they decided what we needed to learn,

35
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,079
where to work,

36
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,840
we did everything we can for our families.

37
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,480
Have you tried for once

38
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,079
do something for yourself?

39
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,440
What're you trying to say?

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,880
It's been ages already.

41
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,480
The dispute should end in our generation.

42
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
If you don't like my sister,

43
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,280
I won't bring her along anymore.

44
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,120
She's just lonely

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,560
and she needs more friends.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,280
Is that too much to ask?

47
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,520
Tian! Earl!

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,000
Kanthir punched Andy at the set. / What?

49
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,120
For real? / Yeah.

50
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,360
It shouldn't be.

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,000
Kanthir is normally a calm person.

52
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
I'll be right there.

53
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Hey,

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
can I leave Prey with you?

55
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
We can talk about this later.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
Let's go. / Let's go.

57
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,360
Hello, Earl.

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,120
Hello.

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you mad at me?

60
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,360
Mad at you?

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,520
Why would I be mad at you, Ms. Prey?

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Why

63
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,800
were you so different from

64
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,000
when we first met at the restaurant?

65
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,080
Did I upset you or something?

66
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,159
Or you don't like something that I do?

67
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
No.

68
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,040
You didn't do anything, Ms.Prey.

69
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,440
Are you sure about that?

70
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm sure about that.

71
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,120
You didn't do anything wrong, Ms.Prey.

72
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
So…

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
If I didn't do anything wrong,

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
why didn't you talk to me informally like before?

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
Why did you talk so formally to me?

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,560
I didn't want to talk informally to you

77
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,120
because we're not that close.

78
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,240
If I talked informally to you,

79
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm afraid that I would be disrespectful to you.

80
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
But I allow it.

81
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,200
You can talk informally to me.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm happy when you did that rather than

83
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,640
calling me Ms.Prey.

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,040
Is that what you want?

85
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
This is what I want.

86
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,200
Fine.

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,040
I'll do that.

88
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,360
It seemed like

89
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,720
Tian asked you to hang out with me.

90
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,800
I'd like to ask you a favor

91
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,159
to drop me off at home again.

92
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Sure.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,080
It's about to rain soon.

94
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
Right.

95
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll give you a ride.

96
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,840
Yay! I'm so glad.

97
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,240
You're the best.

98
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,960
Please have lunch with me,

99
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,240
then we can go.

100
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,920
Okay.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,760
Pookie? What happened?

102
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Well….

103
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
I….

104
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Andy asked Thir to tie shoelaces for him

105
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,840
but Thir refused to do so. Then Andy said that

106
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,400
Thir always did anything his boss asked like

107
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,280
Thir was her servant dog.

108
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,400
Oh come on!

109
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,320
How could you call Thir like that?

110
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,960
I was away for a minute and you caused a scene already?

111
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,400
I'm so done with you.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,960
Why're you like this?

113
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,760
Well, it's true.

114
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
He never did anything I asked him to.

115
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,000
Unlike his boss,

116
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,760
he always did anything for her.

117
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,640
A person with big success

118
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,600
like you wouldn't know anything like this.

119
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,960
Keep that in your rotten mind.

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,520
If Ms.Earl asked me to die,

121
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,920
then I would do it.

122
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,240
I'll go check on him.

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,120
You!

124
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
You hit him at his weakest spot.

125
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,800
What spot? What is it?

126
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,560
What's up, Thir?

127
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Hello.

128
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,640
Is everything okay?

129
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,160
I want to sell you a house.

130
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
A house?

131
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Which one?

132
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,280
My house.

133
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,240
You have a money problem, haven't you?

134
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,920
My dad died a couple days ago.

135
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,080
And my mom needs radiotherapy. I don't have any money.

136
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,240
So I'd like to sell my house on consignment.

137
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
And…

138
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
when I have enough money

139
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,160
I'll pay back to you

140
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,120
and get my house back.

141
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,120
10 million. Is it enough to treat your mom?

142
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,520
My house is valued only 6 million.

143
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,440
It's okay.

144
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,280
You can have 10 million.

145
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,640
I'll stop by to see your mom after work today.

146
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
Thank you but…

147
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,440
I don't want to take your money.

148
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,360
I…

149
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,680
I'll get a job after I graduate and

150
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,920
I'll get my house back.

151
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,360
I didn't just give you money for nothing.

152
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,240
What about this?

153
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,320
You're a junior, right?

154
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
You'll be graduating next year, you can work for me.

155
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,040
I'll pay you.

156
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,440
About other expenses,

157
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,040
you can pay back by work for me and be loyal to me.

158
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,680
Thank you so much.

159
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,640
I'm so grateful.

160
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
From now on,

161
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,240
you're my boss.

162
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,920
If I found someone like Earl,

163
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,360
I'd have worked so hard and given her my own life too.

164
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,760
It's me.

165
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
I'm your sister, your help,

166
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,640
your boss, I'm everything to you.

167
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,040
You don't need to give me your own life.

168
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,800
I just want you to behave and be a good man.

169
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,080
Focus on your work, okay?

170
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,120
But..

171
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,360
I want to apologize to him

172
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
To Kanthir?

173
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
He's mature enough.

174
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,440
He'll remain calm after he's cooling down.

175
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,480
Then he'll turn to be a quiet guy.

176
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,880
I'm ready to apologize to him, please help me.

177
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Please?

178
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,520
Take me to see him so I can apologize.

179
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,240
Milinth,

180
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,200
should we stop shooting today?

181
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,360
Andy can go to see a doctor and rest.

182
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,760
Good, we should tell the director about this.

183
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,800
Well…

184
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
I…

185
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,760
I'm sorry.

186
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,960
If it's done for the day, I should go.

187
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,880
You can't.

188
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
What?

189
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,400
You need to give me a ride. / What?

190
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Well.

191
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,120
Didn't Earl send you to take care of me?

192
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,760
I haven't reached my place yet.

193
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,800
It means that

194
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,360
your job for today hasn't done yet.

195
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,240
You're so shameless.

196
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Whatever,

197
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,240
it's just taking care of a lonely boy and foul-mouthed boy.

198
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
Just dropping you off and I'm done, right?

199
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Hold a bag for me.

200
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,240
It's good to stay outside once in a while.

201
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,680
So refreshing.

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,960
If you like it,

203
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,040
I'll walk with you every day, okay?

204
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,040
Nothing is working properly when you're old.

205
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Right,

206
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,640
did you regret

207
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
marrying an old man like me?

208
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,280
Don't say that.

209
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm the lucky one

210
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,560
that you're so kind to me

211
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,720
and give me your love.

212
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
That's true.

213
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,680
Love is a beautiful thing

214
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,200
if it happens with the right person at the right time.

215
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Sir?

216
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,760
Did you know the truth?

217
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,960
About what happened to your aunt?

218
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
My mom told me that

219
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
people from that palace

220
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,560
were so mean to her.

221
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,000
When she's dead,

222
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,080
my grandma was furious

223
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,840
because she lost her beloved daughter.

224
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,000
She did nothing but cursed them.

225
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,080
And my dad

226
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,360
stopped seeing people from that palace.

227
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,080
He would do anything to get in their business and work

228
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,880
as much as he could.

229
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
So here's the story.

230
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,680
That's why Mr.Parawee

231
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,880
decided to be an ambassador overseas.

232
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,319
Parawee

233
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,280
is a peaceful guy

234
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,319
but he can't disobey my father

235
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,079
so he needed to go.

236
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,200
My lovely Prey is the one to suffer from these consequences.

237
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,119
She didn't get to be around her parents' love.

238
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,240
Don't you remember when Prey was young?

239
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,000
She refused to leave the palace.

240
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,760
I took her to England for less than five days.

241
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,040
And I needed to rush to bring her back.

242
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,200
When she was here

243
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,720
and met my aunt,

244
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,480
she was so happy

245
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,480
and she stopped crying.

246
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,840
Sir,

247
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,960
I feel bad for her.

248
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,280
When will the rage

249
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,080
from the past end?

250
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
We're here.

251
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
Thank you.

252
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,120
Earl?

253
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,840
Would you like to come inside?

254
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,520
I don't think so.

255
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,560
I need to go.

256
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:49,240
But it'll be just a minute, it won't take long.

257
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,600
I just want you to see something.

258
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,920
People from Utsanakhorn Palace won't welcome me.

259
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,640
Trust me on this.

260
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,600
Why's that? I'm inviting you.

261
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,200
That's because you don't know who I am.

262
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
So who are you anyways?

263
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,360
My name is M.L.Kassakorn Sittalrat

264
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
I should go.

265
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,280
It's such an honor to visit this place.

266
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
Thank you.

267
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,520
Sittalrat?

268
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,200
I'm back.

269
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,640
How was

270
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
your lunch with Tian?

271
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Was it fun?

272
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Here.

273
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm thinking of building a greenhouse

274
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,920
to breed rare plants.

275
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,000
If you're free, help me

276
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,000
choose which plants to grow.

277
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,960
I'll find out about it,

278
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,400
and I'll let you know.

279
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,240
About my lunch,

280
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,080
it's normal, nothing special.

281
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,080
Sir? / Yeah?

282
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,680
What about this one?

283
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,200
Grandpa. / Yeah?

284
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,040
What if I need answers of something?

285
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,840
Can I ask you?

286
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,000
What is it that you'd like to know?

287
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,520
Perhaps I could give you an answer.

288
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,360
Why didn't we

289
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,640
like people from Sittalrat?

290
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,440
Because they

291
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
are mean people.

292
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,440
Why are they so mean? Mean to who?

293
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,120
To a person in that portrait

294
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,280
the one that you talk with every day.

295
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
They…

296
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,880
caused the early passing of great-grandmother, didn't they?

297
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,240
I'll let you know when it's time.

298
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,560
Excuse me.

299
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,600
You're working late like this

300
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,120
because something is bothering you, isn't it?

301
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,000
Earl Grey tea? / That's right.

302
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,960
Earl Grey drip tea from Sri Lanka.

303
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,360
It tasted so simple.

304
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,440
It tasted simple but

305
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,520
it's strong and bitter,

306
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,800
pairing with sugar-coated cookies

307
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,600
and it boosts your energy.

308
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,360
More importantly,

309
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,760
it's your favorite childhood snack.

310
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,360
Can you tell me about my grandma and the person she loved?

311
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,640
M.J. Sasinapa and M.J. Piangrawee

312
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,360
were so close

313
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,920
more than friends.

314
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,000
M.J. Piangrawee

315
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,960
almost became a daughter-in-law of Sittalrat Palace.

316
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
But….

317
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,600
back in the day,

318
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,480
society didn't accept it when woman loves another woman.

319
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,920
They didn't even accept it

320
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,600
when it came to royal family members.

321
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,240
It didn't make sense

322
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,320
love is love,

323
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,720
why did their hatred pass on to the next generations?

324
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
Well,

325
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,360
it could be something

326
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,680
that we didn't know of.

327
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,480
From what I heard,

328
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,280
it was a tragic story.

329
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,040
Tragic how?

330
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,120
What should I do?

331
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,400
Should I ask my grandpa again?

332
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,480
About when will our dispute end?

333
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,360
What if people from that palace hurt my great-grandma?

334
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,600
Will she be mad at me for wanting

335
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,600
to be in a relationship with one of them?

336
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,080
After the death of M.J. Piangrawee,

337
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,400
people from that palace

338
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,840
accused us for being a cause of

339
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,760
M.J.Sasinapa's death. She died

340
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,080
of a broken heart.

341
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,560
This is a huge deal.

342
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,160
We can't get closer for sure,

343
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,280
my Prey.

344
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
Hello, Kong.

345
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,000
Beautiful moon tonight.

346
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,720
You're calling to talk about Andy's work, aren't you?

347
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,000
You know me too well.

348
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
That's right.

349
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,320
It's going pretty well.

350
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,240
Our product's feedback is doing well also.

351
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,800
I think I need

352
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,480
to give credit to you, my pretty lady.

353
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,560
You need to give credit to Kanthir.

354
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,120
He takes care of this project, all of it.

355
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
Alright.

356
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,600
Then he needs to be rewarded.

357
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,360
What about this? When I fly back to Thailand,

358
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,720
I'll give him his reward by myself.

359
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Sure.

360
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Thank you.

361
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,360
I gotta go. I need to finish up my work.

362
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,720
I miss you so much,

363
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,560
my fiancée.

364
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,840
It's 8.35 P.M.

365
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,440
You have an appointment with Ms.Cindy at the lounge, should we go?

366
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,520
I think I'm gonna head back to hotel.

367
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,560
You're in good mood because you talked to Ms.Earl, aren't you?

368
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
You really like her?

369
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,320
She's like my childhood friend.

370
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,360
We're so close.

371
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,720
Our parents

372
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,720
made a promise for us to get married.

373
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,720
As far as I'm concerned,

374
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,040
I haven't seen any other woman

375
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,840
who's good enough to walk by my side

376
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,680
in society like her.

377
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
If that's the case,

378
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,360
should I cancel your appointment with Ms.Cindy?

379
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Not yet.

380
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,400
I could call her in

381
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,760
when I'm bored.

382
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,400
My dear great-grandma,

383
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,240
since I've met Earl,

384
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,320
I don't want anything else in my life.

385
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,240
I don't care if it's pretty

386
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,000
or is valued as much as the moon,

387
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,960
I don't want it anymore.

388
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,200
I just want to be my Earl's side.

389
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,880
This is your first time here,

390
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,560
you need to try Sam Pan Nee dessert.

391
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,840
I made it myself.

392
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,120
You made it?

393
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,760
That's right.

394
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,880
I love to cook and bake.

395
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,640
Most dishes here, both sweet and savory,

396
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,440
I made them all.

397
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,160
Please try.

398
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,000
So tasty.

399
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,440
It's even better than the one in my place.

400
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,200
Then you need to come here more often.

401
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,840
I didn't get to go out much.

402
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,800
I get sick easily

403
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,080
when I'm exposed to sun and wind.

404
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,840
Don't worry.

405
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,840
If you can't come here,

406
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,720
I can go to your place.

407
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
No matter where you are in the world,

408
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll go and find you.

409
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,000
Roses from Utsanakhorn Palace, Milady.

410
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,800
She picked them

411
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,720
and arranged them herself.

412
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,600
I'd like to give them to you.

413
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,520
They're not as good as your dessert.

414
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,320
But I poured my heart

415
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,680
into this bouquet of roses

416
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,640
for you, my dear.

417
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Ow!

418
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,480
I want to see you smile big like this every day.

419
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,880
I'm happy because you're here.

420
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,120
If you're happy,

421
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,720
then you need to take a shower

422
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,160
and have breakfast already.

423
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,640
I'm not hungry, can I do it later?

424
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,600
You can't, my dear.

425
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,080
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

426
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,200
If you're being stubborn,

427
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,040
then I need to do something.

428
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,440
No, I'm scared.

429
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,560
You can take care of my grandpa.

430
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,960
I'll follow you in a minute.

431
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm a good girl, I promise.

432
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,720
Well done.

433
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,240
Hurry up.

434
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,720
Okay.

435
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,960
I'll be happy

436
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,120
when Earl

437
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,520
can visit this place,

438
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,160
just like my great-grandma and M.J.Sasinapa.

439
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,560
Excuse me.

440
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,480
I got a package from your father.

441
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,640
He didn't tell me that he'd send me something from France.

442
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,320
I designed a hotel around Avenue Marceau

443
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,000
and I know that you love perfumes.

444
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,400
So I sent this special perfume,

445
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,360
curated for my girl only.

446
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,480
I don't know if you'd like it

447
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
but you need to put it on for work,

448
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,920
not just keeping it in your collection, collecting dust.

449
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,120
Love and miss you, always.

450
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,239
We have good perfumers here in Thailand.

451
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,719
He shouldn't have sent me this scent.

452
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,600
You have this scent already.

453
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,639
Yes, I do.

454
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,680
Thank you so much for yesterday, Mr.Kannnnthirrrrr.

455
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,120
Here.

456
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
A towel

457
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,880
and toothbrush.

458
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,520
You can use my toothpaste.

459
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,520
And

460
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,120
about where to sleep.

461
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,120
You can sleep on the couch.

462
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I sleep on the couch?

463
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Yup.

464
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Fine.

465
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Go take a shower already.

466
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
I'm hungry.

467
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,080
What do you have in your fridge? Can I see?

468
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Tomatoes, carrots,

469
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,400
coriander, onions.

470
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,240
You kept instant noodles in the fridge?

471
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,800
Hey! Stop it! / You're such a weird guy.

472
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Stop that.

473
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,520
This is my kitchen.

474
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
I'll cook for you.

475
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,760
You should take a shower already.

476
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,920
Fine.

477
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
Well.

478
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
Thank you so much.

479
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,080
You need to cook it well.

480
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,480
I'll come back to taste it.

481
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,760
If it's not good, I'm not gonna eat it.

482
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Please cook for me.

483
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,160
Smells so good.

484
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,680
I didn't realize that you can cook.

485
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,920
I'll eat it now.

486
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Wow!

487
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Delicious.

488
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,800
It's even better than the one I had in Korea.

489
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
Look at the noodles.

490
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,720
You cooked it perfectly soft.

491
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Side dishes

492
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,040
are cooked perfectly as well.

493
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,880
Did you put some potions in here?

494
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,600
Why did it taste better than what I used to eat?

495
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,000
If you like it that much,

496
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,640
then you need to do dishes,

497
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,160
and what I left here.

498
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,720
Please clean them up.

499
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Washing dishes?

500
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,120
That's right.

501
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,280
I cooked for you.

502
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,160
Now you're gonna wash dishes.

503
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,920
Have you ever heard these words,

504
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,600
to earn one's keep?

505
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,360
Well this is how you could earn it,

506
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,480
washing dishes for me.

507
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,680
Enjoy doing dishes.

508
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
Let's go

509
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,080
I know that you store everything in your fridge

510
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,760
to keep away ants

511
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,480
from disturbing your eggs, don't you?

512
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,760
I need to visit you more often

513
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,720
I will come with insecticides, okay?

514
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,120
Look at you,

515
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,120
trying to come here more often.

516
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,200
It's getting messier.

517
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,640
You teased me.

518
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,080
I heard you sighed so loud.

519
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,800
I don't think you would want to enjoy tea with me.

520
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,680
Why did you bring so many of these?

521
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,440
I can help you out.

522
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,040
What's that smell?

523
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,920
Smells so good.

524
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,440
I asked Ta to prepare scented candles

525
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,840
to make desserts.

526
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,160
Ta, please brew tea for us.

527
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,440
Got it.

528
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,680
Thanks.

529
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,040
Prey,

530
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,120
is something bothering you?

531
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,200
I heard you sighed since early morning.

532
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,920
Milinth. / Yeah?

533
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,040
Let's say that

534
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,040
you did something and Tian was mad at you,

535
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,080
she didn’t even look at your face.

536
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
Okay.

537
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,920
What're you gonna do?

538
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,360
You asked me?

539
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,680
I would

540
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,720
bring her delicious snacks.

541
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,800
Delicious food will calm her down.

542
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
What if

543
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,520
she's still mad at you after that?

544
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,120
I think I would

545
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,520
wait for her in front of her house

546
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,560
every day.

547
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,840
She'd be so mean if she'd continue to be mad at me.

548
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,600
It looks like

549
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,040
Prey is going out today.

550
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,400
Lately,

551
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,000
she acted so weird.

552
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,480
She'd look sad for one minute then she'd look happy after.

553
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,400
It's not that weird.

554
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,440
She's in love.

555
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,440
In love? / That's right.

556
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,640
Why are you so calm about this?

557
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
It's not okay.

558
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,760
I'll ask her about this. / Wait.

559
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:28,480
I can't even talk about Prey

560
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,640
or you'll turn into a protective mama bear.

561
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,840
Well, I raised her

562
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,680
it's normal for me to worry about her and care for her.

563
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,040
Sinee,

564
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
whatever will be, will be

565
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,160
When karma starts rolling,

566
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,240
there's no point of going back.

567
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
We can't stop

568
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,720
karma from going around.

569
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,400
I believe that karma is fair for everyone.

570
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,800
Hello, baby.

571
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,240
Prey is teaching me how to make Thai desserts

572
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,320
for you to enjoy.

573
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,320
I'm so tired.

574
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,480
Did you make it or you let Ta make it?

575
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,040
A little bit of both.

576
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,720
I'll ask Prey if she wants to join me to see you today.

577
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,680
I want you to try my desserts.

578
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,960
What if I want to try something

579
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,000
besides desserts. / Stop it.

580
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,280
We can do that tonight.

581
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,680
It's not like that.

582
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,960
I mean.

583
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,200
Phanit, my client from Sumalee Group,

584
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,280
invited me to try her new

585
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,520
imported wine.

586
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,160
So I called

587
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,960
to ask permission to go. / You can't.

588
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,600
Tian!

589
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,280
Is she the same Phanit, Songwat's daughter,

590
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,200
who likes to flirt with you?

591
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,960
You're overreacting, it's business.

592
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,200
I need to meet people.

593
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,720
I don't care about others, but you can't meet her.

594
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,600
If it's necessary,

595
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
then I'll go with you.

596
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,240
Don't ever think about going there by yourself.

597
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,840
Otherwise,

598
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,640
you'll be sipping wine in your grave for sure.

599
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,640
That's all.

600
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,960
Ms.Phanit confirmed the appointment already.

601
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,320
She'll wait at the restaurant.

602
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,360
You're such a strange person.

603
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,200
You like to make Milinth jealous.

604
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,320
To add more colors to our lives.

605
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,920
It'd be too dull, so I need to spice it up.

606
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
Also,

607
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,080
I don't want to go there with Phanit alone.

608
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,160
You're afraid of Ms.Milinth or controlling yourself?

609
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,960
I think it's both.

610
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,400
A tiger never changes its stripes.

611
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,920
We can turn to be a kitten.

612
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,680
Don't forget to send a map to Milinth clearly.

613
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,080
Got it.

614
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,160
Who's that?

615
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,160
She dressed

616
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,360
as if she was a ransom kidnapper.

617
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,840
Can I help you?

618
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,640
I..I'm here to see Earl.

619
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,320
Do you have an appointment with her?

620
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,560
I…I don't.

621
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,280
Well, you can't go to see her.

622
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,640
Why's that?

623
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,600
It's her order. If you don't have an appointment, you can't come in.

624
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,920
Well, I'll wait here until she comes to see me.

625
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Okay.

626
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:58,680
Well,

627
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
besides dad's birthday gift,

628
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,880
is there anything special?

629
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,120
Not really.

630
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,280
Do you want me to unlock observatory for you?

631
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,320
You can relax after a hard day at work.

632
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,520
It's gonna be a full moon tonight.

633
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,280
Sounds good.

634
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,680
I don't want to sleep alone on grandma's birthday.

635
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,280
Where did she come from? She refused to leave.

636
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,480
She didn't get it….. / What's going on?

637
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,280
Why do you look so mad?

638
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,440
There's a woman outside. I can't get her to leave.

639
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,320
She even said that she's here to see you.

640
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,800
Did you ask her name?

641
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,000
I didn't.

642
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,440
I told her to leave and she said her name was Pa…

643
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,760
Plern something.

644
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,040
Prey?

645
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Let's go.

646
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,760
Ms. Earl!

647
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,520
Here's an umbrella.

648
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,760
Umbrella, please. / Here.

649
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,560
Why didn't you tell me that you'd be here?

650
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,360
Let's go inside.

651
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,440
Auntie, can you prepare something warm?

652
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,600
Got it.

653
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,400
Hang in there.

654
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,480
You can shower in my room.

655
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,840
Who's she?

656
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,280
How could I know?

657
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,320
But Ms.Earl walked to the gate to see her.

658
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,560
She must be someone important.

659
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,920
Important? How important?

660
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,600
Are you messing with me?

661
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,160
Well, I didn't know.

662
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,400
I didn't know either.

663
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,400
I can't see her face clear.

664
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,360
When she walks out of Ms.Earl's room,

665
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,400
we'll find out who she is.

666
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,800
More importantly,

667
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,120
let's talk about you. How could you

668
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,960
let her friend stand in the rain like that.

669
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,280
Well, I didn't know.

670
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,080
Normally, her friends would ride in expensive cars.

671
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,920
She called a taxi, how could I know?

672
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,480
Who is she?

673
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,040
I put a towel and my clothes here.

674
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,800
Thank you.

675
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,960
I'll feel better after a warm shower.

676
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,920
Don't forget to wash your hair or you'll get sick.

677
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,640
Got it.

678
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,360
Prey?

679
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,400
Earl?

680
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,760
Can I shower with you?

681
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,280
Perhaps Ms.Prey could be M.J. Sasinapa

682
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,440
in her last life.

683
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,560
Why did you torture yourself like this, Milady?

684
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,400
Well…

685
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,920
No need to shower.

686
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,320
Do you think the moon is beautiful?

687
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,920
I think the sky will be prettier as it's getting late.

688
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,840
You said that you loved me.

689
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,400
Stop fighting!

690
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,080
Fierce! Earl! Please stop.
