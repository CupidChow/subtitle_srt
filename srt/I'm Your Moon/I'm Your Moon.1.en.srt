1
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,960
Milady, are you okay?

2
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,740
I'm fine.

3
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
We should get going.

4
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,280
This way.

5
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,520
Why're you so late? I've been waiting for so long.

6
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,000
None of your business.

7
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,650
Just do your job.

8
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,160
Fine, bring her to the bow.

9
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,840
I'll take you to the large pier.

10
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
This way, Milady.

11
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,079
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,640
Milady.

13
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,160
We should go.

14
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,640
Boon, let's get going.

15
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,350
M.J. Piangrawee

16
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,800
must be on her way to see me,

17
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,760
right, my aunt?

18
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,760
I think so, dear.

19
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,079
I feel so bad

20
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,800
for dragging you

21
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,160
into this horrible action.

22
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
My dear niece,

23
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,320
I was once parted from my beloved one

24
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,840
because we were unsuitable.

25
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,680
And I became

26
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,440
a spinster.

27
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,640
I won't let

28
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,250
history repeat itself

29
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,740
with you for sure.

30
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,840
M.J. Piangrawee

31
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,520
and I can be together

32
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
because of your help.

33
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,300
My dear niece,

34
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,530
please remember

35
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,390
that I'll protect you

36
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,650
until my last breath.

37
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,100
in this life

38
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,300
and the next ones.

39
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
My dear Piangrawee,

40
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,080
we'll be together,

41
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,659
just like the moon

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,920
staying by the cloud.

43
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,720
Wait for me a little bit longer.

44
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,920
I'll promise you that from now on

45
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,320
I won't let go of your hand ever.

46
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,720
Boon, there's water in here.

47
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,840
Is it leaking?

48
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,400
I can't swim! What should we do?

49
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't be scared.

50
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,580
Boon, get us to the shore now.

51
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,720
I…I don't know.

52
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,450
I didn't mean to. / Stop talking.

53
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,800
Get us to the shore

54
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,000
before it's sinking, hurry!

55
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,560
Boon! What're you doing?

56
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,880
Milady, please be strong.

57
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,840
Think of the one that you love.

58
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,680
If I'm destined to die,

59
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,760
I'd like to make a wish

60
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,840
for me to come back again.

61
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,720
This time

62
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,120
I won't be parted from her ever again.

63
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Sleep and dream amidst the starry land, so bright to your eyes.

64
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
The moon drifts by, meeting the stars' end.

65
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,600
The night carries her to return to my heart.

66
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,680
My dear great-grandmother,

67
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,680
I miss you every day.

68
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm wondering

69
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,000
if you're reincarnated already.

70
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,320
If she's reincarnated,

71
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,640
then you must be so lonely.

72
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,300
I won't be.

73
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,320
Because I can finally see her in flesh.

74
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,200
If I ever see her again,

75
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,640
I won't let her go away for sure.

76
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm willing to trade

77
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,400
my death for it…. / Prey!

78
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,440
Come on,

79
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,080
don't say that. It's unlucky thing to say.

80
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,520
Your grandpa will scold at you if he hears this.

81
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,060
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,250
Please don't tell him.

83
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Sure.

84
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,400
But you can't say something like this again.

85
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,520
Look at you,

86
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,250
what're you dressed up for?

87
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,080
Tian said that

88
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,120
she will take me for an early birthday lunch.

89
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,000
She's worried that

90
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,700
she couldn't make it on your actual birthday.

91
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,720
That's right. I think

92
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,650
after having lunch with her

93
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,200
I'll bake something for my great-grandmother.

94
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,520
We should go and get some ingredients.

95
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,280
I'll prepare a car for you.

96
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,560
You don't have to. Tian will send someone to pick me up.

97
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,970
Sure.

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll let your grandpa know.

99
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,640
Thank you. / No problem.

100
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,320
I should get going.

101
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Okay.

102
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,600
Ms.Earl, Thir's waiting for you in your office.

103
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,360
I'll be there soon.

104
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,250
You seem to be in a good mood today.

105
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,680
I don't think you need some tea to calm you down

106
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,800
like before.

107
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
No one knows me like you, Aunt Jang.

108
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,000
Please bring my tea to my office.

109
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,100
I already did.

110
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,020
The anniversary of grandma's death

111
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
The anniversary of grandma's death is right around the corner.

112
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,880
Please come to the office

113
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,480
at 10 A.M. to sign some papers.

114
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,800
Accounting department asked for them.

115
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,280
And lunch with Ms.Ticha at noon.

116
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,040
She's the third-generation heiress

117
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,000
of Kraisorn family's department store.

118
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,840
About Kong's new product

119
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,280
that partnered with us, right?

120
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,250
That's right.

121
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,160
Then an afternoon tea with Ms.Sumalee,

122
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,360
a CEO of Sumalee hotel group.

123
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,600
I guess she wanted to ask you for joint venture plan

124
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,000
to expand her business.

125
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Can you check if they're important guests?

126
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,280
If they're not that important, you can cancel the appointments,

127
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,720
I trust your judgement

128
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,520
you don't need to tell me in advance.

129
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,720
In the evening,

130
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,360
there's a dinner plan with Ms.Tawanin,

131
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
do you want me to cancel it?

132
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,560
Tian wanted to see me for dinner?

133
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,360
That's right.

134
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,880
I was surprised too.

135
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,000
Normally, we'd see her during

136
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,480
shareholder's meeting

137
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,680
or big party

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,640
of Methakorn Group.

139
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,680
Storm will hit us for sure.

140
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,000
A busy woman like Tian

141
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,880
asked an old friend like me for dinner.

142
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,520
Are you free? If you're not,

143
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,960
I can postpone the dinner with her.

144
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,500
I'll meet her for dinner.

145
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,200
I want to know

146
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,250
what does she want?

147
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,050
Can you tell me the reason

148
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
why SET's top ten report

149
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,320
showed that we dropped to number three?

150
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,050
Our investment budget

151
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,520
can be compared to PP Land and Kinnaree.

152
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,840
We started the projects slower than them just for a little bit.

153
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,440
A little bit?

154
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,560
They're ready to sell their projects

155
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,050
but we just started to develop in the same area.

156
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,520
How can we compete with them?

157
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,120
Our reputation can draw attention.

158
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,000
If we start new projects, they will be sold out in no time.

159
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,650
I'm not okay with sold out when it's too slow.

160
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,050
If I refused to pay your salaries

161
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,440
for a year or two,

162
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,920
are you okay with that?

163
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,280
The Cloud project

164
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,760
needs to launch before anyone else.

165
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,360
Everything needs to be ready before shareholder's meeting.

166
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,800
Methakorn

167
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,680
will bring back its number one spot

168
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,760
in SET's top ten.

169
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Otherwise,

170
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,000
you all

171
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,240
can pack your bags and leave the company.

172
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,640
She's fierce like a tiger, no man would want to marry her.

173
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,360
If she's not fierce, how can she run a giant company like this.

174
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,360
More importantly,

175
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,280
she has no interest in men.

176
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,960
Ms. Earl, I….

177
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,120
What's going on?

178
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,680
I have a lot to do today.

179
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,120
I'd like to ask you about anniversary

180
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,720
of her death's event.

181
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,000
Just like every year.

182
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,520
More importantly,

183
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,520
don't forget desserts that grandma liked to make.

184
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,870
Sure thing.

185
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,050
I will prepare everything perfectly.

186
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,520
Please take care of it.

187
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Kong Kidakorn

188
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,430
Kong?

189
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,400
I'd like to know

190
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,200
if this is a destiny

191
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,320
or a curse.

192
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,040
Excuse me.

193
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
Come on in.

194
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,520
Minutes of meeting are here

195
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,440
and I sent them to Google Docs already.

196
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,840
You can check details anywhere.

197
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,480
Thank you, Kwang.

198
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,000
I must be so busy today.

199
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,200
You're not getting used to it already?

200
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,000
You're busy every day.

201
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,600
You're right.

202
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
Well,

203
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,120
if there's any emergency, call me on my phone.

204
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,560
If there's none…

205
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,160
Do not disturb. / Well done.

206
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,480
You know me so well.

207
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,200
If I hadn't dated anyone,

208
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,360
I would have asked you out for sure.

209
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,570
Come on,

210
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,050
stop it right there.

211
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,840
Ms.Milinth only has two flaws,

212
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,100
she's so stingy and super jealous,

213
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,360
a legendary level.

214
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,560
I don't want to lose my job right now.

215
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Fine.

216
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,520
You should get going, Prey's waiting for you.

217
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,600
The car is waiting for you out front.

218
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,250
Thank you. / You're welcome.

219
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,400
You don't have to go to the company with me.

220
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,520
You can take care of new product that I partnered with Kong.

221
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,360
Kong's secretary

222
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,100
will send you the details.

223
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,400
Okay, I'll send my assistant to

224
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,080
to take care of you for me.

225
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,880
Good.

226
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,720
Take care of my work, okay.

227
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,520
You can make decisions for me.

228
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,079
Got it.

229
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,880
It's okay, Shun.

230
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,849
I'll take care of signing contract.

231
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,560
I'll send it back to you.

232
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,050
Thank you.

233
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,280
I'm sorry that

234
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,760
this is too sudden.

235
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,560
No worries.

236
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,560
It's our secretary's duty to do so.

237
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,140
Besides,

238
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm quite familiar with Milinth's company

239
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,280
Talk to you later.

240
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,800
Andy Thakoon Stantin?

241
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,000
Is he famous? Never heard of him.

242
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,030
Hey! / Hey!

243
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,480
Start the car.

244
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,480
What? / Come on, look at the back.

245
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,800
Where is he going?

246
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,080
Oh my! I lost Andy, he got in the car already.

247
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,560
He must have something urgent to go.

248
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,280
That's right, otherwise he would have taken photos with us.

249
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
I know, right? / Yep.

250
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,120
It's okay.

251
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
We can come back tomorrow.

252
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:00,440
I got some photos already.

253
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,800
Andy! Where're you going?

254
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,560
If you're not back to sign a contract today,

255
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,000
you're a dead man!

256
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,520
Pookie, come here. / Andy…

257
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,900
He hopped on someone's car and just left.

258
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,200
How can we find him?

259
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,500
Let me see.

260
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,200
Who would dare to steal my 10 million?

261
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,880
Whose care is this?

262
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Or..

263
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,280
they could be

264
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,920
kidnappers?

265
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,250
What should I do?

266
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,000
I worked so hard

267
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,250
to get this project.

268
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,200
If Andy didn't come back to sign the contract,

269
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,600
I'd lose my 10 million for sure.

270
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,800
Please calm down, Ms.Milinth.

271
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,200
No one can steal your money.

272
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Don't forget

273
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,650
that you still got Tian.

274
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,160
Tian can take care

275
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,560
all of your problems, big or small.

276
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,440
You're right.

277
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,250
Tian.

278
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,880
Hello, Ms.Tian,

279
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,400
this is your table.

280
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll get the chair for you.

281
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,320
Thank you.

282
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
Here's menu.

283
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,280
Thanks.

284
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,880
Please pick some appetizers.

285
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,160
Okay.

286
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,840
Just a second.

287
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,320
Hello? You're done with work?

288
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,320
Tian.

289
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,680
Someone took our money.

290
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,280
Who did that? How much?

291
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,880
I don't know but

292
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,200
they stole our money right in front of me.

293
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,540
How much?

294
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,110
10 million.

295
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,560
10 million?

296
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,840
Fine, wait for me there.

297
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
I'll be on my way.

298
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,130
Okay.

299
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,080
What happened? Is everything okay?

300
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,120
Can you wait for my friend here?

301
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,040
I need to check on Milinth. I'll tell you later.

302
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,160
Okay?

303
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Okay.

304
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Hey!

305
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,960
Why did you stop the car?

306
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,280
I should be the one asking you.

307
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,920
What the hell are you doing?

308
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,560
You got on my car all of a sudden.

309
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,280
So you don't know me.

310
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,920
If I know you,

311
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,400
would I look confused like a lost chicken like this?

312
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,200
Come on, be real.

313
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
You really don't know me.

314
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,180
Nope.

315
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,920
I helped you out

316
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,200
and now please leave.

317
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,520
I have something important to do.

318
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,750
You look like a bright person.

319
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
I had no idea you could be this stupid.

320
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Hey!

321
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,480
Get out of my car already.

322
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
You wasted my time.

323
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:19,960
Get the hell out of my car already!

324
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,560
You really have no clues.

325
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,160
Hey, Kanthir

326
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,800
why did you visit

327
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,920
Milinth's company today?

328
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
You are?!

329
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
That's right.

330
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,880
I'm Andy, Andy Thakoon.

331
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,640
Please keep on driving.

332
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Go on.

333
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,200
Did you forget something, Tian?

334
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,200
Tian is not here?

335
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,600
Are you Prey? Tian's sister?

336
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,840
Great-grandmother?

337
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,120
Did I do something wrong?

338
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,520
Are you Prey? Tian's sister?

339
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
That's right.

340
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,240
So I did something wrong.

341
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,880
Or you're Tian's sister.

342
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,520
I'm Tian's sister

343
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,520
and no, you didn't do anything.

344
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,560
I saw your face.

345
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:25,830
And I…

346
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,840
I can't stop crying.

347
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,920
There, there. Please stop crying.

348
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,160
It's your birthday.

349
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,880
You're not made to cry.

350
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,600
Can I wipe your tears?

351
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,000
You know what women like us

352
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,960
will get puffy eyes like goldfish

353
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,560
if we're crying way too much.

354
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,200
Well, I'll stop crying now.

355
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,480
I don't want to look like a goldfish.

356
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,040
Can I borrow your handkerchief?

357
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,320
Sure.

358
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,680
Now that you stop crying,

359
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,520
I'll order something nice for you to try.

360
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,120
But you need to get something really nice.

361
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Otherwise,

362
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,000
I'll cry again for sure.

363
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,920
Got it.

364
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,250
You won't be disappointed for sure.

365
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Some desserts?

366
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,000
That's it.

367
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,250
You scared me.

368
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,600
It's all done.

369
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,840
Please tell Shun

370
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,990
not to worry about it.

371
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,560
We'll follow the contract strictly.

372
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,320
It's not just about us

373
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,160
but they need to follow the contract as well.

374
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Otherwise, it's invalid.

375
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,120
What're you talking about?

376
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,680
It's the same contract as before.

377
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,560
You won't lose advantages for sure.

378
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,400
You're free to go now, thanks for your help.

379
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,670
I mean working with Earl

380
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,100
is a tough job already.

381
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,680
My pleasure.

382
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,800
I should go.

383
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,470
Where're you off to?

384
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,480
I heard you're a right-hand man

385
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,560
of M.L. Kassakorn.

386
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,440
You're not gonna double-check the contract?

387
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
The contract will be completed when Kanthir Wongsa

388
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,560
takes care of the artist until the end of the project.

389
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,480
You can refuse to do so.

390
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,280
But your assigned job

391
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,480
won't end in peace.

392
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,050
Hello.

393
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,760
You wanted to meet me for dinner

394
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,640
but you left me with your sister?

395
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,360
I'm sorry.

396
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,360
Actually, I needed to talk to you about work

397
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,800
and treated my sister for her birthday.

398
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
But…

399
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,250
something came up.

400
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
And?

401
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,920
I heard that someone stole your girl's money.

402
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,480
Is it a scammer call center gang?

403
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,240
Nope.

404
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,520
My presenter ran off in a car

405
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,640
with your assistant, Kanthir.

406
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,920
She was freaked out.

407
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
But it's all good now.

408
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,320
Are you coming back soon?

409
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,160
I..

410
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,720
I don't think I can. Well,

411
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,560
Andy made a big mess.

412
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,720
He asked Kanthir to take care of him until the end of this project

413
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,600
or the contract would fail completely.

414
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,120
So I called

415
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,520
to apologize

416
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,760
about work.

417
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,280
I let Thir decide on this. It's up to him.

418
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,080
And about….

419
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,000
About my sister,

420
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,760
can you

421
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,320
give her a ride back home?

422
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,000
Don't worry.

423
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,880
I won't let Earl out of my sight for sure.

424
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
Okay.

425
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,640
I can give her a ride.

426
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,160
I don't have to go anywhere after.

427
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,960
Yay! Thank you.

428
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,960
Talk to you later.

429
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,920
I don't know

430
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,000
if I'm doing the right thing

431
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,680
for letting them be alone like that.

432
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,880
There's no such thing

433
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,600
as coincidence.

434
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,480
Whatever will be, will be.

435
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,920
You live here?

436
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
That's right.

437
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,420
Utsanakhorn Palace is my grandpa's place.

438
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,280
Would you like to come inside and hang out?

439
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,360
I want you to meet someone.

440
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,760
Someone

441
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,560
who is really special to me.

442
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
I don't think so.

443
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,840
I need to go.

444
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,640
I just realized that I have work to do.

445
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,080
Well, happy birthday.

446
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,160
Right,

447
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:45,760
I almost forgot that you're Tian's friend.

448
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,920
You must be a workaholic like her.

449
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,480
See you later.

450
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,360
Thank you for today.

451
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,960
It's my best birthday.

452
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,170
Thank you.

453
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
You're welcome.

454
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
See you later.

455
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,320
Oh, you're back?

456
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,960
Is everything okay?

457
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,480
It's fine.

458
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,560
You're not done cleaning the room?

459
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,440
I'm done. I'm just checking

460
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,680
and…

461
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,720
pray to her.

462
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,720
Pray?

463
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,190
Like pray at the shrines?

464
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,560
No. I asked her

465
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,960
to protect her children.

466
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:54,840
I don't want to see you cry

467
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,080
in your sleep like before.

468
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,920
No.

469
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,680
It happened to her again, please come and see.

470
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,120
I wouldn't dare to wake her up. / Earl!

471
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,050
Earl! / Earl!

472
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,360
Earl! / Earl!

473
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,719
What should we do?

474
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,960
She looks so tortured.

475
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,400
I feel really bad for her.

476
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,719
Her condition is getting worse

477
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,120
when it's close to the anniversary of my aunt's death.

478
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,800
I don't care about Utsanakhorn Palace's curses.

479
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,960
I'm just worried about my girl.

480
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,920
When she grows up

481
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,679
and her condition is like this,

482
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,960
who would want to marry her?

483
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,960
I will find every possible way

484
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,920
to heal her from this crazy condition.

485
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,880
I don't care what I have to do.

486
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,400
Then she met with a monk

487
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,120
and we found out that your condition

488
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,440
was recalling of your previous life in your dream.

489
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,280
If this is what happens to me,

490
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,640
our dispute with Utsanakhorn Palace

491
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,050
should end soon.

492
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,160
Why? What did they do?

493
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,880
They didn't do anything.

494
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,920
I just met someone who looked like my grandma.

495
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,320
More importantly,

496
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,120
she's an heiress of Utsanakhorn Palace.

497
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,160
My dear great-grandmother,

498
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,960
I met someone today.

499
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,400
You wouldn't believe

500
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,640
what happened to me.

501
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,120
Can you guess?

502
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,440
Well,

503
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,920
Tian picked me up for lunch.

504
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:22,680
She said that she'd surprise me with someone.

505
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,720
When I met her,

506
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,950
it's so amazing.

507
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,600
You know why?

508
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,160
It's because she looks just like you.

509
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,740
So much like you.

510
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,840
Not exactly like you.

511
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,060
I could believe that she is you.

512
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,000
Because you two look so much alike.

513
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,000
Then,

514
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,760
I cried in front of her.

515
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,960
I didn't cry

516
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,240
because she looks like you.

517
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,400
But I feel like…

518
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,960
Like…

519
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,480
I finally met someone

520
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
that I've been waiting for so long.

521
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,400
You

522
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,920
and her

523
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,680
have the same beautiful face like the moon.

524
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,280
Today, I want to make Bulan Dan Mek,

525
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,880
your favorite dessert for you.

526
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,720
The moon will be drifting

527
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,800
beautifully amidst the cloud.

528
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,400
Well, I should start making it

529
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,760
and offer it to you. I gotta go.

530
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
See you later.

531
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
Sinee.

532
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,080
Did I do something wrong?

533
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,760
I let her

534
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,080
meet someone new

535
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,280
besides Tian and Milinth.

536
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,480
Sir,

537
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,600
she's a grown-up.

538
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,320
She can decide for herself.

539
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,480
We can't be with her for the rest of her life.

540
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,280
You're right.

541
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:40,480
She needs to stand on her own feet.

542
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,120
When we're not here,

543
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,080
she'd have someone to be with,

544
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,120
she'd have sisters

545
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,920
to take care of her.

546
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:03,970
Please, grandma.

547
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,280
Please take care of Prey.

548
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,320
Don't let hatred

549
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,680
ruin your children.

550
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,120
Tian.

551
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,920
Thank you so much for today.

552
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,320
If you hadn't helped me,

553
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,160
I would have been dead for sure.

554
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,920
Next time,

555
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,920
you should be careful and stay calm.

556
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm worried about you.

557
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,040
Well, you spoiled me.

558
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,800
You always help me out with my troubles.

559
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,000
Well…

560
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,160
there's something

561
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,440
that I didn't do

562
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,000
but you can undo it for me.

563
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,760
My girlfriend is cute

564
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,680
and sweet like this

565
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,360
I should do something to her.

566
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,200
Tian, wait.

567
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,000
How did it go with Prey and Earl today?

568
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,920
How could I know?

569
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,400
You called me to help with your 10 million.

570
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,050
Tian,

571
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,080
you won't be in trouble, right?

572
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,880
What if her grandpa find out about this?

573
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,160
I just want Prey to be happy

574
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,600
and I'm willing to trade anything.

575
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,360
I hope so.

576
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm just worried that

577
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,960
she could be in sorrow

578
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,440
rather than happy.

579
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,800
Rose scent just like Earl.

580
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,080
Thank you moon

581
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,200
for sending Earl to be my birthday's gift.

582
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,720
You live here?

583
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
That's right.

584
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,250
Utsanakhorn Palace is my grandpa's place.

585
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,440
Would you like to come inside and hang out?

586
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:56,480
I want you to meet someone.

587
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,840
Someone

588
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,560
who is really special to me.

589
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,680
Utsanakhorn won't approve any kind of relationship

590
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,120
of her and someone from Sittalrat for sure.

591
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:28,760
You two called for me?

592
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,200
Your dad has something important to talk to you.

593
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,880
It's not a bad thing, it's good news.

594
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,240
M.J. Chalothorn is fond of you.

595
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,000
He even asked to marry you.

596
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,720
It's unorthodox for

597
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,280
a younger sister to get married first.

598
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,520
But he's so persistent.

599
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,480
So I said yes.

600
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,960
You said yes?

601
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,240
Without asking me?

602
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,600
My dear,

603
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,520
your dad is waiting

604
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,680
to see his daughter

605
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,160
to get married with M.J. Chalothorn.

606
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,920
I bet my daughter

607
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,840
will be the most beautiful bride on your wedding day.

608
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:40,360
After your wedding,

609
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,960
I will ask M.J. Piangrawee to marry your brother.

610
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,480
Piangrawee?

611
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,170
That's right.

612
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,520
M.J. Piangrawee's health

613
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,160
is not so good.

614
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,800
But your brother

615
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,440
is fond of her so much.

616
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,840
So your father agrees of their marriage.

617
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,560
Can I not get married?

618
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,920
You're worried about leaving the palace?

619
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,720
Don't you worried.

620
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,480
I have been thinking about it

621
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,850
and he surely can

622
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,920
take care of my most precious daughter for sure.

623
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:28,770
Okay.

624
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,000
Is it true? / It's true.

625
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:58,600
Who would joke about this?

626
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,000
M.J. Sasinapa

627
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,080
must be so hurtful about this.

628
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,960
That's right.

629
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,050
She cried all night.

630
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,880
I feel so bad for her, word can't describe.

631
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,200
Are you gonna tell M.J.Piangrawee about this?

632
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,000
I wouldn't dare. This is huge.

633
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,760
She needs to tell her.

634
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,480
When will you tell me

635
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,320
about your engagement with M.J. Chalothorn?

636
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,480
I'm sorry.

637
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,880
I'm not brave enough.

638
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,720
It's okay.

639
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,680
To be parted from someone you love

640
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,760
even when you still love one another

641
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,680
must be sorrow, I know it well.

642
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,600
Should we run away together?

643
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,320
Where to?

644
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,360
I see no way out.

645
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,480
The only think that I can do

646
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,120
is to love you with all my heart.

647
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:37,920
That's enough.

648
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,160
But I can't do it like you.

649
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,040
If I have to be with another man,

650
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,280
I would rather face with death ahead.

651
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,560
What about your status?

652
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,250
You can't let go of anything like this.

653
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,880
If I have to be sorrow and get my heart broken

654
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:22,080
to remain my social status,

655
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:28,880
then I'm willing to drop everything.

656
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,800
Please don't leave me.

657
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,800
No one can take you away from me,

658
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,840
only death

659
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,720
can do us part.

660
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,680
Shame!

661
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,960
Piangrawee and Sasinapa!

662
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,050
What're you doing?

663
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,560
Why do I feel so depressed?

664
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,920
I felt bad for you, right?

665
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,680
Let's hurry back to Utsanakhorn Palace

666
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,800
Earl! Wait for me.

667
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:22,480
Earl!

668
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:26,040
Kanthir needs to put this shirt on for me.

669
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,760
Just put it on, right?

670
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,050
It's been seven days

671
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:33,680
she doesn't even read my texts.

672
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,800
It started from people in Sittalrat Palace.

673
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:41,720
My dad and my grandma

674
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,680
couldn't forgive those people.

675
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,040
When will ….

676
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,720
we meet again?

677
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,240
Hey! There!

678
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,040
You can just throw it away.

679
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,160
You don't have to bring it back to me.

680
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,680
It's time for this ring to find its new owner.
