1
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,320
Oh, Miss Earl.

2
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,920
Miss Earl, Miss Earl.

3
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,680
Miss Earl, Miss Earl.

4
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,210
Miss Earl.

5
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,900
Why are you sleeping here?

6
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,920
I've been looking for you all over the palace.

7
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,190
I must be tired.

8
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,280
I've been very busy lately.

9
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,400
Is there something wrong?

10
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,000
Um... Your Highness and Your Lady have called

11
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,640
regarding an important matter.

12
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,560
Alright.

13
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,640
But let me go take a shower first. I'll call them back later.

14
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,720
Oh, what about Kanthir?

15
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
He made a call since early morning,

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,160
telling that he'd come here a little late today.

17
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,640
I think he had an amazing time last night.

18
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,920
Don't forget to eat breakfast before going to work.

19
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,220
I don't want to have a skinny boyfriend with a big head.

20
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,800
This crazy boy.

21
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,960
When did I become your boyfriend?

22
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,240
I ate it.

23
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,920
What a bad cooking skill.

24
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,079
But thanks.

25
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,200
Come home soon.

26
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,240
Do you still love it even it sucks?

27
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,200
I don't know.

28
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,160
I just know that I miss you.

29
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,240
What?

30
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,240
I got to work.

31
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,320
I'll see you after work tonight.

32
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,160
Okay.

33
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,200
Hello, Father.

34
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,399
Is there something important?

35
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,110
It's Kong's parents.

36
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,000
They asked me since you've been engaged for a long time.

37
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,400
I'm not ready. It's not the time yet.

38
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,640
Don't let it go on too long.

39
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,530
It's not easy to find a good guy like Kong.

40
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:41,680
He loves you sincerely.

41
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,760
I don't think I will be able to love Kong like a lover in this life.

42
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,840
When you live together, you'll fall in love with each other eventually.

43
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,920
Your mother and I have high expectations of you.

44
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,200
Don't let me down.

45
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,720
Dear Grandfather,

46
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:28,800
today I made some Kanom Pra Pai for you.

47
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,840
They say that Kanom Pra Pai is an auspicious dessert.

48
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,080
Eating it makes love strong and lasting.

49
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,640
But why is my love life

50
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,360
always filled with sadness?

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,040
Hello, Fierce?

52
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,360
What?

53
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,840
What did you say?

54
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,240
In front of the palace?

55
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,680
Am I really that untrustworthy?

56
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,000
That's why your maid is standing over me like this.

57
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,240
Ta is always like this.

58
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,600
This palace doesn't receive many guests. They probably aren't used to it yet.

59
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,240
Then...

60
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,730
I guess I'll have to come here more often.

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,200
So she'll get used to it.

62
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,200
Do you have free time? You said you were busy with work.

63
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,080
For someone special,

64
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,480
I always find time.

65
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,800
Ta, today I bought grilled fish for you.

66
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,390
But you have to be careful.

67
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,880
There are a lot of cat burglars around here.

68
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,640
Don't worry, Miss Milinth.

69
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,800
I will keep my eyes on them.

70
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,880
Good.

71
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,920
Prey, I have a lot to tell you.

72
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,480
Really, Madam.

73
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,440
I don't like the way this new friend of Ms. Prey looked at her.

74
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,680
She seems like a total flirt.

75
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,880
So you called to tell Tian.

76
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,640
Because I'm worried about Miss Prey.

77
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,320
No matter how much you scold me, I will accept it.

78
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,040
That's good. We have to take special care of her during this time

79
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,200
until she gets stronger.

80
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,000
Madam.

81
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,640
Is this Miss Fierce the one who made Miss Prey cry?

82
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,120
What I'm worried about is that she's not the one that Prey is waiting for.

83
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,440
I didn't know that you had a guest today.

84
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,960
I thought I would discuss with you about the Thai dessert competition.

85
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,640
Are you holding it?

86
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,360
Great, I was just looking for something to do.

87
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm going to ask you to join.

88
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,840
Importantly, Tian is also a major sponsor of this event.

89
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,760
Then I would like to join in too.

90
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,440
If you join,

91
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,320
then I would like to be your co-sponsor.

92
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,640
I hope you don't mind, Milinth.

93
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,250
Sure.

94
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,160
Okay, then can you go to celebrate with me, Prey?

95
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,880
She's probably not convenient now

96
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,640
because I got a lot of works to discuss with her today.

97
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,400
You can leave first.

98
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:44,790
So let's consult with Ms. Sinee about what kind of desserts we're going to make.

99
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,080
Okay? / Yes.

100
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:46,720
Let's go.

101
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,480
Thank you so much. / Let's go.

102
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,640
This is going to be fun.

103
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:04,960
Miss Earl.

104
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,920
Miss Earl.

105
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,640
Miss Earl, Miss Earl.

106
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,480
What's up?

107
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,440
Sign the document.

108
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:29,720
Here.

109
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,600
Earl.

110
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,320
Are you having a personal problem?

111
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,640
Is it that easy to see through?

112
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,160
Yes.

113
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,120
If you let me guess, it must be about your rushing marriage, right?

114
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,540
You should be a fortune teller instead of a secretary.

115
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,080
And what if it were you?

116
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,200
Will you choose your happiness or rightness?

117
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:09,700
If it were me, I would choose rightness if it was about work.

118
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,360
But if it was about love, I would choose my happiness.

119
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,040
That's true.

120
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,600
Even something as simple as this, I can't figure it out.

121
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,560
Until almost everything went wrong.

122
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,000
Earl.

123
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,640
No one never made a mistake.

124
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,360
But if we know where we went wrong,

125
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,830
we will know more about how to fix it.

126
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,600
It's been two months now, Great-Grandmother.

127
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,160
I haven't got in touch with Earl at all.

128
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,240
I think…

129
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,640
Earl is probably not the reincarnation of you.

130
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,880
Because if so, she wouldn't be so mean to me.

131
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,440
I'm stupid.

132
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,840
Prey.

133
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,080
What are you mumbling to yourself about?

134
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,200
Let's go.

135
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,600
It's almost time for the competition.

136
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,520
I haven't prepared anything yet.

137
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,040
Don't worry.

138
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,440
Ms. Sinee and Ta have already put them in the car for you.

139
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,840
That's great.

140
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,160
Let's go.

141
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,240
Prey.

142
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,240
This event,

143
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,240
Earl is a judge.

144
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,160
Are you okay with that?

145
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,680
Yes.

146
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,880
I'll do my best.

147
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,840
Let's go. / Go.

148
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,480
You organized the event very stylishly.

149
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,400
Thank you very much for coming to the event

150
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,190
and helping to report the news.

151
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,760
Yes, do you have a schedule for when the next event will be held?

152
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,320
Oh, it should be early in the year.

153
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,040
Sorry, it should be early next year. Please come again.

154
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,360
Sure. / Anyway, excuse me for now.

155
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,520
Thank you.

156
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,680
Oh, Miss Earl is here.

157
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Let's take their photo in one frame.

158
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,160
Can I take a photo of you two together?

159
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,160
Yes.

160
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,520
This camera, please.

161
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,720
Thank you very much.

162
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,720
Hello, Earl.

163
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,520
Kong isn't coming with you today?

164
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,000
We're not close enough

165
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,560
to talk about personal stuff.

166
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,840
Today we may not be close, but who knows in the future.

167
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,680
The two of us have many things in common.

168
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,640
We are friends with Tian

169
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,040
and also...we like the same person.

170
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,440
This should be enough for us to become close.

171
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,440
Miss Athithan, what are some of the delicious dessert menus you have in this final round?

172
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,320
We have Bulan Dan Mek, Chor Phaka Krong and Saneh Jaan.

173
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,920
Good luck. / Thank you.

174
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,640
And what about you, Jamjan? The other team has Bulan Dan Mek,

175
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,720
Saneh Jaan and Chor Phaka Krong.

176
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,040
What menus will you bring out?

177
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,560
We're preparing Chor Muang, Intanin, and Sum Pun Nee.

178
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,840
Good luck. / Thank you. / Over there, please.

179
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,520
Hello, where are you?

180
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,480
I'm standing here waiting.

181
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,160
There's a Benz parking right in front of you.

182
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,940
Here.

183
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,720
You should know the time and place. Next time, don't leave your things at my house.

184
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,760
I just want to see your face.

185
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,040
You've seen my face all night, why do you want more?

186
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,680
Huh? What did you say?

187
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,960
I can't hear it very well.

188
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,359
Come closer to tell me.

189
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,400
I want to say

190
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,680
Don't forget stuff at my house again.

191
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,720
I am working now.

192
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:20,760
Hey.

193
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,920
I have the motivation to work now.

194
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,520
See you tonight.

195
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,920
Mines are Bulan Dan Mek, Saneh Jaan and Chor Phaka Krong.

196
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,480
For me, there are Sum Pun Nee, Chor Muang and Intanin.

197
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,040
Both contestant, please come to the front of the stage.

198
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,680
The winner of this Thai dessert competition is…

199
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,240
Miss Athithan Utsanakhorn, the creator of Pray for Love.

200
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,000
Prey, congrats.

201
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,800
Good job.

202
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,040
Congratulations, Prey.

203
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,120
Congratulations.

204
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,880
You are the best.

205
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,680
I want to try your desserts too.

206
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,040
Could you take care of the stuff for me?

207
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,680
Okay, I'll take of it.

208
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,120
Prey.

209
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,920
Let me give you a little reminder.

210
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,240
If you want the truth,

211
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,000
you must tell him everything that's on your mind.

212
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,000
Do you understand?

213
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,600
Okay, thank you.

214
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,680
Earl, Earl.

215
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,320
Earl.

216
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,120
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

217
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,520
Congrats.

218
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,080
Do you know?

219
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,850
Why did I make the Pray of Love dessert?

220
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know.

221
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,800
And I don't want to know either.

222
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,560
This dessert

223
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,520
represents my love.

224
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,680
Bulan Dan Mek

225
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,160
is like a young woman who has never been in love.

226
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,440
Even though she is bright and cheerful,

227
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,080
she is surrounded by clouds.

228
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,280
And then one day she found sweet love.

229
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,240
Filled with the allure just like Saneh Jaan.

230
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,600
In the end, whether my love

231
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,040
will be as sweet as Chor Phaka Krong

232
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,840
or will become only a snack

233
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,080
is up to you now.

234
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,760
I can't give you any answers.

235
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,080
Earl.

236
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,560
If we cut out Utsanakhorn,

237
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,120
I'm just a girl

238
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,720
begging for your love.

239
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,720
Why don't you look back at me?

240
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,800
All these times,

241
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,760
Was it all my fault that I thought this way?

242
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,960
Can you look me in the eyes

243
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,200
and tell me

244
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,440
that you never loved me?

245
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,640
Calm down and listen to me carefully.

246
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,600
I never loved you.

247
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,730
Excuse me.

248
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,720
Prey.

249
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,720
Do you want to tell me?

250
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,280
No.

251
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,880
You never cares about me at all.

252
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,360
I feel hurt too.

253
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,920
Now you're acting like

254
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,960
the person who hurt you.

255
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,690
That's not true.

256
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm not that kind of person.

257
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,040
I'm not mean like…

258
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,160
Really?

259
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,080
Prove it.

260
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,220
How do I prove it?

261
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,480
If you're not that cruel,

262
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,640
tonight

263
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,790
you go on a date with me.

264
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,040
Do you dare to prove it?

265
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,560
I…

266
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,540
You're so cruel.

267
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,800
You've rejected me countless times.

268
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,880
Okay, I'll ask for permission from Thian first.

269
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,720
I already told Tian.

270
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,760
Let's have dinner tonight.

271
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I told Tian already.

272
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,800
Don't worry.

273
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,200
You guys did a great job today.

274
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,040
I'll see you at the office.

275
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,440
Could you look over there? There's a little trash.

276
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,960
Okay.

277
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
Thank you.

278
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,200
Today's event went well.

279
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,160
Good job. / Milinth.

280
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,960
Milinth.

281
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,880
Yes? / Have you seen Prey?

282
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,440
I've been looking for her for a long time and I can't find her.

283
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,200
I let Kanthir help for the search.

284
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,080
Wait a minute. Prey isn't with you?

285
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:58,920
No, Prey followed Earl out

286
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,040
and now she's missing.

287
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,480
Here.

288
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,960
Why aren't you answering the phone?

289
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,760
Kanthir.

290
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,720
Have you found her yet?

291
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,400
No.

292
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,560
But most importantly, Miss Fierce has also disappeared.

293
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,640
Huh? / Fierce?

294
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,360
They must have left together.

295
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,280
And…

296
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,160
And where is Earl?

297
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,480
What happened?

298
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,350
Prey left with Fierce.

299
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,640
I tried to contact her, but it seems like her phone is turned off.

300
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,440
I don't know where that snake is taking her.

301
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Wait.

302
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,680
Prey's bag has an AirTag to prevent it from getting lost.

303
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,760
It also connects to my phone.

304
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,480
Here it is.

305
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:56,880
Did you find it?

306
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,330
Wait a minute, this is a bar near Lat Phrao.

307
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,320
A bar?

308
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,320
That means Tian's friend

309
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,290
definitely has bad intention towards her.

310
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm going to report it to the police.

311
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,800
Please calm down.

312
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,980
If you go and report it, it might become news

313
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,630
and it won't have a good effect on Prey.

314
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,840
Then what should I do?

315
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,240
Should I stand still and not be bothered like you?

316
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,760
To be honest,

317
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,320
the culprit is you,

318
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:37,480
who put my niece in danger.

319
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,880
Calm down, Sinee.

320
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,320
Please trust me.

321
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,560
I will bring Prey back safely.

322
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,080
Thir, tell Tian to meet at the bar.

323
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,960
Milinth, come with me. / Yes, yes.

324
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,360
Let's go.

325
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,000
Calm down.

326
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,760
What would you like to drink?

327
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,040
I don't really like drinking wine.

328
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,080
It's bitter.

329
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,120
Really?

330
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,760
But sometimes…

331
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,680
To forget someone,

332
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,640
alcohol is also a good helper

333
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,480
that makes you forget your suffering.

334
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,080
Wow.

335
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,120
You drank it all in one go.

336
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,240
This is not good at all.

337
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,560
You'll get drunk fast.

338
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,080
Excuse me.

339
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,280
I'd like two of these whiskeys, please.

340
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,800
Are you just drinking it straight?

341
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,560
An eye for an eye, right?

342
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,480
I saw that you were drunk.

343
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,040
Drink this now so that you can sober up when Tian picks you up home.

344
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,840
See? It's much better.

345
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,160
It's a pity

346
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,800
that a beautiful girl like you is single.

347
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,960
If I were Earn, I definitely wouldn't let you go.

348
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,280
Can you please not mention that person?

349
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,040
Then

350
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,920
tonight,

351
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,000
it's just the two of us, right?

352
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,130
Excuse me, I would like one Virgin and On The Rocks.

353
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,720
You're so good.

354
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,480
Knowing what to order.

355
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,560
Hey, I'm in a hotel industry.

356
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,280
This is very basic.

357
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,280
Prey.

358
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,700
How dare you slap me?

359
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,400
This is a blessing not to kill you.

360
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,390
You… evil wicked. You trash.

361
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,640
You worthless trash.

362
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,260
Can you hold her a bit?

363
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,160
I'll take care of this witch myself.

364
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,600
I just found out that Tian has a jellyfish as her girlfriend.

365
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,640
You looks innocent,

366
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,320
but in reality, you're full of poison.

367
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,560
But it's better than you.

368
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,040
At first you seemed friendly.

369
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,680
But you're clearly a snake.

370
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,760
If you dare, go ahead.

371
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,720
But I can assure you that

372
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,880
your business will surely be ruined.

373
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,440
Tian, Prey definitely can't go home in this condition.

374
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,000
Thir, take Prey and Earl to the Sittalrat Palace.

375
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,160
Let me deal with this evil friend first.

376
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,440
All the companies I have shares in at Crawford,

377
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,520
I want to cancel all contracts.

378
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,040
If you are not satisfied, sue me.

379
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,280
I give you Prey. Please take good care of my sister.

380
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,760
Kassakorn.

381
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,840
Let's go. / Move.

382
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,760
You gave Prey to Earl,

383
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,670
but you stop me?

384
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,760
Yes.

385
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,760
Why?

386
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,240
Because my sister loves her.

387
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,680
And Earl never used low-level methods to win like you.

388
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,200
But Earl doesn't love Prey.

389
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,410
I'm the one who loves Prey.

390
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,400
This is not called love.

391
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,560
Have you ever thought about

392
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,520
what would happen if she were yours against her will?

393
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,840
If you really love my sister,

394
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,800
Then don't use such low methods.

395
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,080
And every project

396
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,800
that Methakorn has done with Crawford,

397
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,840
I will cancel them all.

398
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,040
Tian, I'm your friend.

399
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,080
Friend?

400
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,100
Not anymore

401
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Today, you sleep at Sittalrat Palace first.

402
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,200
I'll give you a ride to your palace tomorrow morning.

403
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,920
What's the matter?

404
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,280
Your body is warm and fragrant.

405
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,120
That's why I don't want to stop hugging you.

406
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,200
If you don't let go of me now,

407
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:23,480
you can't let go of me for the rest of your life, my dear.

408
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,600
Since the first time we met,

409
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,160
I can't let go of you anymore.

410
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,760
I'm ready to fly with you everywhere,

411
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,560
every place,

412
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,120
with the wind of love.

413
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,920
Hello, Tian.

414
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,480
Hello, Ms. Sinee.

415
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,920
Tonight, Prey will sleep at my friend's house.

416
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,400
She will be back home tomorrow.

417
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,760
Please tell Grandpa about this.

418
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,600
Okay, I will inform the Prince.

419
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,040
Thanks a lot.

420
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,640
Yes, goodnight.

421
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,480
Is that Tian?

422
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:06,880
Yes.

423
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,720
She asked me to tell you that

424
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,280
Prey will be sleeping at her friend's house. She will be returning tomorrow.

425
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,320
Tian's friend that is called Earl?

426
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,760
Yes.

427
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,280
Earl?

428
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,560
Kassakorn,

429
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,000
daughter of M.R. Sasimonthon

430
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,040
Sittalrat,

431
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:38,800
right?

432
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,400
Grandma,

433
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,560
I'm Ahatsakorn, your grandson.

434
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,080
I…

435
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,720
I'm well aware that the two families have had a great deal of conflict.

436
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,480
But what should I do?

437
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,680
I just want this whole thing to end.

438
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,680
Grandma,

439
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,440
please take care

440
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,440
of my granddaughter Prey.

441
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,880
I hope that what you wish for

442
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,120
will come true.

443
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,000
What happened?

444
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:18,480
Your dear sister has disappeared somewhere.

445
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,000
You mean Wee?

446
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,270
There is no way.

447
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,920
I'm very worried about Wee, my son.

448
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,920
She'll be okay, Mother.

449
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:44,230
We found her. We found her.

450
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,240
We have found Lady Wee, Your Majesty.

451
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,960
Wee, where is she?

452
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,040
Oh, why are you delaying? Hurry up and tell me.

453
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,000
She passed away in the canal at the end of the palace

454
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,320
along with Miss Kwan, Sir.

455
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
My dear Wee.

456
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,920
Mother.

457
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Please calm down.

458
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,240
What's wrong, Your Highness?

459
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,810
I feel…

460
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,160
a little uneasy.

461
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,680
Is this about Lady Piangrawee?

462
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,320
Last night, the lady didn't take me away.

463
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,400
She has never broken a promise even once.

464
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,320
The lady did not come even though she knew

465
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:57,240
that my lady would have a wedding ceremony this morning.

466
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,840
This might be her answer.

467
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,960
My daughter is so pretty.

468
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:14,960
You are becoming one with Panudejrangsee.

469
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,000
In the future,

470
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:26,680
you will know how much I have done for you.

471
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,960
Alright, once you're all dressed up,

472
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,720
hurry up and go to the ceremony, or we won't make it in time

473
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,440
for His Highness's visit.

474
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,960
Kaew.

475
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,360
What's the matter, Your Highness?

476
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,960
The water pouring ceremony is unlikely to be completed,

477
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,680
but the royal holy water should be considered complete.

478
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,880
How could my daughter's wedding be so miserable?

479
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,880
Your Highness, don't let this go.

480
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,160
It is necessary, Your Highness,

481
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,740
that we cannot hold this auspicious event.

482
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,720
Why?

483
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,600
Is my daughter not worthy?

484
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,920
It has nothing to do with her.

485
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,360
Now all the relatives have gathered at Utsanakhorn Palace.

486
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,720
Why are they going there? Did someone die?

487
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,400
Yes, there is.

488
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,360
And Utsanakhorn blamed it on us.

489
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,720
Who died? Who did it?

490
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,120
What did they do?

491
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,360
M.J. Piangrawee's boat

492
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,680
capsized, leading to her death at the end of Utsanakhorn Palace last night.

493
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,040
Lady. / Daughter.

494
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,560
Your Highness, this way, please.

495
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,200
Relax, slowly.

496
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,920
My dear. / Mother.

497
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,080
Your Highness.

498
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,120
Calm down.

499
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,640
Take it easy.

500
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,830
You'll be fine.

501
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,560
Calm down, calm down.

502
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,920
Mother.

503
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,960
Do you already know about this?

504
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:36,880
What do you mean?

505
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,280
You're accusing me now.

506
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,560
Piangrawee is my fiancé.

507
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,320
Suddenly she died on my sister's wedding day.

508
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,000
And this.

509
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,840
How did your subordinate Boon

510
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:00,120
have a bag of money stamped with the seal of Sittalrat Palace?

511
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,600
How will you answer me?

512
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,280
I didn't think things would escalate this far.

513
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,120
I didn't want anyone to die.

514
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,200
So you let Boon sink Wee's boat last night?

515
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,120
I knew it.

516
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,760
The low class people…

517
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,360
They must have done something low.

518
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,560
M.J. Utsanee.

519
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,120
Are you behind my daughter's death?

520
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:33,440
Why？

521
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,440
How could you think of hurting Wee like this?

522
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,080
We will soon be related.

523
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,760
Your Highness.

524
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,000
Please let us arrest you and send you to the authorities.

525
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,080
Please take it easy.

526
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:49,480
Why？

527
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,210
Why do we have to be calm?

528
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,320
Your mother didn't even think about the consequence.

529
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,800
Come with me to the police now.

530
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,000
What are you doing?

531
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,800
Ratchanon.

532
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,520
This is Sittalrat Palace.

533
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,240
You don't have evidence

534
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:09,760
Fine.

535
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,240
If the law can't do anything,

536
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,080
I will depend on karma instead.

537
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,720
I, Princess Utsanee Utsanakhorn,

538
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,640
the wife of Your Highness,

539
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,300
will curse you from now on.

540
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,760
You will never be happy.

541
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,680
No heir, the royal family will end here.

542
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,000
There will be no male heirs

543
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,560
from now on.

544
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,160
Because

545
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,640
the bloodline is mixed with that of the lower class.

546
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,120
And all of Utsanakhorn's descendants

547
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,680
will hold a grudge

548
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,760
against Sittalrat in every life.

549
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:23,600
What's wrong?

550
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,160
Why are you crying?

551
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:29,400
I'm not.

552
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,440
What kind of good kid is lying since early morning?

553
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,440
I'm not lying. The tears just flowed on their own.

554
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,560
That's what they call crying.

555
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,840
I'm just sad.

556
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:54,960
What are you sad about?

557
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,520
What happened last night.

558
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,920
I don't deserve it.

559
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,040
Don't be like this, my love.

560
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,600
I was so happy last night.

561
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,800
Don't you feel the same way with me?

562
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:30,920
I love you.

563
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,240
But what we did was wrong.

564
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,240
Because you already has a fiancé.

565
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,790
No one owns me.

566
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,040
Your fiancé does.

567
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,120
Just because we're engaged

568
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,740
doesn't mean I love him.

569
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:04,480
But he still has the right.

570
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:08,760
Should I break off the engagement for you?

571
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,600
I prepared some Sum Pun Nee and hot tea for you.

572
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,800
You have some to refresh your body.

573
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,640
After I'm done eating, I'll drive you to the palace.

574
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:05,280
Since we're dating now, can I go inside your house?

575
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,400
You can drop me off at the front of the palace like usual.

576
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,970
I don't want you to waste your time.

577
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,960
Not at all.

578
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:18,320
Today I want to drop you off inside.

579
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,840
Let's do it next time.

580
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,560
You rejected me like this, are you afraid that people will see us?

581
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:33,640
Anyway, you're not good at lying.

582
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,080
Then drop me off inside the palace.

583
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:18,120
You forgot your phone.

584
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:20,680
Thank you.

585
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:43,560
You come back at this hour?

586
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,000
Who gave you a ride?

587
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,900
I think it's familiar face.

588
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:55,640
Tian's friend. We just met at the mall, so she came to drop me off.

589
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,600
When your father was young,

590
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,280
I raised him much more strictly than this.

591
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,120
But with you,

592
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,880
I think I'm too kind.

593
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,400
So you dare to lie to me so blatantly.

594
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,680
I didn't lie to you.

595
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:31,440
I didn't say that you lied about what happened earlier.

596
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,760
But you got a friend who is many years older than you?

597
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,160
I told you it's Tian's friend.

598
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:52,680
But you didn't tell me that she was from Sittalrat.

599
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,080
Do you have any other excuses?

600
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,280
No.

601
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,120
From now on, you are not allowed to leave the palace for 2 weeks.

602
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,760
I'm going to confiscate your mobile phone too.

603
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,000
Sir, being grounded is fine,

604
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,780
but confiscating her phone, I think…

605
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:30,680
Yes.

606
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:34,040
It's okay.

607
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:36,600
I will do as Grandpa said.

608
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:38,280
Prey.

609
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,400
Here's my phone.
