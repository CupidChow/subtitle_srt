(Tokiwa) Aoba.

342
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:25,188
(Hazuru) I'm sorry earlier.

343
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,023
In the main tournament
Mine too...

344
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:42,881
No, I was the one who committed the foul.
That's not a line I can say.

345
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:45,254
yes.

346
00:21:45,254 --> 00:21:48,485
I'll do my best.

347
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:04,782
≪I am
I was just following Kenshin's back≫

348
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:09,023
≪But you
Trying to defeat Kenshin≫

349
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:13,782
≪You're the line I can't cross
I was on the other side≫

350
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:17,122
≪That strange tenacity. ➡

351
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:19,155
So are you strong?

Someday, I will win against Kenshin.

358
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:47,815
Oh, that's hot.

<For fighting as a grappler➡

Not yet
Although some issues remain➡

369
00:23:21,924 --> 00:23:25,782
Aoba successfully passed the preliminaries>

From this
A lottery will be held for the Bantam class tournament.

374
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,957
I'm the one who will win this tournament!

375
00:23:42,957 --> 00:23:45,518
Is it you? Who is your opponent in the first round?

376
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:48,485
That's pretty tough.
It's fucking boring.

377
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:52,254
How Nueji fights
It's a real fight.

378
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:55,617
After all, me too
I want a striking weapon.

379
00:23:55,617 --> 00:24:00,000
There's no way I'll lose.
Something! This murderous intent.

380
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,221
There's no way I'll lose.
Something! This murderous intent.

381
00:24:00,221 --> 00:24:02,716
Don't let me escape!

382
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:04,924
I might be able to do this.
