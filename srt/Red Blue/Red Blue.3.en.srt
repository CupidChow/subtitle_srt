00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:11,094
(Sound to practice)

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,013
(Tokiwa) Yes

3
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,351
(Tokiwa) Come on, Aoba (Aoba) Do you escape? this

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,519
Come on shrimp shrimp!

5
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:22,022
shrimp! Let's turn the frame! Shoulder and waist!

6
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,442
(Rainbear (Anamachi)) "Don't get paid with this grader"?

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,653
Would you like to leave this world?

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,697
(Tokiwa) Yes!

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,158
Stay moving, keep moving!

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,452
(Rainbase) Because there was something unpleasant 17 times today

11
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,454
If you don't have 18 times

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,918
(Tokiwa) That's right ...

13
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,670
That's right

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,881
You can get it

15
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:51,051
You can go to the triangle, so you can get your skills

16
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,261
(Tokiwa) Use your feet!

17
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:57,390
(Rainlands) The business quota is not the only one, but ...

18
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,892
(Tokiwa) Put on a little more

19
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,518
(Aoba) Uh ...

20
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,688
(Tokiwa) is a big and bigger thing.

Aoba's idea ...

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,903
Thank you for your hard work!

24
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,238
(Narration) It wasn't that sweet

25
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,490
(Tokiwa) Someone buy a beer

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,702
(Tokiwa) Iwase!

27
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,120
(Iwase) This is Muri!

Martial arts with the highest degree of freedom where all attacks are allowed

31
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,050
That is the general martial arts MMA!

33
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,896
(Tokiwa) Put down ... Let's drop your waist

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,316
(Aoba) How can you be so ugly?

35
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,700
Have you ever seen such a person in the city?

36
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:43,163
People who disturb their hair and endlessly tweet

37
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:48,626
A person who raises a loud voice and kicks off the roadside

38
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,630
I wonder if I will not talk to it

39
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,012
I'm not a instructor

40
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,859
(Tokiwa) It's imprisoned, first cling to that wall

41
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:14,861
yes

42
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,488

(chime)

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,832
(Iwase) Well, the sleeping technique of Mr. Ame is so amazing

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,962
Because all games have been superior to sleeping techniques ⸺

47
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,131
Because it ’s a former ranker of a professional group

48
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,092
(Aoba) Is the ranker amazing?

49
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:43,348
(Iwase) Because only the powerful people enter the ranking of professional groups

50
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,353
Well, the former top player of the organization was Tokiwa -san

51
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,067
If you are so amazing, I want you to teach me sleeping techniques

52
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,577
There are two types of sleeping techniques, strangling techniques and joint techniques

53
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,330
First, use your hands and feet ...

54
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,833
Compress the opponent's airway and carotid artery

55
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,629
This is the front chalk of the squeezing technique

56
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,386
Next, the joints of the arms and legs

57
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,889
Control with the opposite of the movable direction

58
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,308
This is an optic of joint techniques

59
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,643
(Aoba) Uh ...

60
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,145
(Iwase) Hmm ...

61
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,274
This is the finally arm cross

62
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,359
Hey!

63
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,236
I'm telling me once!

64
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,988
(Aoba) Uh ...

65
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,536
So can I try to squeeze the next triangle?

66
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,745
(Iwase)

67
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,666
(Iwase) Good ...

68
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,965
(Aoba) If you raise your neck, you will drop it because this hand will be stretched

69
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,300
(Sound of hand)

70
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:06,764
… Put your left foot on the other person's left

71
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,182
Yeah

72
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,100
(Iwase) Did you understand?

73
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,727
-(Aoba) I understand (Iwase)

74
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,978
(Aoba) Good

75
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,565
Good

76
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,321
Good

77
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,031
(Voice heard from the outside)

78
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,866
-(Fist) No, next week- (Satoda / Sojima) Next week?

79
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,660
(Aoba) Oh, Ken -kun

80
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,831
If you master this technique, you can see the face that is suffering well

81
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,626
(Sound strangled)

82
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,087
(Iwase) Aoba Aoba ...

83
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,883
(Aoba) I want to win with this technique if I can fight Kenshin -kun

84
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,800
(Iwase) Aoba!

85
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,844
Hahaha ...

86
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:45,803
(Aoba) Iwase -kun is okay?

87
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,306
(Iwase) If you tap it, remove it

88
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,974
(Aoba) I'm sorry I was crazy

89
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,059
(Iwase) I fell

90
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,101
(Sekikomi)

91
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,321
(Aoba)

92
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,330
(Sekikomi)

93
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,626
I have to do the 10th time 3 times ...

94
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,543
Hu ...

95
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,838
(Freing your hand)

96
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,221
(Iwase) Uh ...

97
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:32,934
(Tokiwa) Oh ... it's a pattern I'm good at.

98
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,318
(Rainbear) He is trying to absorb my sleeping technique

99
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:46,697
This does not cause stress relief

100
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,787
(Aoba) Rainland, please.

101
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:04,257
(Aoba) After all, sleeping techniques have no choice

102
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,177
-(Aoba) Hey Iwase-kun- (Iwase) Eh?

103
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,095
Oh ...

104
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,108
(Aoba) Uh ...

105
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,819
(Aoba) One more time

106
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,206
With your feet ... yeah yes

107
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,249
Aoba Nice!

108
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,868
Does this mean something?

109
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,953
Yeah?

110
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,415
(Tokiwa) Yes, do your best! Two more round trips!

111
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,459
Yes back ~

112
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,128
Hey Aoba! Do you want to stop?

113
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:26,672
(Aoba)!

114
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,717
(Aoba) One more time

115
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:31,677
(Aoba) One more time

116
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,138
(Aoba) Iwase -kun again

117
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,021
(Iwase) Huh ...

118
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,523
(Aoba) Hahah ...

119
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,149
Hey, what happened!

120
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,819
That's why MMA Koshien (Koshinen) champion is Muri!

121
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,947
Do you want to stop! Is it over!

122
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,864
(Aoba / Iwase) Yes!

123
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,699
Good luck!

124
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,387
(Aoba) Sleeping is fun

125
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,640
(Iwase) Hahah ...

126
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,933
(Aoba) Iwase -kun again

127
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,769
(Iwase) Aoba Please forgive me

128
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:33,406
(Rainbreak) Premature young people burning towards their dreams ...

129
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:38,327
Especially since he came, it was uncomfortable

130
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,415
I'm already here ...

131
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:52,800
He wants to win the MMA Koshien and defeat his fist on the professional stage

132
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,513
Hey ... It's okay to have a big dream

133
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,307
that's why…

134
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,059
I'll ask you Amama chin

135
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,438
(Tap sound)

136
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,232
(Iwase) Hahah ...

137
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,158
Mr. Ameji, please sparring

138
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,996
I…

139
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,666
You might break you

140
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,362
(Aoba) Yeah? Why did you grab your left hand?

141
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,325
Oh, it's going to be a chalk jama

142
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,754
(Aoba) If you raise your upper body, the triangle will not be extreme.

143
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,381
Then next ...

144
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,686
(Rainland)!

145
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,853
(Tokiwa) A little stop stop

146
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,355
A little amachin!

147
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,898
Overdoing

148
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,650
(Rainbear) Hu ...

149
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:39,782
(Aoba) I wonder if I can master Kento -kun if there is a rainste -san's technology.

150
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:46,664
Even if you're doing it with you, it's the same as dealing with dolls

151
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,251
Dolls do not release stress

152
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,546
Understand the feelings of the partner who can be the other party

153
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,089
It's annoying

154
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,560
(Tokiwa) Don't worry

155
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,813
Amachin is like you

156
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,859
Maybe the young man heading for the future has a disability

157
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,529
There is also a family

158
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:21,198
I retired because I couldn't eat it

159
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,243
I have a strong talent because I have talent.

160
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,955
I didn't want you to retire

161
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:32,501
But it was really strong

162
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,962
(Aoba) That's right

163
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,235
(Rainbase) At least just a new estimate

164
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,820
If you can read it ...

165
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,238
please

166
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,074
Thank you!

167
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,286
(Young man) Isn't your head down many times and pride?

168
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,955
Thank you

169
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,796
(Rainbreak) The 12th unreasonable behavior younger

170
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,049
(Mobile phone: boss) You can't get the numbers

171
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,342
It's the same as a doll!

172
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,384
yes

173
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,680
(Boss) Do you have a head to understand? Go back until the contract is decided!

174
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,308
Yes I understand

175
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,018
I'm sorry

176
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,980
(Rainland) I gave up my dream, but if I get serious, anyone can break it

177
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,067
That pride supports me

178
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,071
So I still go to the gym occasionally

179
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:49,370
But my peace is being threatened now

180
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,416
(Tokiwa) What? Yeah! Will you quit?

181
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,752
Oh, it's pulled out!

182
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,713
Wow, it's really good!

183
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,714
(Rainbase) No ...

184
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,341
Maybe you return to professional?

185
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,259
(Rainbase) No ...

186
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,427
(Tokiwa) Uwa -Seriously ... I can't go!

187
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,305
It's a little amachiin!

188
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,266
If you want to return to the professional, don't go from home

189
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,601
(Rainbase) No, not

190
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:17,481
I have retired among young people who pursue my dreams, and I feel uncomfortable.

191
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:22,736
(Tokiwa) Please reconsider that, but I think they will be good with them.

192
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,290
(Aoba) Rainland

193
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:38,711
If I take one at the next spar, please tell me sleeping technique

194
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,718
You said you wouldn't tell you anymore

195
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,388
And you can't get one from me with your ability

196
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,602
Then I will quit this gym if I can't get one

197
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,646
(Iwase) Hey! Are you really saying that?

198
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,773
(The sound of joint sounds)

199
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,034
Are you going to be the protagonist of the story?

200
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,789
(Rainbear) Junior high school was driven into judo

201
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,334
It ended with the prefectural tournament prize

202
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:25,341
MMA started as a hobby from college because I was good at sleeping techniques

203
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,344
You can do sleeping techniques that were prohibited in judo

204
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,848
Immediately add to MMA and achieve results even with amateurs

205
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,517
Participated in professional groups

206
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,941
(Rainbase) This is the 6th.

207
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,945
5 years since I retired

208
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:49,740
What am I continuing for martial arts now?

209
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,367
(Tokiwa) Firmly

210
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,373
(Tokiwa) Good, good, good, pushing in

211
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,459
Yes to push without losing

212
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,044
(Iwase) Get out!

213
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,846
Huh ...

214
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,483
Good!

215
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,240
(Tokiwa)

216
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,408
(Iwase) Get out

217
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,121
Amachin

218
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,582
I always expect the opponent's movement and read ahead

219
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,585
(Iwase) Please take one of the Aoba round!

220
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,840
(Aoba) Escape with a hardened shoulder is under the head so that your arms are not washed away ...

221
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,468
(Sound of empty cans falling)

222
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,275
(Iwase) Did you make this kind of memo so much!

223
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,420
(Aoba) After all, my movement as the Theory is

224
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,007
I'm reading everything

225
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,383
that's why…

226
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,766
(Rainbear) I'm reading

227
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,103
Then I'll take the back as it is

228
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,910
(Sound strangled)

229
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,958
Front chalk at this time

230
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,295
Is this a coincidence?

231
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,005
(Iwase) No

232
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:13,383
I read him properly

233
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,806
(Aoba) December 24, 2019

234
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,891
Tokiwa to rain

235
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,103
3 rounds 4 minutes 59 seconds

236
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:28,816
Rainland's fainting with Tokiwa -san's front chalk

237
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,284
(Aoba) Iwase -kun again!

238
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,537
(Iwase) How many times have you done this ...

239
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,628
I have to work a little faster ...

240
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,881
Faster and unconsciously than to think ...

241
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,719
(Aoba) I wrote the sleeping technique I was taught every day.

242
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,013
I've practiced with Iwase -kun

243
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,394
I want the rainste to teach me sleeping techniques

244
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,895
Take one here!

245
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,192
(Rainbase) If you do it, you can still go

246
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,532
(Daughter in the rainy area) Don't papa

247
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,335
(Rainland) But to me now ...

248
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,256
(Rainbear) Uh ...

249
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,260
(Timer alarm)

250
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,726
(Rainbase) Huh ... huh ...

251
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,437
(Aoba) I took one

252
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,732
Huh ... Hahahaha ...

253
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:56,236
I took the probability of less than 1,000th of him

254
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,034
Yes, Aoba brought here with one time

255
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,870
(Rainland) Huh ...

256
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,628
(Aoba) Rainland

257
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,839
Will you tell me this?

258
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,641
(Rainland) I don't like it, who said that?

259
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,935
What are the evidence? Did you record it?

260
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:32,064
And in the first place, it's about winning or losing people's behavior

261
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:36,318
There is no recognition that ignores such personal dignity.

262
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,112
(Iwase) Wow, a large adult is quibble ...

263
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,573
(Rainlands) Oh, I'm glad this was an adult.

264
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,285
Then I will quit this gym

265
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:49,456
(Tokiwa) That's not right

266
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,541
No, it's Zului! Because if it was a game ...

267
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,087
“If it was a game” and “on a professional ring”

268
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,257
“If you were more sticky, you might have been able to get out”

269
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,803
But I'm not a professional anymore

270
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:06,390
I can't talk about "on the ring".

271
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,685
(Aoba) I think it's cool

272
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,270
Cool?

273
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,149
There is also the strength of those who pursue dreams

274
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,652
I think there is also the strength of the person who gave up my dream

275
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,617
Even if you have a big dream like you, you can't say

276
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,664
Anyway, I want to defeat my longing fist and stand at the top of the same generation

277
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,458
You just have a big goal easily

278
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:39,756
I just hate Kenshin -kun.

279
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,718
So suffer from sleeping techniques

280
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:48,098
I just want to see Kenshin -kun's face

281
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,351
(Iwase) I was irritated by the fist who was kind

282
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,979
It's a dangerous guy who started MMA

283
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:59,317
I'm with an old man who is sharpened by a train

284
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,156
(The sound of joint sounds)

285
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,718
What are you on this side?

286
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:30,348
That's why I said it

287
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,935
(Snowbreak in the rainy area)

288
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,564
(Narration) The rainbase becomes the teacher

289
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,485
Aoba who took a step as a grapler

290
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,821
But MMA Koshien qualifying

291
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:47,449
I was approaching that soon

292
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,950
(Tokiwa) You guys!

293
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,285
(Rainbear) Stop! Yes stop stop

294
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,204
Stop stop stop stop

295
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,748
(Tokiwa) The combination of qualifying has been decided

296
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,084
Yes ...

297
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,919
(Iwase) Where is Aoba?

298
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,754
(Tokiwa) Aoba is here

299
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,966
(Tap sound)

300
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,344
(Tokiwa) In the group of Aoba

301
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,346
This is the strongest.

302
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,681
Moreover, this year's championship candidate

303
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,517
(Hazuru) This is Yuza Kazuru

304
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,477
Next to my fist

305
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,313
We will win MMA Koshien!

306
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,025
(Kenshin) Even though Hanasuru is such a handsome guy

307
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,944
From the same genius as me

308
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,237
It's impossible other than winning

309
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,321
(Kazuru) Stop it!

310
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,280
(Fist) maybe

311
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,782
Are you nervous because you're turning the camera?

312
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,325
(Kazuru) Don't be nervous!

313
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,411
(Sunny gym student) One two three!

314
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,662
Yes one two three!

315
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,081
(Iwase) Sharp striking strikes

316
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,708
The type is similar and the cranes are ...

317
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,001
(Sunny gym student) One two three!

318
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,461
yes!

319
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,964
(Iwase) It may be a virtual fist.

320
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,048
(Sunny gym student) One two!

321
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,591
(Sunny gym student) One two three!

322
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,094
yes! One -two three!

323
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:50,846
yes!

324
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,723
Our Prince Genius Hanaku Senpai

325
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,268
(Aoba) It moves like a feather

326
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,394
You may have understood the weakness of Hanaku -kun

327
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,478
Keep out even if you die

328
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,148
(Kazuru) I'm not a genius

329
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,107
Definitely win

330
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,861
(Aoba) Be sure to defeat virtual fist spirit!
