So about Iwase-kun too.
I took lots of notes.

185
00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:53,396
Mr. Iwase
It's the first friend I made.

Hehe, even a monkey can understand➡

255
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:45,330
I'll explain. Hmm. ➡

256
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,363
What is mixed martial arts?

257
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:50,627
Also called "MMA". ➡

258
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:53,726
A mix of all martial arts
It's a martial art.

259
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,231
(Tokiwa)
Boxing is only about punches. ➡

260
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,000
Wrestling is only about throwing. ➡

261
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,957
Wrestling is only about throwing. ➡

262
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:04,594
Judo is only for throwing. ➡

263
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:08,924
But in MMA, you can punch.

264
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:10,957
Ugh!
(Tokiwa) You can kick me.

265
00:15:10,957 --> 00:15:13,825
Ugh! Tokiwa-san, it hurts.
(Tokiwa) Then you can throw it. ➡

266
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,825
Then you can tighten it.
Ugh...

267
00:15:16,825 --> 00:15:19,462
The rest is...
Ugh! Wow!

268
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:22,462
Hmm... extremely good.

269
00:15:22,462 --> 00:15:25,000
Hitting, throwing, pole.
All attacks are allowed➡

270
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,330
The most flexible martial art➡

271
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,594
That's mixed martial arts.

272
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:35,099

I lowered my head≫

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,561
≪Why did I just get punched?
I lowered my head≫

342
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:04,594
≪Unable to do anything
I don't want it to end on my own≫

343
00:19:04,594 --> 00:19:10,198
≪Anything is fine
I want to leave me behind! ≫

344
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:14,495
Huh!
≪This guy... in an overwhelmingly inferior position➡

345
00:19:14,495 --> 00:19:17,000
Are you looking for a chance to win? ≫

346
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,099
Phew... Hey...

347
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:21,198
Oh! I drank too much...ugh...

348
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:24,363
Stand up!
≪What I can leave behind...≫

349
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,462
≪What I can do now...≫

350
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:30,000
≪This stance... is it karate? ≫

351
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,561
≪This stance... is it karate? ≫

352
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:32,594
Wow!

353
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:37,891
≪Is it a well-prepared formal fist strike?≫

354
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:40,660
≪With that tiny weapon
You often stood up to me≫

355
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,891
(Tokiwa) Hmm!
≪What I wanted to see➡

356
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,561
neither talent nor skill
That's the spirit! ≫

357
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,594
Ah! Ugh...

358
00:19:50,594 --> 00:19:53,231
Strengthen your shoulders!

359
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:57,792
Okay, you.
It really blew me away.

360
00:19:57,792 --> 00:20:00,000
I passed.

361
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,363
I passed.

362
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:03,198
Ugh, uh... uh...

363
00:20:03,198 --> 00:20:07,858
Hey, tap! Aoba! Aoba!

364
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:10,792
≪Iwase-kun...≫
Aoba!

365
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,363
≪What is “tap”? ≫

366
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,198
Hey, wake up.

367
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a little too tight.
As expected.

368
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,462
It's a little too tight.
As expected.

369
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:34,231
No, it can't be helped.
It's definitely too much.

370
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:36,264
Because
Don't tap that guy.

371
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:38,297
I don't know.

372
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:44,396
Ha!

373
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:50,594
Mr. Iwase...
Oh, did you notice?

374
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:55,957
Iwase-kun, just now for the first time.
It's like you're calling my name...

375
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:58,957
It's there.

376
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,000
Hmm... Iwase.

377
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,627
Hmm... Iwase.

378
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:04,396
Iwase….
What is it?

379
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,528
Ah~ You say it nicely
Please let me join.

380
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:10,495
It's impossible.
You got beaten up all of a sudden, right?

381
00:21:10,495 --> 00:21:13,264
(Tokiwa) No, you guys are friends.
Huh? We're not friends...

382
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:15,297
(Tokiwa) Huh?

383
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,825
≪Damn it! I couldn't do anything≫

384
00:21:19,825 --> 00:21:22,099
≪Kenshin-kun has been with me since before I could remember➡

385
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:27,132
Are you living in a world like this?
Hurry... we need to start soon≫

386
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:30,000
(Tokiwa) I don't really understand.
It's going well.

387
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,264
(Tokiwa) I don't really understand.
It's going well.

388
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:34,033
Maybe I hit you too hard
I really got the screw out of my head.

389
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:40,759
some time ago
Did you say "passed"?

390
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:42,924
(Tokiwa) Oh...
please!

391
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:52,000
Okay!
Then I'll train you from scratch.

392
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,198
Tough training too
Can you bear it?

393
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:56,792
yes!
(Tokiwa) Okay. Well then, Aoba➡

394
00:21:56,792 --> 00:22:00,000
The game is next week.
yes!

395
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,231
The game is next week.
yes!

396
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,495
game?
(Tokiwa) Yeah. 1 week later➡

397
00:22:03,495 --> 00:22:06,330
There is a sunny dojo and a newcomer meet-up. ➡

398
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,396
No, my house
There's only one newcomer, Aoba, right? ➡

399
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:11,528
It seems like everyone has quit.
No, that's...

400
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:15,000
A game in a week...

401
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,231
Don't worry.
My opponent is also a newcomer with only 3 months of experience in martial arts.

402
00:22:22,198 --> 00:22:25,528
1 week vs 3 months...

403
00:22:27,627 --> 00:22:30,000
Aren't you scared?

404
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,066
Aren't you scared?

405
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:33,330
Someday, you'll give Kenshin a punch, right?

No…➡

418

428
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:56,198
I felt like there was a shadowy person here.

429
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:59,693
I don't remember much.
I'll make sure you remember it.

430
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:00,000
I'll be reborn.
Seriously?

431
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,858
I'll be reborn.
Seriously?

432
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:05,000
It might be real.
I want to win and tell you something.
