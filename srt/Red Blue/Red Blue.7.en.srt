1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,892
(Iwase) That's bad

2
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,938
Anyway, I have to take a little break until the game

3
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,024
(Tokiwa) Fu...

4
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:31,740
In both games, I fought almost four minutes in full and had muscle fatigue, so I couldn't put any effort into it.

5
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,491
And the other person is

6
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:37,203
Physical Monster Hachiya and Mamoru are almost the same

7
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,211
You're barely using your physical strength in the match against Kureishi.

8
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:49,883
(Takiwa) Ah, it seemed Kureishi dominant in the beginning.

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,176
Come a bit

10
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,762
(Video audio: Gong)

11
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,643
(Tokiwa) Kureishi did not take a single blow

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,063
I brought it to my special triangle choke.

13
00:01:04,772 --> 00:01:08,234
Perhaps he himself was sure he would win.

14
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,277
But...

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,653
(Tokiwa) Hashiya's physicality is

16
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,863
It was out of standard

17
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,532
(Iwase) Could it be a power bomb from here?

18
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,784
That's a foul!

19
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,537
No, I'm not throwing it

20
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,166
But every human being has a sense of fear

21
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,751
If it's dropped from this height...

22
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,836
(Time)

23
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,674
The momentary terror of the ruistones Do not let the momentary slacking go away

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,801
Hatya escaped

25
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,554
Finally, we'll start with the right body of Hataya.

26
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,099
An unusually widening, ending with a left straight

27
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,851
When it's over, match time is 37 seconds

28
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,522
I sank Kureishi into the mat in just two shots.

29
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,776
Perhaps the next one will win

30
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,864
This is just a smear, and it's over

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,120
Are you going to show this video?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

32
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,293
Even the very best Aoba might be scared to see this

33
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:13,216
(Aoba) It's definitely better than Kureishi-san

34
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,343
Aoba Was he awake?

35
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,553
Are you scared?

36
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:28,273
(Aoba) I probably couldn't beat Kureishi-san with his ground technique.

37
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,485
I wonder if there's still a possibility if it's a pottery shop.

38
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,904
Hey, don't rest yet

39
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:39,409
I want to watch the next match at the pottery

40
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,331
Leave it to me, you should recover as much as possible.

41
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,878
The video of the first round sums up his amazingness.

42
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,672
I asked later

43
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,507
(Iwase) Yes

44
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,507
(Sekkikomi)

45
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,346
(The sound of grabbing a note)

46
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,359
(Iwase) Looking at your eyes

47
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,780
I feel like they'll do it somehow

48
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,910
Let's have fun playing battles again today

49
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,334
(Clashing sound)

50
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,878
(Iwase) I'm an idiot

51
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:36,758
I was not aware of the sparkle of his eyes, but I was approached.

52
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,553
(Aoba) Frail, sick, poor, dark, and no dreams

53
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,846
What's wrong!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

54
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,226
(Iwase) Since the time he hits Kenshin

55
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,146
Your life has changed...

56
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,943
Iwase-kun is the first friend I made.

57
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,820
friend?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

58
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:04,244
(Iwase) At the same time, after you said you were a friend...

59
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,703
Hey, tap it!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

60
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,873
Aoba! Aoba!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

61
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,961
(Iwase) My eyes to look at you have started to change too

62
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,132
(Iwase) How your growth is...

63
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,178
Do your best, do your best...

64
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,556
Because I saw it the closest

65
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,815
(Iwase) I've been here in just a few months since then

66
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,404
I almost forget how amazing it is

67
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,617
You did it

68
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,831
Kenshin-kun's face is frustrating...

69
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,042
I want to make it smug and distort

70
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:01,092
(Iwase) Back then I thought it was an incredible fantasy,

71
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,515
(Iwase) If we win one more...

72
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,521
Once you've finished watching the video, take a break until the very last minute.

73
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:17,066
There's too much difference in physical strength left

74
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:24,532
How much will your opponent suffer in the second round?

75
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,911
Anyway, it's better to recover as much energy as possible

76
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,416
(Times) Ah... I don't think there's that time

77
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:37,670
(Iwase) Tokiwa-san Is it already over?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

78
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,756
(Takiwa) No, it didn't start

79
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,054
(Time) Huh...

80
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,805
The other party abstained

81
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,016
(Iwase) What...

82
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,852
So the pottery...

83
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:57,231
Ah, it's a bloodthirsty beast

84
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:12,330
(Amachi) I don't think there's much need to be pessimistic.

85
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,458
But this guy's power...

86
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,766
(Rainy area) If you don't enter the way you want...

87
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:36,687
What's more, the final was 3 minutes and 2 rounds, which is certainly tough.

88
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:44,612
However, if you're not exhausted, are you an opponent that can be won with strength?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,913
Originally, an opponent that cannot be helped by power or physicality

90
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,833
If so, you can just open it up

91
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:07,343
(Rainland) Compete with your skeleton rather than your strength

92
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,265
Any human being, all that remains when burned is bones

93
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,104
thank you

94
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,897
(Rainy area) Yes

95
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,235
(Slap sound)

96
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,071
In the tournament, the winner's contender loses

97
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,408
It's common for people who don't know what to do to win.

98
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,120
I don't know why, you're the one, Aoba

99
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,248
(Staff) Excuse me

100
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,419
For players participating in the finals, please reach the entrance to the venue.

101
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,883
In (rainy) I'm watching from the audience

102
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,137
(Takewa) Okay, shall we go!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

103
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,682
(Iwase)

104
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,730
If I win, I might seriously have a fight with Fist Shin

105
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,356
(Aoba) Yes

106
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,483
Okay

107
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,405
‪♪～‬

108
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,365
(Narration) Batting, pitching, and extreme

109
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,870
All attacks are permitted, the most flexible martial arts

110
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,414
That's MMA in MMA!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

111
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:07,547
‪～♪‬

112
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,295
(Hiraigi) It's like the Suzuki Aoba-kun Victims Association.

113
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:52,008
(Nueji) He's the one he played seriously, so if you honestly cheer him on, you should definitely cheer him on him.

114
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,261
It's the first time I've had such a tingly game

115
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,930
(Nuji) Hmm!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

116
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,558
(Nuji) Hmm!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

117
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,524
It was fun

118
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:10,359
interesting?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

119
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,486
Turn my reading over

120
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,655
At the end, he was mocked and exaggerated.

121
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,951
(Hiiragi) This is the first time I've had such a frustrating match

122
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,414
(Hazuru) My feelings towards Aoba-kun are different

123
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,541
Me...

124
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,134
It's scary

125
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:39,972
(Rainland) "Funny, frustrating, terrifying"

126
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,267
What am I?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

127
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:49,815
I wonder if I'm "excited"

128
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:57,365
(Announcer) Now, before the finals, we'd like to introduce you to some amazing guests.

129
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,825
(Announcer) First of all, this person

130
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:03,412
He once created an undefeated legend with the Boost ring.

131
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,331
Legends of the Martial Arts World

132
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:11,629
Takeru!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

133
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:16,717
(Applause and cheers)

134
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,326
And another

135
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:48,040
The divine child of the MMA world is now growing brighter

136
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,834
The winner of the previous tournament

137
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:54,839
Akasawa Fist Shin!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

138
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,551
(Applause and cheers)

139
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,361
Here's a major announcement to everyone

140
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,405
These two...

141
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,409
The next match at the BOOST has been decided!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

142
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,662
(Applause and cheers)

143
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,123
Seriously...

144
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,418
It's MMA Koshien. Who is the lead character?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

145
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,421
(Aoba) No matter what...

146
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:42,428
If we don't win today, Kenshin-kun will go out of reach.

147
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,183
So let's give each of them a few words at a time.

148
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,143
First off, Takeru's player

149
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,062
(Takeru) He's a lucky boy

150
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,523
If there was a tournament like this in my time

151
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,150
I'm winning with ease

152
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:02,281
(Applause and cheers)

153
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,783
(Announcer) Kenshin player

154
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,286
(Fist) Ah...

155
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,705
I've seen it on TV

156
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,500
About three years ago

157
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:17,421
(Applause and cheers)

158
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,839
(Announcer) Now, this time

159
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,383
What kind of stars will be born?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

160
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,804
The MMA Koshien bantamweight final will soon be!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

161
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,641
(Applause and cheers)

162
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,729
I'm getting nervous in the finals...

163
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,400
Why is Iwase-kun so nervous?になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

164
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,239
(Announcer) First, from the blue corner

165
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:49,328
Suzuki Aoba!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

166
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:55,417
(Applause and cheers)

167
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,178
(Announcer) Next, from the red corner

168
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:12,017
Hashiya Mori!になったんです。 English: The first thing you can do is to find the best one to do.

169
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,855
(Applause and cheers)

170
