00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,221
Haha...

180
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,310
(Iwase) Aim for the legs, legs! ‬

181
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,353
(Isshiki) as is
Just like that! ‬

182
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,443
(Isshiki) Go, go, go! ‬

183
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,161
(Tokiwa) It's a shame.

184
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,287
Suzuki goes to tackle! ‬

185
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,664
But Nueji
I successfully crushed this

186
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,210
(Male) Hey Nueji
Stay strong! 　Buy it! ‬

187
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,461
(Female) Is that okay? ‬

188
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:20,007
(Nueji) Kochitora A life-threatening scene of chaos
Go through it

189
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,510
(Male) Hey
Do it quickly! ‬

190
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,928
(Male) Hey
I don't know what you're doing! ‬

191
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,137
(Male) Hey
I don't understand! ‬
(Tamayo)
It's okay, Karimaru

192
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:25,221
(Tamayo)
It's okay, Karimaru

193
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,472
(Tamayo)
It's okay, Karimaru
Isn't it there? ‬

194
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,557
(Nueji) My mother
I cried all the time

195
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,351
(Male) Hey, get out! ‬
A yakuza family! ‬

196
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,396
(Nueji) I can't even remember his face.
Because of Sujimon's father...

197
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,940
(Male) You can hear me, right? ‬
(sound of window glass breaking)

198
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,817
(Male) Don't think this is the end! ‬

199
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,489
(Bad) Ugh...

200
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,993
(Delinquents groan)

201
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,288
(Nueji) The fight that was sold was
I bought everything, but

202
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,543
The people who got involved
Even if it's a blood festival

203
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,088
There's no way my mother will smile

204
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,008
(Nueji) Mother

205
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,554
I'm a professional
I'll make you smile

206
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,645
Oops, I caught your foot! ‬

207
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:17,982
(Nueji) Will you sink with a kick like that? ‬

208
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,487
(Nueji) The moment you defeat him like this
Stop it with a pound

209
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,453
(Aoba) Hmm! ‬

210
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,248
(Nueji) What? Before you defeat me! ‬

211
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:36,917
Ugh...

212
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,257
(Nueji) What? This murderous intent...

213
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:51,473
(Announcer) Arm crosses! ‬
Suzuki: Can you reach the limit? ‬

214
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,312
(Nueji) Hmm! ‬

215
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,731
Don't let me escape! ‬

216
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,648
Aoba! ‬

217
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,150
Hold it firmly between both feet! ‬

218
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,194
It's over when your arms are fully extended
Take your elbows out and run! ‬

219
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,697
(Nueji) Hmm! ‬

220
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,783
(Aoba) Wow! ‬

221
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,910
Time stop! ‬

222
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,707
referee
1 point deduction. Be careful.

223
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,083
(Audience) Ah...

224
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,793
announcer
Nueji intentionally attacked his opponent

225
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,588
Because there was an act of taking him out of the ring.
1 point deduction

226
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,214
resume from stand

227
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,507
male
Nueji: What are you doing? ‬

228
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,384
(Female) What are you doing? ‬

229
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,054
If it were you
You can do more! ‬

230
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,474
Shit... that's cowardly, isn't it?

231
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,810
With intuition cultivated through fights
You sensed the danger.

232
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:42,066
(Nueji) This guy
Only the ground fighting is filled with murderous intent.

233
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:46,445
(Aoba) Mikazuki doesn't work.
Unable to tackle

234
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,572
What should we do? ‬

235
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,788
(Aoba) Ah...

236
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,707
I might be able to do this

237
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,296
(Referee) Fight! ‬
(gong)

238
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,433
(Nueji) What to be careful about when doing standing techniques
Just the crescent moon on the left

239
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,478
(Nueji) Coming! ‬

240
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
(kicking sound)

241
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,111
(Aoba) Now
That's the trick you showed yesterday, right? ‬

242
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,737
Good thing I took notes

243
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,121
as a friend
As a friend who hates Kenshin-kun⸺

244
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,875
One shot at Kenshin-kun
Tell me how to make me punch you

245
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,170
(kicking sound)

246
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,340
(Announcer) Right high kick! ‬

247
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,302
(Iwase) Great! ‬

248
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,971
(Nueji) Shit! ‬

249
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:57,975
I think there is only ground training
be behind the curve

250
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:04,440
Chairman, forget the strategy for now.
Let me do what I want

251
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,152
(Nueji) Huh! Hmm! ‬

252
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:09,944
(Tokiwa) Get back! Back! ‬
That's right! That's right! ‬

253
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,281
(Tamayo) Ganmaru! keep it up! ‬

254
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,531
Go, Ganmaru! ‬

255
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,117
(Tokiwa) Yes.
Get it back! Get it back! ‬

256
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:19,496
Haha... After all, fighting MMA?

257
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,211
I'll take the demerit points too.
It's better to let them do it freely

258
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,589
I can unleash my wild power
Maybe it's okay

259
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,090
(Tokiwa) Be careful, be careful! ‬

260
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,176
announcer
Suzuki down! ‬

261
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,560
(Aoba) I hope you come.
That's what I thought

262
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,024
It's all about the stands

263
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,777
The verdict is still in my favor.

264
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,448
40 seconds left, ground game
You don't want to waste your time, right?

265
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,664
Go, go, go! Good luck, Ganmaru! ‬

266
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,835

268
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,048
(Tamayo) Go, go, go! ‬

269
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,133
(Nueji) Hmm! ‬

270
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,927
Huh! ‬

271
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,762
(Tamayo) Do your best, Karimaru! ‬

272
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,389
(Announcer) Nueji's right! ‬

273
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,308
-(Tamayo) Ganmaru! ‬
-(Tokiwa) Aoba! ‬

274
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,310
Okay! Here's the verdict

275
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,729
20 seconds left, don't push too hard! ‬

276
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,356
(Nueji) I entered this time! ‬

277
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,484
I'll stop like this! ‬

278
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,862
Please wait

279
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,822
(Nueji) Again! ‬

280
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,328
(Nueji) Judgment Even if it's disadvantageous
Do you want to master your new skills? ‬

281
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,333
(Nueji) Ugh...

282
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:53,382
(Nueji) Ankle joint! Oh no! ‬

283
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,386
Hurry! It's a natural crisis avoidance ability.

284
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,060
(Iwase) That guy
With that natural talent...

285
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,688
You can catch up with effort.

286
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,814
fool! ‬

287
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,610
(Isshiki) If it's an ankle joint with 15 seconds left.
I wish I could endure it...

288
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,409
Don't worry about your neck! Drop it forward! ‬

289
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,120
(Nueji) Hmm! ‬

290
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,038
(Tokiwa) Aoba! Master it! ‬

291
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,003

00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:35,173
Go! ‬

294
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,258
Don't let me escape! ‬

Huh! ‬

297

Lightning arm cross! ‬
Suzuki Aoba is a big upset! ‬

303
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:25,390
(claps and cheers)

304
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,486
Tokiwa-san, a match like this
I've never seen it before

305
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:41,782
Iwase Witness the legend
That's what talent is all about.

306
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,172
footsteps

307
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,757

308
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,675
Ah...

309
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,093
(Nueji) Mother...

310
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,930
Too bad, I'm going to lose.

311
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,433
You did your best. Did you have fun? ‬

312
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,852
No, mom
I lost though...

313
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,980
(Tamayo) I don't understand that.

314
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,857
Did you have fun? ‬

315
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,696
Hehe... it was fun

316
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,741
Come to think of it, it was fun

317
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,118
-(Tamayo) I see.
-(Nueji) Oh

318
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,246
Well then, just look like that.
Go say hello to the other person.

319
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,376
(Nueji) Oh

320
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,378
(Tamayo) What is this?

321
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,217
I want to be young

322
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,885
Let's know

323
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,607
(Aoba) Nueji-san, what is it? ‬

324
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,030
(Nueji) Newaza It was very murderous.

325
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,991
Completely defeated

326
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,537
You could be a murderer
Were you raised? ‬

327
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,083
No, my parents
I think he's a normal office worker.

328
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,837
Are you that kind of office worker?

329
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,424
Everyone at my high school is like that.

330
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,593
Really! ‬

331
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,513
(Iwase)
Somehow it doesn't mesh.

332
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,440
(Nueji) Is Hiiragi next?

333
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,943
(Moderator) Excellent analytical skills
I'm a smart fighter

334
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,488
Be careful

335
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,533
Every inch of my body right now
be analyzed

336
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,373
(Narration) Even though it's painful
Aoba wins his first match

337
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,627
(Video audio/Gong)

338
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,589
(Narration)
The next opponent is

339
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,300
It's the best of the tournament
Brainy fighter

340
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,761
Aiho Hiiragi

341
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,947
(Narration)
Aoba is now

342
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:30,200
Naked
was about to be

343
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,876
(Announcer) To the finals
Which piece will move forward? ‬

344
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,837
(Tokiwa) No more
It's better not to use the crescent moon.

345
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,838
(Hiiragi) Too irrational

346
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,048
(Aoba) The surprise attack was discovered.

347
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,258
(Hiiragi) I can see what's ahead.

348
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,009
(Aoba) No matter what you do, it will be read.

349
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,137
smiling

350
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,555
Why are you laughing? ‬

351
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,849
(Hiiragi) With you as a friend
we might have met

352
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,227
(Aoba) Why so much?
Can you understand me? ‬

353
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:01,022
(Hiiragi) Like this
I never had to fight you

354
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,485
(Aoba) Me too, Hiiragi-san.
I want to understand more! ‬
