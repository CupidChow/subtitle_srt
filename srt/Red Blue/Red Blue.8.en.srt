1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:07,799
(Tokiwa) Guard Guard!

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,301
(Hikaru) That's right! Run away, run away!

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:11,344
Yes, run away!

4
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,179
(Iwase) Aoba Get away!

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,889
(Hikari) That's right!

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,641
Don't let go!

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,351
(Tokiwa) Retractable It's about to drag you in!

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,440
(Aoba) Even if you grab it, it will be peeled off immediately.

9
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,277
His physical abilities are amazing!

10
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,362
(Narration) Finally

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,282
Aoba rose to the final

12
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:37,037
The other person is muscle strength, explosive power, etc.

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,292
All of his athletic abilities were superhuman physical monsters.

14
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:44,711
But...

15
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,965
(Aoba) Something like me is fighting against such an amazing person

16
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,426
(Pitching sound)

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:58,349
(Narration) Aoba enjoyed the situation

18
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,606
(Aoba) It's not time to be happy

19
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,901
We have to win and connect to this point!

20
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:12,489
Originally, power and physical can't be won't win no matter how you try.

21
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,116
If it's (Amachi), you can just turn it all the way around.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,579
(Rainland) Compete with your skeleton rather than your strength

23
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:23,875
All that remains is bones when burned

24
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,793
(Time-Wa) Firm hold Hold!

25
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,336
(Iwase) That's right, that's fine!

26
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,253
(Tokiwa) Don't lose Don't lose!

27
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,755
- (Light) Go! - (Time-Time) Protects you!

28
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,507
(Timewa) Raise your guard!

29
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,467
(Timewa) Okay, well protected Aoba!

30
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,803
(Rainy area) That's right, it's the way to use a tension rod.

31
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,055
If that's the case, you don't need muscle strength

32
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,765
(Hachiya) It's a jam!

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,813
(Iwase) That's good, Aoba!

34
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:49,400
(Hiragi) He's using his knee shield or bone to protect him.

35
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,114
(Raichi) What I told you was...

36
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,574
It's me

37
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,660
(Aoba) Movement has stopped!

38
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,037
My ground technique you can do now!

39
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,959
Okay! Triangle strangle!

40
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,710
(Time-Wa) It's a good attack using a skeleton

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,756
(Iwase) That's good, that's good!

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,341
That's right! That's right!

43
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,887
(Rainy area)

44
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,724
Triangle is a technique that uses the opponent's arm to pressure the carotid artery.

45
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,185
If your arm is pulled out, you won't be able to get too close

46
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,354
(Hataya) Should I raise the gear?

47
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,496
That power through the guard...

48
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,499
Get away! If you get one hit, it'll be over!

49
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,876
(Aoba) Coming!

50
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,461
Left straight, left hook

51
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:55,216
Double it to the right to either side and raise the right guard!

52
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,303
(Light) Yes Body

53
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,220
That's right

54
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,973
(Light) It's good

55
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,433
(Hataya) Shh! Shh!

56
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,893
Shh! Shh!

57
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,352
(Hikari) Hataya!

58
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,943
(Light) Your strength is the flexibility around the shoulders

59
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,614
Don't change your form until the very last minute and hit the hook.

60
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,203
What if you dodge your straight and get your hook protected?

61
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,040
That's the aim

62
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,710
Focus your attention on your face...

63
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,007
(Pitching sound)

64
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,008
(light) body

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,010
Ugh...

66
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,639
(Light) It's important to me here

67
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,433
If you know the scary thing about your body blowing

68
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,019
Your opponent lowers your guard by 100%

69
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,606
So immediately hit the left hook with the same form.

70
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,276
What I'm aiming for is an empty face

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,444
(Hataya) That's it!

72
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:03,159
♪～

73
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,119
(Narration) Batting, pitching, and extreme

74
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,624
The most flexible martial arts where all attacks are permitted

75
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,168
That's MMA in MMA!

76
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:01,300
～♪

77
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,469
(Hataya) That's it!

78
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,347
(gong)

79
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,765
(Referee) Stop!

80
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,476
(Announcer) This is where the first round ends!

81
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,940
(applause)

82
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,945
(Hataya) That guy didn't even lower his guard even 1 mm.

83
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,120
(Aoba) Fu...

84
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,955
Hikari

85
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,873
(Light) Yes?

86
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,792
How can I smash through his face?

87
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,547
It's rare that you're particular about how you win

88
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,469
He'll protect his face even if he's stubborn

89
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,431
That stubbornness makes me feel like I've lost if I can't beat it

90
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,724
(Light) Huh...

91
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,813
(Iwase) He didn't lower his guard well.

92
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,526
(Aoba) If you get it even just one shot on your face

93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,779
I'm sure I'm gonna spurt my consciousness...

94
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,490
just…

95
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,326
The potter's murderous insanity is amazing

96
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,704
Murderous insanity? You're just scared

97
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,165
Is it okay? If you keep getting hit through the guard

98
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,792
I'll throw the towel

99
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,294
If you're going to win, stop early

100
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,172
(Referee) Second out!

101
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,842
(Aoba) Woo...

102
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,351
Win

103
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,560
Yeah

104
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,482
Yes Lady Fight!

105
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,483
(gong)

106
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,026
(Times) Come on, Aoba

107
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,945
(Announcer) Fateful final round

108
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,364
(Light) Look closely

109
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,616
Go go!

110
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,617
That's right! That's right!

111
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,911
(Announcer) Hashiya We're suddenly closing the distance!

112
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,788
Suddenly, he tackles from the left hook!

113
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,164
No, feint! Overhand!

114
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,625
(Announcer) Hataya's attacks never stop!

115
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,420
(Hataya) Until I hit you in the face, continuing to hit you all the time!

116
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,880
Damn it...

117
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,509
If you suddenly swing it around, your head will fly away

118
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,054
Ah, there's no need to worry about being defeated even if it's clinched

119
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,306
That means you can go punching hard

120
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,308
(Aoba) From before

121
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,854
It feels like the punch to the face is full of strength

122
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,899
Are you narrowing your finish to your face?

123
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,942
(Light) Aim for it!

124
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,073
(Aoba) Even though they've raised their guard so much...

125
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,241
Are you being despised?

126
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,411
(Hataya) I think we can win if we keep our heads ⸺

127
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,122
I'll destroy that consciousness!

128
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,832
(Light) Go!

129
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,125
Front Front Front!

130
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,209
(Iwase) That's good!

131
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,506
(Hataya) I was dodged!

132
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,799
The left of the return is coming!

133
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,904
Suzuki Aoba It's no guard with lowered guard!

134
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,950
(Nueji) What shall I do... I'm going to die

135
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,077
(Hitori) It's an irrational strategy

136
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,706
(Rainy area) There must be something aimed at

137
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,469
(Hataya) Don't underestimate it

138
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,348
(Iwase) Protect yourself!

139
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,767
It's dangerous! Get your guard up!

140
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,352
No, I'm watching

141
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,146
The opponent is clearly aiming for a KO in the face.

142
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,565
No matter how powerful a blow

143
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,110
If you stick to that, it's easy to get rid of it

144
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,948
Isn't he scared at all, Aoba?

145
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,702
(Aoba) You can see the pottery well

146
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,581
Plus, I'll take a little rest

147
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,250
I can still fight!

148
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,294
(Hataya) Seriously don't underestimate it!

149
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,760
Suzuki Do not do it, do it, do it!

150
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:16,264
Good luck, Hatya! You don't have the time to be particular about how you win!

151
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,779
(Hataya) Oh no, I threw it too much!

152
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,863
Go Aoba!

153
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,371
(Male) Hey, what is it?! Hit it!

154
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,039
(Male) Hit and hit!

155
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,749
(Rainy ground) Why don't you play?

156
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,340
(Aoba) Sorry, the tape is peeling off

157
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,384
(Referee) Stop! tape

158
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:56,387
(Announcer) Ah, it looks like the tape on the gloves has come off.

159
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,432
What about (Neudo)? It's fine if you hit it

160
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,975
(Hazuru) is dangerous

161
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,978
The peeled tape will cut the other person's skin

162
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,024
(Tokiwa) It was put straight in like that.

163
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,525
It's not like you

164
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,613
(Aoba) No, the tape is dangerous

165
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,116
(Iwase) Have you suddenly become awakened to sportsmanship?

166
00:10:17,616 --> 00:10:19,410
Aiming for the crane's waist

167
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,663
I had tapered on my uninjured leg

168
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,042
(Aoba) No, that's within the rules, right?

169
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,088
(Tokiwa) Whew... aren't you a proper MMA fighter?

170
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,925
Thanks to this, I got a little rest

171
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,263
If I keep avoiding this, I'll lose

172
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,931
I know

173
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,852
But I'm happy

174
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:51,609
You can fight against such strong people depending on your strategy and technique.

175
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,821
MMA is interesting

176
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,746
Fight fair and brave...

177
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,707
I want to see the misaligned face of the pottery

178
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:14,382
Hey, what's wrong with me now? What's missing?

179
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,222
Hmm... think for yourself

180
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,893
Is that a second?

181
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,562
(Light) I'll just give you hints

182
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,859
One thing you lack is humility

183
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,404
The other is...

184
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,363
(Referee) Fight!

185
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,363
(gong)

186
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,864
(Times) Go Aoba

187
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,449
(Hikari) Do your best, decide!

188
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,618
(Timewa) That's good

189
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,997
(Hataya) Nyaro!

190
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,376
No, don't get excited, let's be humble

191
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,296
Power, speed, physical, that doesn't matter

192
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,551
(Hataya) Overwhelmed by the tactics and the pace is disrupted

193
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,471
This guy is strong and should keep that in mind!

194
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,557
(Light) Another...

195
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,018
It's a distance

196
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,186
Woo...

197
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,064
(Hataya) It's true that I got too close just because I'm no guarded

198
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,818
As usual, I'll jump in from my distance!

199
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,365
Oh Hashiya player, you've kept your distance

200
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,661
(Hataya) I've just accepted your strength

201
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,080
I'm not being careful anymore

202
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:32,126
I'll do my best and win with my usual self!

203
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:45,347
Haa... Haa...

204
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,105
I raised the guard

205
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,815
I felt something

206
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,692
(Hataya) Let's go!

207
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,238
(Aoba) A straight ball that knocked Kureishi is here!

208
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,913
(Aoba) This left is growing incredibly

209
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:12,208
Kureishi-san went straight down and was eaten

210
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,794
Do not take this to the side!

211
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,465
(Hikari) The shoulders are strangely soft

212
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,927
Watch your opponent's movements to the very last minute and hit them apart

213
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,180
It won't let you escape, no matter which way you move

214
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,681
(Pitching sound)

215
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,606
(Iwase) Standing Aoba!

216
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:37,608
- (Time) Set up! Stand up! - (Iwase) Standing!

217
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,109
(Shihe) Aoba!

218
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,820
Are you okay? Can I go, Aoba!

219
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,321
(Iwase) You can do it!

220
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,489
(Times) I can still go! I can still go!

221
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,658
(Aoba) If I don't stand...

222
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,370
I have to get up early...

223
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,288
You can stop the match

224
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,374
- (Iwase) Aoba! - (Tokiwa) That's right!

225
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,667
(Takiwa) You can still do it!

226
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,544
(Aoba) I have a sense...

227
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,629
(Aoba) But...

228
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,549
The scenery is turning

229
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,385
Can't stand

230
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,137
Don't stop

231
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,722
lose?

232
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,474
I don't want to lose

233
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,059
Will it end?

234
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,895
- (Time) Set up! - (Iwase) Standing Aoba!

235
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,232
(Aoba) Iwase-kun is the first friend I made.

236
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,484
(Tokiwa) I'll tell you the real MMA

237
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,027
- (Aoba) Please tell me your ground technique - (Iwase) Win

238
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,028
(Rain) I wonder if they'll stop talking to me

239
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,363
(Aoba) Kenshin-kun's face...

240
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,699
(Raichi) I might destroy you

241
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,033
(Aoba) In frustration...

242
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,910
I want to make it smug and distort

243
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,163
(Aoba) I don't want to end

244
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,457
The arms and legs...

245
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,126
Move

246
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,795
I can still fight

247
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,006
(Aoba) I really wanted to hit this hand

248
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,799
(Fist) I'll stay empty forever

249
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,343
That means you found a dream!

250
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,432
(Aoba) Come

251
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,017
Come on!

252
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,226
come

253
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,478
Come, come, come, come!

254
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,857
This is your graveyard!

255
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,858
Tokiwa-san!

256
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,359
ah

257
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,697
(Hataya) Don't stop, referee!

258
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,284
Your eyes aren't dead yet!

259
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,912
(Aoba) Thank you Hatya!

260
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,580
(Hataya) Finish with Pound!

261
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,957
(Aoba) Finish on the ground!

262
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,844
Good job, kicked my hips to lose my balance

263
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:31,347
(Aoba) The move you're aiming for is decided!

264
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,311
Go! Triangle strangle!

265
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,146
Don't let it go this time!

266
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,356
Go, go!

267
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,232
-(Timewa) That's good! - (Iwase) Keep squeezing!

268
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,319
(Hiow) It's difficult to choke a triangle against someone with soft shoulders.

269
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,199
(Rainland) There are measures to deal with it, and I wonder if Aoba-kun will notice...

270
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,202
(Hataya) Hmm... Hmm...

271
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,788
Be careful, Aoba!

272
00:15:55,871 --> 00:16:00,542
(Aoba) I know that the same thing that escaped just now

273
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:06,173
As I wrote in my head during the game

274
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,218
Just move

275
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,386
and…

276
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,180
Just master it!

277
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:17,434
(Cheers from the audience)

278
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,646
Yes, no-arm triangle choke that doesn't use your opponent's arm

279
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,529
It's packed in! Don't let go!

280
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,197
Hey, don't let go even if you die!

281
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,990
(Hataya) Not yet

282
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:45,129
(Hataya) Ha ha ha ha ha...

283
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,215
(Nuji) Trying to hit it!

284
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,842
(Baby Crane) It's dangerous! It's a foul!

285
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,177
Hatya! Stay calm!

286
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,888
(Hataya) Ha ha ha ha...

287
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,890
(Hataya) I'm calm

288
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,602
I'll throw it, I'm a mixed martial artist!

289
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:06,233
(Squeezing sound)

290
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:11,530
(Hatya) If you do this, you'll generally be able to relax a little. Usually...

291
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,659
You don't loosen a millimeter

292
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:20,205
...I'm tired of it

293
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,916
My own...

294
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,376
To weakness

295
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,092
(Referee) Yes, Stoop!

296
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,927
(gong)

297
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:39,516
MMA Koshien Bantamweight Winner Suzuki Aoba!

298
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,477
(Hikari) Hataya!

299
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,106
(Applause and cheers)

300
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:51,153
(Applause and cheers)

301
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:57,493
(Applause and cheers)

302
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,913
(Applause and cheers)

303
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,083
(Announcer) This time's MMA Koshien...

304
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,584
(Hashiya) Mitsuru-chan

305
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,794
(Light) Yes?

306
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,546
what up? Hotpot

307
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,760
(Hataya) I'm totally weak

308
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,516
That's right

309
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,103
It's still not at all

310
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,734
I'm glad I was able to experience a loss early

311
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,450
Woosh

312
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:41,161
Hmm...

313
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,747
(Times)... I did it

314
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,874
(Iwase) Well, I was really surprised

315
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,918
I was a little moved just now and cried

316
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,253
What are you crying

317
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,088
That's where his start

318
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,339
Tokiwa-san was crying earlier too...

319
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,091
-(Times) Don't cry, idiot! - (Iwase) Crying

320
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,009
No, what is that, it's the beer I drank yesterday

321
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:56,969
No, I'm drinking too much

322
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,095
Shut up! If I say more...

323
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,096
(Aoba) Sorry for being late

324
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,473
(Iwase) Oh, congratulations on Aoba's victory!

325
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,475
Seriously amazing

326
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,728
(Timewa) Oh! Well done Aoba

327
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,313
(Aoba) Thank you

328
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,316
(Tokiwa) I wonder if it's Iwase next?

329
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,152
(Iwase) No, Iwase... You can't afford it

330
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,361
(Tokiwa) Ah, you said it!

331
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,280
(Iwase) I can go if I leave

332
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:22,077
(Crying in the rainy area)

333
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,998
(Speaking voices of time and time)

334
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,208
Ah, Rainji-san

335
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,377
Didn't you see the award ceremony?

336
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:34,006
(Raichi) I wonder if something had changed if I was watching it?

337
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,052
Ah, no... Even if it's not so cold

338
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,473
(Takiwa) No, it's not even so

339
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:48,186
Actually, Amachin was the only one who believed in winning the championship the most.

340
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,188
Is it true?

341
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,733
(Rainy area) No, well...

342
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,987
I think he believed it more than the second who tried to throw a towel over and over again.

343
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,325
(Aoba) Amashi-san is crying too

344
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,743
(Rain) I'm fine with me

345
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,246
No, I don't think Aoba is tough like that, normal

346
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,331
(Rainy) Ah

347
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,665
Hahaha... I cried too much!

348
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:14,463
It's thanks to Iwase-kun who hit me at the back of the school building every day.

349
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,133
Yeah? What is that

350
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,552
You... soooo...

351
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,513
Eh, I'm grateful

352
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,976
That's because I'm in the world of MMA right now

353
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,270
(Takewa) What is it? Behind the school building?

354
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,689
Maybe you were bullying Aoba?

355
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,734
No, I can't believe it... I was just playing

356
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:37,486
(Rainy area) Strange

357
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,403
(Iwase) No, it's not suspicious

358
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,863
What? Hey Aoba

359
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,490
Ah, I'm going to the bathroom for a while

360
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,659
Wait a minute

361
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,666
(2 people) It's really weird

362
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,004
Trust me, uh... we're friends now

363
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,006
(Rainy area) "What's it now?"

364
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,260
(Iwase) Ah, no, I mean, I mean... ever since I've been like that

365
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,638
(Rainy area) Is it okay to emphasize that?

366
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,056
(Iwase) I've been friends forever

367
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,058
(Rain) Have you been friends forever?

368
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:26,827
(Cheers from the audience)

369
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,372
(Cheers from the audience)

370
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,944
(Fist Shin) Aoba

371
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,537
(Fist Shin) Aoba

372
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,339
That's amazing, you're going to win

373
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,429
Do you still want to hit me?

374
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,933
But

375
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:37,773
I'm going to be a pro and I don't think I'll have the opportunity to do that.

376
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,650
now…

377
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,570
Would you like to try it?

378
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,159
It's noisy

379
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,870
Huh?

380
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:58,251
I'll choke you down one day so just wait quietly

381
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,269
(Aoba) A stray person who can't fit in with those around him

382
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,900
A twisted person who doesn't fit in with the surroundings

383
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:28,115
Such a lonely person

384
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,700
usually…

385
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,162
Get addicted to martial arts
