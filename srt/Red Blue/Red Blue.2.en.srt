1
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:16,349
(Tokiwa) Aoba Forget about karate's true fist thrust for a moment.

2
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,810
I'll teach you how to do MMA straight.

3
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:19,894
Take notes

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,021
(Aoba) Yes.

5
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,650
(Tokiwa) What is the straight stance?

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,820
Dominant leg slightly behind

7
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,573
Push out your fist while stretching your hind legs

8
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,491
At this time, pull your chin

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,911
My other hand protects my face like this.

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,873
(Tokiwa) Type this quickly.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,334
Understand? ‬

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,211
yes

13
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:50,300
Punches, not just straight ones, are fired from a stationary position.

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,762
After reaching max speed, the arm reaches its full length and stops.

15
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,391
Depending on the timing of the punch

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,393
Not a critical hit

17
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:03,438
The timing and distance of the strongest punch

18
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,400
When you aim for the opponent's chin and throw a punch...

19
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,401
(sound of hitting)

20
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,034
(Tokiwa) Okay, then bring me the gloves.

21
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,951
Iwase: You too.

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,083
(Tokiwa) Yes.

23
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,878
(Tokiwa) That's right.

24
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,966
(Iwase) Whoosh! Whoosh! ‬

25
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,677
(Tokiwa) Look, what's wrong, Aoba?

26
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,807
If that's the case, you won't be able to make a mess of your fist! ‬

27
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,146
(Narration) Suzuki Aoba 16 years old

28
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,274
I've always lived in the shadows

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,318
(Kenshin) You...

30
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,654
(Kenshin) It's empty forever

31
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,614
(Narration) Mixed martial arts prodigy⸺

32
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:57,200
Aoba couldn't help but hear Kenshin Akasawa's words...

33
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,787
I almost hit you

34
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,501
But it wasn't that sweet

35
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,886
(sound of door opening)

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,723
(Tokiwa) Good morning, I'm at the Shark Gym.

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,059
(Sunny Weather Trainee) Mr. Shark is here! ‬

38
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,770
(Sunny weather trainees) Good morning! ‬

39
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,355
(Tokiwa) Good morning.

40
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,779
It would be reckless to enter a fight within a week of starting MMA.

41
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,406
originally lost

42
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,909
But when it comes to the game, stand up.

43
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,288
I've been a professional for 13 years, too.

44
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,915
How long did you stand in the ring during the match?

45
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,625
Not even 4 hours

46
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,086
It's rare to have a serious competition.

47
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,213
Let's go

48
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,969
(Tokiwa) Hello~

49
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:58,887
(Sunny weather trainee) Yes

50
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,348
(Yasuo) Oh, Tokiwa-san! Nice to meet you today

51
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:07,312
(Yasuo) But even though it's a rookie exchange game, is it okay for management to have only one newcomer? ‬

52
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,731
Kenshin is popular in our house, so it's tough.

53
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:13,359
Hahahaha... No, no, no, I'm worried. It hurts.

54
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,363
(Tokiwa) No, but our policy is to only allow genuine members to join.

55
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,240
(Yasuo) Hmm... hahaha...

56
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,743
Ah, Tokiwa-san, I have something to ask you about.

57
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,787
After the first shot, a joint practice session...

58
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,540
(Kenshin) Aoba...

59
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,543
(Kenshin) I was surprised by you.

60
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,211
Why did you join Shark Gym? ‬

61
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,466
No, because I have friends.

62
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,220
(Kenshin) Oh, I just remembered that.

63
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,722
Maybe we went to elementary school together? ‬

64
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,100
I feel like there's some kind of shadowy guy here.

65
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,396
(Iwase) Aoba, let's get ready.

66
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,484
Do your best today! ‬

67
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,197
(Sunny weather trainee) Kenshin... Kenshin, let's do it

68
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:15,046
Iwase-kun shorts thank you

69
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,089
No no no

70
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,175
Iwase-kun, look at me

71
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,301
(Iwase) Yeah.

72
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,348
(Iwase) Good

73
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,560
Okay...

74
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,444
(Aoba) Tamamatsu-kun has become really muscular.

75
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,077
This is Aoba Suzuki, who I was with when I was in junior high school.

76
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,538
(Aoba) Nice to meet you today.

77
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,042
(Tamamatsu) Ah... were you there? ‬

78
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,669
I don't remember much.

79
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,801
(Tamamatsu) Are you today's opponent?

80
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:07,098
But please stop talking about middle school. I don't want to remember that much.

81
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:17,358
Your shorts are here! That's something to throw away.

82
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,028
Shall I buy you a new one? ‬

83
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,406
Hey Aoba, I'll upload it.

84
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,118
Huh...

85
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,298
Kota, have fun

86
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,261
(Tamatsu) Are you okay? Maybe you got scared? ‬

87
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:48,473
Hey hey, you're Mr. Shark's important newcomer.

88
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,225
Don't get hurt, there's only one person here.

89
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,143
(Tamamatsu) Usu

90
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,270
(Tokiwa) Hahahaha…

91
00:05:54,353 --> 00:06:00,401
Somehow, they're all looking at me from above! ‬

92
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,112
Hey, Aoba, you definitely win.

93
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,281
Be ready to die

94
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,908
You originally said you lost...

95
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,493
It's annoying

96
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:15,875
I'll make sure you remember it today.

97
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,044
About me

98
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,632
(Tokiwa) Aoba

99
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,268
(Referee) Eh~ From now on, Seiten Dojo vs. Kota Tamamatsu⸺

100
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,396
I would like to start a practice match with Aoba Suzuki at Shark Gym.

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,314
Both to the center

102
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,153
(Narration) To defeat Kenshin

103
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,242
Aoba's first door into MMA...

104
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,619
It will be opened now! ‬

105
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:52,912
(Referee) Ready fight! ‬

106
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,122
gong

107
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,042
‪♪～‬

108
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,002
(Narration) Hitting, Throwing, Kiwami

109
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,507
The most flexible martial art in which all attacks are allowed.

110
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,051
That's mixed martial arts MMA! ‬

111
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,184
‪～♪‬

112
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,935
gong

113
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,729
(Yasuo) Okay, okay, okay! ‬

114
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,777
(Tokiwa) Hey, short uppercut, Aoba! ‬

115
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,945
I don't tell you

116
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,322
(Yasuo) Go, go, go! Good, good! ‬

117
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,365
Cross your knees! ‬

118
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,742
I didn't tell you that either.

119
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,662
Hey, tighten your guard! ‬

120
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,039
it taught

121
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,958
(Tamatsu) Hey! Hmm! ‬

122
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,003
(Yasuo) Hey, this is someone you can beat! ‬

123
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,964
Decide! I started this because I wanted to change myself! ‬

124
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,260
(Tamamatsu) That's right.

125
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:33,679
(Tamamatsu) I will be reborn! ‬

126
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:39,602
(Tamamatsu's strenuous voice)

127
00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:40,937
Wow! ‬

128
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,192
Wow! ‬

129
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,485
(sound of hitting)

130
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,737
Aoba! ‬

131
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,155
(Tokiwa) Your eyes aren't dead yet.

132
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,615
(Aoba) Hmm! ‬

133
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:59,830
From a close position, I got down on my knees and secured the distance to hit a straight ball.

134
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:05,253
Did you just think about hitting me with an accelerated fist like I told you to?

135
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,548
-(Yasuo) Tamamatsu! -(Kenshin) Kota! Stand up! ‬

136
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,842
(Aoba) Do you remember me? ‬

137
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,885
(Yasuo) Tamamatsu! ‬

138
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,553
(Tamamatsu) This guy...

139
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,391
(Tamamatsu) Okay, let's meet! ‬

140
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,061
(Tamamatsu) If you don't mind, I'll give you what you like.

141
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,356
(Friend) Huh? Tamamatsu: It's all about rare cards.

142
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:29,485
Seriously! I'm your best friend, President Tamamatsu! ‬

143
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,362
(Friend) No, it's the Tamamatsu-sama of the world.

144
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,280
(Friend)! ‬

145
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,156
(Friend) I will cherish it forever! ‬

146
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,075
Hey, this is great! ‬

147
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,625
(Tamamatsu) How about Aoba-kun too? ‬

148
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,005
Ah, it's okay, I don't need it.

149
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,967
(Tamamatsu) This guy rejected me back then...

150
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,677
(Yasuo) Stand Tamamatsu Look! ‬

151
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,016
(Sunny Weather Trainee) Attack! Before before! ‬

152
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,267
(Sunny weather trainee) Go! ‬

153
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,896
(Tamatsu) Hmm! ‬

154
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,898
(Yasuo) Before before before before! ‬

155
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,527
Acha...

156
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,031
I haven't practiced how to escape after being defeated.

157
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,535
Yeah? How to escape after being defeated? ‬

158
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,538
Yeah, I want you to tell me.

159
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,961
(Iwase) It can't be helped, it's only once.

160
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:29,879
Wow...

161
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:36,135
(Iwase) Your priority now is to train your hitting skills.

162
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,720
Hey

163
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,306
Yes, squeeze your legs

164
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,059
First, attract the opponent's head.

165
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,644
(Aoba) Attracts... Ah...

166
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,938
(Iwase)...and the other person will raise his body.

167
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,858
Place your left hand straight on the floor and stand up.

168
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,653
(Aoba) Good...

169
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,865
(Iwase) Then, use your hand to wrap around the opponent's right arm.

170
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,949
-(Aoba) Get involved -(Iwase) Good luck

171
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,409
(Aoba) Ah...

172
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,827
(Iwase) Then raise your hips.

173
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,912
(Aoba) Yoisho

174
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,622
(Iwase) Yes more more more

175
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,167
Then I kick my right foot as hard as I can and throw it.

176
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,085
(Aoba) Huh! ‬

177
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,336
(Iwase) more more more

178
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,253
(Aoba) Huh! ‬

179
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,922
(Iwase) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

180
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,173
rainwear

181
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,258
This is a hip throw

182
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,719
Yes, I understand

183
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,304
(Iwase) Ui

184
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,390
(Iwase) I tried it just once.

185
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,975
In just one week...

186
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,935
no

187
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,353
(Sunny weather trainee) Just go! ‬

188
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,270
(Sunny weather trainee) Go! ‬

189
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,023
Looks like that one time was helpful.

190
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,818
(Aoba) Hold your left hand straight.

191
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,487
Involve the opponent's right arm...

192
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,657
Throw with your right foot

193
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,790
Seriously! Just once...

194
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,500
This guy...

195
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,628
(Tokiwa) It might be real.

196
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:03,347
(Aoba) If you beat me, you'll forget about me, right? ‬

197
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:08,310
That's why I want to win and tell you something! ‬

198
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,063
(Kenshin) Just go, go, go! ‬

199
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,815
(Tamatsu) Hmm! ‬

200
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,860
(Kenshin) Good! Just keep going! ‬

201
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,278
Kota! Decide! ‬

202
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,284
(Tamatsu) Ah! ‬

203
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,793
(Tamamatsu) Ah... Hmm...

204
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,295
Hmm! ‬

205
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,714
Hmm! ‬

206
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,303
There are a lot of things that are missing

207
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,598
Both of you will fight with good faces, right?

208
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,519
(Tamamatsu) Please stop talking about middle school.

209
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,645
I don't want to remember too much

210
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,689
(Friend) Tamamatsu is really cool~

211
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,318
(Friend) Who can get the most expensive item from Tamamatsu?

212
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,611
Let's compete

213
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,696
(Friend) I like the Kanebuta chicken race! ‬

214
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,239
I'll rip it off! ‬

215
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:05,868
(Friend) That guy is already the Kinbuta Bank ATM 3rd year 2nd class branch.

216
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,454
(Friend) Oh, that’s delicious! Like that! ‬

217
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,665
(Friend) Seriously, that guy is all about money and pigs. It's too dangerous! ‬

218
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,584
(Friend) I bought you something the other day...

219
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,643
(Male) Yay! Nouveau riche ATM! ‬

220
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,145
(Male) Hey, are you crying? Butakin Junior

221
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,230
(Male) Kinpig piggy bank

222
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,523
(Female) It's just an ATM, right?

223
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,525
(Male) Pigs are so smart.

224
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,902
(Tamamatsu) No! I'm different now! ‬

225
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,738
Use your power to win and change! ‬

226
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,334
(Referee) Stop! Stop stop! ‬

227
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:55,793
(Referee) Stop! Stop stop! ‬

228
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:55,793
(gong)

229
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:55,876
(gong)

230
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,961
(gong)

231
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:56,961
Stop stop! ‬

232
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,923
(Aoba) Ugh... Ugh...

233
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,174
(Tokiwa) Aoba

234
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,345
Well done for my first time. Good job.

235
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,932
(Aoba) Haha...

236
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,142
Haha...

237
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,396
(Referee) Eh~ Winner: Seiten Dojo Kota Tamamatsu! ‬

238
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,148
applause

239
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,943
(claps and cheers)

240
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,152
(Kenshin) Well done

241
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,325
The winner is Kota Tamamatsu! ‬

242
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,454
(Aoba) I wanted to win.

243
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:37,293
After all, it would be frustrating if we lost...

244
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,923
How was your first match? ‬

245
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,261
It was fun, but I was disappointed that I lost.

246
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,431
But my practice paid off.

247
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,603
(Tamamatsu) Thank you for fighting today.

248
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,486
It's me...

249
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,532
The truth is, I wanted to beat you and tell you something.

250
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,243
Ah... what do you want to tell me? ‬

251
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:20,628
When I was in middle school, I always wanted to be friends.

252
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:28,552
Tamamatsu-kun was handing out cards to everyone and buying them food.

253
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,641
Are you lying and making fun of me? ‬

254
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:37,394
You know what they called me! ‬

255
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:44,902
Yeah, Golden Pig and Butatama, Pig Piggy Bank, Pig Seven Lights, right?

256
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,570
The rest...

257
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,074
If I look at my old notes, I'll understand more.

258
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:55,120
After all, you thought the same thing like them.

259
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,539
And you rejected me then.

260
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,749
No! ‬

261
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,212
What I rejected was a rare card.

262
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:08,425
And the people around Tamamatsu-kun

263
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,845
We're not all friends

264
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,016
(Aoba) Everyone, please be spoiled by your kindness.

265
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,022
But why would you do something like me without money?

266
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:28,070
That means you can't make friends unless you give them money or things.

267
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,199
Does that mean you lack confidence in yourself and have low self-esteem? ‬

268
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,703
(Aoba) That... I don't care what you pretend to be.

269
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:40,624
Making friends using the money you have

270
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,085
It takes a lot of courage and action...

271
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,420
(Tamamatsu) Sorry.

272
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,630
It's okay now

273
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,175
Ah... this guy is a bit weird.

274
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,429
Okay, I'll go with Tokiwa-san.

275
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:58,350
(Aoba) I love the true form of Tamamatsu-kun.

276
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,438
That's why I've always wanted to be friends

277
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,443
but

278
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,654
They don't remember me.

279
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,950
Those are the words of a loser

280
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:19,538
I know... I know

281
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,665
(Iwase) Don't worry about it.

282
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,916
I don't really understand him either.

283
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:34,178
(Tamamatsu) Does that mean that for Aoba, I don't need to change?

284
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,639
(Yasuo) Tokiwa-san, thank you very much for today.

285
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,974
(Tokiwa) Thank you very much.

286
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:40,768
That kid looks like he's growing

287
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,019
Oh, is that so? ‬

288
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,061
(phone ringtone)

289
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,856
But really, it would be better to increase the number of people.

290
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,441
Ah~

291
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,359
(Sunny Weather Trainee) Chairman I'm on the phone! ‬

292
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,778
(Yasuo) Who is it from? ‬

293
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,945
(Sunny weather trainee) Oh, it's my wife.

294
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,280
(Yasuo) Honey? ‬

295
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,032
Ah, Tokiwa-san, see you soon.

296
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,158
(Tokiwa) Again

297
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,993
Ou

298
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,120
Huh...

299
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,080
(Tokiwa) I'm going home.

300
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,459
(Tokiwa) Good job!

301
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,835
(Kenshin) Mr. Tokiwa! ‬

302
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,713
Let's spar with me

303
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,386
(Tokiwa) Hey, aren't you calling out to the wrong person? ‬

304
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,935
I want to feel Tokiwa's MMA with my skin.

305
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,938
(Iwase) It’s crazy…

306
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,690
If Mr. Tokiwa is here

307
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,528
If something were to happen to break the spirit of a child prodigy,

308
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,489
My gym is...

309
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,783
Shhh! ‬

310
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,328
Hey! ‬

311
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,499
There's no way our representative could do it in a place like this.

312
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,545
Do you know who Tokiwa-san has defeated? ‬

313
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,672
(Iwase) Don't say it too easily.

314
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,257
(Tokiwa) Hey Iwase

315
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,596
Don't lift your master in someone else's gym, that's vulgar.

316
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:06,562
I'll be waiting until the monk emerges victorious.

317
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:10,399
From a place like this

318
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:15,028
Let's do it somewhere bigger.

319
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:28,625
I'm the one who will surpass your dreams, so please wait.

320
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,379
(Tokiwa) Yes.

321
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:50,689
(Aoba) I am still involved in Kenshin-kun's martial arts life.

322
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,526
Not even a character

323
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,701
(Aoba) Iwase-kun! ‬

324
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,329
Oh Aoba

325
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,248
Body is dangerous

326
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,712
(Aoba) Iwase-kun, look at this.

327
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,548
I took pictures of Kenshin-kun's sparring.

328
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,592
Are you secretly filming?

329
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,718
(Aoba) Yeah.

330
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,353
Against a grappler

331
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,230
I can make it this far without being defeated.

332
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,444
After all, Kenshin is a natural striker.

333
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,824
Yeah? What are strikers and grapplers? ‬

334
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,618
mainly

335
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,997
A player who is good at punching, kicking, and hitting...

336
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,086
against that

337
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,464
Use a throwing technique to knock the opponent down to the mat and hold them down from above.

338
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,845
There are athletes who are good at joint techniques, choke techniques, and ground techniques...

339
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:19,027
Kenshin-kun doesn't like being defeated that much...

340
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:25,909
(Aoba) What I need to master in order to beat Kenshin-kun...

341
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,078
That's...

342
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,999
(Klaxon)

343
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,218
(Amachi) Mud splashes on a freshly cleaned suit

344
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,554
15th item

345
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,899
Huh...

346
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,026
(Iwase) Good morning.

347
00:21:59,109 --> 00:21:59,943
(Aoba) Good morning.

348
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,111
(Tokiwa) Wow~

349
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,155
(Iwase) Sorry, I'll replace you.

350
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,281
(Gym student) Oh

351
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,615
(Aoba) I'll take your place.

352
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,825
(Gym student) Assu

353
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,965
(Aoba) Tokiwa-san

354
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,554
I will become a grappler and defeat Kenshin-kun with ground fighting.

355
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,472
(Iwase) Huh? ‬

356
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,015
(Tokiwa) Hmm...

357
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,604
(Tokiwa) Maybe it's suitable.

358
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:40,275
So, are you aiming for MMA Koshien as a grappler?

359
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,652
Hmm...

360
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,488
To fight Kenshin

361
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:48,533
The shortest way is to win there.

362
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,537
If you win there

363
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,832
Can you fight Kenshin-kun?

364
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,042
(Tokiwa) What do you think?

365
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,879
But for you and Kenshin to fight

366
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,672
First of all, you need a track record.

367
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,220
(Narration) Towards overthrowing Kenshin

368
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,431
Aoba decides to become a grappler

369
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,394
But what appeared there...

370
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,438
(Ameji) Good morning.

371
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,987
Well, even if you master new techniques,

372
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,864
My gym is before that.

373
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,784
I think my heart might break...

374
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,371
Ah, the old man from earlier

375
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,129
(Amaechi) Rude young man's remarks

376
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,673
17th item

377
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,927
(Narration) It's not easy.

378
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,929
He was an oddball.

379
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,973
Sparring please

380
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,141
Could you please not talk to me?

381
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,476
(Iwase) Mr. Amaechi's ground work is really amazing.

382
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,480
(Amaechi) Young people with a promising future are burning towards their dreams...

383
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,940
Very uncomfortable

384
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,151
(Tokiwa) As talented as I am, I am also strong in my regrets.

385
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,944
(Aoba) I'll take one here! ‬
