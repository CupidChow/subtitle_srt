1
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,762
(Narration) MMA Koshien

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,848
Just before the semifinals

3
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:21,396
(Video voice / audience cheering)

4
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,231
(Narration) In a short time

5
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,234
Aoba (Aoba) exploring the weaknesses of Hiiragi

6
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,029
(Video audio: The audience cheering)

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,489
(Video audio: Gong)

8
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:38,872
(Iwase) I have a little more habit and I can't do it from here.

9
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,832
(Interviewer) Congratulations on passing the qualifying

10
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,958
(Hiiragi) Thank you

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,044
(Interviewer) What are you enthusiastic about the main game?

12
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,255
(Hiiragi) Yeah

13
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,132
If you can't win

14
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,760
Give up on the path of martial arts

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,305
I am prepared to choose a doctor's way and take over my parents' house

16
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,474
(Interviewer) With that much thought ...

17
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,185
(Aoba) I wonder if I can give up so easily

18
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,562
(Hiiragi) Yes, this is a promise with my father ...

19
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,941
It's like a son of a large hospital, so it's a doctor's choice in the end, right?

20
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,278
(Hiiragi) It is a must to win in this tournament

21
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,367
It is me who wins this MMA Koshien

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,912
(Interviewer) Thank you

23
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,164
I asked Ai Hiiragi to talk to you

24
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,665
(Hiiragi) Thank you

25
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,055
(Aoba) Oh ...

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,308
(Aoba) Mr. Hiiragi

27
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:44,187
Thank you for the next game

28
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,192
(Hiiragi) I wanted to hear one, but is it okay?

29
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,069
(Aoba) Yes

30
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:56,658
I guess it's true, but do you want to beat Kensawa Kenshin?

31
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,120
(Fist laughter)

32
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,290
What?

33
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,795
(Hiiragi) I was wondering if I started MMA because I was in the same high school.

34
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,923
Instead, the type is completely different

35
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,968
I mean, it's a way of fighting focusing on sleeping techniques that he seems to hate

36
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,432
No, isn't it?

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,937
(Hiiragi) It's too rational to catch up with him from now on

38
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,024
Forget

39
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,987
Thank you for the next game

40
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:48,042
It's amazing to understand that

41
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,045
Why are you happy even though you're being spotted

42
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:55,884
(Iwase) Aoba

43
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,386
What happened to how to walk?

44
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,101
(Tokiwa) I'll touch it

45
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,520
(Aoba) I went ...

46
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,565
(Iwase) Is it a crescent moon kick?

47
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,987
(Tokiwa) You shouldn't use the crescent moon any more

48
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,284
Taping

49
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,165
(Aoba) Oh ...

50
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,337
This is not the left foot ...

51
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,255
(Tokiwa) What is it?

52
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,760
Is it okay to wrap it around my right foot?

53
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,181
(2 people) What?

54
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,267
(Iwase) Is it really good?

55
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,270
I went to kick with my feet that seemed injured

56
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,398
I have to do so

57
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,860
Hiiragi seems to be injured and attacked tightly

58
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,030
If you win it, another game

59
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:03,117
It would be best if I could decide on a haste with a surprise attack and save my physical strength

60
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,911
Yes

61
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,120
Green leaves

62
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,457
(Dondon) Hey love

63
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,170
(Announcer) Come on the Bantamweight semifinals

64
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,630
This is the first game

65
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,424
Aoba Aoba (Suzuki)!

66
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,929
Which is the one to proceed with the piece to the finals?

67
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,568
(Narration) For a male hiirager who is looking for everything

68
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,906
Aoba who gets a surprise by taking the injury to the opposite hand

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,449
(Referee) To the center of both!

70
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,163
(Narration) For fighters with different types than before

71
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,710
Challenge the battle for the finals!

72
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,507
♪～

73
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,467
(Narration) Hit / throw / Pole

74
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,972
Martial arts with the highest degree of freedom where all attacks are allowed

75
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,516
That is the general martial arts MMA!

76
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:57,648
～♪

77
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,235
(Support of the audience)

78
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,737
(Referee) Yes Lady Fight!

79
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,863
(gong)

80
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,990
(Tokiwa) Ike! Go!

81
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,246
(Second) Match!

82
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,956
(Tokiwa) Look at it

83
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,708
Okay, it looks like it looks

84
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,043
(Second) Good, good

85
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,297
(Second) Ikeikeike!

86
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,548
Ikeikeiikeike!

87
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,217
(Sound of early return)

88
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,139
(Aoba) The surprise was barre

89
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,398
(Aoba) Where is here?

90
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,984
(Hiiragi) It's my analysis space

91
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,781
(Hiiragi) After all taping is fake

92
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,829
It was a standing way to cover the right foot and protect my left foot

93
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,625
What I'm really injured is my left foot

94
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,932
Can't you use a kick like the first round anymore?

95
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,950
Immediately after the start, it was expected to use the right foot

96
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,635
(Aoba) Did you read everything!

97
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,055
(Dondon) Ikeikeiikeike!

98
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,476
(Second) Hold the pressing and hold it down!

99
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,271
Moving Aoba! Inverted!

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,362
Where to hold it and how to run away

101
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,907
I will grasp the human body structure tightly

102
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,914
(Hiiragi) There is no physical that can overturn this position

103
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,792
If you hold it down for 3 minutes as it is, it will be my win

104
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,838
(Aoba) To get out of this situation ...

105
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:33,971
(Support of the audience)

106
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,640
(Aimachi) If this happens

107
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:40,394
Put your opponent's head in the side and take your feet as it is

108
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,772
… And lock with the opposite feet

109
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:47,318
… Clatch your hands and keep up with you as it is

110
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,737
If you put pressure on ...

111
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,738
yes

112
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,366
(Rainland) Oh ...

113
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,283
Baggie cheeks

114
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,952
When it is held down in the side position

115
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,037
It is the only sleeping technique that can be used from below

116
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,955
(Aoba) Thank you

117
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,415
(Rainland) Because it is a relatively new technique

118
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,085
Many players have insufficient measures

119
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,461
Hmm ...

120
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,838
(Tokiwa) Thank you Amachin

121
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,885
(Dondo) Remove!

122
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,554
(Hiiragi) Buggy chalk?

123
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,472
(Sound strangled)

124
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,932
(Dondon) Remove love!

125
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:22,770
(Hiiragi) Buggy was unexpected, but I can see it.

126
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,730
(Hiiragi) Hmm ...

127
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,151
(Support of the audience)

128
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,947
(Shihe) Qingye!

129
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,950
(Tokiwa) Arms! arm!

130
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,951
(Iwase) Cut off!

131
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,244
(Tokiwa) Arms!

132
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:58,806
(Aoba) How to move from this position ...

133
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,070
Sleeping is a pattern

134
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,657
If you keep giving the best solution at the fastest fastest, it will be sealed

135
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,370
It's amazing ... you can read no matter what you do

136
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,413
(Tokiwa) Stick!

137
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,041
Yes, arms and arms! Align together!

138
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,754
(Hit sound)

139
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,592
(Hit sound)

140
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,805
I'm laughing

141
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,812
Why do you laugh?

142
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,482
Mr. Hiiragi

143
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,484
Why so ⸺

144
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:37,363
Do you know me?

145
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,866
(Hit sound)

146
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,784
(Tokiwa) Run away!

147
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,584
Why did you dare to be in a disadvantage?

148
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,169
(Announcer) I took the Hiiragi mount position

149
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,629
-(Announcer) Chance has arrived! -(Iwase) Mazui!

150
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,131
no

151
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,358
Okay! Ike Aoba!

152
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,945
(Tokiwa) Push out!

153
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,155
Good, good

154
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,406
Return it!

155
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,741
Aoba I did well!

156
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:28,581
(Hiiragi) Did you read that my judgment was delayed by unexpected movements?

157
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:35,421
(Aoba) I also want to understand more about Hiiragi!

158
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,716
If you can't win

159
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,135
Give up on the path of martial arts

160
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,722
I am ready to go on the doctor's way and take over my parents' house.

161
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,653
How serious you are

162
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,656
If you fight like this, it will be painful

163
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,659
Why do you give up?

164
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,370
I'm ...

165
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,048
(Hiiragi) It was a life where the path to go from the beginning was decided

166
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,802
I wasn't lost in going on the path my father decided

167
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:32,770
I had the ability to meet that expectation

168
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:05,594
(Hiiragi) It was just a whim that chose a different path

169
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,193
(Sounding sound)

170
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:25,030
(Hiiragi) Even though I met

171
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,658
(Trainer) Hey! Hey!

172
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,659
Hey!

173
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,160
(Hiiragi) I know

174
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,747
Just studying and the athletic nerves are on par with people

175
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,418
Someday I will always hit a wall that cannot be exceeded

176
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,424
My MMA is just a distraction

177
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,968
Reality escape

178
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,764
It was a mistake to meet MMA in the first place

179
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,828
(Hiiragi) If you choose your usual way at that time ...

180
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,423
(Hiiragi) I didn't fight you like this

181
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,763
Is that so?

182
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,517
(Hiiragi) Umm!

183
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,727
(Aoba) Yeah

184
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,355
(Hiiragi) Maybe

185
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,942
You may have met you as a friend

186
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,860
(Aoba) Maybe so

187
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,447
(Aoba) Yeah ...

188
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,158
(Hiiragi) The dangerous is super delicious

189
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,576
(Aoba) Char shoe dangerous

190
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,994
(Hiiragi) Seriously?

191
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,749
(Hiiragi) Yeah

192
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,503
Umm!

193
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,048
This is good

194
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,845
(Hiiragi) Excessive intake of salt lipid carbohydrates

195
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,514
So it's delicious

196
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,516
I know

197
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,937
(Aoba) Calcium

198
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,397
(Hiiragi) Thank you

199
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,194
(Sound of eating dried chicken)

200
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,654
(Hiiragi) Yeah ...

201
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,123
While knowing the danger of a big injury

202
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,460
It's too rational to fight someone

203
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,966
That's right ...

204
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,142
(Hiiragi) Ugu ...

205
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,022
(Iwase) Kicking crescent moon ...

206
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,941
(Tokiwa) With my injured leg ...

207
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,070
(Hiiragi) Huh ... uh ...

208
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:15,075
Hahaha ...

209
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,418
After all I noticed the injury on my left foot

210
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,337
You thought you didn't use this.

211
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,257
Uh ...

212
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,970
I and Mr. Hiiragi wouldn't meet here

213
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,222
That's right, right?

214
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,059
Kusso ...

215
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,565
(Aoba) Press the opponent from above and get on the side!

216
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,650
(Hiiragi) Wide foot width so as not to be crushed!

217
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,403
(Aoba) Wrap your arm around your neck and guillotine!

218
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,530
(Hiiragi) Insert your arm so that your neck is not wrapped!

219
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,784
(Aoba) Put your hand under the side and get on the back!

220
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,494
(Hiiragi) I can't go around!

221
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,665
After all theory is no good

222
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,084
Then!

223
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,637
(Hiiragi) Dare to go down?

224
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,098
It doesn't mean that it's such a mucha technique.

225
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,644
(Hiiragi) To bring it into your fighting style

226
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,772
It is your way to make even a disadvantageous situation

227
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,360
What are you going to come next?

228
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,574
(Hiiragi) Did you read further ahead?

229
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,745
(Second) Run away, run away!

230
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,704
Run away! Run away love!

231
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,415
(Sound strangled)

232
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:50,838
(Passion sound)

233
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,799
(Sound strangled)

234
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,260
(Hiiragi) I met

235
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,971
(Sound strangled)

236
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,430
(Referee) Stop!

237
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,598
(gong)

238
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,891
(Tokiwa) Shah!

239
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,727
(Applause and cheers)

240
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:06,895
Yeah!

241
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,773
I did it! Aoba!

242
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,025
(Tokiwa) Ushi

243
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,112
(Applause and cheers)

244
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:20,200
(Applause and cheers)

245
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,475
Hu ...

246
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,569
Hiiragi!

247
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,323
that…

248
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,242
thank you

249
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,706
Um ...

250
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:50,832
(Calling sound)

251
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,042
(Sigh)

252
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,379
(Calling sound)

253
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,091
(Tel: Tatsuyuki) Did you lose?

254
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,635
I…

255
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,223
After all I want to continue martial arts

256
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,686
I don't know if I can balance it with the exam

257
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,188
But ...

258
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,442
I don't want to give up here

259
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,071
(Tatsuyuki) The promise is different

260
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,452
Talk again

261
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,791
(The sound of calling out)

262
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,970
(Hiiragi) I knew

263
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,682
How serious you are

264
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,022
That's why I didn't want to deal with it ...

265
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,361
What do you do? Aoba Suzuki!

266
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,906
(Sigh)

267
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,382
(Iwase) Aoba

268
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,844
Why are you laughing during the game

269
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,638
That's a little scary

270
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:33,769
(Aoba) I felt that Mr. Hiiragi really understood me

271
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:34,978
I'm glad

272
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,314
(Iwase) Foo ...

273
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:43,779
You can't be a good friend who is good at reading, right?

274
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:50,702
But I came here because Iwase -kun was there.

275
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,416
I am nothing

276
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,669
You did your best without permission

277
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,303
(Narration) Finally in MMA Koshien

278
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,390
Aoba who has reached the final

279
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,683
(Iwase) Congratulations on the finals

280
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,019
(Aoba) Thank you

281
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,445
I'm sorry

282
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,867
Hmm ...

283
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,496
Not open

284
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,915
What?

285
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,423
(Narration) But that physical strength

286
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,843
It has already reached the limit

287
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:53,932
(Announcer) MMA Koshien Final!

288
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,433
(Referee) Fight!

289
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,686
(Announcer) Here is a serious announcement for everyone

290
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,605
(Tokiwa) If you drop from this height, you will die

291
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,524
Compete with the skeleton

292
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,986
(Aoba) Is there a continuation of that end?
