1
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,240
I want to break up.

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,320
They're not playing around, Zea!

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,680
You're not safe here. You have to go home.

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,366
I assure you, nothing will happen to Zea.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
This is our only clue.

6
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,280
There's only one custom helmet shop.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,779
Moreo, Richie, and I

8
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,860
will do a stakeout around Labos.

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,640
We know the location and the person.

10
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,800
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's just attack.

11
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:00,981
Hey!

12
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,040
You can't escape now.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,560
You have to pay for what you did to us.

14
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:09,786
Go.

15
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:22,209
Dad!

16
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:23,858
How could there be burglars?

17
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,479
Mom, Dad.

18
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,920
My personal belongings are all here.

19
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,880
Thank God.

20
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:52,147
The important thing is that we're okay.

21
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:56,022
Then, why did they come in and make a mess

22
00:03:56,566 --> 00:03:57,840
but didn't take anything?

23
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,240
That's weird.

24
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,040
That's a good point.

25
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,840
Ares, have you checked your room?

26
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,520
Before you went out,

27
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,680
did Richie come here?

28
00:04:10,493 --> 00:04:11,573
"Richie"?

29
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:13,947
No.

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,520
What's wrong?

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,080
Good evening.

32
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,560
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening, Sir.

33
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,880
- Mr. Chrysander and Mrs. Athena?
- That's right.

34
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,840
We've checked every door and window

35
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,960
but we didn't find anything suspicious.

36
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
Okay, Sir. Thank you.

37
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

38
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:53,786
- Ardhan.
- What's up?

39
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,599
- Are you still at the base?
- I was just about to go home. Why?

40
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:01,793
Is Richie there?

41
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,607
He's here.

42
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,840
He came not long after you left.

43
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,239
Okay.

44
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:11,006
Thanks.

45
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,280
What's wrong with you?

46
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:32,853
I'm out of lollipops.

47
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,440
You can buy one.

48
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,120
- Come on.
- Okay.

49
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,400
I am hungry!

50
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,666
Hungry.

51
00:06:05,526 --> 00:06:06,566
Sir!

52
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,273
Grilled sausage.

53
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:12,553
Americano and

54
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:14,906
pepperoni.

55
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't make me wait too long, okay?

56
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,285
Dear viewers,

57
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:24,680
violence by bike gangs lately

58
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,813
is getting more and more unsettling.

59
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,901
These cases are considered
as criminal acts.

60
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,826
Sir, we're done here.

61
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
Let's go, guys.

62
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,293
I'm putting the money here.

63
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,309
It is reported

64
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,840
that several bike gangs in the capital
have been on a break

65
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:12,656
following the amount of terror
they have received.

66
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,200
We've asked the parents
to come to the school

67
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,560
and they've monitored our students
outside of school.

68
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,720
But, I'm still not convinced.

69
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,200
Antares and his friends
can't easily disband their gang.

70
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,960
This can be a serious threat
to our school.

71
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:37,626
Well,

72
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,880
we've given them a warning.

73
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:43,040
And we have given them punishments.

74
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,369
I know very well that you care

75
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,960
about our school's reputation.

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,600
But all we can do now
is to monitor and see what happens.

77
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,400
And I'm trusting you
to monitor Ares and his friends.

78
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,120
Okay. Will do, Sir.

79
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,573
Sir, Ma'am. You can check it now.

80
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:09,361
The site's should be able
to operate normally.

81
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,040
And I've upgraded the security system.

82
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,040
- Okay.
- Okay. So, it can't be hacked now?

83
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,800
That's right.
It's back like it used to be.

84
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
- Thank you.
- Okay. I'm leaving.

85
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
Okay.

86
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Is it possible that Richie
took the kerambit blade from my house?

87
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,120
What's wrong?

88
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
The kerambit's missing.

89
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,280
Damn!

90
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,493
Missing, you said?

91
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,747
Yeah.

92
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,840
My house was burgled.

93
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,760
Nothing else is missing.

94
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,000
Only the kerambit.

95
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,360
And you don't know who took it?

96
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,701
Don't you have any clue?

97
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
No.

98
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,320
Do you like the movie?

99
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,120
It was tense, but I like it.

100
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,620
Alright.

101
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,560
Next time, let's watch what you want.

102
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,880
It's okay.

103
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,920
I also like action movies.

104
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,320
But, I was just surprised earlier.

105
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,640
We couldn't guess who the villain was.

106
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,640
- Have you seen the news?
- What news?

107
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,055
The guy who smeared bike gangs'
reputation has been captured.

108
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,760
His name was...

109
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,480
Who is it...

110
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,200
Is it Radit?

111
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:21,946
That's right.

112
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,080
I'm glad.

113
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,120
My friends won't be stressed
by the scary terrors again.

114
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,720
Even my school's website got hacked.

115
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,640
- That's horrible.
- I know, right?

116
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:37,979
Calderioz's guys were blamed

117
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,160
because they were involved
with the perpetrator.

118
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,360
The school asked them to disband the gang.

119
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
And are they disbanded now?

120
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,560
There's no way Ares
will disband Calderioz.

121
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,045
What?

122
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,840
Nothing.

123
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,840
Thank you for today.

124
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,640
You're welcome.

125
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,840
Are you still going to accept
my invitation to watch a movie next time?

126
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,800
Of course.

127
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm going to head in, okay?

128
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,573
Okay.

129
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:10,007
- Why is this...
- Let me show you.

130
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,166
Good night, Serra.

131
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,200
Good night, Jayden.

132
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:21,026
Hi, Babe.

133
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:53,130
What gift are you going to give Serra?

134
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,160
Wow.

135
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,040
Amazing.

136
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,056
I didn't know you're such a romantic.

137
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,600
Of course, I am.

138
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,756
If you're going to give something,

139
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,880
just give something the girl likes.

140
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,320
- Like this.
- Good point.

141
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,280
- Serra will certainly love that.
- I know, right?

142
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,240
Hey, you! Why are you smiling by yourself?

143
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:30,993
What are you thinking about?
Dirty thoughts?

144
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,080
What are you talking about?

145
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,480
You don't need to deny it.

146
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,920
Sometimes guys think of dirty thoughts.

147
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,600
Me, too. Sometimes.
Sometimes I think dirty thoughts.

148
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,720
I was thinking about Aiden.
You don't know anything.

149
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,440
I miss Aiden too, Ardhan.

150
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,400
Especially when you were busy with Richie.

151
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,160
I was lonely, I only had Ares and Megan.

152
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,440
It was exhausting.
You know how quiet they are.

153
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,480
They're as quiet as a wall.

154
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,960
Wall...

155
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,440
Wall of heart. Oh, dear.

156
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,800
Not funny?

157
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,160
We all miss Aiden, Ardhan.

158
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
I still feel something's not right.

159
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,000
If he's the sole perpetrator,

160
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,920
my kerambit wouldn't be missing

161
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:44,320
after Radit had been apprehended
by the police.

162
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,680
So, you don't think he worked alone?

163
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,680
Or maybe,

164
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,680
he's not the perpetrator?

165
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,520
If he's the man behind this,

166
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,840
would he have surrendered so easily?

167
00:16:09,353 --> 00:16:10,629
The way I see it,

168
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,770
he did that

169
00:16:13,549 --> 00:16:14,732
in order to...

170
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,873
To cover up the real man behind this.

171
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,510
Do you have a suspect in mind?

172
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:29,816
I do.

173
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
But I don't have any proof.

174
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
Great!

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,680
- I'm so tired.
- Today was great, Karissa!

176
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,499
I'm going to focus on dance now
so we can be the champion!

177
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,440
- Amen.
- That's it!

178
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,080
Our practice won't be in vain then.

179
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,640
This is me making amends.

180
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,920
- Sorry, guys.
- Well,

181
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:39,753
you were busy doing photoshoots,

182
00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:43,612
countless auditions, dating...

183
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,200
Can you shut up?
Can you stop talking about it?

184
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:48,819
Enough. Stop making a fuss out of it.

185
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,840
Being single is fun, isn't it?
No one would ask you,

186
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,823
"Baby, have you eaten yet?"

187
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,720
"What are you doing?
Have you slept yet?"

188
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,800
Baby.

189
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,680
Being single is fun, isn't it, Selina?

190
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,000
- It is fun. What's wrong?
- No, it isn't.

191
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,780
Moreo.

192
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,840
You were the one who captured Radit?

193
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:26,562
It was actually quite risky.

194
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:29,880
But thankfully, I was there.

195
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,120
Or Ardhan and Richie could've been dead.

196
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,406
That was why I asked Ares to come

197
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:38,000
while I kept Radit there.

198
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,400
But you weren't the one
to defeat him, right?

199
00:18:42,258 --> 00:18:44,258
Hold on...

200
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,619
Hold on.

201
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,320
- What?
- Of course I did.

202
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,866
Ares and Richie did helped.

203
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,680
They chased him.

204
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,160
But I couldn't stand
seeing my friend like that.

205
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,247
I needed to handle it myself

206
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,600
and I finally took down Radit.

207
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:09,293
Really?

208
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,840
- Really? You swear?
- Don't mock me. I'm serious, you know.

209
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm serious.

210
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,640
If it was recorded,
the whole school would know.

211
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,160
But we're talking about principles here.

212
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,760
I don't want that.

213
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,760
Because if you’re a hero,

214
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:29,363
people don't need to know what you did.

215
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,080
A hero!

216
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,520
Who is it, Selina?
They're sending you texts non-stop.

217
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,360
Check it out. Maybe it's important.

218
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,840
(LilBuddy: Hi, Selina. Remember me?
Send me your sexy pics. I'm horny)

219
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:52,421
This guy keeps on asking me for pictures.

220
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
Let me see.

221
00:19:54,086 --> 00:19:55,086
Who is it?

222
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,060
- Wait.
- Here.

223
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:59,806
(LilBuddy: Hi, Selina. Remember me?
Send me your sexy pics. I'm horny)

224
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,960
That's him! He's also
sending me texts. Look.

225
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,520
- Really?
- You, too?

226
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,567
Ignore him. He's just some weird guy.

227
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,000
- So weird.
- Freaky.

228
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Just ignore him.
He'll give up eventually.

229
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,480
Do you know how happy I am, Ares?

230
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:22,706
We rarely eat with Ares

231
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,760
and it turns out you're available tonight.

232
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:26,025
Weird, right?

233
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:29,326
He is usually taking care of Calderioz.

234
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,960
How's Calderioz, Ares?

235
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,920
Good.

236
00:20:42,303 --> 00:20:45,360
Honey, why are you asking about Calderioz?

237
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:49,313
Don't you want to ask
how his studies are at school?

238
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,836
And about his grades?

239
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,360
How long is it until the national exam?

240
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,640
How many more months?

241
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,099
Should I add the lesson time with Mr. Sal?

242
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,880
No need, Mom.

243
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,046
- It's enough.
- Is it?

244
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,986
"Anya_itsme"

245
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:16,000
Is that your friend?

246
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,049
She is.

247
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:20,699
- What's up with her?
- That's why.

248
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,040
Every time I post something,
she always posts a comment.

249
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,120
I post something and her comment pops up.

250
00:21:29,653 --> 00:21:33,013
- It's funny.
- She likes Ares, for sure.

251
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
Ignore her, Mom.

252
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,640
That's the way she is.

253
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,160
An attention seeker.

254
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,440
No way I'm ignoring her.

255
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,760
Should I not do anything?

256
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,640
You're weird, Honey.

257
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,880
You know your son
is the leader of Calderioz.

258
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,880
He's Antares Aldevaro.

259
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,520
He has a lot of fans, for sure.

260
00:21:58,693 --> 00:21:59,893
Am I right, Ares?

261
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,480
Calm down.

262
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,680
We're only here to ask some questions.

263
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:34,086
We're not going to do anything.

264
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,120
Do you have any connection to Radit?

265
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,720
I don't know.

266
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,600
I have only been here for two months.

267
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,760
Was any of the other
staff members involved?

268
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,039
No.

269
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,600
Radit didn't talk much.

270
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,360
Be it here or outside of this place.

271
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,360
Other staff members didn't know either.

272
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,440
Or maybe he had his friends
come over here?

273
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,800
There were. Only two people.

274
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,120
Was there anything suspicious about him?

275
00:23:24,286 --> 00:23:25,366
There was something.

276
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,600
You got a package, Boss.

277
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:37,386
Thanks.

278
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,939
(This is all for your brother.
Avenge him. That's an order!)

279
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,760
(I don't take no for an answer.
I don't want to hurt you)

280
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,000
I saw a threat letter.

281
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,160
"A threat"?

282
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,560
This guy's crazy. He keeps on texting me.

283
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,760
Selina, he's texting me too. Look.

284
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,520
Are we being stalked?
Why is he texting you too?

285
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,753
Don't say that. You're scaring me.

286
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,320
What? What happened?

287
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,699
The guy is texting Karissa, too.
He wants to get to know her. Scary.

288
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
- Seriously? How can he be texting you?
- We don't know!

289
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,527
Or should I respond?

290
00:25:06,627 --> 00:25:09,760
No! Just ignore him like I do.

291
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,960
Calm down.

292
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,346
Just ignore him.
Maybe he's just fooling around.

293
00:25:13,466 --> 00:25:15,213
Let's hope that's the case.

294
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:18,367
- But he's...
- Enough. Ignore him.

295
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
Guys, sorry, I have to leave.

296
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:23,873
Bye.

297
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,400
Jayden?

298
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,120
Bye.

299
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,000
- Bye!
- You should buy us some meals!

300
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,400
- For what?
- For having a new boyfriend.

301
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,621
Are they a couple now?

302
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:38,230
(Adams)

303
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,451
(Rock N Rider)

304
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:14,264
You!

305
00:26:14,731 --> 00:26:16,492
How many times have you done this?

306
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,216
Idiot!

307
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,676
Good thing there's no customer!

308
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:30,553
I've told you,

309
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:35,997
I prioritize cleanliness!

310
00:26:37,672 --> 00:26:38,699
Understand?

311
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,553
I'm sorry, Sir.

312
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,680
Clean it now!

313
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,000
How could it happen, Ares?

314
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,040
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

315
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
Does Barend know, yet?

316
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,076
I want to clear this up
before telling Barend.

317
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,960
That's why I need your help.

318
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,560
Why do problems keep coming our way?

319
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:19,527
The perpetrator has been caught.

320
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
But we still have problems.

321
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,360
Can't we have some downtime?

322
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,760
Calm down, Moreo.

323
00:27:26,613 --> 00:27:27,613
Where's Richie?

324
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:31,872
I don't know. He didn't say a thing.

325
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,720
And he hasn't come to school
after Radit's capture.

326
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,640
A friend of mine texted me last night.

327
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,800
He's a member of a new bike gang.

328
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,520
He said their base was attacked.

329
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,920
They don't know who did it.

330
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,120
Do you know what the attackers look like?

331
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,240
They wore full-face helmets,

332
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,000
black jackets, and masks.

333
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,000
And they got away after the attack.

334
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,560
Just like what we experienced.

335
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:07,025
You mean, the perpetrator is out there
though Radit has been apprehended?

336
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
Maybe.

337
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,800
And this has got to do
with your missing kerambit.

338
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,160
Aren't you curious?
He knows your house, Ares!

339
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:19,840
No one

340
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,600
should know about this.

341
00:28:23,793 --> 00:28:24,913
Including Richie?

342
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,960
Especially Richie.

343
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,400
I've checked everything.

344
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,240
They left no evidence.

345
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,080
I think,

346
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,080
they only wanted to scare us.

347
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,100
Arka?

348
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,100
Ares.

349
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:55,966
The terror is still haunting us.

350
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,600
It's getting more brutal.

351
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,800
New bike gangs
have become their target.

352
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,560
The perpetrator seems to know the
bike gangs' development.

353
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,120
We need to unite all the bike gangs.

354
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,240
The ones on a break and the active ones.

355
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,480
Because anyone can be their target.

356
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,080
Nice.

357
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,259
I agree.

358
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,080
We can't play it safe anymore.

359
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,440
If we do nothing for too long,
they'll act more outrageously.

360
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,679
Guys.

361
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,520
Anything you need,

362
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,600
I'll be ready to help you.

363
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,706
What's your plan?

364
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,280
We gather all the bike gang leaders

365
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,299
from Jakarta and Bandung.

366
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,480
- We're going to find who's behind this.
- Yeah.

367
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:28,672
(Karissa: Someone's bothering me,
it's annoying!)

368
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,010
Who's bothering you?

369
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,640
What do you mean?

370
00:30:36,823 --> 00:30:38,087
I saw your status.

371
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:40,506
It's nothing.

372
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,040
Babe.

373
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,360
Why do we have to be like this?

374
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,480
I want us to be like we used to, Babe.

375
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,360
- Baby.
- Ardhan! I'm in a hurry!

376
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,000
Hi, Mom.

377
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,240
Calm down.
I've done my detox a few days ago.

378
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,320
I'm good. I'm okay.

379
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,800
Relax, Mom, okay?

380
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,880
Okay.

381
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,479
I love you.
