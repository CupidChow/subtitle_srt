1
00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:13,446
Don't be afraid of Mommy, dear.

2
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:16,540
Mommy won't force you to do
something you don't want to do.

3
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:17,993
Only you can answer.

4
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:21,546
When you have had enough
and you feel you have to stop.

5
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:24,639
Please reschedule
all of my schedule for the day.

6
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,605
I have to meet an important client.

7
00:00:26,713 --> 00:00:27,746
Okay, thank you.

8
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:33,406
I can tell apart someone who is sincere.

9
00:00:33,704 --> 00:00:35,824
To me, she is mysterious.

10
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:38,640
She keeps her distance from me.

11
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,006
You're not on her level.

12
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:42,467
If people are already in love,
level is not important.

13
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:43,894
Do you think you actually love her?

14
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,379
This woman is different.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,306
There's something about her
that grew my interest all the more.

16
00:00:48,832 --> 00:00:52,365
She refuses to kiss
any of her clients, including me.

17
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:53,946
I'm fucking serious.

18
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:00,971
Because of you, I lost many
clients from his circle.

19
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:04,278
Whatever Mommy gave me,
I always give back more.

20
00:01:04,386 --> 00:01:06,699
Far more than what I received.

21
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:11,971
Why don't you ever want to
serve your client more than once?

22
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:15,186
Your profession is a prostitute.

23
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,727
And a whore who stands with her principle,

24
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:19,454
won't get anything.

25
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:23,061
In this world, there is no man who
is willing to have the woman he loves

26
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:25,182
able to sell herself to another man.

27
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:26,653
What are you afraid of from the past?

28
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,695
Now, all we have is the future.

29
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:31,283
It's fine if you can accept it,
but what about your parents?

30
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,254
Sir, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,201
Flo still uphold on to her principles.

32
00:01:38,427 --> 00:01:41,454
She couldn't see the same
client again a second time.

33
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,061
But, rest assured, Mr. Arif.

34
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:45,340
I have two new ones, fresh.

35
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:50,413
(Night Butterfly)

36
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:53,759
(Coming soon on WeTV)

37
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,170
What is this?

38
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,730
My mother was the victim there.

39
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,570
I did all this

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,590
to find out who did it!

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,160
Do you know when Calderioz
and Wolves were in a clash?

42
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,270
Of course.

43
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,480
How did you know? Was it on the news?

44
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,850
(Karambit Blade, Bike Gang Terror)

45
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,920
We still haven't found the karambit blade.

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,700
We also still haven't found
the real guy behind this.

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,939
Who's your boss?

48
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:54,330
(Previously)
Who's your boss?

49
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:54,850
(Previously)

50
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,310
I don't know.
(Previously)

51
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,720
(Previously)

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,585
Either you speak now
(Previously)

53
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:57,980
Either you speak now

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,690
or never speak again.

55
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,070
Regarding the person behind all of this,

56
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,220
I'm going to ask for Eros' help
to find out more.

57
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,930
What about "Slice of Happiness"?
Were there thugs?

58
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,220
If I see that thug once more,
I'm going to kill him.

59
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,130
Why are you lurking
at "Slice of Happiness"?

60
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,300
Damn it.

61
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,920
This is all your fault, Megan!

62
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,720
Why did you have to walk back and forth?

63
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,340
What are you talking about?
Just admit that you lost.

64
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,430
Cleo is in there.

65
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,070
Is it locked?

66
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,870
Ares.

67
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,300
Okay. One, two...

68
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,380
(Ares: The culprit is Jayden!)

69
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,500
Jayden?

70
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,900
It's Jayden!

71
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,470
Cleo is with Jayden!

72
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,110
What the hell?

73
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,020
- Megan!
- Moreo, watch out!

74
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,440
- Put it out!
- Crazy!

75
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,660
- Don't stand there, Cup!
- Moreo! Ardhan!

76
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,410
- That's the guy! Bastard!
- Megan!

77
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,080
- Hey! Megan!
- Bastard!

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,280
- Come on, Moreo!
- Come here!

79
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:36,930
(Do not attempt to do this act)

80
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,800
Ardhan! Leave!

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,920
Come here!

82
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,480
No one's here. It's empty.

83
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,720
How could we miss this?

84
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,590
Jayden, Ares! Jayden!

85
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,960
I’m sure Cleo is with him now.

86
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,700
If something happens to Cleo,
I'll finish him!

87
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,210
Calm down.

88
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,330
Calm down, okay?

89
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,870
Let's search for them again.

90
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,090
Let's search for them again.

91
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,430
Come on.

92
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,400
Where are you going?

93
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,250
I'm going to Serra's.

94
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,730
There's something I want to ask her,
but she's unreachable.

95
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,400
Why can't it wait until tomorrow?

96
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,810
It's late.

97
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,410
I'm coming with you.

98
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,830
Are you serious?

99
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,320
I need some fresh air anyway.

100
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,470
Come on!

101
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,780
Richie!

102
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,040
What is this place?

103
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,140
Then where's Cleo, Ares?

104
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,960
Cleo!

105
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,400
Cleo!

106
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,090
Where's Cleo?

107
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,780
What the hell happened to you?

108
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,000
Our base was attacked!

109
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,490
How are the guys?

110
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,740
Again.

111
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,270
They're handling it.

112
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,310
What are you doing here? Where's Cleo?

113
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,590
When we got here,

114
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,280
she was already gone.

115
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,150
(Megan: Cleo, I'll pick you up
at the cafe, okay?)

116
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,880
Control yourself.

117
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,650
Where's Cleo, Richie?

118
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,530
- We're going to find her together.
- Calm down, okay?

119
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,250
We're going to find her together. Okay?

120
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,720
Calm down.

121
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,210
Is there anything weird
that you know about Jayden?

122
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,950
This has nothing to do
with the bike gang attack, right?

123
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,670
Zea, that's not how Jayden is.

124
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,780
He doesn't like bike gangs.

125
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,280
But he has nothing to do
with those attacks.

126
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,490
Hang on.

127
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,940
You're not accusing him
of something, aren't you?

128
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,910
Serra.

129
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,030
I'm not accusing him.

130
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,190
I'm happy to see you smiling again
because of him.

131
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,500
But, is there anything
don't know about Jayden?

132
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,620
Wait here.

133
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,310
Is he the guy we're suspicious of?

134
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,370
He is.

135
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,460
There was something suspicious
when I last met him.

136
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,350
Here, Zea.

137
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,280
Honestly, I was suspicious when I saw it.

138
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,800
But, it wasn't as bad as I thought.

139
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,130
It was just a misunderstanding.

140
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,990
Zea.

141
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,980
Jayden is a nice guy.

142
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,070
He's only looking for the guy
behind his mother’s death.

143
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,650
Just like you are looking for the guy
behind all these incidents.

144
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,860
He doesn't know anything
about the "Stop or Die" attacks

145
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:07,350
or any other attack.

146
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,560
It's all clear.

147
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,990
I'm tired of hearing you making trouble.

148
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,240
You often got into fights.

149
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,170
And now Cleo's missing.

150
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,650
And you're trying to find her?

151
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,630
Let the police do that.

152
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,020
Hey, you. Why are you eating that here?

153
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,070
Ares, I've told you before.

154
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,120
Stop taking care of Calderioz.

155
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,890
Focus on your tryouts
and the national exam.

156
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm not the leader of Calderioz anymore.

157
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,990
Ardhan is.

158
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,610
I don't care who the leader is.

159
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,070
I just want you all to focus on school.

160
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,560
Not only Ares.

161
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,010
And don't go around trying to find Cleo.

162
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,970
The police is handling it.

163
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,710
But, Cleo is our friend.

164
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,870
But, the police is handling it.

165
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,950
You don't need to get involved.

166
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,230
Do you get it?

167
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,600
Cleo's missing.

168
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,000
And now you're asking us
to focus on our studies?

169
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,210
Megan, I know you're sad and devastated.

170
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,790
But, the police is handling it.

171
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,650
The police is looking for her.

172
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,510
I don't want you all to go looking for her

173
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,590
and cause more trouble for yourselves.

174
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,890
Yes, Ma'am.

175
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,210
Wait.

176
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,480
Ares.

177
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,480
Do you want us to stop looking for Cleo?

178
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,260
How could you say yes to Miss Anin?

179
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,430
Megan is still fighting for Cleo!

180
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,560
I think that's what we should do.

181
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,020
But Ardhan is the one
who makes the decisions here.

182
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,090
Ardhan, come on, man.

183
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,430
Cleo's missing. We need to find her.

184
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,850
It's pointless.

185
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,900
The national exam is ahead of us.

186
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,090
Do you want us to fail school
because we have to deal with the police?

187
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,600
I don't give a shit about that, man.

188
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,410
Cleo's in danger.

189
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,210
We need to find her now.

190
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,170
I agree with Richie.

191
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,210
We've done nothing all this time.

192
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,470
But we can't do that now!

193
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,400
This is a matter
of someone's life, Ardhan.

194
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,480
Don't tell me you're not
going to make a move, man.

195
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,160
The police is handling it.

196
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,320
Let them do their job.

197
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,310
I bet they're doing their best.

198
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,130
Just trust them.

199
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,360
I think Calderioz needs to be on a break.

200
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,960
Seriously?

201
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,960
Your first day as Calderioz’s leader
and this is your decision?

202
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,800
And what do you want us to do?

203
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,950
Even if it's Jayden,

204
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,370
we don't know where he is!

205
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,510
Can we

206
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,750
just for once agree on something?

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,650
What have we done from the beginning?

208
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
We've done nothing.

209
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,930
And now what? A break?

210
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,670
Retro and Delasga are active again,
yet we're on a break?

211
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,990
Hey, let me tell you something.

212
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,150
Our enemy right now is twisted.

213
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,860
- Come on.
- I can't.

214
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,000
I will still leave.

215
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,990
- Megan.
- Me, too.

216
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,420
It's a mess.

217
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,670
A total mess.

218
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,000
Calderioz guys are snitching.

219
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,900
But, I get it.

220
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,880
They're worried about their comfort.

221
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,510
Yes, Ardhan.

222
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,840
A lot of the guys asked me,

223
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,300
why don't we just go on a break?

224
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,990
And,

225
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,900
I didn't know how to answer it.

226
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,540
The problem has become personal.

227
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,940
We can't keep involving Calderioz in this.

228
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,720
I will contact Baren and the others.

229
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,930
They will understand.

230
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,190
Where else should we look for Cleo?

231
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,790
I just hope

232
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,340
the police can find Cleo fast.

233
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,260
What have we done to Jayden?

234
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,460
You should've told us
from the start about this.

235
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,860
I... I know I made a big mistake.

236
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,090
I never thought Jayden would do
something like this.

237
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,770
If only...

238
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,200
Serra, stop it.

239
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,790
It's not your fault.

240
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:30,710
None of us knew that Jayden did it.

241
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,740
We were fooled by his kindness.

242
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,630
Guys.

243
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,850
I promise

244
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,440
we're going to find Cleo.

245
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,770
Whatever it takes, I promise I will help.

246
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,070
Hi.

247
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,510
Let's go home together.

248
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,120
Okay?

249
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,180
Of all the members of Calderioz,

250
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,530
you're the one I admire the most.

251
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,690
You're similar to Ares.

252
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,830
You're always calm
when facing anything.

253
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,760
If you stay calm,

254
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,150
everything's going to be okay.

255
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,840
Aiden.

256
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,950
I failed

257
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,990
to protect Cleo.

258
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,890
It's not your fault, Megan.

259
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,970
It's not your fault.

260
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,580
You just need to calm down

261
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,410
in order to think clearly.

262
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,090
You're going to leave
in this messy situation?

263
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,670
How could you hand over your leadership?

264
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,960
The karambit is missing.

265
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,180
And now you have another problem,
Cleo's missing!

266
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,410
And you decided that

267
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,650
Calderioz is going to be on a break?

268
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,050
I don't get it.

269
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,130
Are you playing around
with your leadership?

270
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,020
(Missing Person, Name: Cleo)

271
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,090
If you see this person,
please contact the number below.

272
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,430
- Okay.
- Thank you.

273
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,730
We miss you, Cleo.

274
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,540
The disturbing bike gang terrors
keeps on going.

275
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,670
Yesterday night, several people got robbed
by the bike gang.

276
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,390
The victims said the perpetrators
were three people on a bike.

277
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:21,160
Bike gangs keep on taking victims.

278
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,870
I just want them to disband!

279
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,410
But they're too stubborn to do that!

280
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,660
If only Ares would disband Calderioz
like those other gangs,

281
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,430
the situation won't be like this!

282
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,110
Those damn bike gangs!

283
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,070
Cleo.

284
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,560
Sorry.

285
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,270
I shouldn't have done this to you.

286
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,560
I won't hurt you.

287
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,310
Got it?

288
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,030
I won't hurt you.

289
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,370
Got it?

290
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,030
You,

291
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,180
Serra,

292
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,140
and your other friends

293
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,510
shouldn't have gotten involved this far.

294
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,910
Seeing Calderioz disbanded...

295
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,090
That's what I want.

296
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,710
Wait.

297
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,600
Where are Selina and Karissa?

298
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,800
They left to look for our dance costumes.

299
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,990
Serra.

300
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,610
Have you heard anything from Jayden?

301
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,130
I can't stop thinking,

302
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,870
do you know the places he often visits?

303
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,220
There are some places,

304
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,310
but I'm not certain if he's there.

305
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,870
No problem. Can you send them to me?

306
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,490
Okay.

307
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,670
I've sent them.

308
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,030
Okay. Thanks, Serra.

309
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,830
Zea

310
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,620
What's up, Serra?

311
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,030
Are you sure Jayden is involved?
