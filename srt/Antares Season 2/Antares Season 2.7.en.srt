1
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:31,846
I want to take over Calderioz.

2
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,200
Not that easy.

3
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:37,429
It's scary now.

4
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:39,606
The bike gangs are extorting us.

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,279
It's more dangerous

6
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:43,529
if we let the criminals be.

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,160
No, this bike looks exactly like the one
that was chasing me.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,760
I have more than one bike.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,306
If I wanted to destroy Calderioz,
I would aim the leader.

10
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:52,545
Why on earth would I target you?

11
00:00:52,646 --> 00:00:53,760
Let it go!

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,173
Don't let outsiders know
Calderioz's internal dispute.

13
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:00,310
Or they'll be able to use that
to their advantage.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,080
Let's solve this together, okay?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,080
Ares!

16
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,320
I don't get it, Miss Anin.

17
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,120
There's more and more trouble
happening in this school.

18
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,880
And again, it has to do with Calderioz.
I don't get it.

19
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,720
Ares, Zea...

20
00:03:48,236 --> 00:03:49,280
How is she, Doctor?

21
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:53,570
She's fine, but please don't be noisy.

22
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:54,926
Let her rest.

23
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:57,699
I'll take my leave.

24
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,920
Thank you, Doctor.

25
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:07,633
Ares.

26
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,240
The thief has been arrested.

27
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
You can relax now.

28
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,400
Watch her for me.

29
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:19,093
I'm going to the counseling room.

30
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,367
Miss Anin asked for me.

31
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:21,847
Okay.

32
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
- Let us know if anything happens.
- Okay.

33
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,800
I know you're an accomplished student.

34
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,400
You have great grades.

35
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,500
And you often
make our school proud academically.

36
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:43,632
But all of your actions doesn't reflect

37
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,080
that you are an accomplished student.

38
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,160
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

39
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:51,459
It's my fault that I took justice
into my own hands.

40
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,367
It's good that you're aware of that.

41
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,480
But this isn't the first time
you have made trouble.

42
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,720
Other students will think

43
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,893
this school is not handling

44
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:04,480
trouble-makers like you seriously.

45
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,120
I've consulted Mr. Darwis.

46
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,520
And with a heavy heart,

47
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,600
the school has to suspend you
for this incident.

48
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,473
I will call your parents.

49
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,800
I hope this will be
a learning experience for you.

50
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,280
This is your last warning.

51
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
The national exam is approaching.

52
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,520
Don't make any more trouble.

53
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:35,000
If you do that one more time,

54
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,496
you might be expelled.

55
00:05:40,386 --> 00:05:41,506
Yes, Ma'am.

56
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,200
What's taking him so long?

57
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,400
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know. Let's just wait.

58
00:05:54,243 --> 00:05:55,243
Ardhan.

59
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:56,800
Be honest.

60
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:59,480
Where were you during the gala?

61
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,920
Why weren't you there?

62
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,666
How was it?

63
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm suspended.

64
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:08,786
Five days.

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,560
Seriously?

66
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,920
I'm going to see Zea first.

67
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,620
Things are bad as it is,
and now this happens.

68
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,240
How was it?

69
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
I'm suspended for five days.

70
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,200
Get well soon, Babe.

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,720
I need to go.

72
00:06:58,513 --> 00:06:59,753
Take care of her for me.

73
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,760
For sure.

74
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,280
Be careful, Ares.

75
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,840
Wait.

76
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,880
What are you doing?

77
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,880
I'm apologizing.

78
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:43,105
We can't keep on fighting.

79
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,120
Let's make up.

80
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,080
Why only "hmm"?

81
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Let's make up.

82
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,760
Okay.

83
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
If you don't want the pinkie...

84
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,840
- You'd like that, right?
- What are you doing?

85
00:08:06,941 --> 00:08:08,621
Am I right?

86
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,040
That's why you shouldn't be annoying.

87
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,960
Let's make up then.

88
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,800
Here.

89
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:20,986
That's it.

90
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,480
Babe, you didn't go to the gala dinner?

91
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,320
Where were you?

92
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,880
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

93
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:54,586
- License and registration, please.
- Just a minute.

94
00:08:57,793 --> 00:08:59,313
(Suspension Letter)

95
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,600
It was just yesterday,

96
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:10,499
not even 24 hours ago

97
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,280
that we were shocked
by what happened during gala dinner.

98
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,360
Now, this!

99
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,793
I want to ask you something.

100
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,200
Have we ever forbidden you
from riding a motorbike?

101
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,240
Answer her, Ares.

102
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
Never.

103
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,400
Have we ever forbidden you
from your activities in Calderioz?

104
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:39,086
- This has nothing to do with Calderioz...
- Answer me, first.

105
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,272
Never.

106
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:44,753
Do you know why?

107
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,600
Because I trust you.

108
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:57,099
You don't know this,
but I'm always worried about you.

109
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
But I try to understand you.

110
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,859
I keep on trusting you

111
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,880
and your good intentions
along with your friends

112
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,440
to restore Calderioz's good name,

113
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,440
unlike what people have accused you of.

114
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,440
That Calderioz's name is dignified.

115
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,440
I believe in you.

116
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,280
We're just worried.

117
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,920
And how's Zea?

118
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,360
I haven't asked about her.

119
00:10:24,392 --> 00:10:26,113
But I heard she has woken up.

120
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,199
Oh, my God. That's not what I mean.

121
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
Don't you get it?

122
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,532
You're not only endangering yourself,

123
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,960
you're also endangering others.

124
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,280
And it's Zea!

125
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:40,413
Do you think I will let that happen?

126
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,840
Yes, Mom.

127
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,840
I was wrong.

128
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,480
I let my emotions
get the best of me.

129
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,113
But I'm not only

130
00:10:52,626 --> 00:10:54,480
responsible for myself.

131
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,400
Now,

132
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,400
I need to find out
who ruined the gala.

133
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,520
I bet you want to know too.

134
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,520
You broke the rules.

135
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,240
You're suspended.

136
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,840
Think about it.

137
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,213
Can we just

138
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,240
try make the best use of right now?

139
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,883
So you can

140
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,640
think more clearly.

141
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,183
For yourself. You!

142
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:30,273
You need to stop
thinking about your friends.

143
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:31,833
Can you do that?

144
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,320
You are important!

145
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,680
Focus and introspect.

146
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,280
That's all I ask of you
if you still love me.

147
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,800
I'll keep this phone.

148
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:48,449
Honey, we can't let Ares

149
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,680
leave the house for five days.

150
00:11:57,953 --> 00:11:58,973
Okay.

151
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,640
But I want to make a phone call first.

152
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,600
Okay, just once.

153
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,603
(Ares)

154
00:12:36,073 --> 00:12:37,113
Ares's calling.

155
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
- Hello, Ares. What's up?
- Ardhan.

156
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,120
I can't come to the base.

157
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,880
I can't hang out with the guys for now.

158
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
My mom is furious.

159
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
I can't get out of the house

160
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,526
and my phone won't be with me.

161
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,800
Are you serious?

162
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,840
Take care of the guys for me.

163
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,810
Take care of Calderioz for me.

164
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,840
Take good care of them until I'm back.

165
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,103
- Okay, Ares.
- Thanks, Ardhan.

166
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,280
Take care of yourself.

167
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:12,233
Okay.

168
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,953
Guys, come here.

169
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,960
What is it, Ardhan?

170
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,240
Ares won't be able
to take care of Calderioz for some time.

171
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,560
He asked me to take over the leadership

172
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,280
until he comes back.

173
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,160
What's wrong with him?

174
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,440
His mother is furious.

175
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,800
But don't be woeful.

176
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:46,213
Even without Ares,

177
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
we have to take care
of Calderioz together.

178
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,532
We need to show

179
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,520
that we're no ordinary bike gang.

180
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,440
They can't mess with us.

181
00:13:57,073 --> 00:13:58,143
Come on!

182
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
We can't cave in! Calderioz can't cave in!

183
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,960
Go Calderioz!

184
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:22,752
The number you're calling
is out of reach. Please...

185
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,896
(Let me know when you're awake)

186
00:14:25,997 --> 00:14:27,590
(I didn't mean to hit you, I'm sorry)

187
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:29,340
(I have to go home, I got suspended)

188
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,466
(It's okay)

189
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:32,073
(Are you home now?)

190
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:34,120
(Can I call you?)

191
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,080
Eros? Hello?

192
00:15:22,186 --> 00:15:23,226
Yeah?

193
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,160
- It's still very red.
- I'm fine.

194
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,080
See? It's not that bad.

195
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,067
I'm strong.

196
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:33,607
Yes, you're strong. A champion.

197
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,080
But that doesn't mean
nothing won't happen to you.

198
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,327
Do you know who did it?

199
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:42,069
Let it go.

200
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,640
- I want to find him.
- You don't need to.

201
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,600
(CCTV Room)

202
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,840
- Okay. Thank you, Sir.
- You're welcome.

203
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,743
I've told you.

204
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,960
Calderioz needs a commander-in-chief.

205
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,763
I'm leaving. Don't talk about it here.

206
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:23,503
See, Megan?

207
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:25,200
What did I tell you?

208
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,120
I already had a bad feeling
since the very beginning.

209
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,200
What do you mean?

210
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,247
Did you realize

211
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,360
that Ardhan wasn't at the Gala?

212
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,920
Something also happened that night.

213
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,080
Ardhan has always been at odds with Ares.

214
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,320
So, you're blaming Ardhan for this?

215
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
No way!

216
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,960
At the base,

217
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,160
who was the most excited last night?

218
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,840
So quiet. Everyone's doing
their own thing.

219
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,200
Don't we have to make a move?

220
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,640
That Gala incident, Zea being mugged.

221
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,880
How long will we stay silent?

222
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,720
Morning, guys.

223
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,720
So?

224
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,040
I'll follow what Ares says.

225
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,840
- He is still suspended.
- Let's wait for him.

226
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,240
We need to be more careful.

227
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
The situation's risky.

228
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,480
If we're reckless,

229
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,400
it'll be dangerous for us.

230
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:18,126
We're going to be have
national exam anyway.

231
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,560
I'm with you, bro.

232
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,920
"I'm with you, bro."

233
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,440
The school's quiet without Ares.

234
00:18:46,785 --> 00:18:47,869
I know, right.

235
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:49,960
I can't even contact him.

236
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,840
I heard his phone has been confiscated.

237
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,240
Stay strong, Zea.

238
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,680
You could write him a letter?

239
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,040
My house isn't far from his.

240
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,200
I can bring it to him.

241
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,840
That's a good idea!

242
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
- So cute, just like the olden times.
- Yeah.

243
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,040
- Can you do that?
- Of course.

244
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,760
- So adorable!
- Exchanging letters.

245
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,880
I want that, too.

246
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:29,966
Someone went to the gala dinner.

247
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,883
It's Aldevaro's gala dinner, too.

248
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,280
How was it?

249
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,480
Were you happy?

250
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,786
For a lowlife commoner

251
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,360
to go to an exclusive place
for the first time.

252
00:19:44,773 --> 00:19:45,950
Hey, horse face!

253
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,800
Are you jealous? Just say it!

254
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,430
Hey, you tramp. Don't act too much!

255
00:19:51,531 --> 00:19:52,680
Shut your mouth!

256
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,880
You crazy girl!

257
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,840
- You freak!
- You freak!

258
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,360
Okay. Ready?

259
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,120
(Hi, Babe!)

260
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,240
(First day of school without you)

261
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,280
I'm going to leave.

262
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,680
You're not allowed
to meet your friends, right?

263
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,880
Thank you, send my regards to Zea.

264
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

265
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,160
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

266
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,280
- Please come again.
- Okay, bye.

267
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:37,113
Sir.

268
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,920
- Fi.
- Yes?

269
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:44,773
The customer who likes to order
our sunflower cake, was she here today?

270
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,080
The one you dropped to the car
under the umbrella during the rain?

271
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,120
I don't think she came today.

272
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,800
But, it's unusual.

273
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,960
- Thank you.
- Okay.

274
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,680
Aiden.

275
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,120
Should I move on?

276
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:36,607
Aiden.

277
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,280
If you think I should move on,

278
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,880
please

279
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,280
make the music box
play one more time.

280
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,040
You're crazy, Serra.

281
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,120
- Aunty?
- Hey, Zea.

282
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,227
Your face is bruised. Sit down.

283
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,960
It's fine.

284
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,520
You and Ares are the same,
always saying "it's fine".

285
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,880
I'm sure it hurts.

286
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,520
I could only buy you this cake.

287
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,480
Thank you. Sorry for troubling you.

288
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,640
No trouble.

289
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,423
I'm sure you've heard

290
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,800
about Ares being suspended for five days.

291
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm sorry.

292
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,616
He's suspended

293
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:45,480
because he helped me.

294
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,360
Wait, don't say that.

295
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Don't blame yourself.

296
00:23:51,223 --> 00:23:53,080
It's Ares' fault.

297
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,680
Why did he take matters
into his own hands?

298
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,526
I came here to explain

299
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:01,960
that during his suspension,

300
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,320
I'm keeping his phone.

301
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,276
I want him to introspect and focus

302
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,160
so that he understands his fault

303
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,960
and knows how to fix it.

304
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,520
And one more thing.

305
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,320
I want to say something.

306
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,960
To Ares and you.

307
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,523
Right now,

308
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:32,613
these high school years

309
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,040
are going to affect your future greatly.

310
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,400
You need to be extremely careful.

311
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,400
Yes, Aunty.

312
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll try telling him that.

313
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,280
On the first day of your suspension,

314
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,640
everything changed.

315
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,760
It's quiet.

316
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,680
Even Serra realizes that.

317
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,560
I'm okay, Ares. See?

318
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm all good.

319
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,600
It'll fade soon.

320
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,040
You're doing okay, aren't you?

321
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,360
What have you been doing today? Tell me.

322
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,427
By the way,

323
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:26,320
I sent you a letter through Cleo.

324
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
Have you read it?

325
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,160
Also,

326
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,080
your mom was here earlier.

327
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,247
But I'm going to tell you
about that later,

328
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:39,400
when we meet.

329
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,160
One thing for sure is that

330
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,720
I miss you so much.

331
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,000
Though it's only been one day.

332
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,893
Hi, Babe.

333
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:16,773
The first day of school
without you feels so quiet.

334
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:20,127
I feel like I haven't met you in forever.

335
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,720
Though it's only been one day.
I'm exaggerating.

336
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,000
I didn't hang out
with the Calderioz guys today.

337
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,560
I don't know what they were doing.

338
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
All I did was thinking about you.

339
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,840
Take good care of yourself, okay?

340
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,160
I can't wait to meet you.

341
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
So, who was it?

342
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,440
You haven't found out, yet?

343
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,520
Isn't it you?

344
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,960
Come on, man! Use your brain!

345
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,560
- Stop talking.
- Hey.

346
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,240
I told you I'm with you.
So, whatever your plan is, I'm in.

347
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,240
Where are the others?
Are they suspended, too?

348
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,080
Can you shut up?

349
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,920
Okay, Captain.

350
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,560
Are you testing me?

351
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,916
Look at me.

352
00:27:27,496 --> 00:27:30,160
Look at me.

353
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,070
You are the captain now.

354
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,360
Mrs. Athena, thank you
for inviting me here.

355
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,360
It's my pleasure.

356
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:52,219
I've looked into Antares' profile.

357
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,600
- Call me Ares.
- Ares.

358
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,966
I made a chart

359
00:27:59,243 --> 00:28:01,876
regarding Ares' education.

360
00:28:01,977 --> 00:28:04,777
During the 10th grade, we can see

361
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:08,242
Ares is excellent in several subjects,

362
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,286
like English.

363
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,880
It's good.

364
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,360
Physics. It's great.

365
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,880
Math. Okay, great.

366
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,960
But, Mrs. Athena,

367
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,360
approaching national exam,

368
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,660
you can see

369
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,920
an extremely low number.

370
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,160
- The subject is Indonesian.
- Oh, dear.

371
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,560
Meanwhile, Indonesian has a big
percentage in the exam.

372
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:40,139
If you're Indonesian but
can't speak the language, that's worrying.

373
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,720
- I hope it won't be like that.
- That's the thing.

374
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,640
So, I've prepared

375
00:28:46,133 --> 00:28:49,733
a strategy for his education.

376
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,080
Pass the national exam,
then we go to college.

377
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,480
- That's good.
- What is this, Mom?

378
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:02,939
This is a special program
made specially by Mr. Sal

379
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,382
for you to learn
easily to make it easier

380
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:09,320
for you to pass the
university entrance test.

381
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:10,899
Understand?

382
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,840
You may continue.

383
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,313
I'd like your permission

384
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:17,600
to check his room after this.

385
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,800
This way.

386
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,320
The study desk,

387
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,400
the study chair,

388
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:55,042
the room condition,
the decoration and ornaments,

389
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,194
the lamp, the lighting.

390
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,693
It's dark.

391
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:01,386
It's not conducive for his study.

392
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:04,313
What is this? Fengshui?

393
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,760
So, what should we do?

394
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,073
Maybe there's another room

395
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:15,200
that's more conducive to study?

396
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,200
Somewhere bigger and brighter.

397
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,480
- Hi.
- Hi.

398
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,640
- Morning.
- Morning.

399
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,760
I wanted to bring you this.

400
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,360
What is this?

401
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,640
Sunflower cake.

402
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,600
Oh, my God!

403
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,880
I heard you came looking
for this yesterday.

404
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,120
So, I made this for you.

405
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,200
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

406
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,960
Have a nice day.

407
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,600
You, too.

408
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,120
- I'm going to leave.
- Okay.

409
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,080
- See you.
- See you.

410
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:27,499
Serra's not single anymore!

411
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,680
What's this? Food?

412
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,440
- It's Serra's.
- Yes, food.

413
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,920
I'm only asking.
I'll be thankful if you give me some.

414
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,920
- Hold this. Don't let it near him.
- Be careful!

415
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
Moreo's dangerous.

416
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,320
- I'm only asking.
- He's quiet but dangerous.

417
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,460
Zea! Karissa! Come here!

418
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,360
Serra's not single anymore!

419
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,400
You're too loud!

420
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,000
- Can I try it?
- No way!

421
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,040
It's for Serra.
If you want, just ask Moreo.

422
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Why should I ask him?

423
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,300
It's okay, Selina!

424
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,160
Zea, here.

425
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:38,613
It's only a cake.

426
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

427
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,936
Rest assured, I didn't read it.

428
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,680
I trust you.

429
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,546
I need to go.

430
00:32:46,866 --> 00:32:49,946
- The cake's cute.
- Girls, Moreo, I'm leaving.

431
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,440
- Bye.
- Where are you going?

432
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,680
Hey!

433
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,760
Wait, why is she smiling?
