1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Here.

2
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:11,594
I can't stop thinking about it.

3
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:15,308
Ardhan is suspended.

4
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:17,821
He went viral with that video.

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,501
And then what?

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,741
Who else is going to be the victim?

7
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,061
Do you realize?

8
00:00:30,314 --> 00:00:33,154
Calderioz's members have been attacked
one by one.

9
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:35,874
You're the only one
who hasn't been attacked yet.

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,781
Don't think about it.

11
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,781
Nothing's going to happen to me.

12
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:43,421
I know. Nothing's going to happen now.

13
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:44,581
- Hey.
- But...

14
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:49,901
Relax. Okay?

15
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:51,541
I'm going to be fine.

16
00:01:01,257 --> 00:01:06,924
(Do not attempt to do this act)

17
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:08,781
What are you doing?

18
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,181
Do you want to fight?

19
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:22,981
Hi.

20
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:25,421
It's me, Richie.

21
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,261
I thought you were someone else.

22
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:39,130
Alright.

23
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,301
Sorry, I was just joking.

24
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,421
Hi, Cleo.

25
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,141
Am I disturbing?

26
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:04,861
No?

27
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:07,354
Okay.

28
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:15,094
Richie.

29
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:18,541
I'd like to ask you something.

30
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:21,454
Go ahead.

31
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:26,941
Why did you come back here?

32
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:32,261
I've finished all of my family matters.

33
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,581
That's why I came back.

34
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:42,381
Do you have any problem with Ares?

35
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,981
I don't feel like I have any problem.

36
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,241
But I don't know about him.

37
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,021
Let's go. I have to go to the base.

38
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,880
You go.

39
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:10,301
Let me drop Cleo home.

40
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:15,887
Come on.

41
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:18,581
Relax, Megan.

42
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:21,581
She's like a little sister to me.

43
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:25,981
He's like a brother to me.

44
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:30,334
Aren't you going to the base?

45
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,181
I got bored at that place.

46
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:34,501
I'll go later.

47
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:37,501
It's fine, Megan. Just go.

48
00:03:40,694 --> 00:03:42,294
- Okay.
- Do you have to?

49
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,781
Well, I have to. Ares is waiting for me.

50
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,687
Bye.

51
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:52,261
Take care.

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,440
- Bye.
- Okay.

53
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:00,461
- Give us two portions of meatballs.
- No need.

54
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,661
- Two. Cleo!
- No.

55
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,701
Do you want to order or not?

56
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,581
You indecisive youngsters.

57
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,781
Oh, dear.

58
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:16,541
I went with Ardhan and Richie yesterday.

59
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:19,181
And I'm sure they were thugs.

60
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:21,661
A random person recorded it

61
00:04:22,107 --> 00:04:24,267
to add the fuss on bike gangs.

62
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,021
You attacked the wrong target.

63
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,261
That's a fact.

64
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,181
The thugs might not be the ones
who attacked us.

65
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,861
But they're still thugs
who have been disturbing people.

66
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:37,247
But the news that is spreading
about the attack

67
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,421
makes the people restless.

68
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,581
You can't find a justification
for your wrong target.

69
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,621
I believe in you all.

70
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:53,781
But Calderioz shouldn't have acted
this recklessly.

71
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:55,981
This is why we have to be cautious.

72
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:57,767
Got it?

73
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,931
I want all of you to be focused

74
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,221
and unite to solve this problem.

75
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,861
We can't have our own ways like this.

76
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,141
I'm with Ares on this.

77
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,981
If anyone has any information,

78
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,581
share it.

79
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:19,141
But you move on your own, Ares.

80
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:28,621
Okay.

81
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:31,261
From now on,

82
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,861
I'm going to involve all of you.

83
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,341
Our target's name is Radit.

84
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:41,741
I'm sure he works on his own.

85
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:44,581
He's not involved with any bike gangs.

86
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:48,421
But I still need solid proof.

87
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,581
And I only have one clue about him.

88
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:05,164
(Labos Helmet)

89
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:06,501
I want you all...

90
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,448
All of us

91
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:10,327
to find out about Radit.

92
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:12,727
About this.

93
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:15,707
Whatever it is.

94
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,481
The motorbike is with Bara right now.

95
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,941
You can take it. You can check whatever.

96
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:25,461
Check the plate, the owner,
the address, everything.

97
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:29,261
I will focus on Ardhan who is suspended

98
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,581
because I need to find the proof
that I can give to the school.

99
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:35,901
So you don’t get expelled.

100
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:17,981
- You have your drink with you?
- I have it here.

101
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:19,294
Okay.

102
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:21,821
Hey, Ares. Join us.

103
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,741
To do what?

104
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:29,301
Morning run?

105
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:32,621
You haven't been
running with us for a while.

106
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:35,174
He's been doing it frequently.

107
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:37,741
Because he's been fighting a lot.

108
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:39,741
He's your brother!

109
00:07:41,141 --> 00:07:43,221
Come on. The sun's really nice today.

110
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,261
Come, it's good to go out once in a while.

111
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,021
Change your clothes. I'll be waiting.

112
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:51,501
Okay. Hang on.

113
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:55,501
He's going to join us! Yes!

114
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,981
- Wait!
- Sandra?

115
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,640
- What's wrong?
- Pace your breath.

116
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:06,701
- You're tired already?
- Even I can do it.

117
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:09,054
- Hi, Uncle, Auntie.
- I'm tired.

118
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:11,541
You're jogging together?

119
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,421
It's unusual for him to join us, right?

120
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,581
I managed to get him to join us.

121
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,400
So he can breathe the fresh morning air.

122
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:22,421
- Yes.
- So, you want to sit first?

123
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,400
- Come on, let's sit.
- Here, Honey.

124
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,581
Yes.

125
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,861
Good thing you're here, Cleo.

126
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:31,581
I'd like to ask about that viral video.

127
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,701
The fighting video.

128
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,501
Are Ardhan and Richie in it?

129
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:41,021
Were you there, too?

130
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,781
No, I wasn't.

131
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:44,901
No, Auntie.

132
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:48,101
Ares, Megan, and Moreo weren't there.

133
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:51,541
And I think the video
has been manipulated.

134
00:08:51,923 --> 00:08:53,007
In fact,

135
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:57,537
Ardhan and Richie were asking
the thugs there to leave.

136
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,941
Thank God.

137
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:04,221
If you were there,

138
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,101
I can’t imagine how furious I would be.

139
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:12,101
Mom, I'll walk with Cleo for a while.

140
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:14,141
- Okay.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,101
You need to pace your breath.

142
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:21,741
Thanks for defending me, Cleo.

143
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,261
You're welcome.

144
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:35,381
How fun it is to be able to ride a bike.

145
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,101
I'm not scared to learn anymore.

146
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:42,221
You remember that accident?

147
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:44,321
Yeah.

148
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,234
Here's the throttle.

149
00:09:47,334 --> 00:09:49,221
Remember to look
at the rear mirror.

150
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:51,261
- Okay.
- Okay. The engine...

151
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,421
What are you doing?

152
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:54,461
I'm teaching Cleo to ride a motorbike.

153
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:57,621
- No way. It's dangerous.
- Why?

154
00:09:57,701 --> 00:09:59,541
- It's dangerous, Cleo.
- It's fine.

155
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,467
I can take care of myself.

156
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:02,941
Continue.

157
00:10:04,221 --> 00:10:05,261
Richie.

158
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,320
You should know better.

159
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,700
She even fell from her bicycle
the other day.

160
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:11,661
Now you're teaching
her to ride a motorbike?

161
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,381
Not everything is dangerous.
Don't listen to him, Cleo. It's easy.

162
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:15,501
Turn this on.

163
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,894
- Wear the helmet.
- Okay.

164
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:20,974
Okay?

165
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,301
Okay.

166
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,021
- Like this?
- Yeah.

167
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:26,821
Start the engine.

168
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,461
Just believe in yourself, okay?

169
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:33,021
Okay.

170
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:35,021
Just go.

171
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:38,181
This is not a good idea.

172
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,581
Cleo! See?

173
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
Cleo? What hurts?

174
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:54,621
My foot hurts so much.

175
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,461
Don't touch it!

176
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,141
This is your doing! Get help!

177
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:00,581
Cleo, sorry.

178
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:04,461
- Okay. Don't move it.
- It hurts so much.

179
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,461
Don't move it.

180
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:11,381
Take a deep breath.

181
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:24,981
I wish you, Richie and I
can be friends like we used to.

182
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:27,981
Sorry.

183
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:30,174
Because I wasn't careful,

184
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,861
the three of us ended up like this.

185
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:35,261
It's not because of that.

186
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:39,101
There was another reason
that worsen our friendship even more.

187
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:54,034
Oh, dear!

188
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:56,701
You're so handsome, Ares!

189
00:11:57,427 --> 00:12:00,147
I bet you're going on a date with Zea.

190
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,653
No. I just have to talk to her for a bit.

191
00:12:03,817 --> 00:12:05,501
Is that so?

192
00:12:09,781 --> 00:12:14,221
See? I'm sure you're going on a date!

193
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,741
What are you talking about?

194
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:20,021
Okay then. Have a nice date.

195
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:22,621
Bye!

196
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:26,621
Let's go to the scene.

197
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,141
Let's find proof to clear Ardhan's name.

198
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,101
And Richie, too.

199
00:12:34,264 --> 00:12:35,264
Ares.

200
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:38,308
Richie is also a member of Calderioz.

201
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:40,341
He's your commander-in-chief.

202
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,261
You also need to protect him.

203
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:50,981
I tried to investigate Labos,
but they were closed.

204
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,221
So I didn't get to go inside.

205
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:56,301
Okay. Come on.

206
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,027
When will Ardhan and I
be like how we used to be?

207
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:22,581
He told me to make a bucket list.

208
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,781
But he doesn't even have time
to fulfill them.

209
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:29,814
He doesn't even have time to read it,

210
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:32,174
let alone fulfill them.

211
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:43,748
(Ardhan: Babe, I'm down here)

212
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:51,801
Babe.

213
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,613
What's wrong with you?

214
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:57,741
I don't know, Babe.

215
00:13:59,141 --> 00:14:00,461
My head's spinning.

216
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,221
How did it turn into this?

217
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,061
May I ask for a hug?

218
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:38,981
Do you remember?

219
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,461
You used to be jealous of Richie.

220
00:14:46,861 --> 00:14:48,341
He's annoying.

221
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:52,341
But he's not that bad.

222
00:14:58,537 --> 00:15:01,501
But you do realize

223
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,301
that he has a bad effect on you?

224
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:09,261
"A bad effect"?

225
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:12,801
What do you mean?

226
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:24,294
Babe, amongst all Calderioz's
main members,

227
00:15:25,381 --> 00:15:27,101
Richie trusts me the most.

228
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:30,181
And he always has my back.

229
00:15:44,024 --> 00:15:45,148
Babe.

230
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:46,941
Please.

231
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,141
I only need your support now.

232
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,541
After all this is over,

233
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,901
everything's going to be fine.

234
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:05,461
We're going to have more spare time,
like we used to.

235
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,101
Okay, Babe?

236
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,700
Sir.

237
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:53,141
- Morning, Sir.
- Morning.

238
00:16:53,794 --> 00:16:57,234
- You want to order chicken noodles?
- Yes. Two portions, please.

239
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,901
- With veggies, please.
- Okay.

240
00:17:00,002 --> 00:17:01,052
By the way,

241
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,043
I heard there was
a commotion here yesterday.

242
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,859
The video went viral.

243
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:09,101
It has been settled.

244
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:14,021
There were thugs causing trouble.

245
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:18,427
- "Thugs"? Not bike gangs?
- No.

246
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:21,341
The bike gang members
actually helped us.

247
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:26,261
See? They helped us repair the damage.

248
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,701
Then, the news circulating
that vendors were attacked

249
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:35,221
aren't true, then?

250
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,701
That's not true.

251
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,341
- Okay then. Thanks.
- Okay. I'm going to prepare your order.

252
00:17:42,421 --> 00:17:43,501
Thanks.

253
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:09,947
(Richie: You're up for a game?)

254
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:50,842
(Bucket List)

255
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:24,141
Why is it so hard for us to get together?

256
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,861
Don't space out.

257
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,021
You all are going to be like that again.

258
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:36,367
Am I right?

259
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:42,221
How's Selina?

260
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,581
"Selina"?

261
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:48,221
Aiden, she's... How do I say it?

262
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:49,901
She's proud.

263
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:54,901
She's so cold,
but needs someone to warn her up.

264
00:20:58,821 --> 00:20:59,901
There she is, Selina.

265
00:21:09,461 --> 00:21:10,981
I've been trying to find proof.

266
00:21:13,461 --> 00:21:14,541
You guys just relax.

267
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,141
Ardhan won't be expelled.

268
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:21,697
But can we get Richie expelled instead?

269
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,381
He's pissing me off.

270
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:33,901
Five, six, seven, eight.

271
00:21:33,981 --> 00:21:38,181
One and two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

272
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:42,134
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

273
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,141
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

274
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:50,021
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

275
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:06,101
We're done for today.

276
00:22:06,764 --> 00:22:08,487
Cleo and Karissa weren't energetic enough.

277
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,057
But we can practice more later.

278
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:16,987
Guys, Karissa, Cleo.

279
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,461
Ares and I've been trying to find proof

280
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:23,907
to stop Ardhan and Richie
from being expelled.

281
00:22:24,781 --> 00:22:26,061
Thanks, Zea.

282
00:23:00,701 --> 00:23:01,741
Zea?

283
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:08,828
Zea?

284
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:18,131
Did she leave me? Zea!

285
00:23:18,694 --> 00:23:21,094
Well, if we have the address,

286
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,981
what if we go there right away, Ares?

287
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:25,541
Zea has the address.
I'm going to ask her for it.

288
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,621
Here's Zea.

289
00:23:28,101 --> 00:23:29,701
- What?
- We have another witness

290
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:32,701
who has a video of the attack.

291
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,080
We're going to go there first,
then we go to Labos.

292
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,541
- Okay.
- Ares, I can go there by myself.

293
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,981
Megan and Moreo need you
if anything happens.

294
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,821
I'm just going to meet the witness
and ask for the video.

295
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:50,101
Ares, I'll be fine.

296
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:52,501
Please, trust me.

297
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:55,467
Okay.

298
00:23:55,741 --> 00:23:57,057
But after that,

299
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:58,993
we're meeting at the base.

300
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:03,521
- Are you going to be okay?
- I'll be fine.

301
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:05,221
Or do you want me to accompany you?

302
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:07,701
Don't be cocky.

303
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,581
I prefer to be with Zea than you
if we're going to have a fight.

304
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:13,861
She's a Capo Wolves. What are you?

305
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:17,261
I'm good at fighting too, you know.
Have you ever seen me fight?

306
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:20,981
Okay then. I'm going to leave, okay?

307
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,461
- Bye.
- Take care.

308
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:23,901
You, too.

309
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:46,101
(Ardhan: Babe, let me
drop you home, okay?)

310
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:18,321
This is it.

311
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:21,061
This is the place.

312
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:41,581
May I help you?

313
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,901
- Yes.
- I'm looking for a guy named Radit.

314
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:46,447
"Radit"?

315
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:48,541
Is he working here?

316
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:50,341
I...

317
00:25:58,101 --> 00:25:59,221
Which Radit?

318
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,594
Here's the photo.

319
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,034
This one.

320
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:06,941
We have no one named Radit here.

321
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:14,354
Ares!

322
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:19,221
- Hey!
- Move!

323
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:20,943
(Do not attempt to do this act)

324
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:22,541
Where are you going?

325
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:41,889
(Do not attempt to do this act)

326
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:43,701
Spin!

327
00:26:43,945 --> 00:27:12,997
(Do not attempt to do this act)

328
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,421
- Go after him!
- That's right!

329
00:27:18,341 --> 00:27:19,461
Ares.

330
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:22,301
He got away through the side door.

331
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,244
(Wolves)

332
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,621
Megan, Moreo.

333
00:28:03,913 --> 00:28:04,953
What?

334
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:40,461
I don't want to act right away.

335
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:44,061
For now,

336
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:47,141
we focus on restoring Ardhan's name.

337
00:28:48,981 --> 00:28:50,061
And also Richie’s.

338
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:52,981
"Richie"?

339
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:54,501
Remember, Moreo.

340
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,360
Defend each member.

341
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:05,861
Zea has gathered enough evidence
to bring to school.

342
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,540
When everything's settled

343
00:29:10,028 --> 00:29:11,828
and our two members is safe,

344
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,160
we're going to go back on track.

345
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:16,894
I agree.

346
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,294
How about you?

347
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,621
Agree.

348
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,187
(Bike Gang Members
Defending Street Vendors)

349
00:30:08,004 --> 00:30:11,301
(Now this is the real video)

350
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:15,061
(It turns out,
they were defending the vendors)

351
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:21,577
"Thank you for defending us
from those extorters"

352
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:31,541
Yes!

353
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:35,501
"Thank you!"

354
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:42,821
"Sorry for this".

355
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,724
(Now this is bike gangs
supposed to be, cool)

356
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:47,171
(People tries to smear bike gang's image,
but they aren't all bad)

357
00:30:56,661 --> 00:31:01,421
"Thank you for defending us
from those extorters".

358
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:06,204
- "That's right".
- "Thank you so much".

359
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:45,781
Okay.

360
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:50,061
That was what really happened.

361
00:31:50,901 --> 00:31:52,301
The school's reputation is still clean.

362
00:31:52,987 --> 00:31:56,107
Because Ardhan and Richie
weren't wearing any school attributes.

363
00:31:57,021 --> 00:32:00,141
Derlangga's reputation is even better
because of this.

364
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:03,061
Because its students were doing
good deeds outside of school.

365
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:19,861
Thank you, Ares.

366
00:32:20,861 --> 00:32:22,401
Zea was the one who searched the proof.

367
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:24,821
Thanks, Zea.

368
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:26,621
Watch your hand.

369
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:30,304
Chill, bro. I just want to thank her.

370
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:31,907
I was joking.

371
00:32:32,507 --> 00:32:33,627
Thanks.

372
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:37,821
Although I was planning
to enjoy my holiday, but still, thanks.

373
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:42,141
Thanks, Zea.

374
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:47,861
It's my duty.

375
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:51,301
You're still a Calderioz.

376
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,007
Baby!

377
00:32:59,261 --> 00:33:00,461
I'm out of suspension.

378
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:12,861
What's wrong with you, Babe?

379
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:16,101
I want to break up.

380
00:33:21,136 --> 00:33:27,007
