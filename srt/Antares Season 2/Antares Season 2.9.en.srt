1
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,800
And with a heavy heart,

2
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:35,833
the school has to suspend you
for the incident.

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,176
You're not only endangering yourself,

4
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:42,579
you're also endangering others.

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,920
And it's Zea!

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,280
Ares won't be able to
take care of Calderioz for now.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,080
He asked me to take over the leadership.

8
00:00:52,876 --> 00:00:53,933
It's you, right?

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,040
You set this whole thing up, didn't you?

10
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,581
Now you're accusing me?

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,600
What the hell?

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,600
Red motorbike, Calderioz's jacket.

13
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,320
Are you still going to accuse me?

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,360
You haven't found it yet?

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,600
Weren't you the one who did it?

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
Look at me.

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,160
Look at me.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,096
You are the captain now.

19
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,680
Ardhan won't be working by himself.

20
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,320
He'll get help from
his commander-in-chief.

21
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,600
"Commander-in-chief"?

22
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,720
Here's the thing.

23
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,680
While you were suspended,

24
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,920
I appointed Richie as
our commander-in-chief.

25
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,800
What do you mean?

26
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
Why didn't you tell me?

27
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:48,040
You weren't at the base.

28
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,019
I went to our base,
but you two weren't here.

29
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,093
You told me to come, but you weren't here.

30
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:54,600
Who knows what you two were doing.

31
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,720
Whatever you were investigating,
I don't even know.

32
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,320
What are you talking about?
Don't exaggerate...

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Who gave you permission to do that?

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
Ares.

35
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,560
You entrusted Calderioz to me.

36
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:09,459
So I did...

37
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
Ares!

38
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
Listen to him, bro.

39
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,000
Do you want to be suspended again?

40
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,560
Nobody asked you to speak.

41
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:24,130
Ardhan and I did all your duties

42
00:04:24,238 --> 00:04:25,680
while you were suspended.

43
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
And this is how you thank us?

44
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,960
I know

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,120
you must be upset right now.

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,520
It feels like

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,680
the problems keep on coming.

48
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,200
But you stay mad for too long.

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,480
You need to take care of this situation.

50
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,680
We need to take care of this situation.

51
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,480
You're not alone.

52
00:05:29,607 --> 00:05:30,627
Hold on.

53
00:05:30,973 --> 00:05:32,013
Let me see.

54
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,239
What?

55
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,360
- Come here.
- No.

56
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
- Zea.
- You haven't even seen it.

57
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,680
From a scarf...

58
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,193
No!

59
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:51,153
Done.

60
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,459
Let me see. One, two, three.

61
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,640
Stop it.

62
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,080
I haven't even taken a photo.

63
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,560
You're no fun.

64
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,920
How come you're not playing?

65
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,200
I can't stop thinking about Calderioz.

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,080
Me too.

67
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
I'm scared Calderioz
will go on a break.

68
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,320
That's still better.

69
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,200
But what if it splits into two groups?

70
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:41,293
Selina?

71
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
Why are you alone?

72
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:44,636
Whom should I be with?

73
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,743
Nobody. I'm alone too.

74
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,733
Where's Megan going?

75
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,400
He's going to polish gemstones.

76
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,253
- Can't you act normally?
- Don't get upset.

77
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:08,499
There was...

78
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,479
Can't you act normally?

79
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,440
I got closer to talk about
a serious matter.

80
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,920
What?

81
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:18,153
Selina.

82
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:22,993
The bell's ringing. I'm leaving.

83
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,160
Where are you?

84
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,040
Ares told me he's in the class already.

85
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,960
We're in a group with him, aren't we?

86
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,233
Okay. See you in class.

87
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,200
Hurry up, bye.

88
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,160
Is Ares lying to you?

89
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,920
How come you donít know anything?

90
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,456
Maybe he doesn't think it's important.

91
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:53,800
So he didn't tell you.

92
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,240
We can't be sure Anya's not lying.

93
00:07:57,873 --> 00:07:58,913
There's no doubt.

94
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,720
You don't know who Ares really is.

95
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,760
You're not falling in love with Ares,

96
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,600
you just like the feeling
of being in love.

97
00:08:07,646 --> 00:08:10,646
Don't listen to her.
She only wants to provoke you.

98
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:12,933
Don't be influenced, Zea.

99
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,139
Babe.

100
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,120
You need to be careful.

101
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,560
I don't want anything to happen to you.

102
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,680
It's impossible.

103
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,560
If something happens to me,
who would you be with?

104
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,960
I'll find someone else.

105
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,800
The second Ardhan.

106
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,000
You're sulking. How cute!

107
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,941
I'm only kidding.
There's no one else.

108
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,480
You're the only one.

109
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
- Okay, go to class.
- Alright then.

110
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:56,533
Babe!

111
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,979
- I don't want to part.
- I have class.

112
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,520
I don't want to part.

113
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,652
Miss Anin!

114
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,560
She's looking this way! Miss Anin!

115
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,520
Babe!

116
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:15,686
You both are too much,
you're making such a fuss about parting.

117
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,280
You don't understand
what it feels like to fall in love.

118
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,880
I want to tell you about Aiden.

119
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,240
Aiden was a Calderioz member.

120
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,193
He was the only one
who made me believe that

121
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:41,040
bike gang members aren't bad people.

122
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,040
After he was gone,

123
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,360
I don't know how Calderioz
is doing anymore.

124
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
But I don't know why,

125
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,760
seeing Calderioz's disunity,

126
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,920
reminds me of Aiden.

127
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,320
Because he...

128
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,680
He would do anything
to prevent the disunity.

129
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
- He sounded like a very good guy.
- For sure.

130
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,680
No one is as good as him.

131
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,800
I think,

132
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,200
I was always bad towards him.

133
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:38,979
Serra.

134
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,200
A good person always meets a good person.

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,720
So, if Aiden was a good person,

136
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:51,287
I'm completely certain

137
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,680
that you're not a bad person.

138
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,520
You made this?

139
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,600
Everything started here.

140
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,120
Retro and Delasga's attack.

141
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,160
And Laskar's attack.

142
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,640
It means they're targeting the bike gangs.

143
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,219
From here

144
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:47,699
(Carissa's home)

145
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:49,626
to here.

146
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:52,099
(Retro's on a break!)

147
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,780
And terror at the gala.

148
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,760
Both have the same objectives
as Retro and Delasga's attack.

149
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:01,293
Stop

150
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:02,986
or die.

151
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,653
Now, here's something
I didn't expect at all.

152
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:09,862
(Delasga on a Break)

153
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,193
It was too sudden.

154
00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:14,699
And this, too.

155
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,360
(Terror at Calderioz's base)

156
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,920
During your suspension,

157
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
I wanted to find out
who's the one behind all this.

158
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,200
We haven't found out
why Delasga is on a break.

159
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,840
We can still find out

160
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:41,247
from one member of Wolves
who got stabbed.

161
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,842
I think we have a lot of opportunities

162
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:47,720
to find and catch the perpetrator.

163
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,920
But as you said,

164
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:52,972
we need to be careful.

165
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,280
Ares.

166
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,120
You can't solve all of this by yourself.

167
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,640
You need to learn to accept people's help.

168
00:13:08,716 --> 00:13:10,720
Everything would be easier that way.

169
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:13,973
Okay?

170
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,856
We don't need to wait

171
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,646
for another attack to find it out.

172
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,720
There's no doubt

173
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,800
that the targets are the bike gangs.

174
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,379
We've been focusing on the wrong thing.

175
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,680
We're too focused

176
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,800
on the "Stop or Die" threat

177
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,920
and the bike gang's image.

178
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,240
Meanwhile, the perpetrator
is still out there.

179
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,080
And we still don't know who that is.

180
00:13:46,733 --> 00:13:48,040
And the person

181
00:13:49,386 --> 00:13:51,480
succeeded in getting Retro
and Delasga to go on a break.

182
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:57,670
Jayden.

183
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:00,841
If you want to go back to the cafe first,
I can wait here myself.

184
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,499
It's okay.

185
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:03,966
Relax.

186
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,680
That's the car.

187
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,906
Serra.

188
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:34,813
Yes?

189
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,080
Are you free tomorrow evening?

190
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,960
I don't know yet. What's up?

191
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,160
I

192
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,520
want to take you out.

193
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,480
Only if you want to.

194
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,520
But it's okay if you don't want to.

195
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,880
I'll let you know, okay?

196
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

197
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,800
Take care.

198
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,480
Thank you, bye.

199
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:03,480
I'll be waiting for your response.

200
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,600
Don't just say yes
because you feel bad for me.

201
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,440
Take your time.

202
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,200
Okay?

203
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,880
I know you're thinking about Calderioz.

204
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,600
Am I right?

205
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,440
There's no way that a leader like you

206
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,480
will not be thinking about your members.

207
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:44,513
Dad?

208
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,320
If an organization splits up,

209
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,600
is it the leader's fault?

210
00:15:54,112 --> 00:15:55,246
It depends.

211
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,760
But for the most part, yes.

212
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,520
It means the leader failed to unite

213
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,760
the vision and mission of its members.

214
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,040
This isn't including the factor
if certain member turns into defectors.

215
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,960
So, how do I handle it?

216
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,720
When you're a leader,

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,533
and you feel like

218
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,807
that's your chance to be more vocal,

219
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,480
for you to be more forthright,

220
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,080
then you're wrong.

221
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,740
A leader needs

222
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:40,766
to listen to his members.

223
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:44,426
Only then,

224
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,546
you'll know what they want.

225
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,643
And you'll find

226
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:57,201
a lot of surprises
that you had never imagined.

227
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,200
Where's everyone?

228
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,920
(Street Food Vendors Harassed
by Street Thugs on Motorbikes)

229
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,101
Street thugs are joining the madness.

230
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,440
I found a clue.

231
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,320
This bastard is riding a red motorbike.

232
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,040
Well, that's not much.

233
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,240
But we do need to do something massive.

234
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,023
What do you mean?

235
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,620
Hear me out.

236
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,280
I'll ask our members one by one
and maybe other gangs too,

237
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,800
on who has red motorbikes.
You have the video, right?

238
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,120
What if the perpetrator
isn't from the bike gangs?

239
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,560
We just need to find out the location.

240
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,640
- I'm going to ask Ares first.
- Why would you do that?

241
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,440
He would only ask us to calm down
and not to be reckless.

242
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,760
Ares is still Calderioz's leader.

243
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:45,945
From what I remembered,

244
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,217
he's riding a red motorbike

245
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:50,360
with a gold-colored exhaust.

246
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:54,712
And I'm sure
he's not a bike gang member.

247
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,600
Whoever that is, we have a new enemy now.

248
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
One who wants
to ruin the bike gang's image.

249
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,360
And he has succeeded.

250
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,320
Delasga and Retro should be
the only ones on a break.

251
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,563
I hope Wolves won't follow their lead.

252
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,000
We need to team up
to find the perpetrator.

253
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,680
I'll tell Eros.

254
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,720
He'll agree with you.

255
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:24,746
I'll call him too.

256
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,320
What's on your mind?

257
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,480
I think I'm wrong.

258
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,040
Wrong about what?

259
00:19:54,597 --> 00:19:55,597
Your mom

260
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,640
asked me to talk to you

261
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,360
to leave Calderioz
and focus on your studies.

262
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,640
But I'm helping you in handling
Calderioz's problems instead.

263
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,660
You're not wrong.

264
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,480
Moreover, there's nothing that
can make me leave Calderioz.

265
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,720
Just like there's nothing
that can make me leave you.

266
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,266
Okay?

267
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,400
Stop thinking about my mom.

268
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,360
Let me handle her.

269
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:36,686
Eat up.

270
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,480
You have to pay.

271
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,920
She looks like a rich girl.

272
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:19,719
You have great taste.

273
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,800
Don't harass my customer.

274
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,960
I've given you the security money.

275
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,200
It's not enough.

276
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,880
If I kidnap your guest,

277
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,800
I will get more money.

278
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,240
- Let's go.
- Okay.

279
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,880
Hi, sweetie.

280
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
My mom will love you.

281
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:16,600
Mom? Are we going to see your mom?

282
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,760
Don't be surprised.

283
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,840
It's not a big deal.

284
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,400
But what I mean is

285
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,200
are you for real?

286
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:29,687
I am.

287
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,840
My God!

288
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,120
It's okay.

289
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:50,633
You're beautiful.

290
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,120
My mom will love you.

291
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:01,610
(Amara Lunetha)

292
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:07,093
See?

293
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,320
What did I tell you?

294
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,960
My mom will love you.

295
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,320
I come here often.

296
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,640
Almost every day.

297
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,120
Asking how she is over there.

298
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,800
Do you want to say hi?

299
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,920
Hello, Auntie.

300
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,360
Come here.

301
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,040
Auntie.

302
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,880
I'm Serra.

303
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,840
Mom.

304
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,000
This is Serra.

305
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,320
She's my friend.

306
00:24:09,332 --> 00:24:10,472
She's

307
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,400
beautiful.

308
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,600
And she's undoubtedly nice.

309
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,640
I'm comfortable being with her.

310
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,480
So hot!

311
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,960
Drink it slowly.

312
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,840
How come youíre here alone
and not with Ares?

313
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,400
He must be with his girlfriend right now.

314
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,120
Meanwhile, I'm single.

315
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,040
Yes, I know you're single.

316
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,080
- One black coffee, please.
- Yes, Sir.

317
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:09,853
You're on night duty?

318
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,680
I am. We're going to do a raid.

319
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,320
You know, the bike gangs
have been rampant lately.

320
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:16,559
They're mischievous.

321
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,000
Our work has doubled because of them.

322
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,800
Have they been captured now?

323
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,560
We've captured some.
But some dispersed from there.

324
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,160
We've captured five people yesterday.

325
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
They claimed they're not
bike gang members.

326
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,200
But they've been extorting
high school students.

327
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,760
- Are you a high school student?
- Me? I am.

328
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,160
But I've never been extorted
by those bike gangs.

329
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,120
The bike gang at my school
are nice people.

330
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,760
So, there's a bike gang in your school?

331
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,080
No, none!

332
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,160
I mean, in our neighborhood.

333
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,720
Right, how much for this coffee?

334
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,541
- As usual, 12 thousand rupiah.
- Alright.

335
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
- Here it is, Sir.
- Sometimes I forget.

336
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,960
- Here. Keep the change.
- Okay.

337
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,080
Okay.

338
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,200
- Bye!
- Bye!

339
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,600
- I'll head back.
- Okay, thanks.

340
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:37,013
Where is he?

341
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:39,473
That's the motorbike.

342
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,840
I asked the vendors here.

343
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,480
They said it's the street thug's motorbike
who usually extorts them.

344
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,540
But he's nowhere to be seen

345
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,440
since a few hours ago.

346
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,120
I have no doubt

347
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,360
that's the same motorbike
we saw on the gala's CCTV.

348
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,800
- I'm going to tell Ares.
- It'll take too long.

349
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:10,647
So, what are you going to do?
Damage that motorbike now?

350
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,120
It's impossible.

351
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,200
That's not how we do things.
