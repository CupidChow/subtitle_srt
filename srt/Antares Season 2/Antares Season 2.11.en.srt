1
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,190
We've been focusing on the wrong thing.

2
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,360
We were too focused
on the "Stop or Die" threat.

3
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,360
Meanwhile, the perpetrator
is still out there.

4
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:37,989
And that person has caused

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,240
Retro and Delasga to go on a break.

6
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:45,869
It's definitely him! What do you want?

7
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,040
Ardhan, enough.

8
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,357
I'm scared Calderioz
will go on a break.

9
00:00:48,457 --> 00:00:49,500
That's still a bit better.

10
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:53,292
But what if it breaks into two groups?

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,190
- Ares isn't even here! What should we do?
- Can you calm down?

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,607
I found a clue.

13
00:00:57,707 --> 00:00:59,640
The bastard is riding a red motorbike.

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,693
We have a new enemy now

15
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:08,760
who wants to ruin
our gang's good name.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,240
Bastard!

17
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,360
Get him!

18
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:40,650
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

19
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,240
Ares.

20
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,040
I thought you forgot
because you were busy dating.

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,440
I was chasing
the person we've been looking for.

22
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,860
Who?

23
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:11,606
What happened?

24
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
He got away.

25
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,360
Ares.

26
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,080
Why didn't you tell us?

27
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,460
Sorry.

28
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,650
I got the info
when Zea and I were on our way here.

29
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:28,846
I went straight there
since I didn't want to lose him.

30
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,560
Hey, give that to me.

31
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,000
We got another clue.

32
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,560
Let me see.

33
00:04:58,713 --> 00:04:59,793
Radit?

34
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,560
But what is this?

35
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
What company is this?

36
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,600
And he hasn’t put
his full name on the ID card.

37
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,440
Where's Ardhan?

38
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:34,427
Come here you!

39
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:37,208
(Labos Helmet)

40
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,659
The number you're calling
cannot accept your call.

41
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,630
Oh, God!

42
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,320
Zea!

43
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,320
You're awake!

44
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,960
I was just about to wake you up.

45
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,640
- I'm in a good mood today.
- Great then.

46
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,396
Come on out.
I've made breakfast for you..

47
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:08,543
Okay, in a minute.

48
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,149
I'll get ready first and head downstairs.

49
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,000
- Okay.
- Thank you.

50
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,320
No problem.

51
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,920
- Hey.
- Zea.

52
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Why are there two?
Who's the other one for?

53
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,720
For Ares, of course.

54
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,920
I don't think he's picking me up today.
He hasn't even replied to my text.

55
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,040
Oh, dear! Why is he like that?

56
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,040
What about the chicken noodles?

57
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,480
- You can have it. Let's eat together.
- For me?

58
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
- Here?
- Of course!

59
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,640
Thank you!

60
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,120
Come on, let's eat.

61
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,640
- Enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

62
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,560
What a great breakfast!

63
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:02,513
Good morning.

64
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
- Hi.
- Hey. You're having breakfast?

65
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,200
I am.

66
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,240
What's wrong?

67
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,720
Babe, I'm coming!

68
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,920
You're too noisy! Be patient!

69
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,160
I can't be patient
if I haven't seen you, Babe.

70
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:25,726
- You...
- Here.

71
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,760
Wear it yourself. Come on. What?

72
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,680
Have you been fighting?

73
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,427
Last night, Richie and I

74
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,447
attacked the gang
that has been terrorizing Calderioz.

75
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:41,593
And then?

76
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,760
We won, of course.

77
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:49,246
- Hurry up!
- But your face got beaten up like this.

78
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm fine, really.

79
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

80
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,160
It hurts!

81
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,080
- You said you're fine.
- But you didn't have to hit me, Babe.

82
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,440
You can go to school yourself.

83
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,960
Get on the bike, hurry.

84
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,760
Morning, dude.

85
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,920
Morning, Karissa.

86
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,280
Oh, my God!

87
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
Why aren't you bruised as bad as me?

88
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,000
Because you don't fight
as well as me, man.

89
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
You're nuts.

90
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,600
- Calderioz!
- That's right, Calderioz!

91
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,296
I can't wait to tell them
back at the base.

92
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,120
Hey, Babe.

93
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,640
Come on.

94
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,680
Let's go, Babe.

95
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,480
Where were you last night?

96
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:29,760
Something exciting happened,
yet you were missing.

97
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,880
I don't know what you're planning.

98
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,000
But if you're going to destroy Calderioz,

99
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,520
- I won't hesitate...
- Chill, man.

100
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
I'm clean.

101
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,160
You said the same thing two years ago.

102
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm not lying, Ares.

103
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,080
What's wrong, Karissa?

104
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,440
Is it about Selina?

105
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,720
No.

106
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,640
About Ardhan?

107
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:25,273
Zea.

108
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,760
I...

109
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,400
I don't like Richie.

110
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,100
Why?

111
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,600
Do you know Ardhan and Richie
attacked someone last night?

112
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
I know.

113
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Was Ares with them?

114
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,200
Ares and I had something else to do

115
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:55,280
when Ardhan did the attack.

116
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm worried, Zea.

117
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,960
If Ardhan keeps on doing this,

118
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,887
I can't.

119
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:15,080
I'm scared.

120
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,080
You must've felt
what I'm feeling at some point.

121
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:25,986
Although you're brave.

122
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
Worried, you mean?

123
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,600
Definitely.

124
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,200
But I trust Ares.

125
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,320
Do you trust Ardhan?

126
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,800
Very much.

127
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,680
But Richie...

128
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,320
It was crazy!

129
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,560
- Oh, man!
- It was nuts!

130
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,520
- What did you do at the end?
- I was, you know...

131
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,640
How did they manage to sneak up on you?

132
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,960
Just once, it's nothing.

133
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Just once, bro.

134
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
I told you I got your back, man.

135
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:22,240
- We're a team!
- Why didn't you wait for me to attack?

136
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,833
Not that we didn't want to.

137
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,840
We had waited for you,
but you didn't come.

138
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,080
Ask Moreo.

139
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,640
Maybe you were on a date.

140
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,240
Ares, why are you mad?

141
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,080
You should actually appreciate us.

142
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,970
Richie and I got those thugs
down on their knees.

143
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:51,699
The street vendors were even thanking us.
Am I right?

144
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,960
Do you know

145
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,960
that you attacked the wrong target?

146
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,093
"Wrong target"?

147
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:59,360
The motorbike was clearly red.

148
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,176
And Serra said the guy
extorted Jayden at his cafe.

149
00:14:02,277 --> 00:14:03,819
Everything's clear.

150
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,240
You attacked the wrong people.

151
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,320
Zea and I attacked the real perpetrator.

152
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,880
His name is Radit.

153
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,920
And he works alone.

154
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,040
Not a motorbike gang.

155
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,680
"Radit"?

156
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,120
What is this? I don't get it.

157
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,320
That's why you shouldn't
take a decision by yourself.

158
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
We've investigated it, Ares.

159
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,000
From the CCTV?

160
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,120
What's the point?

161
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,320
We've eliminated the thugs.
Come on. Give a little appreciation!

162
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,680
Was I not clear?

163
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,880
You attacked the wrong people.

164
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,000
Did the one you attacked
used this motorbike?

165
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,423
Guys, stop!

166
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:04,837
It's early morning,
you're making so much noise.

167
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,041
It's irritating.

168
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,800
Sorry, girl.

169
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,080
What happened?

170
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,880
It's alright.

171
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,200
Is that really Ardhan in the video?

172
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:35,407
Ardhan said he was in a fight yesterday.

173
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,440
And the other person, is that Richie?

174
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,160
What should I do, guys?

175
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:46,901
Karissa, calm down. Don't panic, okay?

176
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,120
I can't believe
Ardhan did something like that.

177
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
No. No way.

178
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:57,779
There's no way he attacked
innocent people. You know that.

179
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,520
But you saw it yourself.

180
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,920
Yes, I saw it.

181
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,360
Ares hasn't given you any info, Zea?

182
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,720
He hasn't.

183
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,360
- Let's find out.
- Okay.

184
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,560
- Come on.
- Come on.

185
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
Something's not right.

186
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,360
I wouldn't attack innocent vendors.

187
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,960
The video has been manipulated.

188
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,880
This is to pit us against each other.

189
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
You know your team better than anyone.

190
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,960
That’s how it should be.

191
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,320
He really wants
to smear the image of bike gangs.

192
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,360
That's his goal, isn't it?

193
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,880
That's why I told you to hold yourself.

194
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,366
Don't be reckless!

195
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,080
My ears.

196
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
We were heroes, Ares.

197
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,800
Just ask the witnesses there.

198
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,960
Yeah.

199
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:07,421
It's easy to know the facts.

200
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,720
But Calderioz's image...

201
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,876
You can't easily clean our image
because of this video.

202
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,800
Can you do it?

203
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,946
Ares, Ardhan, Richie.

204
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,800
Breathe. Calm down.

205
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,040
You three have been called
by Miss Anis and Mr. Darwis.

206
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,960
Do you realize it's not a trivial case?

207
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,880
You're involved in violent acts
again and again.

208
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
It smears our school's image.

209
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,287
People out there will think

210
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,920
that Derlangga High School

211
00:18:57,993 --> 00:19:02,073
teaches its students
to be bike gang members.

212
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
The evidence are here.

213
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,606
How will you deny this?

214
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,840
We are being framed, Sir.

215
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,360
Am I right, guys?

216
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,840
Don't laugh.

217
00:19:19,963 --> 00:19:20,963
Sir.

218
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,680
The video has been edited.

219
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,119
It's as if we did it.
In reality, it wasn't us.

220
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,000
Someone must have wanted
to tarnish the name of bike gangs.

221
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:32,947
Bike gangs' image is already bad.

222
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,960
Why would anyone need to make it worse?

223
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,960
With heavy hearts,

224
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,160
we're going to suspend you.

225
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,760
You're not going to be able
to take tryouts and the national exam.

226
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,840
If you're proven to be guilty,

227
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,296
the school can also expel you

228
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,680
with a letter of poor behavior.

229
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,560
That means you won't be able
to join any other school.

230
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,040
Sir, Miss.

231
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,480
We're not breaking any of our deal.

232
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,680
First of all, there hasn't been
other attacks at school.

233
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:18,212
Secondly, Calderioz's activities

234
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:21,000
never disrupt our study performances.

235
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,880
How could you suspend us?

236
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,160
We can suspend you

237
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,503
if you behave poorly and are dangerous.

238
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,640
Ares.

239
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,800
You set this up, didn't you?

240
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
Sir, Ares had nothing to do
with this incident.

241
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,200
How could he not?

242
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,080
He's the leader.

243
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,780
He must've known

244
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,569
where his gang will attack.

245
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,801
That's for sure.

246
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,320
I hate to admit it,

247
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
but he didn't, Sir.

248
00:21:01,746 --> 00:21:02,786
Sir.

249
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,200
It was only me and Richie.

250
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,840
Ares had nothing to do with it.

251
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,200
I can assure you that.

252
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,960
Are you certain?

253
00:21:16,273 --> 00:21:17,633
- We're certain.
- We're certain.

254
00:21:21,593 --> 00:21:22,633
Okay.

255
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,400
Then you may leave, Ares.

256
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:33,553
You two stay here.

257
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,880
Hey! Why are you so mopey?

258
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,880
He's right. Richie got suspended,
but you guys are in a bad mood.

259
00:21:57,981 --> 00:21:59,181
Cheer up!

260
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,527
Wait, this is the incident
that went viral, right?

261
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:04,459
- Where Ardhan and Richie attacked people?
- That's right.

262
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,640
But they attacked thugs.

263
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,000
The vendors should be thankful to them.

264
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,560
That's the thing.

265
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,920
We should wait
and see why they got called.

266
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,680
Selina?

267
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:24,287
Your won't finish your food
if you keep stirring it.

268
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,720
Oh, dear.

269
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,800
You want it?

270
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,740
Buy it yourself!

271
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,640
Be strong, Karissa.

272
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's hope it's nothing.

273
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,920
I can't take it, you know.

274
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,446
Dating a motorbike gang member
doesn't feel good.

275
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,040
It feels like riding a roller coaster.

276
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,440
I'm worried all the time.

277
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,720
Riding a roller coaster is fun.

278
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,520
It isn't!

279
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,720
I've never been on a roller coaster.

280
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,360
Selina, want to ride
a roller coaster with me?

281
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,200
- Okay, thanks.
- Moreo!

282
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,640
The guys are in trouble.

283
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,666
Can you be a bit more serious?

284
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,280
What happened?
Why did they ask for you too?

285
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,480
It's okay. I'm good.

286
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,400
Thank God. What about the others?

287
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,840
Ardhan and Richie...

288
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,480
There's a big chance
they're going to be expelled

289
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,880
if there's proof they started the fight.

290
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
They did start it.

291
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:18,673
They did.

292
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,880
I can't just stand and do nothing.

293
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Sorry.

294
00:24:30,892 --> 00:24:34,432
I didn't mean to overhear
your conversation,

295
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,440
but this has been the talk of the school.

296
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,920
That's why I feel like
I have to say this to you.

297
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,680
Ares.

298
00:24:47,506 --> 00:24:49,306
You're a Calderioz member.

299
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,600
Ardhan and Richie are your members.

300
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,800
So, I think you have to do something.

301
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,360
I'm sure Richie and Ardhan
wouldn't do such a horrible thing.

302
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,680
I've known them for so long.

303
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,040
As long as I've known you.

304
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:10,160
So,

305
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:13,933
you can prove they're not wrong, Ares.

306
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,960
So do it, okay?

307
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,460
Yes. Thanks, Anya.

308
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:20,527
You're welcome.

309
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,560
Anyway,

310
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,256
you skipped break time.

311
00:25:28,677 --> 00:25:29,677
So,

312
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,480
I put your favorite drink on your table.

313
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,520
Avocado juice

314
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,220
with lots of chocolate condensed milk,
and no sugar. Right?

315
00:25:39,193 --> 00:25:40,233
Drink it.

316
00:25:48,253 --> 00:25:49,453
You see?

317
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,320
- That was successful.
- Of course!

318
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,280
Your approach to Ares was great.

319
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,800
I know, right?

320
00:26:00,553 --> 00:26:01,633
Anya.

321
00:26:07,753 --> 00:26:08,793
What?

322
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,960
I'm amazed by you.

323
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,640
You can’t just stop chasing Ares.

324
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
Don't you want to be with me instead?

325
00:26:25,573 --> 00:26:26,853
Seriously?

326
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,560
What do you have to offer?

327
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,800
Are you sure you don't want to be with me?

328
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
You know what?

329
00:26:42,293 --> 00:26:44,256
I am considering.

330
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,760
Babe, how was it?

331
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,920
How was it, Ardhan?

332
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
I'm suspended.

333
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,760
And I'm in danger of being expelled.

334
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,640
That bad?

335
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,560
It is.

336
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,120
For how long?

337
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,880
- I don't know.
- Why?

338
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,603
Because we have to prove

339
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:29,322
that we really attacked thugs.

340
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
And before we find any proof,

341
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,960
we're suspended.

342
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,480
Is he suspended, too?

343
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:41,193
Who?

344
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,160
Of course. We're suspended together.

345
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,640
Ares is the only one not suspended.

346
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,120
Because he's not involved.

347
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,520
This is the right time for the school
to expel them.

348
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,000
How many times have Antares
and his friends caused trouble?

349
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:04,633
I know.

350
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,440
But we also need to be careful.

351
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,200
We can't let our decision
harm other students

352
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:15,246
and smear our school's reputation.

353
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,920
The national exam is coming up.

354
00:28:19,107 --> 00:28:21,180
But if we don't expel them,

355
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:23,548
Derlangga's reputation will be smeared.

356
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,840
But we can't prove anything for now.

357
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,040
We don’t know yet if they really are
our students in that video.

358
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:39,846
You know there are lots of
edited videos on social media.

359
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,120
And they turn out to be a hoax.

360
00:28:43,566 --> 00:28:44,606
How about this?

361
00:28:45,216 --> 00:28:46,440
Let's make sure if it's real.

362
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:49,406
When it has been proven,

363
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,280
we'll take appropriate measures.

364
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:52,919
Okay?

365
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,920
- Here's your food.
- Thanks.

366
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,080
You're welcome.

367
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,160
Hello, Miss Serra. Good afternoon.

368
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,400
Jayden?

369
00:29:18,726 --> 00:29:21,406
Have you seen the viral video?

370
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,040
What video?

371
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,760
That video where the bike gang members
attacked street vendors.

372
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,120
Oh, that one.

373
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,280
Yes, I've seen it.

374
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:32,753
Why?

375
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,800
You know them?

376
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,960
They are Ardhan and Richie.

377
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,313
They have been suspended
because of that video.

378
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,680
And they're in danger of being expelled.

379
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,600
But I'm sure,

380
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:53,786
the video was made
to desecrate the bike gangs reputation.

381
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,920
It doesn't make sense.

382
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,640
But what for?

383
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,880
Isn't there a lot of bad news
about motorbike gangs recently?

384
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,640
Poor them.

385
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,080
But they better study for now.

386
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,880
They're in 12th grade, right?

387
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,600
The situation's not good.

388
00:30:18,638 --> 00:30:20,638
People are sensitive
to bike gang members.

389
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,280
I know.

390
00:30:24,813 --> 00:30:27,333
But, Calderioz isn't that bad.

391
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:29,440
They aren't like other bike gangs.

392
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,360
They have a different vision.

393
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,960
Because sometimes,

394
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,080
we can't fight bad rumors.

395
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,880
We can only ignore it.

396
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,320
We let it be until the moment passes.

397
00:30:58,739 --> 00:30:59,739
Here.

398
00:31:01,853 --> 00:31:03,133
I can't stop thinking about it.

399
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:06,847
Ardhan is suspended.

400
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,360
He went viral with that video.

401
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,040
And then what?

402
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,280
Who else is going to be the victim?

403
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,600
Do you realize?

404
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:24,693
Calderioz's members have been attacked
one by one.

405
00:31:25,493 --> 00:31:27,413
You're the only one
who hasn't been attacked yet.

406
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,320
Don't think about it.

407
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,320
Nothing's going to happen to me.

408
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,960
I know. Nothing's going to happen now.

409
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,120
- Hey.
- But...

410
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,440
Relax. Okay?

411
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,080
I'm going to be fine.

412
00:31:52,796 --> 00:31:58,463
(Do not attempt to do this act)

413
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,320
What are you doing?

414
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
Do you want to fight?
