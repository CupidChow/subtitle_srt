1
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:31,771
That's just an assumption.

2
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,195
I'll make sure to find
the person behind this attack.

3
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:39,155
I'm telling you all to leave Calderioz.

4
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:42,335
We have to find out quickly
who attacked our school.

5
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,776
Why is your leader looks so relaxed?

6
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,530
His vision is clear.

7
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:49,981
He wants to unite all the bike gangs.

8
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:55,695
I don't want to put my men in danger.

9
00:00:55,796 --> 00:00:56,813
But my advice to you,

10
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,764
watch your back.

11
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:00,898
We still don't know who's friend or foe.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,260
Why do we have to inform it
to Ares or you?

13
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05,608
Can't we share it in front of everybody
who are present here?

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,045
You said you're a democrat,

15
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:09,785
but opinions could only
be express privately.

16
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:14,155
Hit me.

17
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:17,403
- Here he comes.
- What did he say to you?

18
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:20,590
I asked him what's his problem with you.

19
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:14,566
When our bike gang is in danger,

20
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,247
you still have time to date?

21
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:18,727
That's none of your business.

22
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,456
Go home, this is not your place.

23
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,987
Okay.

24
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,233
I'm just here to tell you,

25
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,750
someone vandalized the bus stop
not far from our base.

26
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,176
How are the boys?

27
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,547
I thought you told me to go home.

28
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:36,363
Just answer the question!

29
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,776
They're fine. Until now, at least.

30
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:43,841
But I'm sure something
will happen to them.

31
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:46,741
What do you mean?

32
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,687
Chill, Ares.

33
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:53,683
What do you want?

34
00:03:57,181 --> 00:03:59,083
I want to take over Calderioz.

35
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:01,476
Not that easy.

36
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:06,997
Well,

37
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:10,054
I guess that's something
worth fighting for?

38
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,410
- What's so funny?
- You are.

39
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:19,991
Of course I wouldn't dare

40
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:23,810
to take over the gang
from it's rightful leader, right?

41
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:25,783
That's impossible.

42
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,167
But if your leadership is problematic,

43
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,663
I'm not going to keep quiet.

44
00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:51,948
Excuse me.

45
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:06,668
Enjoy.

46
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:10,055
Iced cappuccino, iced red velvet,

47
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:12,542
and the cake.

48
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:14,376
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

49
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,436
Babe.

50
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,523
What are you looking at?

51
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:50,816
This.

52
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:57,323
Are you interested in being a model?

53
00:05:58,182 --> 00:05:59,330
What do you mean?

54
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,482
I mean, how should I say this?

55
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:06,001
It's not that I don't support you,

56
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:08,516
but why didn't you tell me?

57
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:13,156
I thought you're busy with Calderioz?

58
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:17,366
I am, but you can at least say,

59
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,921
"Babe, I want to be a model."

60
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,890
It would take you less
than a minute to say it.

61
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:25,167
I'm bored with my monotonous life.

62
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,652
It's just school, then dance practice.

63
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:36,835
Babe.

64
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,496
Here's an idea.

65
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:43,542
Make a bucket list.

66
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:46,016
Everything on that list
that you want to try,

67
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,582
I can help you make it happen.

68
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,375
I can promise you that!

69
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:50,908
Okay?

70
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:57,476
Don't make any promises
that you can't keep.

71
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:02,009
I know you're very busy with Calderioz.

72
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,483
(Ares)

73
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:19,662
It's from Ares.

74
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:21,610
Just a second.

75
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,570
Yes, Ares. What's up?

76
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:32,150
I'm with Karissa, what's wrong?

77
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:42,256
Okay, I'll be right there.

78
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,290
Okay.

79
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:53,616
Babe.

80
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:57,490
Let's go home.

81
00:07:58,332 --> 00:07:59,836
You are needed somewhere else, right?

82
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:06,210
You're the best, let's go.

83
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,502
Babe!

84
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,055
Come on!

85
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:32,463
(Bike gangs carries sharp weapons)

86
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,143
Can you stop that?

87
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:57,030
Are you deaf?

88
00:08:58,062 --> 00:08:59,963
Unlock the door!

89
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:18,670
Come in.

90
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:29,236
Zea, you've been in your room for hours.

91
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,876
Aren't you hungry?

92
00:09:31,057 --> 00:09:32,740
I've cooked for you.

93
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:34,065
Maybe later.

94
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,470
Don't be like that.

95
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:38,553
If you get sick,

96
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:40,502
I wouldn't be the only one who worries.

97
00:09:40,582 --> 00:09:43,160
Both Ares and Eros

98
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,622
would worry like crazy.

99
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:48,899
Fine.

100
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:50,862
Atta girl!

101
00:09:57,262 --> 00:10:00,270
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.

102
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,810
When I was in the market,

103
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,300
everyone was talking about bike gangs.

104
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,822
They said the bike gangs are now
getting out of control.

105
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,295
The police are also now doing more
searches on the street.

106
00:10:17,942 --> 00:10:21,747
I want you, Ares and Eros

107
00:10:21,847 --> 00:10:23,102
to stay safe.

108
00:10:23,182 --> 00:10:26,680
You'd better stay home with me. Okay?

109
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,782
Don't worry.

110
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:35,733
Just pray for the three of us

111
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,342
will stay safe.

112
00:10:37,422 --> 00:10:39,963
Amen.

113
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:42,476
I'm going to leave you now to eat.

114
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,827
Spare me.

115
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:57,430
Don't hurt me.

116
00:10:58,662 --> 00:11:00,216
Please, don't hurt me!

117
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:03,090
It's me, Ares.

118
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:09,447
Ares, you scared me.

119
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:10,942
I thought you were a robber.

120
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:15,382
- Coffee?
- One sweet tea.

121
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,089
Sit down.

122
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:22,436
Thank you.

123
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,281
How was business today?

124
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,470
As you can see, not very good.

125
00:11:29,342 --> 00:11:31,776
This is a dangerous time apparently.

126
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:34,283
People are afraid of street robbers.

127
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,653
I'm about to go home as well

128
00:11:36,753 --> 00:11:38,676
because they closed the park.

129
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:42,456
I didn't get any money, only bad luck.

130
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:45,183
My friend was robbed the other day.

131
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,062
What do you mean?

132
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:50,822
He lost all his money to street thugs

133
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:53,102
and also by the robbers,

134
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:56,836
even the bike gangs too.

135
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,336
But I'm sure,

136
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,996
you and your friends aren't like them.

137
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:05,176
You better quit the gang.

138
00:12:05,702 --> 00:12:07,542
It's too dangerous, you could get hurt.

139
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:10,051
It's more dangerous

140
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,375
to not do anything about the criminals.

141
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,043
- Right?
- I get your point.

142
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,643
(Are you at home now?)

143
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:45,790
(Yes, what are you doing?)

144
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,267
(Just finished dinner)

145
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,310
(I thought you're thinking about me)

146
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:09,590
- There he is.
- Morning.

147
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:12,507
Morning, Ares!

148
00:13:12,607 --> 00:13:14,837
I'm so happy.

149
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:17,533
It's been a while since anyone

150
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:19,557
said good morning to me.

151
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:24,296
- Well, I'm off.
- Take care!

152
00:13:24,397 --> 00:13:25,656
Okay.

153
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,517
- Morning.
- Morning.

154
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,089
It's so bright.

155
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:42,633
The sun?

156
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,957
What's wrong?

157
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:46,982
The view in front of me is so bright.

158
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,557
It's too early for that.

159
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:53,596
Let's go.

160
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,403
Ares!

161
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:02,436
Ares, stop it!

162
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,096
Goodness.

163
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:07,317
It's early in the morning,
yet you guys are being lovey-dovey.

164
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:09,277
You remind me of my younger days.

165
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:11,340
You're still there?

166
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,916
Right.

167
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:33,591
Today we're going to do a search.

168
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,570
- Can I see your bag?
- Sure.

169
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:51,465
You.

170
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,956
This is a school, not the beach.

171
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:09,909
May I?

172
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,085
Your bag.

173
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:37,603
Read this at home,
don't bring it to school.

174
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,263
Yes, Ma'am. I'm sorry.

175
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:43,538
But, you're not going to
confiscate it permanently, right?

176
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,890
Because I borrowed it from...

177
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,830
Who still have
the same jacket like Ardhan's?

178
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,996
Take them all.

179
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,090
Your jacket?

180
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:55,250
I'm sorry, but I'm just
following the school rules.

181
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:56,663
Moreo!

182
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:05,990
I'm dead.

183
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:20,063
May I?

184
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,923
What do you mean?

185
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,632
Your bag.

186
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,820
My school bag?

187
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,178
You're going to only
find books like the others.

188
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,350
Then open it.

189
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:45,269
You're bringing these everyday?

190
00:17:46,631 --> 00:17:48,108
Well, yeah.

191
00:17:48,209 --> 00:17:50,552
I mean, who knows when
I'm going to need one of those?

192
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,403
You're bringing more makeup than books.

193
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:00,679
If she takes my makeup,
then how am I going to do my touch ups?

194
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,839
She's always up to no good.

195
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,639
What doesn't she understand?

196
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,519
Makeup can cheer you up.

197
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:14,800
If you're happy,
you'll be more excited to learn,

198
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,603
that's related to our studies, right?

199
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,723
You're absolutely right.

200
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,462
Let's buy you a new one, okay?

201
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:28,418
They sell them at the mall, right?

202
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,679
No, thanks. I can afford them, Richie.

203
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:35,440
Anyways,

204
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,781
I hate her so much.

205
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:40,279
Why does she likes
to do those unnecessary things?

206
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,956
Do you realize how intimidating
she can be?

207
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:45,516
- Need a hug?
- Sorry.

208
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:48,536
I might need it from someone...

209
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:53,178
Feel better now?

210
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,970
Not really, but thank you.

211
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,690
Anytime.

212
00:19:02,178 --> 00:19:04,338
I don't understand Miss Anin.
I think she's going through PMS.

213
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,420
Why are women going through it
always so annoying?

214
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,959
This is crazy!

215
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,260
Am I the only one who's upset
about her taking our private stuff?

216
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,490
We can't let her do that.

217
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:18,637
I mean, what the hell was that?

218
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,603
Unannounced search,
seizing Calderioz jackets.

219
00:19:27,392 --> 00:19:29,163
I think I still have one more jacket
hidden in this school.

220
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,639
- Oji!
- Yes, what's up?

221
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:37,443
Can I have my jacket back?
The one I told you to keep it for me?

222
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,279
"Jacket"? I have it.

223
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,836
Does it mean I'm no longer
one of the Calderioz?

224
00:20:07,269 --> 00:20:08,333
Oji.

225
00:20:09,062 --> 00:20:10,233
Here, take it.

226
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:12,064
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

227
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:14,359
You're my true friend!

228
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,852
We're best friends!

229
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:18,878
Calderioz in my heart!

230
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,882
So, what's the plan?

231
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,003
Stay away from trouble.

232
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,410
Who's looking for trouble?

233
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:35,978
We were minding our own business
when they took our jackets.

234
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:39,943
We agreed not to wear

235
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,467
any gang symbols to school.

236
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:43,568
Dude.

237
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,365
You didn't even wear it.

238
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:48,631
You were just carrying it in your bag,
not wearing it.

239
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:54,032
- How about we take them back?
- No.

240
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:59,796
I mean, we sneak in, nobody would see us.

241
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:01,910
I said, stay away from trouble!

242
00:21:04,585 --> 00:21:05,830
And for the last time,

243
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:07,816
stay away from trouble.

244
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:15,470
Ares.

245
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,939
Ares, we're not done talking!

246
00:21:41,108 --> 00:21:42,108
Ares.

247
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,343
You can talk to me.

248
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:53,676
Fine, it's okay if you're not ready.

249
00:22:00,239 --> 00:22:01,256
Babe.

250
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,639
Cheer up.

251
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,449
Smile.

252
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,959
This one is not overly sweet,
which I like.

253
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,050
And then,

254
00:22:42,216 --> 00:22:43,603
I can taste the cheese

255
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,483
and the tartness is just perfect.

256
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:50,849
This must not contain sour cream, right?

257
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,839
No, we just use
some lemon juice and lemon zest.

258
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,630
Zest, yeah!

259
00:22:57,058 --> 00:22:58,960
I use those things as well.

260
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:01,748
But I thought nobody
uses the old recipes anymore.

261
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:04,050
It's my mom's recipe.

262
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,512
I love every one of them.

263
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:12,051
You want them all?

264
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,603
Is it that obvious?

265
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:17,979
If you want a custom cake,

266
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
just let us know.

267
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,503
- Can you make no bake cheesecake?
- Yes, Ma'am.

268
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,976
I'm impressed.

269
00:23:27,999 --> 00:23:29,895
This is a nice place, Cleo.

270
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:31,436
Has Ares been here?

271
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:34,876
Thank you for telling everything to me.

272
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:38,692
In my opinion,

273
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:40,543
the most crucial things is

274
00:23:40,643 --> 00:23:44,650
don't ever let outsider know
about your internal feud.

275
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:47,316
They'll take advantage of that situation.

276
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:49,703
Yes, babe.

277
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:58,783
I tried to investigate the case.

278
00:24:00,392 --> 00:24:01,550
I always tell them.

279
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:05,684
Don't accuse someone without evidence.

280
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,583
That's why I've been
searching for more evidence

281
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,143
of whether the culprit is

282
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:14,592
someone from the inside

283
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:17,516
or from a different bike gang.

284
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,283
I know you're not going to sit around
and do nothing.

285
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:25,519
What I'm worried about is

286
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,758
the others misunderstand you.

287
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:34,918
For the time being,

288
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,410
I think the culprit

289
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:46,256
wants all bike gangs to lay low.

290
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:56,370
Let's find the solution together.

291
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:02,136
What's wrong with your eyes?

292
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:03,795
Is there something?

293
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:05,350
Don't touch it.

294
00:25:05,451 --> 00:25:06,451
What is it?

295
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:08,109
What's wrong?

296
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,952
Sneaky move.

297
00:25:28,217 --> 00:25:29,389
Who is it from?

298
00:25:30,578 --> 00:25:31,594
My mom.

299
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:34,883
She wants to talk about
the family annual gala dinner.

300
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:39,838
You'd come, right?

301
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:42,515
Me?

302
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:44,589
Just me?

303
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:49,563
To your family gala dinner?

304
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:51,599
- Me?
- Yeah.

305
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,003
You're kidding.

306
00:25:53,499 --> 00:25:54,499
Just you.

307
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:57,326
Are you serious? Cleo...

308
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:59,039
What about Cleo?

309
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,639
What about Selina and Karissa?
Calz Angels?

310
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:03,599
- Just you!
- I'm dead.

311
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,420
Ares, wait! Stop playing around!

312
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:36,969
(Please don't attempt to do this act)

313
00:26:48,411 --> 00:26:50,576
As leaders from other schools,

314
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:53,196
protect the Calderioz members there.

315
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:55,996
Make sure they're all okay.

316
00:26:58,854 --> 00:26:59,966
If anything happens,

317
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,670
call me immediately.

318
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:17,454
Ares!

319
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:24,847
- What is it?
- I was being chased.

320
00:27:25,406 --> 00:27:26,486
What do you mean?

321
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:28,334
There were three bikers chasing after me

322
00:27:28,435 --> 00:27:30,014
and one of them was wearing our jacket.

323
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:31,534
Do you know who chased you?

324
00:27:31,614 --> 00:27:33,504
I don't, but I saw him take out a knife

325
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:35,494
and was about to stab me.

326
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:37,642
But you know I'm a good driver,

327
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,060
so I swerved around to avoid it.

328
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,229
Ares.

329
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:45,429
We can't do this anymore.

330
00:27:46,214 --> 00:27:47,613
First Laskar, now Moreo.

331
00:27:47,927 --> 00:27:49,516
How many more victims do you want?

332
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:51,734
They are targeting us!

333
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,217
Either they're targeting us

334
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:54,864
or they're trying to manipulate us.

335
00:27:56,734 --> 00:27:58,574
What are you waiting for?
I don't understand.

336
00:27:58,654 --> 00:27:59,896
I'm waiting for evidence!

337
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,510
Any evidence to justify our action.

338
00:28:03,294 --> 00:28:05,630
Even Moreo doesn't remember
the stabber's face.

339
00:28:05,947 --> 00:28:07,276
How are we going to take any action?

340
00:28:14,814 --> 00:28:16,254
Oh, baby.

341
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:20,396
Is that your bike?

342
00:28:20,774 --> 00:28:22,103
Answer me, is that your bike?

343
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:23,614
Yes, why?

344
00:28:23,774 --> 00:28:25,083
Are you out of your mind?

345
00:28:26,094 --> 00:28:27,534
And you dare to greet me?

346
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:29,454
I know you're the one who attacked me.

347
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:31,854
- Are you trying to hurt me?
- Chill, man.

348
00:28:31,934 --> 00:28:35,463
- You want to destroy Calderioz?
- We have no evidence.

349
00:28:36,654 --> 00:28:39,214
No, this bike looks exactly
like the one that was chasing me.

350
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:42,174
- This isn't the only bike I have.
- Shut your mouth!

351
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,934
From the moment you came back,
I had a bad feeling about it.

352
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,307
If I want to destroy Calderioz,

353
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:48,340
I would aim the leader,
why on earth would I aim you?

354
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:51,374
Enough. Moreo, enough!

355
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:57,846
This is exactly why
I want to take over Calderioz.

356
00:28:58,493 --> 00:28:59,663
What do you mean?

357
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:02,547
That's an intense glare.

358
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:04,536
Here's an idea.

359
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,429
You have no commander-in-chief.

360
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,575
Let me handle that.

361
00:29:10,614 --> 00:29:12,303
No need to rush, sleep on it.

362
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:14,683
It's a good deal.

363
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:22,183
Let him go, Moreo.

364
00:29:26,694 --> 00:29:28,347
Let's talk inside.

365
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:30,236
- I panicked.
- Yeah.

366
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,296
We can't let things like this ruin us.

367
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,790
Let's talk inside.

368
00:29:38,014 --> 00:29:40,603
- Where are you going, Ardhan?
- Are you leaving?

369
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,220
Let's talk first.

370
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:47,747
Ardhan!

371
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:54,336
Come on.

372
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:58,470
If this keeps happening,

373
00:29:58,584 --> 00:30:00,660
one by one, the Calderioz members
will get hurt.

374
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,930
I don't want you to get hurt.

375
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,310
At least, watch your back.

376
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,156
Don't worry,

377
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:14,610
I can take care of myself.

378
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:17,203
Are you sure Richie is behind all this?

379
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,316
I have suspicions.

380
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:26,153
But,

381
00:30:27,406 --> 00:30:29,450
maybe it's not him.
