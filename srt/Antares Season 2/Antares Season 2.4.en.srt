1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,889
Ardhan told me that Retro gang
is laying low right now?

2
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:17,595
Ares.

3
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:20,382
you can tell me anything,

4
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:22,966
maybe I can help.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,400
No.

6
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,579
I don't want to involve you
any deeper into this mess.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,580
I can take care of myself.

8
00:00:30,653 --> 00:00:31,653
You know me.

9
00:00:32,373 --> 00:00:33,829
I'm a Capo Wolves, remember?

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,949
- Please listen to me, Zea.
- Do you trust me or not?

11
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:40,312
- It's not that...
- Do you trust me or not? Just tell me.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,495
I trust you.

13
00:00:54,475 --> 00:00:56,075
You're heavy.

14
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:00,526
If you can't stand it,

15
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:01,829
just kiss me.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,462
Why did you come to school with Cleo?

17
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:23,797
Why do you ask?

18
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:25,528
Are you jealous?

19
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:27,235
No way.

20
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:29,368
I just want to know why.

21
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:30,803
Simple as that.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,162
- Well? Answer me!
- Are you jealous?

23
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:39,286
No! I'm not jealous!

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,855
Move.

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,786
Zea!

26
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,049
- Are you jealous?
- No!

27
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,499
I put my boogers in your cold drink,
and I stirred it in.

28
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,835
- Gross! Take it!
- No.

29
00:02:00,173 --> 00:02:01,995
Surprise!

30
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:05,296
Baby.

31
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:08,800
Please stop being mad at me.

32
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,760
Nope.

33
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:15,115
- What's his problem?
- Household problems, I think.

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,569
- What's going on?
- Ask him.

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,575
- I fell asleep on the phone last night.
- While I was pouring my heart out!

36
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,939
This is one of the reasons
why I'm grateful to be single.

37
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:39,600
I think this couple’s quarrel stuff
is kind of like being in junior high.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,720
Yeah, right.

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,182
Hey, Moreo,
she's single and she's happy.

40
00:02:45,835 --> 00:02:48,249
- Me too.
- Yes, you are.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,855
That's what I want to see!
So pretty.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640
So you think I'm pretty
only when I'm smiling?

43
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:57,341
Oh, my.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,169
My eyes!
Are you out of your mind?

45
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,733
That kind of stuff definitely ruins
a good hangout spot!

46
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:22,720
You turned it into a loser spot!

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,973
Walk me to the health clinic.
I'm feeling nauseous.

48
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:28,466
Let them be.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,146
Do you know Fino has transferred
to another school?

50
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,162
Yes!

51
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:41,412
Sorry, I just won a game.
What did you say about Fino?

52
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:44,039
His parents transferred him.

53
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,508
They don't feel
this is a safe school.

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,986
I'm worried about you.

55
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,082
It's alright.

56
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:55,562
And about me
riding with Ares this morning...

57
00:03:56,259 --> 00:03:57,882
You don't have to worry
about that either.

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,873
- I trust you.
- Okay.

59
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,760
And she hugs me.

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,635
- Promise me you will be careful.
- I promise.

61
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:07,892
Let's go.

62
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,386
What happened?

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,520
- What happened?
- Someone stabbed me.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,160
- Get help!
- Get help!

65
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:37,282
(Bike gangs suspected to be the criminals,
citizens became unsettled)

66
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,875
(Eros)

67
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:11,885
Hello?

68
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:14,132
Ares, one member of the Wolves

69
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,112
got attacked by unknown
bikers in Jakarta.

70
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,260
Where is he now? I'll be right there.

71
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:21,442
No need to, it's been taken care of.

72
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,115
Just please watch your back and Calderioz.

73
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:28,187
One more thing.
Please protect Zea.

74
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,607
Jakarta is not a safe place right now.

75
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:30,921
You can count on me.

76
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,582
The victim and the perpetrator
are allegedly members of bike gangs.

77
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:45,114
In the recording,
the victim fell down

78
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:47,889
after being attacked
by a motorcycle gang.

79
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:49,936
(Where are you?)

80
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:51,422
(Have you heard from Eros?)

81
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:52,717
(Ares?)

82
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,815
I'm starting to see the pattern.

83
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:00,442
One.

84
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:04,572
The crimes were done in public areas

85
00:06:04,672 --> 00:06:06,456
by a group of men

86
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:09,049
who were dressed like
they're from some bike gangs.

87
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,672
But they're not.

88
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:14,728
Two,

89
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,424
they attacked real bike gang members.

90
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,555
They wore fake insignias
from another gang.

91
00:06:26,515 --> 00:06:27,775
Turning us against each other.

92
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,842
From these two cases,

93
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:34,608
both have the same objectives.

94
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,695
To end the bike gangs.

95
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,919
If all bike gangs cease to exist,

96
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:49,888
every attack, destruction,
and other criminal acts will be over.

97
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,362
I wonder who has so much hatred
for bike gangs to do such things?

98
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:06,871
(Moreo)

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,075
- What's up, Moreo?
- Hey, Ardhan.

100
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:13,675
Why are you naked?

101
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:18,159
I can't believe you forgot
how I love being naked.

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,673
We slept together countless times, right?

103
00:07:23,971 --> 00:07:26,595
Antares Sebastian Aldevaro!

104
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:29,489
Sir, excuse me! Sir!

105
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,480
Tell me, is there any more
bike gangs except Retro laying low?

106
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,682
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

107
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,640
Yes, everything's fine,
until there are more victims.

108
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,320
Are you sure?
It's a crucial moment for us.

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,855
Can you just shut up?

110
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,689
Where were you
when they attacked our school?

111
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,315
I was laughing at you. Remember?

112
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:56,162
Ardhan.

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,082
- Laugh again, I dare you.
- Go ahead, hit me.

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,462
Calm down, Ardhan.

115
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,035
Are you ignoring me?
What's going on? Ardhan?

116
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:45,332
Maybe to clear our names and Calderioz
in Mr. Darwis's eyes,

117
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:47,082
we have to do one thing.

118
00:09:47,183 --> 00:09:48,212
What is it?

119
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:52,162
- Clean the school.
- Okay. Where is the paint?

120
00:09:52,423 --> 00:09:53,835
Can't you see? It's over there.

121
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:02,663
Excuse me!

122
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,749
Ares.

123
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:16,082
I just mopped that spot.

124
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:19,395
Move.

125
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:25,325
To clear our names and Calderioz

126
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,212
in Mr. Darwis's eyes,

127
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:28,836
we have to get good grades.

128
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,006
That one is too hard for me.

129
00:10:32,106 --> 00:10:35,595
Try study for once,
so you'll get better grades.

130
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:39,593
I'm going to find a
way to get good grades.

131
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,863
That's what I want to hear.

132
00:10:41,943 --> 00:10:43,629
You're talking about
buying the cheat sheet, right?

133
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,195
We'll create a study group.

134
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:51,195
And hire a private tutor if we have to.

135
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:53,922
I know a good private tutor.

136
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:56,463
Can you stop appearing out of nowhere?

137
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,429
That's creepy!
Are you a ghost or something?

138
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:03,582
We don't need your help. Get it?

139
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:06,255
Calderioz members should help each other.

140
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,662
What's the slogan again?

141
00:11:08,762 --> 00:11:10,588
"Defend each member."

142
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,428
What are you doing here anyway?

143
00:11:13,028 --> 00:11:14,983
Why don't you go back to the States?

144
00:11:15,063 --> 00:11:16,623
Don't tell me what to do.

145
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,576
You're not the Calderioz leader.

146
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,452
Sorry, you're the deputy.

147
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:22,835
A position that should've been mine.

148
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:24,975
Right?

149
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,486
Aiden's dead,

150
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:31,002
Laskar left.

151
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,349
That’s already
too much for us to handle.

152
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:36,488
Sir.

153
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:42,715
Prove it, bro. Prove it.

154
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,628
Behave.

155
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,115
Ms. Anin and Mr. Darwis are watching.

156
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:55,982
Where were we?

157
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:01,968
- Richie.
- Zea.

158
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:04,875
- What's your problem with Ares?
- Wait.

159
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:08,299
Before that, I want to apologize
for what I did to you yesterday.

160
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:12,714
It was just an old habit
I should've left behind.

161
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:15,885
Not all girls like to be touched.

162
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:19,662
Yes, not without consent.

163
00:12:21,623 --> 00:12:23,849
And to answer your question,

164
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,695
I don't have any problem with him.

165
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:29,322
But I can't say the same about him.

166
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,195
Here he comes.

167
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,295
What did he say to you?

168
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:43,629
I asked him what's his problem with you.

169
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:49,708
Why didn't you ask me instead?

170
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,648
I did, you won't tell me.

171
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,135
In fact, you've been avoiding
that question like a plague.

172
00:13:03,223 --> 00:13:05,915
Okay, I will tell you everything.

173
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,739
Now smile for me.

174
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,422
I have to go to my class.

175
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:18,635
I love you.

176
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,428
I love you too.

177
00:13:33,303 --> 00:13:34,739
He's stable now.

178
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:36,995
But he doesn't know
who stabbed him.

179
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:40,622
Does it have to do with Lionel?

180
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,675
Just keep your eyes open.

181
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,342
But let's not get carried away.

182
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:48,889
Just stay cool.

183
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,103
Let's go to Jakarta.

184
00:13:52,183 --> 00:13:55,635
- No, wait for my signal.
- Fine.

185
00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:58,706
Excuse me.

186
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:04,183
I'm delivering a package for Eros.

187
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:05,369
I'm Eros.

188
00:14:07,536 --> 00:14:09,688
(Stop or die)

189
00:14:10,286 --> 00:14:12,338
- Who is it from?
- I don't know.

190
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,849
The sender didn't put
any name on the package.

191
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:18,922
- Who is it from?
- Relax.

192
00:14:19,023 --> 00:14:21,503
I swear to God, I don't know.
I'm just delivering the package.

193
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,115
Calm down.
He's just delivering the package.

194
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:30,223
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Excuse me.

195
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,402
Sure.

196
00:14:35,103 --> 00:14:36,642
Wolves just called me.

197
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:40,055
They got the same message.

198
00:14:41,383 --> 00:14:43,102
Stop or die.

199
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:45,795
We have to find the person who did this.

200
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:46,979
Sure.

201
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,162
But, not now.

202
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:51,383
What do you mean?

203
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:53,429
Are you telling us to do nothing?

204
00:14:54,303 --> 00:14:56,063
We have to find out
the person behind all this.

205
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:57,922
I said, not now.

206
00:15:01,822 --> 00:15:03,302
Running around in the darkness

207
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:05,856
won't benefit us anything.

208
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:08,991
All we can do now

209
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:10,402
is people power.

210
00:15:10,955 --> 00:15:13,035
We need to change
the negative stigma about bike gangs

211
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:15,669
with public service activities.

212
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:18,849
I agree.

213
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:22,222
There's nothing wrong in repeating
the previous method.

214
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:23,961
Right, Moreo?

215
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,349
Yeah, I agree.

216
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:32,103
But if it involves physical work,
I have to pass.

217
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:33,715
I don't feel well.

218
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:40,095
Just kidding.

219
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:43,236
Love the hair, by the way.

220
00:15:44,863 --> 00:15:46,862
Any more ideas, guys?

221
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,035
Call me if anything happens.

222
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:58,755
Okay.

223
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,559
Mom doesn't need to know about this.
So don't tell her.

224
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,492
I don't want her to worry.

225
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,317
I can take care of myself.

226
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:07,459
No, listen to me.

227
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:12,168
If an incident like this happen again,
you have to come home immediately.

228
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,582
- I hope it won't happen again.
- Amen to that.

229
00:16:16,463 --> 00:16:17,548
Bye.

230
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,642
Everyone's here?

231
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:37,743
I think so.

232
00:16:37,823 --> 00:16:38,915
So let's do it.

233
00:16:40,063 --> 00:16:41,922
Are you coming, Lollipop?

234
00:16:42,783 --> 00:16:47,383
I'd better stay here. Guard the basecamp.

235
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:50,928
Who knows, maybe they deliver
another threat letter.

236
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,262
It would be a shame
if no one is here to receive it.

237
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:57,755
If I was the man behind all this,
I'd be delighted.

238
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:59,796
The new image of bike gangs,

239
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,443
Calderioz is now doing
public service activities.

240
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,935
Drive carefully, my friends.

241
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,103
Ma'am. Sir.

242
00:17:42,183 --> 00:17:44,282
We're giving out goods.

243
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:49,190
If you want to do good deeds,
this is not the right place.

244
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:51,839
What do you mean?

245
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,806
You’re just pretending
to be kind to us,

246
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,703
so we don't think
of you as criminals.

247
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:59,263
But we're doing this
without any hidden agenda.

248
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:01,279
There's no such thing as good bike gangs.

249
00:18:01,379 --> 00:18:02,725
Let's go.

250
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,719
- Here you go.
- No, thank you.

251
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:09,542
We're not interested. Let's go.

252
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,749
What's wrong with them?

253
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:18,362
I was afraid, you know.

254
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,743
Excuse me.

255
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:23,004
Here you go.

256
00:18:26,743 --> 00:18:29,422
A special cake for the special dancers.

257
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:32,702
Enjoy.

258
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:43,042
Please don't do that.
You embarrassed me in front of Jayden.

259
00:18:44,642 --> 00:18:48,242
There's nothing happening between us.
I just come here often.

260
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:53,943
And then we chatted and somehow
I told him about our group dance.

261
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:56,343
- That's all.
- Are you sure?

262
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:59,943
- You guys believe it?
- Nothing happened between us.

263
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:05,468
And you know it's still hard
for me to move on.

264
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:11,386
I know Aiden would be happy

265
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,455
to see you happy.

266
00:19:16,943 --> 00:19:20,223
No more doom and gloom,
I want sweet treats.

267
00:19:20,303 --> 00:19:23,983
As sweet as Moreo?

268
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:26,743
Just because you already have Ardhan
You’re being mean?

269
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:28,423
You bet.

270
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:32,642
Is that a picture of Cleo, Ares and Richie?

271
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:39,075
Were Ares and Richie friends in the past?

272
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:42,795
Ares and I live in the same neighborhood.

273
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,759
Of course, we grew up together.

274
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:48,703
- And with Richie too.
- How come we didn't know that?

275
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:49,822
Me too.

276
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:55,423
Since Ares joined Calderioz,
we don't hang out as much.

277
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:58,422
I just don't think that's newsworthy,
that's all. Let's dig in!

278
00:20:07,103 --> 00:20:08,863
- Which one is the spicy one?
- It's this one.

279
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:10,223
- This is the other one.
- Thank you.

280
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:12,302
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

281
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:20,068
You're not eating?

282
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,628
Neither are you.

283
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,295
How did the charity activity go?

284
00:20:36,364 --> 00:20:37,468
It went well.

285
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,488
But?

286
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:46,108
But since lately our image
has been tainted..

287
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,269
some people didn't want to receive it.

288
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,749
Hang in there.
It's going to get better.

289
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:05,022
What's your excuse?

290
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:10,896
Ares.

291
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:14,722
You can't keep me guessing about
what's going on with your life.

292
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:17,569
What do you mean?

293
00:21:18,202 --> 00:21:20,082
You just proved my point.

294
00:21:20,183 --> 00:21:24,195
You won't say anything until
I ask you about the charity activity.

295
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,535
And also about Richie.

296
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:34,082
You promised to tell me about
what's going on with you and Richie.

297
00:21:34,239 --> 00:21:37,162
But that's it. It's just a promise.

298
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,389
I found out about your childhood friendship
from his social media.

299
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,393
Yes.

300
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:52,922
I was friends with Richie and Cleo

301
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:58,069
until around 2 or 3 years ago.

302
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:01,189
Did something happen?

303
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,528
Richie did something to Cleo

304
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:10,975
that caused her to break her ankle.

305
00:22:13,903 --> 00:22:15,489
I was mad at him,

306
00:22:17,174 --> 00:22:21,282
but Cleo defended him.

307
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:27,562
He never apologized to her,

308
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:30,295
even till today.

309
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:36,448
That incident broke our friendship.

310
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,369
Let's eat.

311
00:22:44,199 --> 00:22:45,259
Here you go.

312
00:22:51,756 --> 00:22:53,982
- It's good.
- I know, right?

313
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,595
Any plan to reconcile?

314
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:02,816
Well...

315
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:06,563
There are some things

316
00:23:08,103 --> 00:23:09,676
that should not be forced.

317
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:14,719
I failed Cleo

318
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:16,515
by letting the accident happen.

319
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,715
I just don't want
the same thing to

320
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:24,067
ever happen again.

321
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,555
I'm going to protect
all the Calderioz members,

322
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:31,735
and you.

323
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:34,196
For the rest of my life.

324
00:23:40,442 --> 00:23:41,442
Ares.

325
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:44,127
You're not a superhero.

326
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,915
It's not your duty

327
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:49,849
to protect everybody.

328
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:04,439
Oh, my God. It's so beautiful!

329
00:24:04,503 --> 00:24:07,263
You really can make a sunflower cake!

330
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:10,942
- Yeah.
- It's too cute.

331
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:14,519
Let me know if you like it.

332
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:16,463
Sure thing.

333
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:18,635
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

334
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,403
I'd better go home now.

335
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:29,623
How about I give you a ride?

336
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:42,002
Too bad, I already ordered a taxi,
and it's waiting outside.

337
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:45,143
- But, next time, maybe?
- Okay.

338
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:47,528
Bye.

339
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:05,695
Hello?

340
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,239
Bus-stop vandalism allegedly
carried out by a motorcycle gang.

341
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:17,348
This vandalism took place in several

342
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,823
Isn't that the bus-stop near our base?

343
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:24,284
You're right.
They're getting closer to us.

344
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:50,635
The existence of your organization
is about to end

345
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:53,183
and you still have time to date?

346
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:55,023
That's none of your business.

347
00:25:55,223 --> 00:25:57,415
Go home, this is not your house, anyway.

348
00:25:58,842 --> 00:25:59,942
Okay.

349
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:04,916
I'm just here to tell you that someone
vandalized a bus-stop near our base.

350
00:26:06,036 --> 00:26:07,288
How are the boys?

351
00:26:08,595 --> 00:26:10,676
I thought you
told me to go home.

352
00:26:10,922 --> 00:26:14,162
- Just answer the question!
- They're fine.

353
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:15,582
Until now, at least.

354
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,722
But I’m sure that
something will happen to them.

355
00:26:21,463 --> 00:26:22,675
What do you mean?

356
00:26:24,242 --> 00:26:26,855
Chill, man.

357
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:28,649
What do you want?

358
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:34,108
I want to take over Calderioz.
