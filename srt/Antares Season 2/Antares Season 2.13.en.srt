1
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:30,733
Do you know

2
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:32,827
that you attacked the wrong target?

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,000
"Wrong target"?

4
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:37,327
Zea and I attacked the real perpetrator.

5
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,520
Our target's name is Radit.

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sure he is working on his own.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,920
He's not involved with any motorbike gang.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,560
We are going to find out about Radit.

9
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,280
There is no one named Radit here.

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,960
Ares!

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,680
- Hey!
- Move!

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,880
Spin!

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,760
That's why I told you to refrain.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,560
Don't be reckless!

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,830
My ears.

16
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,560
Baby!

17
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
I'm out of suspension.

18
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,440
What's wrong, Babe?

19
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:29,567
I want to break up.

20
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:42,086
I don't...

21
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,207
I don't understand.

22
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,640
Why?

23
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,320
Because I said so.

24
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,856
But we can talk about it, Babe.

25
00:03:56,513 --> 00:03:57,553
Ardhan.

26
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:01,906
We're still in high school.

27
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,493
We should be having fun at our age.

28
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,973
Instead of being busy
with our own problems.

29
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,486
You also know that we've been

30
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
keeping our problems to ourselves.

31
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:34,606
It's toxic, Ardhan.

32
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,567
But, Babe.

33
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,840
I need your support right now.

34
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:40,961
Me too.

35
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,782
I also really need your support.

36
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,600
But Calderioz is your priority right now.

37
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:53,816
I can't keep on supporting you

38
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:55,523
when you don't even focus on me too.

39
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:00,513
Maybe it's best for us to be on our own.

40
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:04,139
Babe, I can't...

41
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,280
Please.

42
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,339
- But this isn't...
- Ardhan.

43
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,040
You once asked me what I want.

44
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:16,947
This is what I want.

45
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:21,973
And you promised

46
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,133
to fulfill it.

47
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,719
That you would do what I want.

48
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,040
But, Babe.

49
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,126
That's not what I meant.

50
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:44,027
Let's go home.

51
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:46,593
You go first.

52
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,386
I'm still going to accompany Karissa.

53
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:51,453
She just broke up with Ardhan.

54
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,300
"Broke up"?

55
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,607
Don't say it out loud!

56
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,240
I feel bad for Karissa.

57
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:02,073
- Okay?
- I'm going to wait here then.

58
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:04,573
You don't need to. Just go.

59
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,080
Didn't you say you're going to the base?

60
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:09,546
I'll be fine. Okay?

61
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,940
Zea.

62
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,153
I don't want to go home alone.

63
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,640
Ares, I want to go home alone.

64
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,613
It's okay. Just go to the base.

65
00:06:18,637 --> 00:06:20,360
Please. Okay?

66
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:22,666
I'll share my live location, okay?

67
00:06:22,826 --> 00:06:25,026
- Take care, bye!
- Bye!

68
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,340
Karissa.

69
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,753
Sorry I left in the middle of your story.

70
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,680
Aren't you going home with Ares?

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,051
It's okay.

72
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:46,517
I can go home by myself.

73
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,546
He's going to meet the other
Calderioz members anyway.

74
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
Maybe because you're also
a motorbike gang member, Zea.

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,320
So you understand Ares' activities.

76
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:12,459
I...

77
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,960
I can't.

78
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,520
I know I've been demanding a lot
from Ardhan lately.

79
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,000
Meanwhile, he's busy
taking care of Calderioz.

80
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:35,299
Poor guy.

81
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,646
But,

82
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,796
wouldn't this decision
makes him more miserable?

83
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:47,602
At least he'll be able to forget it

84
00:07:47,703 --> 00:07:49,780
since he's preoccupied
with the exams and Calderioz.

85
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,720
But do you still love Ardhan?

86
00:08:10,653 --> 00:08:11,813
Of course I do.

87
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,793
But maybe I just need time

88
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,240
for us to take care of our own things.

89
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,620
I understand.

90
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,046
Sometimes,

91
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:40,326
distance can be our way to show our love.

92
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,460
My advice is

93
00:08:47,973 --> 00:08:49,333
don't regret it.

94
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,800
It's okay.

95
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,093
Oh, dear.

96
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,760
Chill, man.

97
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:13,999
Hey. Ardhan?

98
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,053
What's wrong with you?

99
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,667
He broke up with Karissa.

100
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,280
Shut the hell up, Richie.

101
00:09:23,203 --> 00:09:24,469
Don't be such a know-it-all.

102
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:27,080
If he broke up with Karissa,
I'd be the first to know.

103
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,600
I always know your friend better than you.

104
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,320
Enough.

105
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,463
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

106
00:09:57,246 --> 00:09:58,326
Where's Ares?

107
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,520
He's with the guys.

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,360
He usually drops me home.

109
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,720
Enough with this.

110
00:10:11,412 --> 00:10:12,452
What's wrong?

111
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:14,413
You have to see this.

112
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:15,986
Follow me.

113
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,520
She witnessed it.

114
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,040
- This...
- Look at that.

115
00:10:46,693 --> 00:10:49,516
(Stop or Die!)

116
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,120
They're not playing around!

117
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,520
You're not safe here.

118
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:55,772
You have to come home.

119
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:56,912
But...

120
00:10:57,013 --> 00:10:58,360
Don't argue with me on this.

121
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,980
When you're with the Wolves,
things like this never happened.

122
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,325
Except for my incident.

123
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,320
And do you remember how bad it was?

124
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:10,647
It's not about facing this on your own.

125
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,196
But this shows they're not playing around.

126
00:11:29,586 --> 00:11:30,666
What happened?

127
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:35,747
See for yourself.

128
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,473
Where did you get it?

129
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,086
Let's talk outside.

130
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,114
Aeros, what are you doing?

131
00:11:50,138 --> 00:11:51,200
You wait here.

132
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,920
- Aeros.
- You wait here. Come on, move it.

133
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:01,653
Ares.

134
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,880
You said you're going to
keep your promise.

135
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:07,680
So, what kind of terror is that?

136
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:15,687
Can you keep Zea safe?

137
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:18,786
If you can't,
I'm going to bring Zea back to Bandung.

138
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,399
Where were you?

139
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,367
Sorry.

140
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:24,953
I'm asking you one more time.

141
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,880
Can you keep my sister safe?

142
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
I assure you,

143
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,840
nothing will happen to Zea.

144
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,156
You can trust me.

145
00:12:35,257 --> 00:12:36,297
Okay.

146
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,320
Aeros, this is not the time
to put blame on others.

147
00:12:45,093 --> 00:12:46,864
We should find out about this together.

148
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,045
No.

149
00:12:49,097 --> 00:12:51,240
You can't involve yourself in...

150
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm not a kid anymore.

151
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,880
When you were in a coma,

152
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
I had to found out everything on my own.

153
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,642
And then Ares came

154
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:02,760
and helped me.

155
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,800
I just don't want anything
to happen to you.

156
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:09,553
Don't worry.

157
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:12,532
I'm going to discuss this
with the guys straight away.

158
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:14,253
Let me know.

159
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,906
(Ardhan: Baby. I'm sorry)

160
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:45,620
(Ardhan: Please don't break up with me)

161
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,594
(Ardhan: I love you so much)

162
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:02,773
(Ardhan: Babe, please don't avoid me)

163
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:14,939
Let me.

164
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,173
Okay.

165
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:19,546
Done.

166
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,400
Is there no one looking for you
if you're not home at this hour?

167
00:14:27,086 --> 00:14:28,126
No one.

168
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:33,093
I only live with my maid and my driver.

169
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,799
Where are your parents?

170
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
It's a long story.

171
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,267
Your friends don't come here very often.

172
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,920
Yeah, they're busy with their own things.

173
00:14:53,619 --> 00:14:54,819
By the way, why haven't you gone home yet?

174
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,393
Home where?

175
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,053
Wait, where's your home?

176
00:14:58,526 --> 00:14:59,646
Here.

177
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,956
Seriously?

178
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,920
No.

179
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,820
I live in a house my Mom left for me.

180
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:12,253
But I'm here most of the time.

181
00:15:12,766 --> 00:15:13,846
I see.

182
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,640
When I'm home,

183
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
especially when I'm alone,

184
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,080
I tend to remember her.

185
00:15:27,366 --> 00:15:31,006
There used to be someone
asking me what time I will come home.

186
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:34,200
"Don't come home late,
there are lots of bad people."

187
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:37,743
But,

188
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:39,840
not anymore.

189
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:44,079
So,

190
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:46,953
whether I'm home or not,
there's no big difference.

191
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,120
We're not that much different.

192
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,653
I'm surprised, you know.

193
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,160
When you said you're friends
with the Calderioz members.

194
00:15:58,513 --> 00:15:59,633
Why?

195
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,120
I didn't expect it.

196
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,160
My Mom was worried about bike gangs.

197
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Because of their bad image?

198
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,120
Well, it depends on the gang.

199
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,846
But after listening to your stories,

200
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,483
your friends are good people.

201
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,040
They are very good people.

202
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,280
A far cry from that nasty news.

203
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
How did it go?

204
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,640
I heard there was a clarification video?

205
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,083
That's right.

206
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:34,107
Here's the story.

207
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,480
There's a bad person who intentionally
smeared Calderioz's name.

208
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,600
I thought

209
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,120
Calderioz was really going to split.

210
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:47,005
Thank God that didnít happen.

211
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,640
Well, I'm impressed by Ares.

212
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,840
He's

213
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,080
great at managing his members.

214
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:01,027
Even Aiden respected him.

215
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,960
Sorry.

216
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,960
What's wrong?

217
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,836
(Zea: Guys, take a look at this)

218
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,763
(Stop or Die!)

219
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,080
Do you remember

220
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:26,327
at the Gala,

221
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,179
someone vandalized the car
with the writing...

222
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,480
Stop or Die?

223
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,280
Yes, "Stop or Die".

224
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,880
That person terrorized Zea directly.

225
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,253
He broke Zea's window.

226
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:43,739
Oh, my God. I'm so worried

227
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,960
that they'll do much worse than this.

228
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,000
Let me drop you home, please.

229
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm worried.

230
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:53,627
Okay?

231
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:00,951
You want me to send you the notes?

232
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:03,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

233
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:05,853
Baby. Babe.

234
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:10,646
Give me a minute to talk to you. Please.

235
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:14,483
- No.
- Babe!

236
00:18:15,153 --> 00:18:16,193
Oh, dear!

237
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,620
Hello, my single friend.

238
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,366
What are you talking about?

239
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,760
Ardhan, when it comes to romance,

240
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,360
you're the expert.

241
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,720
But if it's about exes,

242
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,000
that's not your specialty.

243
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,633
Do you want to get back with Karissa?

244
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,400
You don't need to ask.
Of course I want that.

245
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,400
So, will you follow my advice?

246
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:51,967
- What?
- But,

247
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:54,294
you have to do everything I say.

248
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:56,291
Just say it!

249
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:04,872
Are you crazy? There's no way
I can do that!

250
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,200
- I'll be embarrassed.
- Then you don't want to be with her.

251
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,440
Do you want to get back with her?

252
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
Did you read our group chat?

253
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,840
Poor Zea. The terror is spreading.

254
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,640
It's horrible.

255
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,640
I can't stop thinking about it.

256
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,120
They attacked her house.

257
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,880
Is this the risk
of dating a motorbike gang member?

258
00:19:49,506 --> 00:19:52,806
What if we accompany her?
Since she lives alone with her maid.

259
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:54,800
The house won't be as quiet
if we stay there.

260
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,520
Can you stay the night there?

261
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,600
I can. I also live alone anyway.

262
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,960
I need to ask for permission.

263
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,360
You know how my parents are.

264
00:20:04,627 --> 00:20:05,747
I can.

265
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,000
How come you're being
loyal to your friend?

266
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,040
Make up, please.

267
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
Don't ignore each other for too long.

268
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,600
I am loyal.

269
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,440
Pfft!

270
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,680
I even willingly became single
to accompany you.

271
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,360
I didn't ask for that.
I have Serra for that.

272
00:20:31,486 --> 00:20:34,486
Serra is with Jayden now.
You just don't know it yet.

273
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,880
No, you're talking nonsense.

274
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,040
Not yet.

275
00:20:40,064 --> 00:20:41,640
"Not yet"?

276
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,920
So, you'll be with him?

277
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,120
To my fellow beloved Derlangga students,

278
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:59,366
I have an important announcement today!

279
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,520
Is everybody here already?

280
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,200
We're here!

281
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:07,093
Okay!

282
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,320
On this bright day,

283
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,040
I want to declare something!

284
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,013
That I

285
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:22,606
can't live without Karissa Andromeda!

286
00:21:26,113 --> 00:21:28,353
Aka "My Baby".

287
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
Why am I standing here?

288
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,520
Because I want you all to be my witness

289
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,360
that I can't live without Karissa.

290
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,440
- Do you all understand?
- We do.

291
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:06,226
Baby.

292
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,879
You know I can't live without you.

293
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,840
So, please.

294
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,520
Be my girlfriend again, okay?

295
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,420
Baby!

296
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,520
Ardhan.

297
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,800
It was only your first try.

298
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:37,739
Am I right?

299
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,140
Do you know how embarrassed I am?

300
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,547
This was your idea.

301
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,800
I know you're embarrassed,
but at least you tried.

302
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,119
- We'll try again. I have a lot...
- No.

303
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,986
There's no need for that.

304
00:22:55,105 --> 00:22:56,692
We're having a meeting
at the base tonight.

305
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,820
Any update?

306
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,447
I'll let you know later.

307
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,540
When will he stop saying "later"?

308
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,120
Can you shut your mouth?

309
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,120
Relax.

310
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,440
Aeros told me to go back to Bandung.

311
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,760
He's worried about
the situation in Jakarta.

312
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,680
But,

313
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,640
I will try my best to stay here.

314
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
Let's solve this together.

315
00:23:39,447 --> 00:23:40,487
Zea.

316
00:23:41,546 --> 00:23:44,386
I don't want you to be in danger again.

317
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,840
Ares, what are you talking about?

318
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:51,299
I was involved with a bike gang
before I knew you.

319
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:53,606
This isn't danger.

320
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,680
This is my world.

321
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,040
Zea.

322
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:01,539
Ares, I'm staying here

323
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,440
with you.

324
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,880
Ares, let's go to the class.

325
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,040
The teacher's here.
The class is going to start soon.

326
00:24:09,966 --> 00:24:11,046
Just go first.

327
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,240
Okay. Don't be late,
our teacher's waiting.

328
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,360
Why is she so annoying?

329
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,165
Don't mind her. As long as
she's not bothering us,

330
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:29,320
just ignore her.

331
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,870
We can't. The more we ignore her,

332
00:24:32,894 --> 00:24:34,440
the more annoying she'll be.

333
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:36,025
You have to...

334
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,166
Zea?

335
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,160
What?

336
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,480
What?

337
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:45,339
Jealous?

338
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:47,613
No.

339
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:50,670
- What are you talking about?
- What's wrong, Babe?

340
00:24:55,547 --> 00:24:56,827
What's your favorite drink?

341
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,680
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

342
00:25:00,986 --> 00:25:02,146
I just want to know.

343
00:25:04,773 --> 00:25:05,973
Watermelon juice.

344
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,487
Wait, why are you still here?

345
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,880
You don't want to go back to Bandung,

346
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,680
so I'm staying here.

347
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,899
You're exaggerating.

348
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:25,040
Where's Ares?
Why didn't he drop you home?

349
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,706
He dropped me home

350
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,280
but he went straight to the base.

351
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,033
This is our only clue.

352
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,146
(Labos Helmet)

353
00:25:37,853 --> 00:25:39,733
There's only one custom helmet shop.

354
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,156
And it's likely

355
00:25:44,616 --> 00:25:45,840
connected to

356
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:55,846
Wolves?

357
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,400
Is Radit a Wolves member?

358
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,020
We don't know yet.

359
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,680
Whichever gang he is a member of,

360
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,661
we already know he's the perpetrator.

361
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:14,793
We know the location and the person.

362
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,120
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's just attack.

363
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,040
Didn't you learn your lesson?

364
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:21,747
The person's right in front of us.

365
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,480
Have you forgotten
how your attack ended up?

366
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,810
But it has been proven
that someone was recording it

367
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,711
- Someone...
- That's why I'm avoiding it.

368
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:36,426
You're too afraid to take action.

369
00:26:37,327 --> 00:26:39,607
I'm thinking about the strategy.

370
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,063
It's time your "we'll see" principal
is changed into "what will we do".

371
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,280
Just attack first.

372
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:49,647
Enough.

373
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,160
We better divide our tasks.

374
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,360
We know that Ares is best
at building a strategy.

375
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,680
And Richie is good at attacking.

376
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,240
But only if there's a strategy.

377
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,419
Richie.

378
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,733
The attack the other day was cool.

379
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,520
But it had no strategy at all.

380
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,680
So, we better divide our tasks.

381
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:23,152
Moreo, Richie, and I

382
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,080
will do a stakeout around Labos.

383
00:27:27,366 --> 00:27:28,526
If there's something,

384
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,880
Richie will act.

385
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,600
Moreo will contact Ares.

386
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,840
And I

387
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,720
will make sure no one escapes.

388
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,780
Because we're still lacking information,

389
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,373
you will be with Megan

390
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,360
to find the information out there, Ares.

391
00:27:50,593 --> 00:27:52,713
Ask Wolves, anywhere.

392
00:27:54,092 --> 00:27:55,946
We need to find out
the mastermind behind this.

393
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:00,493
Everybody agrees?

394
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,280
- Agree.
- Agree.

395
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,613
I agree with Ardhan.

396
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,339
Me too.

397
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:41,973
Hey!

398
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,480
There's nothing out there.
Calm down.

399
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,200
I was just looking around.

400
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,880
Haven't you slept yet?

401
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,760
Not yet. We're still chatting.

402
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,440
Why are you smiling?

403
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,000
What? I can't smile,
I can't be mad either.

404
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:40,607
You can't have her, she's someone else's.

405
00:29:40,932 --> 00:29:42,052
Who?

406
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:43,459
Moreo?

407
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,820
It's not official yet.

408
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,480
So,

409
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,640
someone is waiting
for certainty from Moreo?

410
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,280
Zea, why did you tell them?
I don't like this!

411
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,320
I will not be his girlfriend. Never.

412
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,800
Why?

413
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,360
Right, why not?

414
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,640
Why should I?

415
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,543
Just because we're Calz Angels,

416
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,910
do we have to be with Calderioz members?

417
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:16,726
Serra?

418
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,682
She's with Jayden.

419
00:30:18,706 --> 00:30:20,216
I know you like Jayden.

420
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,503
Stop it. Here's the thing, Selina.

421
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,933
If Moreo asks you to be his girlfriend,

422
00:30:25,034 --> 00:30:26,034
what will you do?

423
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,560
Will you say yes?

424
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,696
She's thinking about it!

425
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:36,280
It's obvious you like him.
You're just too proud to admit it.

426
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,800
Let's stop this.

427
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,600
She's sulking.

428
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,732
(Moreo: If the perpetrator comes out,
I'll finish him)

429
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,898
(Selina: All by yourself?)

430
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,599
(Moreo: Yes, easy peasy)

431
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:11,746
- Were you peeking?
- No.

432
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,040
You're sick, you know that?

433
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,859
Didn't they teach you manners in New York?

434
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
- Calm down.
- Manners!

435
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,480
- Calm down.
- Calm down? Are you crazy?

436
00:31:24,013 --> 00:31:25,093
Can you shut your mouth?

437
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:27,653
Do you want us to get caught?

438
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,360
(Ardhan: Babe, I miss you)

439
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,000
What?

440
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,973
What is it?

441
00:31:39,707 --> 00:31:41,347
Moreo is going to catch the perpetrator.

442
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,480
- Now?
- Yes, he's chatting with me about it.

443
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,613
You two are chatting. Lovebirds!

444
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:39,266
- Serra.
- Zea.

445
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,520
Can't sleep?

446
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,379
Since no one's home,

447
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,613
I've been having a hard time sleeping.

448
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,360
Quiet, isn't it?

449
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:53,139
Very.

450
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,800
It feels like

451
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,200
I'm all alone in this world.

452
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,280
Although I have Jayden,

453
00:33:11,286 --> 00:33:12,926
sometimes something is

454
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,000
missing.

455
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,423
I still miss Aiden once in a while.

456
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,659
Am I being cruel to Jayden?

457
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,880
The important thing
is that you've come clean to Jayden.

458
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,920
Jayden knows about Aiden, doesn't he?

459
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:31,185
He knows.

460
00:33:31,286 --> 00:33:34,160
Sometimes I tell him stories about Aiden.

461
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:39,607
Well, then he knows the risk.

462
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,360
Why are they taking so long?

463
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:11,626
Babe.

464
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:14,893
Babe, hang on. Please.

465
00:34:22,013 --> 00:34:23,253
We've broken up, Ardhan.

466
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,040
But I can't, Babe.

467
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,240
No more "Babe".
