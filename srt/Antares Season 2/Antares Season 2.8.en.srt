It's for Serra.
If you want, just ask Moreo.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,120
Why should I ask him?

13
00:00:48,146 --> 00:00:49,620
It's okay, Selina!

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,480
Zea, here.

15
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:52,933
It's only a cake.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,320
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:57,256
Rest assured, I didn't read it.

18
00:00:57,573 --> 00:00:59,000
I trust you.

19
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,866
I need to go.

20
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,266
- The cake's cute.
- Girls, Moreo, I'm leaving.

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,760
- Bye.
- Where are you going?

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey!

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,080
Wait, why is she smiling?

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,301
(Zea, are you okay?)

25
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:33,929
(I didn't mean to hit you the other day)

26
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,140
(I miss you too)

27
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:36,540
(I'm grounded, the internet's down,
and we can only communicate like this)

28
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,085
(Take care, I love you)

29
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,101
(Ares)

30
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,413
I love you more, Ares.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,960
Ardhan is different from Ares.

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,440
They have a lot of disagreements. Right?

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,880
- That's right.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,920
That's why I want us to make a move.

35
00:01:59,493 --> 00:02:01,373
We can't just stand still following Ares.

36
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:04,513
You read it yourself in the group chat
that Delasga is on a break.

37
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,240
Where's Ardhan going?

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,840
He's acting suspicious.
Do you realize that?

40
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,400
It's as if he's avoiding us.

41
00:02:32,482 --> 00:02:35,486
- Don't make baseless accusation.
- That's all you've been saying.

42
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,040
It gives me a headache, you know?

43
00:02:38,446 --> 00:02:40,966
Ares isn't here. Delasga is on a break.

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,720
We're scattered.

45
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:48,200
Boys, we're going to the base later.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,840
- Delasga is on a break.
- We know.

47
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:54,646
Then come. You're still
in the Calderioz, aren't you?

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
Or Mom won't let you out?

49
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Your phone got confiscated? Is that it?

50
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,280
Bye, boys.

51
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,206
If he's the one, I'll beat him up.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,680
I hope Ardhan isn't influenced by him.

53
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,400
Forget it. Let's go.

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,000
- You have to be better this time. Okay?
- Okay.

55
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,560
- Okay, Karissa, let's try again.
- Okay.

56
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:28,812
Okay, open your legs.

57
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,166
Deeper stare, change your expressions.

58
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,360
Ready? One, two...

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,240
Yes. Laugh freely. Nice!

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,600
One, two...

61
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:44,653
Nice! Okay! One, two...

62
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,760
Nice!

63
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,760
How was it? Great?

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,240
Great! The shots are amazing!

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,560
You're so good at finding talent.

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
Her star aura is shining brightly.

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,960
- Karissa, good job.
- Thank you so much.

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,440
- Happy?
- Happy.

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,880
Don't be happy too soon.

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,800
Someone's looking for a female talent
for a movie.

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,240
Would you like to do the audition?

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,600
Okay.

73
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,320
Alright, then. Get ready.

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Don't forget, practice your acting
from now on.

75
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
Okay. I'm going to leave.

76
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,611
(Babe, sorry we have to
cancel tonight's dinner)

77
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:41,379
(I have things to do)

78
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,960
(Sorry, I'll make it up
to you tomorrow, promise)

79
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,406
Dear Ares.

80
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:01,579
There's something I need to tell you.

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,880
This is important.

82
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,320
I've confirmed this with Eros.

83
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,400
It's true, Delasga is on a break.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,880
(Delasga is on a break)

85
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,960
Where's everyone?

86
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,880
We were told to come to the base,
but no one's here.

87
00:05:37,053 --> 00:05:38,133
Weird, isn't it?

88
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,960
They both didn't come.

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,160
Yet, who told us to come?

90
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,013
"Don't make baseless accusation".

91
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,406
What that brings us?

92
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,520
You're gaming too much.

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,560
Just be a gamer,
not a bike gang member.

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
Moreo, Megan.

95
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:58,231
I saw Ardhan and Richie's motorbikes
on the street.

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,360
- Where?
- Near the Gala Dinner's building.

97
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,453
See?

98
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,220
What did I tell you?

99
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
It's a mess.

100
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,680
Babe, here's your drink.

101
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,280
Thanks.

102
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,599
Babe.

103
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,120
I'm sorry about yesterday.

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,600
It's okay.

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,640
I haven't seen Megan and Moreo
since yesterday.

106
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,379
Where are they?

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,160
Everyone's just busy
with their own things.

108
00:06:47,433 --> 00:06:49,513
Because Ares is suspended,

109
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,360
Calderioz is scattered, isn't it?

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,000
No, we're not.

111
00:06:57,826 --> 00:06:58,866
Babe.

112
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,480
While Ares is suspended,

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,280
Calderioz is in my hands.

114
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,400
I don't want to disappoint the guys.

115
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,203
I have to show them

116
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,960
that I can catch the person behind this.

117
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,840
You support me, don't you?

118
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,150
Of course.

119
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:20,813
Is anyone against you?

120
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,600
Well, none.

121
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
But as his deputy,

122
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,246
I feel like Ares
doesn't respect me anymore.

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,640
He always turns down my suggestions.

124
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,760
I feel like we have different visions.

125
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,120
But Ares is still Calderioz's leader.

126
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,800
He is the legitimate leader.

127
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,163
But I can prove

128
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:50,540
that I can handle Calderioz's problems.

129
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:55,907
Babe.

130
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,520
Is it okay if I leave you for a bit
and take care of some things?

131
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,480
It's okay.

132
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,320
But we're going out tonight, aren't we?

133
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,440
That's the thing, Babe.

134
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:12,786
I have a meeting today
and I need to go to the base.

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,320
Delasga is on a break
and I don't want Calderioz to falter.

136
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,673
Babe.

137
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,020
Okay?

138
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
Okay.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
Babe, I can promise you.

140
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,040
After all of this,

141
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:35,339
we're going to hang out
like we used to. We're going...

142
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Babe, it's okay.

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,740
Just take care of all of your problems

144
00:08:39,847 --> 00:08:41,727
and don't make any promises, okay?

145
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,733
Who's that? Jayden?

146
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,080
It's lovely to see you like this.
He looks nice.

147
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,440
He is nice.

148
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,960
But...

149
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,760
Is it normal

150
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:18,486
that I often feel guilty towards Aiden?

151
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,200
It's normal.

152
00:09:22,993 --> 00:09:26,439
What's important is
that you ask yourself,

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,080
Are you happy?

154
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,160
With Jayden?

155
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,760
I don't even know.

156
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:40,928
We've only been chatting for a while.

157
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,360
You're right. Just go with it for now.

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,487
But one thing is for sure,

159
00:09:48,587 --> 00:09:51,760
Aiden is happy to see you happy.

160
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,400
Thank you, Zea.

161
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,640
Thank you.

162
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,960
Your love letter is here, Zea.

163
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,400
Sorry, Zea.

164
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,800
There's no letter today from Ares.

165
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,680
I went to his house.

166
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,920
I waited for 15 minutes,
but he didn't come out.

167
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,280
Sorry.

168
00:10:23,047 --> 00:10:24,807
It's okay, Cleo. It's not your fault.

169
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,520
Ares!

170
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
Did you just wake up?

171
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,000
Mr. Sal is waiting.

172
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,120
- Hurry and get ready!
- Yes, Mom.

173
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,200
Oh, dear!

174
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,440
Hurry!

175
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:09,953
Do you need help with something?

176
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,000
No, Sir.

177
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:13,566
You can do it?

178
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,960
Certainly.

179
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,767
Don't sound so snob, boy.

180
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,760
Someone told me
to go to the base yesterday,

181
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,520
but he didn't even come.

182
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,640
Where were you two?

183
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,110
Who told you I was with him?

184
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,240
Drop the act.

185
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:46,163
I had a sudden business.

186
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,880
What business? Is it that important?

187
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,200
You do have an important matter
with Ardhan, right?

188
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,560
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

189
00:11:56,273 --> 00:12:00,113
The others saw you two parked
near the gala building.

190
00:12:01,071 --> 00:12:03,499
You didn't come to the gala,
but you were there.

191
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,160
And you were there with Richie!

192
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:09,840
Moreo, why are you
involving Richie in this?

193
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,979
It's tacky.

194
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,160
Anya, don't meddle in this. Okay?

195
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,040
Just mind your face!

196
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:18,952
Why are you mad at me?

197
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,960
Richie, are you okay?

198
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,760
Be honest, what's going on?

199
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,500
What are you talking about?

200
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,240
Moreo, stop it.

201
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,960
No, Megan. He needs to hear this.

202
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,706
It's you, isn't it?

203
00:12:36,693 --> 00:12:37,800
The one who set this up.

204
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,400
You didn't come to the gala,
but you both were there last night.

205
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,170
You're both are getting weirder.

206
00:12:44,273 --> 00:12:45,600
You're getting suspicious.

207
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,020
Do you want to take Calderioz down?

208
00:12:49,327 --> 00:12:51,807
- So, you're accusing me?
- Moreo, stop it!

209
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:53,966
Moreo, this isn't right.

210
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,436
Answer me.

211
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:00,727
What were you two doing?

212
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,280
Do I have to tell you?

213
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,249
Answer me if you
don't want to be suspected.

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,160
I don't know anything.

215
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,473
But you and Richie
made a move on your own.

216
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,563
You even need to look at each other first
before you answer?

217
00:13:24,936 --> 00:13:26,120
You're amazing.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,080
Listen.

219
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,850
We checked the CCTV at the gala.

220
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,320
Why?

221
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,896
Because Ares can't do this.

222
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,880
You know he's suspended.

223
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,840
And what are you going to do?
Do nothing?

224
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,579
How could you accuse me, Moreo?

225
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:49,706
You were the one
who didn't come to the base.

226
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:52,903
Just so you know,

227
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,642
I went to the base

228
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,886
to search for a way
to catch these bastards!

229
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,186
Let me ask you, then.

230
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:08,952
Where were you two?

231
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,360
Enough, Ardhan.

232
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,760
Are you having a stomach ache?

233
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:35,246
No, Sir.

234
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,320
Then why are you looking at the bathroom?
Do your work.

235
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,200
The bathroom isn't going anywhere,
stop looking at it.

236
00:14:46,893 --> 00:14:47,973
Here it is.

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,040
Thanks.

238
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,680
What's wrong?

239
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,080
Do you have a lot on your mind?

240
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,480
Do I look like I am?

241
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,120
May I sit?

242
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,720
Of course.

243
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,800
I noticed you're often alone.

244
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,480
You rarely come with your friends.

245
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,640
They're busy.

246
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,840
Because they're dating the Calderioz guys.

247
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
"Calderioz"?

248
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,760
That's right. Calderioz.

249
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,563
Especially with a lot of bad news

250
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,360
surrounding bike gangs lately.

251
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,000
My friends have to
support their boyfriends.

252
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,667
What about you?

253
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,600
Are you dating one of them?

254
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:43,653
I used to.

255
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,600
But not anymore.

256
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:51,946
Oh, right.

257
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,680
If you're lonely,

258
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,120
you can come here anytime.

259
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,600
- Thank you.
- Okay.

260
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:02,076
Hey.

261
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:03,960
Do you want to learn how to make a cake?

262
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,556
"Cake"?

263
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:09,207
- I can't.
- You can.

264
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,120
You have me here.

265
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,520
Okay. It sounds interesting.

266
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,220
Come on.

267
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,840
Here, let me show you how.

268
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,720
Okay.

269
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,160
Pour it, just a little.

270
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
Then mix it slowly.

271
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,320
Tenderly.

272
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,080
- Like this?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
- Sorry. Yeah.
- It has to be like that?

274
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,660
Jayden!

275
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,280
You.

276
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,320
Today, I just saw

277
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,520
how Calderioz is without its leader.

278
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,480
I heard

279
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Ardhan and Moreo fighting.

280
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,960
They were accusing one another
for the gala dinner incident.

281
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,800
I miss you, Ares.

282
00:17:49,199 --> 00:17:50,499
Seeing that scene

283
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:53,680
reminded me of Eros and Lionel in Wolves.

284
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,212
I'm worried that without you,

285
00:17:57,313 --> 00:17:58,920
Calderioz will crumble.

286
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,316
But I'm still looking for a way

287
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,340
to get through all of this.

288
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,280
Please come back soon, Ares.

289
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,187
Everyone's lost without you.

290
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,680
Including me.

291
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:25,267
Mom.

292
00:18:25,893 --> 00:18:26,933
Hey!

293
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,560
Have you eaten yet?

294
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,400
It's a question, Ares. Answer it.

295
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,200
I need to go, Mom.

296
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,920
What do you mean?

297
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,800
You're still suspended.

298
00:18:45,633 --> 00:18:46,953
Have you forgotten?

299
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:48,759
Mom.

300
00:18:49,566 --> 00:18:50,846
This is important.

301
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,360
Ares.

302
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,687
Learning to follow the rules
is also important.

303
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,880
What happened?

304
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,400
Have you contemplated your mistakes?

305
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,200
Have you found what you really want

306
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,320
and what is your focus?

307
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:20,046
What?

308
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,000
What's your priority?

309
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,040
To study, not the bike gang.

310
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,240
The things you do.

311
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,000
Have you eaten yet?

312
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,446
I have.

313
00:19:41,886 --> 00:19:44,139
We can't deal with this without Ares.

314
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,327
Move!

315
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:48,779
Look at this.

316
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,360
See?

317
00:19:52,553 --> 00:19:53,593
Your turn.

318
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,463
Have you ever seen

319
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,280
this kind of disunity?

320
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,240
Moreo.

321
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,840
What's wrong with the guys?

322
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,120
What the hell?

323
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:17,520
Get these up!

324
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,120
- Hey!
- Hey, you bastard!

325
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,680
- Ardhan!
- Ardhan!

326
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,440
Ardhan!

327
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,560
Ardhan!

328
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,646
Bastard!

329
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,080
Red motorbike, Calderioz's jacket.

330
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,840
Just like what you told me.

331
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
Are you still going to accuse me?

332
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:29,803
Ardhan.

333
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:31,193
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,296
(Stop or die!)

335
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,000
They're belittling us.
Do you realize that?

336
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,040
- What are we waiting for?
- Hey.

337
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,720
But still,

338
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,040
we can't be reckless.

339
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,160
I'm not reckless, I've thought about it.

340
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,280
What are you thinking about?

341
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,160
Nothing.

342
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,840
You're frowning.

343
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,240
What are you thinking about?

344
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,440
I'm not thinking about anything.

345
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Let's go in.

346
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,040
Megan.

347
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,760
Please tell me if there's anything.

348
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:09,726
Okay.

349
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,460
Come on.

350
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,120
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three.

351
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

352
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,440
Step, step, step. Turn around.

353
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,400
Stop.

354
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,600
What's wrong?

355
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,000
- I'm going to sit for a while.
- Can you walk?

356
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,800
Slowly.

357
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,680
Come here.

358
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
- It hurts so much.
- I'm going to massage it, okay?

359
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,080
Okay.

360
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:39,665
- Be gentle.
- Okay, I'll be gentle.

361
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,280
Is the movement too hard?

362
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,752
Not really.

363
00:23:43,853 --> 00:23:45,840
But, I once fell in the past.

364
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,686
That time you were with Ares and Richie?

365
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:50,859
Yeah.

366
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,680
What if we change the movement?

367
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,600
Let's change it, so everyone can do it.

368
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,920
I agree. That part is hard to learn.

369
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
That's only because you're not focused.

370
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,760
Take a break.
We're going to practice without you.

371
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,100
Is it okay?

372
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,640
It is. Don't make it worse.

373
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,380
Sorry, guys.

374
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,920
I can replace Cleo's position.

375
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
How about that? I remember the movements.

376
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,080
Like this, right?

377
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,040
- Like that?
- Nope. Wrong.

378
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,640
- It's wrong?
- Dead wrong.

379
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,600
Okay, we're going to practice first.

380
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,160
- Okay.
- But you make the movements.

381
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,560
You're the dance leader,
not a model leader.

382
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,400
- Okay.
- That's "trught".

383
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,720
True and right. Trught.

384
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,680
So, it's trught.

385
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,960
Thank God. Finally, someone's treating me.

386
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,920
This is all I can treat you.

387
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,800
My way of saying thank you
for bringing the speaker.

388
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,280
Chill.

389
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,480
When was the last time you drank?

390
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,920
Take it slow.

391
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:15,726
- Chill.
- So refreshing!

392
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,240
Just like breaking a fast.

393
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,600
Does Ares know Calderioz base
was attacked last night?

394
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,080
Not yet.

395
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,350
I don't know.

396
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
I'm pissed.

397
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,200
Everyone's doing their own things.
That's not cool.

398
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,320
Aiden's gone, Laskar too.

399
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,520
And now Ares is suspended.

400
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,480
It feels really different
without Ares, doesn't it?

401
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,480
If you can feel that,
imagine how Calderioz feels.

402
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,080
This one has more in it.

403
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,480
I think that's
the best step for Calderioz.

404
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,120
But don't act arbitrarily.

405
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:11,893
I have put my trust on you.

406
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
So, we have a deal, right?

407
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,700
Deal.

408
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,040
Some of the Calderioz guys have agreed.

409
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,600
I'll handle Megan and Moreo.

410
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,880
Hi, Zea.

411
00:26:41,513 --> 00:26:42,673
You haven't gone home yet?

412
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,080
I haven't.

413
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,440
A letter for Ares?

414
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,313
What are you talking about?

415
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Chill.

416
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:56,766
I was joking.

417
00:26:58,273 --> 00:26:59,353
I'm leaving, okay?

418
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,920
- That hurts!
- It's really you?

419
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,640
- I miss you!
- I miss you, too.

420
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,937
What should I do

421
00:27:59,037 --> 00:28:01,080
to make you forgive me?

422
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,760
I slapped you
because I thought I was dreaming.

423
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,040
Was there no other way
besides slapping me?

424
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,680
What other way?

425
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,760
Anything.

426
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,520
A kiss, maybe.

427
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,320
Don't pretend to sulk.

428
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:28,353
Do you forgive me?

429
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,840
Such a big glass.

430
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,763
Thanks.

431
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:42,843
Finally!

432
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:46,606
My favorite power couple
is together again!

433
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,360
Oh, please.

434
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,440
What do you want me to cook for you?

435
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,040
Fried rice, sunny-side up, noodles?

436
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,633
Or do you want
salted egg yolk-flavored

437
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,040
fish skin crackers?

438
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,200
Oh, dear.

439
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,160
You don't need to prepare anything.

440
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,200
No? It's quite a trouble anyway.

441
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,833
Okay then.

442
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:12,526
I'll head back to the kitchen.

443
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,993
You can continue.

444
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,846
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

445
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,480
How are you here?

446
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,800
I miss Oji's cooking.

447
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,400
Of course.

448
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,560
We're here.

449
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,200
See you during the break.

450
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,280
Bye.

451
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,480
Ardhan won't work by himself.

452
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,800
He'll get help from
his commander-in-chief.

453
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,280
"Commander-in-chief"?

454
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,480
Here's the thing.

455
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,360
While you were suspended,

456
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,440
I appointed Richie as
our commander-in-chief.

457
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,600
What the hell?

458
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,400
Why didn't you tell me?

459
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,720
You weren't at the base.

460
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,800
I was at the base,
but you two weren't here.

461
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,833
You told me to come,
but you weren't here.

462
00:30:21,933 --> 00:30:23,320
I don't even know what you were doing.

463
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Whatever you investigated,
I don't even know.

464
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:28,012
What are you talking about?
Don't exaggerate...

465
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,080
Who permitted you to take such an action?

466
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,840
Ares.

467
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,320
You entrusted Calderioz to me.

468
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,440
Of course, I have to...

469
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,600
Ares!

470
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,920
Listen to him, bro.
Do you want to be suspended again?

471
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,440
Nobody asked you to speak.

472
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,947
Ardhan and I did all your duties

473
00:30:51,047 --> 00:30:53,560
while you were suspended.

474
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,760
And this is how you thank us?

475
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:07,650
(To Be Continued)
