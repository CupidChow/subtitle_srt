1
00:00:29,745 --> 00:00:35,220
(Previously on season 1)

2
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,357
Apologize to me now!

3
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:42,562
Not that easy!

4
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,110
I don't know if it's you or I
who should be careful.

5
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,114
Don't trust Ares.

6
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:53,192
He just doesn't want rival gangs to
outshine his gang.

7
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:55,881
He's also the reason why
your brother is in a coma.

8
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:04,396
Ares is the best person
I've ever known.

9
00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:08,089
He always defend the gang.

10
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:12,690
He never lets anyone
suffer any difficulties.

11
00:01:18,797 --> 00:01:20,490
Aiden!

12
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,395
Don't defend her
just because you like her.

13
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:37,003
What if she really did it?

14
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,013
- It's not my...
- Hypocrite!

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,347
I did all of that

16
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:43,582
to destroy Calderioz.

17
00:01:43,731 --> 00:01:45,251
Because Calderioz

18
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:47,181
put Eros in a coma.

19
00:01:47,261 --> 00:01:49,076
Lio is behind all this.

20
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:52,268
He tried to harm me and Ares.

21
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:54,401
And he pit

22
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:55,727
Retro against Calderioz.

23
00:01:57,558 --> 00:02:01,198
Is it true that you were the one
who gave the order to hurt me and Ares?

24
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:02,886
Answer me!

25
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:06,074
There are enemies amongst the Wolves.

26
00:02:06,534 --> 00:02:07,534
What do you mean?

27
00:02:09,252 --> 00:02:11,276
You're saying that Lio is behind all this?

28
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,211
You're all idiots!

29
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:03,399
- Good evening, everyone.
- Evening.

30
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:06,903
After all we've been through,

31
00:05:08,493 --> 00:05:11,533
I never dreamt that we can finally
all be here together.

32
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,523
Wolves.

33
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,642
Delasga.

34
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:20,186
Retro.

35
00:05:22,413 --> 00:05:23,973
And Calderioz.

36
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:29,363
This is what I'd been dreaming of.

37
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
And it's now

38
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,639
coming true.

39
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:38,135
All thanks to Antares.

40
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:39,426
Antares!

41
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:43,530
Ares!

42
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:49,799
- Thank you, Ares.
- Sure, man.

43
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,232
(Mom)

44
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,456
My effort will not end here.

45
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,970
This is just the beginning.

46
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,599
And I hope in the end,

47
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,535
all of the bike gangs can unite as one

48
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,373
and have firm solidarity.

49
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,533
No more fighting,

50
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,761
and no more tearing each other down.

51
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,071
Because we're all equal.

52
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:20,563
Wolves!

53
00:06:22,253 --> 00:06:23,483
Calderioz!

54
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,670
Retro!

55
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,799
Delasga!

56
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,766
One more thing.

57
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,136
And I'm going to do it

58
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,163
in front of you guys.

59
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,156
As the 30th Calderioz leader,

60
00:06:41,446 --> 00:06:43,512
I saw how you united

61
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:45,785
all the bike gangs.

62
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,283
It’s time for you

63
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:49,250
to take up on this responsibility.

64
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:56,890
Take this.

65
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,596
Take good care of this.

66
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,596
This is your moment.

67
00:07:29,086 --> 00:07:30,459
Thanks, man.

68
00:07:54,253 --> 00:07:55,543
Wait!

69
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:56,959
We haven't took pictures yet!

70
00:07:57,413 --> 00:08:00,453
Come on, let's take a selfie.

71
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:01,566
Come on.

72
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,800
Let's do it.

73
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:06,007
That hurts, bro.

74
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,373
One, two,...

75
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:11,773
Who's this?

76
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:15,948
Hello?

77
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,403
Good evening, Auntie.

78
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,276
It's your mom!

79
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,010
- Yeah, we're...
- Why did you pick up?

80
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,700
Mama's boy.

81
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:27,527
Hello, Mom?

82
00:08:28,898 --> 00:08:30,365
I'll be home after this.

83
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Yeah.

84
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,714
Yeah.

85
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,493
Okay, bye.

86
00:08:43,252 --> 00:08:44,495
Everything's alright, mama's boy?

87
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:46,630
I have to leave.

88
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,266
- Is it okay?
- Sure thing.

89
00:08:50,093 --> 00:08:51,653
Are you leaving, mama's boy?

90
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:54,738
- You're not taking pictures with us?
- I'm out.

91
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:57,499
Suit yourself. Drive safe.

92
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
Yeah.

93
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:24,156
(Do not attempt to do this act)

94
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,453
Help! Help me!

95
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,762
Are you okay?

96
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,492
I'm fine.

97
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,483
(Stop or Die!)

98
00:09:56,533 --> 00:09:57,963
Coward!

99
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:06,927
Welcome to Slice of Happiness.

100
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:08,775
Thank you.

101
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,200
Zea, look!

102
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,573
Zea! Oh, my God!

103
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,230
I want this one.

104
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:19,684
Yeah, let's sit first.

105
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,303
Selina, let's go.

106
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:25,876
You look so happy.

107
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,453
Well, what do you think?

108
00:10:29,533 --> 00:10:32,213
Isn't it perfect for Calz Angels base?

109
00:10:32,653 --> 00:10:34,299
We have our own base?

110
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:36,451
Is that our gang's name?

111
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:37,905
What do you want, then?

112
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,222
Calz Devils?

113
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,043
- Calcium?
- Yeah, right.

114
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:43,663
What do you think, Zea?

115
00:10:44,656 --> 00:10:45,829
I'm okay with everything.

116
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,595
But this means Zea will be super busy.

117
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:51,650
She's the capo wolves,

118
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:53,752
the girlfriend of the Calderioz leader.

119
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,216
And now she's a member of Calz Angelz.

120
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,395
It's Calz Angels.

121
00:10:58,496 --> 00:11:00,648
- Calz Angelz!
- There is no "z" in the "Angels"!

122
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,022
Angels!

123
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,899
But I have to give it to you
for picking out this place.

124
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:09,816
So I remembered

125
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,739
a man handed out flyers about this place,
he was gorgeous.

126
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:17,013
- Don't forget, you've got Ardhan.
- But he's not here.

127
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,598
What if he suddenly
appeared from behind?

128
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:20,093
- Are you afraid?
- Don't joke like that.

129
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:26,450
Cleo!

130
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,996
Come here, who are you waiting for?

131
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,013
Just a sec, someone's coming.

132
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,306
Maybe it's Ardhan.

133
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,732
That's why, behave.

134
00:11:42,257 --> 00:12:03,613
(Do not attempt to do this act)

135
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,523
Oh, my God.

136
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:17,653
My intuition tells me
that you're going to date Moreo.

137
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:19,139
Guys!

138
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:22,936
Ladies.

139
00:12:23,037 --> 00:12:26,549
- Richie!
- Richie!

140
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:28,953
It's been so long!

141
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:32,053
- How are you?
- When did you come home?

142
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,630
Just yesterday.

143
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:37,153
I'm still recovering from jet lag,
but I'd do anything for you all.

144
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,458
You're so sweet.

145
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:41,346
By the way, Serra.

146
00:12:43,493 --> 00:12:46,453
I'm sorry for your loss.
He was a good guy.

147
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:47,556
Thank you.

148
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,359
Alright. Shall we?

149
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:51,959
Let's go.

150
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:57,488
By the way, this is Zea.

151
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,543
Zea, this is Richie.

152
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:02,890
(Richie Leonatan)

153
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,424
(Date of Birth: December 9th, 2003)

154
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,569
(Zodiac: Sagittarius)

155
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:07,842
(Character: Where's there commotion,
there's always Richie)

156
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:09,318
Hi.

157
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,535
Nice to meet you.

158
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:13,895
So this is

159
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,101
Ares' Queen?

160
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,976
Let's sit down.

161
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,293
Here comes the employee of the month.

162
00:13:34,373 --> 00:13:37,413
We're just about to order,
and you're here already.

163
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:38,533
Here you go.

164
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:42,133
Welcome to Slice of Happiness.

165
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:44,270
What would you like to order?

166
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:46,203
Today is my day.

167
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:49,565
So, you can have whatever you want.

168
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,813
It's on me, girls.

169
00:13:52,773 --> 00:13:53,973
Really?

170
00:13:54,053 --> 00:13:57,133
Oh, my God! You just made my day!

171
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:58,716
Let's order everything from the menu!

172
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:01,909
Just kidding.

173
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:03,470
Our favorite cakes are

174
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:05,630
the red velvet and the chocolate cake.

175
00:14:06,453 --> 00:14:07,663
But for you,

176
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:10,116
I recommend the green matcha cheesecake.

177
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:12,810
- Okay.
- It's delicious.

178
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:14,869
Want to try it?

179
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:16,553
Sounds good.

180
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:20,333
Were you the guy
who handed out the flyers?

181
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,303
By the way,

182
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:53,156
I met your friend yesterday.

183
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:56,760
- Who?
- Richie.

184
00:15:00,703 --> 00:15:01,703
I want you

185
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,183
to stay away from him.

186
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:05,945
Why?

187
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,199
Please

188
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:09,799
just do as I say.

189
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:11,862
Okay, let's go.

190
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:15,649
What's with him?

191
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,343
You're dating him and
he still keeps secrets from you?

192
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,686
He just need to tell you who he is.

193
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:24,293
Don't overthink it.
He's just being himself.

194
00:15:24,373 --> 00:15:26,379
He'll tell you eventually.

195
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:28,613
I'm not overthinking it.

196
00:15:28,714 --> 00:15:31,593
But If he already does that
from the beginning,

197
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,263
there must be something.

198
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,050
Maybe it's not what you think it is.
Maybe he just...

199
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:40,243
Babe.

200
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:46,838
Students of Derlangga High,

201
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,743
keep in mind that you are all seniors.

202
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,586
The national exams are coming up.

203
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,339
You have to focus on your studies

204
00:15:56,616 --> 00:15:57,872
and not mess around.

205
00:15:58,404 --> 00:16:00,301
You have to uphold

206
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:02,338
this school’s accreditation.

207
00:16:03,151 --> 00:16:05,711
- Are we clear?
- Yes, Sir!

208
00:16:07,773 --> 00:16:10,003
Calderioz.

209
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:12,650
I hope you don't forget

210
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,023
what the principal
said this morning.

211
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:16,943
About the school’s accreditation?

212
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,233
No.

213
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:23,176
It's about the upcoming national exams.

214
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:28,173
You can relax, Sir. We're all over it.

215
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,963
Yeah, Sir. Relax.

216
00:16:30,044 --> 00:16:32,453
We are very confident
we have a bright future.

217
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:36,173
It's so bright,
I need a pair of sunglasses.

218
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,773
- Come on, man.
- I can't see anything. Sir?

219
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,773
- He's still here.
- You're kidding, aren't you?

220
00:16:40,853 --> 00:16:43,493
I am just kidding. Or am I?

221
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:45,949
Do you want a massage
or a cupping therapy perhaps?

222
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,315
Don't do that.

223
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:56,650
What's this?

224
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,806
Is this a chocolate bar?

225
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,459
New York's Chocolate.

226
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:09,626
Who are these from?

227
00:17:13,213 --> 00:17:14,396
Are these from you, Ares?

228
00:17:16,032 --> 00:17:17,156
Nope.

229
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,000
They're from me.

230
00:17:27,686 --> 00:17:29,009
Richie?

231
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,370
Miss me?

232
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:44,750
- That's Aiden's desk.
- Calm down.

233
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,783
Hey, ladies.

234
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:17,496
Hey.

235
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,983
He's out of his mind.

236
00:18:32,446 --> 00:18:34,949
Look at your boyfriends

237
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,050
Creepy.

238
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:38,956
- I'm going to teach him a lesson.
- Calm down, Moreo.

239
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:51,333
If he touches Karissa,
I'm going to kill him.

240
00:19:03,486 --> 00:19:05,437
The bike gangs' reputation
is under attack.

241
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,770
We can't just do nothing.

242
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:09,712
What happened?

243
00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:11,430
Have you seen the news?

244
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:22,332
"A group of guards were attacked
by housewives in Gondangdia"

245
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:23,959
"for turning on the wrong blinkers."

246
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,183
Wrong news.

247
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,816
"A riot was broken up by locals."

248
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,222
"Eleven people were arrested."

249
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:35,933
"Their bikes were impounded."

250
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:40,126
"The bike gang vandalized the place."

251
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:43,579
"Spray paints were found at the location
and collected as evidence."

252
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,290
Damn!

253
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:51,757
Can you shut up?

254
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,670
If you have no business here,
you'd better leave.

255
00:19:55,453 --> 00:19:58,230
Sorry, I won't make any noise again.

256
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:02,013
But this is important.

257
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,270
Where were we?

258
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:09,256
If you read the news completely,

259
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:12,959
it's still not clear whether
the perpetrators are from a bike gang.

260
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:18,213
In that case, what do we care?
Right, guys?

261
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,370
It's the opposite.

262
00:20:19,773 --> 00:20:23,059
I don't want them to make assumptions
that it was done by the bike gang.

263
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:24,999
We have to do something

264
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:27,573
to make the news more neutral.

265
00:20:29,006 --> 00:20:30,883
We can organize a social activity
like Aiden's idea.

266
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:33,765
I think we can do it again.

267
00:20:34,013 --> 00:20:35,608
And for the wall they vandalized,

268
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:38,166
how about we repaint it?

269
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:39,853
Great idea.

270
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,373
I'm going to let the Wolves
and other gangs know about the idea.

271
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:07,110
Oh, dear!

272
00:21:18,613 --> 00:21:20,213
Careful, you'll get hurt.

273
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,492
Aiden?

274
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,023
Aiden?

275
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:31,371
My name is Jayden.

276
00:21:38,372 --> 00:21:39,479
What did you just call me?

277
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,493
Aiden?

278
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:43,533
Nothing. I'm sorry.

279
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:48,373
I'm sorry, I broke the glass.

280
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:49,654
It's okay.

281
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:51,451
Let me clean it up.

282
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,379
Sal.

283
00:21:58,453 --> 00:22:01,910
I'll be right back with
your replacement drink, Serra.

284
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:03,945
How do you know my name?

285
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,299
Or your name is not Serra?

286
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,070
No, you're right. I'm Serra.

287
00:22:10,373 --> 00:22:12,133
I'm just wondering
how did you know my name.

288
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,777
Jayden.

289
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:21,228
Serra.

290
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:48,110
No!

291
00:22:49,194 --> 00:22:50,404
Ares!

292
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:07,926
Ares!

293
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:09,716
Get your own.

294
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,493
It's a gift from Richie.

295
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:18,279
What's going on between you two?

296
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:21,702
I thought you were best friends.

297
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,053
Especially when it involved bikes
and fixing the machines.

298
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,790
You could stay in the garage all day.

299
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,570
I remember he often
slept over at our house.

300
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:34,803
To the point, Mom and Dad
considered him as family.

301
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:39,659
Look, your idol just died.

302
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:41,279
Firman!

303
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:18,572
(Motorcycle gangs help fight vandalism)

304
00:24:18,673 --> 00:24:26,043
(Locals are grateful for the cleanup)

305
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:33,836
I've been curious

306
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:37,246
what kind of girl

307
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,413
could melt Ares' heart.

308
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,130
Sorry.

309
00:24:43,586 --> 00:24:45,738
I don't feel comfortable when you do that.

310
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,019
Why? You don't feel comfortable
when I do this?

311
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:54,216
Okay, chill.

312
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,373
That's how she is, Richie.
She plays hard to get.

313
00:25:00,453 --> 00:25:02,350
That's how Zea is for you.

314
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:04,999
- Excuse me?
- What?

315
00:25:06,653 --> 00:25:08,203
Just because you’re dating Ares,

316
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,366
you feel like a princess?

317
00:25:11,373 --> 00:25:12,790
I just don't like it.

318
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,290
If you like him putting
his arm around you, be my guest. I don't.

319
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,636
Can you leave me out of this?
The whole school already knows...

320
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,110
Enough. Chill.

321
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,233
Don't fight over me.

322
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:27,692
Please.

323
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:29,973
It's not a big deal.

324
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:31,136
- It is!
- It is!

325
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:39,905
What?

326
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,812
Nothing.

327
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:46,850
Amazing, right?

328
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:48,729
Yeah.

329
00:25:49,266 --> 00:25:50,316
Beautiful.

330
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:55,741
I'm talking about the news.

331
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:57,416
Read it for me.

332
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,543
Why? So you can stare at me?

333
00:26:01,853 --> 00:26:03,210
You heard me.

334
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,917
Beautiful.

335
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:09,543
Come again? I didn't hear it.

336
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,722
What?

337
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,773
Fine, then.

338
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:20,210
I'll just go to the sport's hall.

339
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:21,437
Bye.

340
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:24,896
Beautiful!

341
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,219
Guys, I'm bored.

342
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:05,332
I think I need to find
new activities to do.

343
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:09,459
I want my high school years
to be more colorful.

344
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:14,486
Are we not enough
to make your school years more colorful?

345
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:18,872
What more could you want?
Aren't we enough?

346
00:27:18,973 --> 00:27:20,676
That's not what I mean.

347
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,370
I mean, I want to be like Ardhan.

348
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:27,519
He has activities
outside high school life.

349
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:31,373
I just want to be like him.

350
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:37,545
Hello. Excuse me, my darlings.

351
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,219
Here's your speaker.

352
00:27:43,373 --> 00:27:45,173
Since I've brought the speaker,

353
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:47,573
can I watch you guys dance?

354
00:27:50,173 --> 00:27:51,190
Nope.

355
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,672
No.

356
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:56,858
No.

357
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,450
Why do you guys have to be

358
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,086
so bloody cheeky?

359
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:12,136
Yes, hello. My name is Moreo.

360
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:14,893
Singular, bye.

361
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:42,256
Who's there?

362
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:04,576
Ares.

363
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:09,383
Aiden?
