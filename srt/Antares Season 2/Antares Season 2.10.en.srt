00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,580
That's the motorbike.

8
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:50,947
I asked the vendors here.

9
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:53,587
They said it's the street thug's motorbike
who usually extorts them.

10
00:00:55,426 --> 00:00:56,647
But he's nowhere to be seen

11
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:58,547
since a few hours ago.

12
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:02,227
I have no doubt

13
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:06,467
that's the same motorbike
we saw on the gala's CCTV.

14
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:14,907
- I'm going to tell Ares.
- It'll take too long.

15
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:17,754
So, what are you going to do?
Damage that motorbike now?

16

Can you help trace it?

28

- Adam. Bo.
- Ares. Zea.

29
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:48,707
Have you ever seen a red motorbike
with a gold-colored exhaust?

30
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,526

No.

- Okay.

he got extorted by street thugs.

Were they scary?

42
00:04:55,646 --> 00:04:56,766
Who's being extorted?

43
00:04:57,107 --> 00:04:58,187
Jayden.

44
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:00,367
By street thugs?

45
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:02,466
Yeah, they were scary.

46
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:04,867
- You saw them?
- I did.

47
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:06,867
Serra, do you remember their features?

48
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:09,187
Let me think.

49
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:11,867
What I remember

50
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,307
is that one rode a red motorbike.

51
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:17,697
And one of the street thugs

52
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,466
had a scar on his cheek.

53
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,587
That's it. A scar.

54
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,867
What's wrong, babe?

55
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,387
Nothing. I'm going to class, okay?

56
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,083
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

57
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,347
Serra, did you see the exhaust?

58
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,507
I didn't notice that.

59
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,980
Red motorbike again.
This could be the same person.

60
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,227
But we don't know if it's
the same person as yesterday night.

61
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,507
It's clear enough. They extort people.

62
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:08,747
- Let's find Ares.
- Guys! Stop!

63
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,467
What a coincidence.

64
00:06:11,067 --> 00:06:12,107
Have you seen Ares?

65
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:14,267
We're going to look for him.

66
00:06:15,107 --> 00:06:16,547
Why aren't you looking for me?

67
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,867
Why always Ares?

68
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,787
You wish!

69
00:06:21,987 --> 00:06:24,307
Anyway, let me join you.

70
00:06:24,707 --> 00:06:27,827
I'm bringing him food, isn't it cute?

71
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:29,707
What are you bringing him?

72
00:06:30,187 --> 00:06:32,307
Richie, don't pry.

73
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:34,767
Let me have it.

74
00:06:35,627 --> 00:06:36,827
I'm hungry.

75
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,307
This is a special delivery, for Ares only.

76
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:47,467
Whatever. You're not helping.
I'm going to find him myself.

77
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,707
- Bye, boys.
- Bye, girl.

78
00:06:51,347 --> 00:06:53,307
I like that kind of girl.

79
00:06:55,187 --> 00:06:56,627
Sassy yet cute.

80
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:00,547
I can't stop thinking,

81
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,147
what will happen to Calderioz?

82
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,690
Ares.

83
00:07:10,357 --> 00:07:11,987
Aren't we going to do something?

84
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:17,849
Aren't you afraid Calderioz will split up?

85
00:07:21,147 --> 00:07:23,507
And we haven't found
the person behind this.

86
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,073
I've found the perpetrator, Ares.

87
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:31,326
Sorry, correction.

88
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:33,987
Not only you. We've found him.

89
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:38,147
The gala dinner's attacker
rode a red motorbike.

90
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:39,667
The same one that attacked Moreo.

91
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,280
And the one that messed up
our bikes at the base.

92
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:45,473
This proves one thing.

93
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:48,427
The "Stop or Die" threat is connected
with this motorbike.

94
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:50,046
That's right.

95
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:52,347
- I think...
- We think.

96
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:56,547
Yeah, we think...

97
00:07:57,747 --> 00:07:58,787
I think.

98
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,987
- And I think...
- We think.

99
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:04,863
We think they're

100
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,393
street thugs claiming themselves
as bike gang members.

101
00:08:07,507 --> 00:08:08,870
to extort people,

102
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,667
from cafes to street vendors.

103
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:13,427
Even Serra said,

104
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:15,627
she saw that motorbike at Jayden's cafe.

105
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:17,467
That's right.

106
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:20,267
Ares, we need to do something.

107
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,147
I know where he is now.

108
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,947
Okay.

109
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,107
And what's your plan?

110
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:30,667
Let's just go. Come on, we attack him.

111
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:35,233
Are you serious?

112
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,227
Yes, what are you waiting for? Come on!

113
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:39,368
Ardhan.

114
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,620
I don't want you
to make the same mistake as I did.

115
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:45,147
Don't act recklessly.

116
00:08:46,307 --> 00:08:47,827
Who is acting recklessly?

117
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:50,427
Even when you were suspended,
I've checked the CCTV.

118
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:53,107
It's certainly him! What do you want?

119
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:54,747
Ardhan, enough.

120
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:57,067
I said wait!

121
00:08:57,507 --> 00:08:58,867
You can't just attack him.

122
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:01,747
I don't agree with that.

123
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:04,746
I don't think you've ever agreed with me.

124
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:06,867
I don't get you, Ares.

125
00:09:07,707 --> 00:09:09,507
You want to do everything by yourself.

126
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:12,147
As if you've never cared
about mine and Richie's work.

127
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,377
I don't know what problem
you have with Richie,

128
00:09:17,484 --> 00:09:19,467
but this is for all of us.

129
00:09:20,307 --> 00:09:21,507
For Calderioz!

130
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,820
- That's right.
- Enough, Ardhan.

131
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:25,707
To satisfy both of your ego!

132
00:09:26,187 --> 00:09:27,307
Not for us.

133
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,067
Acting without thinking.

134
00:09:30,513 --> 00:09:32,079
Have you forgotten why I got suspended?

135
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:35,427
Because I was reckless
and was provoked by emotions

136
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,673
and I attacked the person who mugged Zea.

137
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:41,547
- Do you want to repeat that mistake?
- Ares!

138
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,960
Enough.

139
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:54,587
Ardhan.

140
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:58,907
Hold your horses, okay?

141
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,987
We're going to find a solution together.

142
00:10:04,507 --> 00:10:06,107
A solution that won't endanger us.

143
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:10,613
Okay?

144
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,327
Sorry, Ares.

145
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,107
But I don't agree with you this time.

146
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:19,947
Ardhan, don't be like this.

147
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:21,653
Let him be.

148
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,217
Congrats, Captain.

149
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:27,307
Shut up. You've only been
agreeing all this time.

150
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:28,467
Annoying.

151
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,307
Ares.

152
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:16,507
I cooked this morning. Try it.

153
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,227
- What's that?
- Fried rice.

154
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:21,100
Smell it. Tantalizing, isn't it?

155
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,027
There's egg and sausages,
everything's there.

156
00:11:23,128 --> 00:11:24,173
Let me have that.

157
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:26,237
Moreo, what are you doing?

158
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:28,293
It's for Ares.

159
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:29,434
Try it.

160
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:34,686
- I'm not hungry. Thanks.
- See?

161
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:37,826
- He's not hungry.
- Its delicious, Ares.

162
00:11:38,027 --> 00:11:39,787
- Won't you try it?
- See? Let me eat it.

163
00:11:39,888 --> 00:11:42,459
Moreo! It's for Ares!

164
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,928
Go find yourself a girlfriend!

165
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,750
Stingy!

166
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,668
If you're stingy, you'll suffer in hell!

167
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,580
One, two, three, and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

168
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:57,907
One, two, three, four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

169
00:12:00,397 --> 00:12:02,307
We're so cool!

170
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,587
Of course! Calderioz angels!

171
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:08,107
Great energy, we're cohesive.

172
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,187
And the choreography is better, right?
This one's cool.

173
00:12:10,267 --> 00:12:13,227
I can't wait! I hope we win!

174
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,587
Amen!

175
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:19,032
Karissa, what about our costume?
When will we do our fitting?

176
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,987
Oh, God. I forgot.

177
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,353
Seriously?

178
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:28,027
You said we need to book the tailor
long before.

179
00:12:28,427 --> 00:12:30,254
I'm so sorry. I forgot.

180
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:32,387
I've been busy rehearsing
my lines for my audition.

181
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:35,267
I promise I'll contact
the tailor after this.

182
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:39,790
You can do your photoshoot and audition,

183
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,627
but don't forget your responsibility here.

184
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:43,667
- You're the leader.
- Stop it.

185
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:47,107
- She's going to contact the tailor later.
- Don't defend her.

186
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:48,627
We changed the choreography for you.

187
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:51,670
I already noticed.

188
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,373
Ever since you're doing photoshoots,
you've been acting so busy.

189
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,587
You're exaggerating.

190
00:12:59,227 --> 00:13:02,114
Whether I'm doing photoshoots or whatever,

191
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:03,707
is it any of your business?

192
00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:07,547
I'm not saying anything.
But you don't know your priorities.

193
00:13:07,627 --> 00:13:10,027
Don't you see we're practicing hard here?
And what are you doing?

194
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:12,667
Dating, photoshoot, audition.
Your schedule is packed!

195
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:15,227
Have I ever missed the practice?

196
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:19,227
- And this is just a costume.
- It's not "just"!

197
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:21,923
We need a long time to prepare them!

198
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:26,250
What's wrong with you?

199
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:27,600
Are you lonely?

200
00:13:28,187 --> 00:13:29,507
Do you envy my life?

201
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:34,867
Find other things to do!
Don't meddle with my business!

202
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:47,107
Why are you like this?

203
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:54,667
I just want you to have more time with us.

204
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,526
I've had enough of this.
Handle the dance yourself.

205
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,680
I'm full.

206
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:28,507
Is this yours? Is it good?

207
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,107
I made a mess.

208
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:37,867
Let's go.

209
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,780
We're having a meeting
tonight at the base.

210
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,294
Hey, where are you going?

211
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:12,587
I need some fresh air.

212
00:15:24,938 --> 00:15:26,298
I thought you were someone else.

213
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,187
I was going to beat you up.

214
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:30,667
You're scary.

215
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,307
What problem does Ares have with Richie?

216
00:15:39,307 --> 00:15:40,907
Well, I don't know about that.

217
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:44,147
Cleo was his childhood friend.

218
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:46,707
Didn't she tell you anything?

219
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,667
Cleo...

220
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,467
Never.

221
00:15:54,147 --> 00:15:56,387
I think it's personal.

222
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:00,707
You need to help me.

223
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:05,227
Calderioz can't keep doing nothing.

224
00:16:06,326 --> 00:16:07,726
This is our chance!

225
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:10,947
Come on!

226
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,187
I mean,

227
00:16:18,707 --> 00:16:20,587
Ares was right.

228
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,507
If we attack just like that,

229
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,507
there will be consequences.

230
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,267
I actually agree with you.

231
00:16:35,947 --> 00:16:37,547
But I also agree with Ares.

232
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,587
You're both right.

233
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:43,507
I don't understand you.

234
00:16:46,553 --> 00:16:48,993
So, relax.

235
00:16:50,587 --> 00:16:51,827
You're not alone.

236
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,787
I will always have your back.

237
00:16:58,987 --> 00:17:00,027
Okay?

238
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,493
Thanks.

239
00:17:15,547 --> 00:17:17,507
Let's see what Ares is going to say.

240
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,760
Babe.

241
00:17:28,861 --> 00:17:29,937
Let's go.

242
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:34,147
Guys, I'm heading off.

243
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:35,707
- Bye.
- Bye.

244
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:47,473
Guys, sorry. I have to go,
my driver's here.

245
00:17:47,707 --> 00:17:49,387
- Okay. Bye, Serra.
- Bye.

246
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,587
Take care.

247
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:00,587
Just leave.

248
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:01,827
Come on.

249
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,827
- Bye.
- Bye.

250
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:18,587
Hey, darling. It's time to go home?

251
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,593
Let's go home.

252
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:24,987
Let's go.

253
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:33,367
Cleo.

254
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,547
Come home with me once in a while.

255
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:45,387
Don't you ever touch Cleo!

256
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,280
That's it.

257
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,107
You should be like this!

258
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,787
You've done nothing from before.

259
00:18:53,894 --> 00:18:54,974
Fight back.

260
00:18:59,947 --> 00:19:00,987
Calm down, man.

261
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,227
I won't steal your girlfriend.

262
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,207
Okay?

263
00:19:09,686 --> 00:19:10,726
Come on.

264
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:14,427
Babe.

265
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:19,427
Fighting among friends is common.

266
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,587
I know.

267
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,307
I just don't like the way Selina acted.

268
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:29,039
Yeah, but don't get mad at me too.

269
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,507
It's not my fault.

270
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:37,187
Do you want something now?

271
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:38,787
I'll buy it for you!

272
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,660
Nothing.

273
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:44,787
Nothing? Impossible.

274
00:19:45,107 --> 00:19:47,027
What? I donít want anything.

275
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,980
Babe!

276
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,347
What if someone sees us?

277
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,180
So what?

278
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,147
Did you panicked?

279
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:05,167
Did you?

280
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,547
You were. Admit it.

281
00:20:07,627 --> 00:20:08,707
No.

282
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,600
A little.

283
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:17,606
"The word means straightforward,
so it's easy to understand

284
00:20:17,707 --> 00:20:21,347
and the logic can be traced clearly."

285
00:20:23,094 --> 00:20:24,134
Hold on.

286
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,827
We still have another 30 minutes.

287
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,427
I have put on a timer here.

288
00:20:35,787 --> 00:20:36,907
Let's continue.

289
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,080
"A proper language is signified by"

290
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:44,307
Zea.

291
00:20:45,107 --> 00:20:48,107
- Sandra.
- Ares hasn't finished yet?

292
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,674
He has. He's walking Mr. Sal out.

293
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,107
By the way, I have a question.

294
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,067
Does Richie have a girlfriend?

295
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,413
Why?

296
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:02,387
Do you like Richie?

297
00:21:03,186 --> 00:21:04,466
Who likes Richie?

298
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,073
You?

299
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:08,667
What are you talking about?

300
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,647
We're discussing something else.

301
00:21:12,587 --> 00:21:14,627
And yet, you're smiling like that.

302
00:21:15,553 --> 00:21:17,800
What's wrong with you? So grumpy.

303
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,000
Hello?

304
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:30,993
Okay.

305
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,140
I'll be there.

306
00:21:37,067 --> 00:21:38,307
Our target has been spotted.

307
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:40,873
Okay. Let's go.

308
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:02,107
Where's Ares?

309
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:05,467
Be patient, Ardhan. He'll be here soon.

310
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,427
What?

311
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,347
He's there.

312
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:15,227
Dude, we have to go now.

313
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:18,387
The perpetrator is right there.
We can't lose this opportunity.

314
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,027
Wait for Ares.

315
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,660
We have agreed to meet him here.

316
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,667
We're going to discuss this here.

317
00:22:24,747 --> 00:22:27,067
We wait for him, and then what?
We're going to wait some more?

318
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:29,227
Can you agree with Ares just once?

319
00:22:29,387 --> 00:22:30,987
Don't go looking for trouble all the time.

320
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:39,587
They're extorting
the street vendors again.

321
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,267
- We need to go.
- Go where?

322
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:44,987
What?

323
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:46,347
Wait for Ares.

324
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:49,387
Ares is with his girlfriend.
Why should we wait for him?

325
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:51,248
Are you going to join us or not?

326
00:22:52,307 --> 00:22:54,187
- Don't be reckless, Ardhan!
- Ardhan!

327
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:02,867
Why are they all following them?

328
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:21,253
It's not him.

329
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,727
Ares!

330
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:51,107
Why isn't he picking up?

331
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:55,067
- Calm down.
- Where is he? How can I calm down?

332
00:23:55,627 --> 00:23:58,387
- Ares isn't here! What should we do?
- Can you calm down?

333
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:00,827
Calm down!

334
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,187
- Two for you, two for me.
- Hey!

335
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:13,707
- How much did you get today?
- Who are you?

336
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:15,787
- You talk too much! Come on!
- You talk too much!

337
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:39,130
(Do not attempt to do this act)

338
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,830
Bastards!

339
00:24:41,177 --> 00:25:06,257
(Do not attempt to do this act)

340
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,166
Get up, you bastard!

341
00:25:08,865 --> 00:25:39,754
(Do not attempt to do this act)

342
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:35,427
(To Be Continued)
