1
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:31,926
My effort won't stop here.

2
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:34,093
I hope all the bike gangs unite as one

3
00:00:34,193 --> 00:00:35,926
and have a firm solidarity.

4
00:00:36,006 --> 00:00:37,329
No more fighting

5
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,086
and no more tearing each other down.

6
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:46,776
Help! Help me!

7
00:00:55,632 --> 00:00:56,712
Who are you?

8
00:01:10,926 --> 00:01:13,210
Attack!

9
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,009
Moreo!

10
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,700
Moreo.

11
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:43,966
Moreo.

12
00:01:44,046 --> 00:01:45,726
Moreo.

13
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:49,726
- Please wait outside.
- Moreo!

14
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:39,401
Thank you for your participation.

15
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,122
Your voices

16
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,361
are the voices of change for Calderioz.

17
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:46,010
I'm confident

18
00:03:46,756 --> 00:03:48,223
and I believe

19
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:49,863
Calderioz

20
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:52,840
will become better

21
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:56,247
being led by young men, like you guys.

22
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:00,154
We've counted the votes

23
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:04,856
and these are the top three.

24
00:04:06,783 --> 00:04:07,929
Congratulations!

25
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,896
I love you, Antares!

26
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,961
Congrats to Antares Sebastian Aldevaro.

27
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,573
You're the new leader.

28
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:23,376
And Richie Leonathan

29
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:25,108
as the deputy leader.

30
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,063
I love you, Antares!

31
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,510
So that's the story.

32
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:46,598
Why didn't Ares tell me
that Richie was a Calderioz member?

33
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:48,535
But I think he's nice.

34
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,510
Because he has a hidden agenda.

35
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:53,276
He was the one who helped you.

36
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:57,753
I know he did help me,

37
00:04:57,853 --> 00:05:01,241
but I didn't ask for it
and I didn't need his help.

38
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:02,721
I had to fight two men.

39
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,841
And it was a fair fight,
and we throw the same amount of punches.

40
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,130
and I would have been fine
without his help.

41
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,496
But I'm glad he did.

42
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:13,367
Even with his help,
they still knocked you out.

43
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:16,034
I have low blood pressure.

44
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:18,540
(Are you okay?)

45
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,403
- You know me.
- You're full of excuses.

46
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,183
I wonder how Ares is doing.

47
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,516
There is no confirmed information
that the attack was directed on Calderioz.

48
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,283
Where did you get the information?

49
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:33,812
From here.

50
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,641
(Trends for you)

51
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:36,786
(#Calderiosisbeingattacked)

52
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,121
(#Derlangga)

53
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:42,656
Those are just assumptions.

54
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,481
I'm going to make sure to find out
who was behind this attack.

55
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:50,673
You're students.

56
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:52,762
Investigating is not your job.

57
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:55,914
Your job as a student is to learn.

58
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:58,614
You're now seniors.

59
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:01,601
The final exams are coming up.

60
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:03,976
Therefore,

61
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:08,743
I order you all to leave Calderioz.

62
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:11,641
- Do you understand?
- You can't do that to us.

63
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,244
I understand your concern.

64
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:17,090
But we can't make a hasty decision.

65
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:19,093
Calderioz is an organization,

66
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:22,103
and us as the members in it
have responsibilities to uphold.

67
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,747
I agree with him.

68
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:27,716
Here's an idea of a win-win solution.

69
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:30,756
How about we make an agreement?

70
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,983
So you can allow us to
keep the organization

71
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:39,371
without giving a bad reputation
to the school?

72
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:41,394
One,

73
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,974
we'll guarantee there will never be
another attack on this school.

74
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,114
Two,

75
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:51,119
our activities in Calderioz
won't compromise our grades.

76
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:52,903
And three,

77
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,414
if we break those two previous points,

78
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:58,436
we will accept the consequences.

79
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:00,716
Okay.

80
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:03,149
But, on one condition.

81
00:07:05,053 --> 00:07:07,573
Do not wear any attributes

82
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,180
of your gang to school.

83
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,521
- Are we clear?
- But, Sir...

84
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,603
Yes, Sir.

85
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,083
Okay.

86
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,981
We have to find out quickly
who attacked our school.

87
00:07:24,281 --> 00:07:27,909
I bet it's connected to the attack
on Retro and Laskar.

88
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:34,443
We've got to have a meeting
with the other gangs.

89
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,110
They must have plans themselves.

90
00:07:39,554 --> 00:07:40,554
Alright.

91
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,590
I'll arrange the meeting.

92
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:55,347
- Baby, I got it.
- Let me carry your bag.

93
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,894
- I can carry it myself.
- Let me do it.

94
00:07:58,481 --> 00:07:59,821
Thank you.

95
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,082
Baby, I want to eat something.

96
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,001
How about we go to
A Slice of Happiness?

97
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,334
You've never been there, right?

98
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:09,070
How about tomorrow?
I have a meeting later today at the HQ.

99
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:10,395
Alright, Babe?

100
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:13,723
Babe!

101
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:15,841
- Don't stay out too late!
- Baby!

102
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:32,629
Hi, Bro.

103
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:39,149
Why does your leader acts so chill?

104
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,033
His vision is clear.

105
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,614
He wants to unite all the bike gangs.

106
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,307
"Unite"?

107
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:49,516
That's an ambitious goal.

108
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,103
Hey, Cleo.

109
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,501
- Bye.
- Okay.

110
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:12,600
Let's go.

111
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,936
How's Fino doing?

112
00:09:22,046 --> 00:09:23,793
His condition is worse than Moreo.

113
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:27,041
The last time I saw him,
he was still in the hospital.

114
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,510
But his parents are with him now.

115
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:34,663
Did Richie help Moreo earlier?

116
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,010
Let's not talk about it.

117
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,416
I just hope this incident
will be the last.

118
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:55,799
We can't just pull the plug

119
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,250
just because the attack on our school.

120
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:00,924
I can promise you

121
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:03,048
Calderioz is going to be all right.

122
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:05,585
Our leader's school and
the main members got attacked.

123
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:08,496
How can you say
that we're going to be all right?

124
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:12,727
We have three rules
that live in our heart.

125
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,367
Defend each member.

126
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:17,281
Destroy the betrayer.

127
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,943
Don't die as a loser.

128
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:26,230
Carry on.

129
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,270
Make sure to watch each other's back.

130
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,979
If you have any suggestions,
information or anything,

131
00:10:36,963 --> 00:10:38,803
talk to me or Ares.

132
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:45,634
Why in private?

133
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,837
Can't we share it in front of everybody
who are present here?

134
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,277
I think every member has the right

135
00:10:53,378 --> 00:10:55,901
to speak their minds freely.

136
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,781
You said you're a democrat,

137
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:03,093
but opinions could only
be express privately.

138
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,179
Just shut the hell up.

139
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:07,107
Ardhan.

140
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:32,530
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

141
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,523
Do you want to order anything else?

142
00:11:37,241 --> 00:11:39,571
But we have already
closed orders for coffee.

143
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,062
What time is it?

144
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:45,926
Oh my, it's this late. I'm so sorry.

145
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,204
It's okay.

146
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,103
If you lost track of time,

147
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,083
then you enjoyed the place.

148
00:11:53,247 --> 00:11:54,872
Do you have
someone picking you up?

149
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,370
I'm ordering an online taxi right now.

150
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:11,910
- Thank you.
- Take care.

151
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:32,236
I know, Baby.
The meeting's over, I'm going home.

152
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:35,283
Baby, there's something I need to tell you.

153
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:37,243
What the hell, man?

154
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,580
- What did you say to me?
- I forgot my helmet.

155
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:43,321
I was talking to Richie.
He's such an asshole.

156
00:12:43,401 --> 00:12:44,517
I wasn't talking to you.

157
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,775
Bye, Karissa.

158
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,170
Bye, Richie.

159
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,796
Did you just say goodbye to him?

160
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,094
What's so wrong about it?

161
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,416
Don't laugh.

162
00:12:58,597 --> 00:12:59,930
Don't be mad.

163
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:02,936
Okay, I'm going home.

164
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:05,530
Okay, take care.

165
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,296
Let me know when you're home.

166
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:15,427
Hold on.

167
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:18,636
Have you noticed

168
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,783
Richie got more annoying
after he returned from States?

169
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:23,723
He laughed at me
when we got attacked earlier today.

170
00:13:24,241 --> 00:13:25,730
No wonder you got punched.

171
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:31,255
He could be behind the attack.

172
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,903
Stop, you can't accuse him without proof.

173
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:38,523
Do you even remember,
he helped us in the principal's office.

174
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,303
Maybe he pretended
to be a hero by helping us.

175
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:46,483
You should go home.

176
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,697
I still haven't got your guest list

177
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:59,281
for the gala dinner.

178
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:01,562
I gave it to Sandra.

179
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:03,380
I see.

180
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,183
Is Richie on the list?

181
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,087
If you want to invite him,

182
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:12,616
put him on your guest list.

183
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,521
Bye, Mom.

184
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,243
That's not how you talk to your mother.

185
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,663
I thought you've resolved
your disagreement.

186
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,820
Fine, it's your guest list anyway.

187
00:14:24,921 --> 00:14:27,961
But tell them to RSVP.

188
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:33,001
Talk to me, Ares.

189
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,476
Don't forget to help me
prepare the gala dinner!

190
00:14:39,051 --> 00:14:43,531
(Hey, need your help)

191
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,865
(What?)

192
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:48,627
Ares!

193
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,134
What's up, Cleo?

194
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,751
Richie came back to turn things around
so we can be like the old days.

195
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,990
He doesn’t want to cause any trouble.

196
00:15:06,233 --> 00:15:09,663
He just wants you, us, to be happy.

197
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:12,053
Have fun like we used to.

198
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:16,287
Don't be too naive.

199
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:20,271
Why are you still here?

200
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,886
You're waiting for Megan?

201
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:25,816
Okay then, bye.

202
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,600
(How well do you know your boyfriend?)

203
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:42,001
(Girls, are you sure
you know your boyfriend?)

204
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:45,401
(Take the quiz to make sure
how well you know your boyfriend!)

205
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:47,876
- I met your friend.
- Who?

206
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,082
Richie.

207
00:15:53,316 --> 00:15:54,316
I want you

208
00:15:55,316 --> 00:15:56,663
to not get too close to him.

209
00:15:57,436 --> 00:15:58,455
Why?

210
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,116
Just do what I say.

211
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,170
Okay, let's go.

212
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,340
(First question)

213
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:12,721
(What is your boyfriend’s birth date
and where was he born?)

214
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:16,249
(Second question)

215
00:16:16,357 --> 00:16:18,241
(Do you know your boyfriend’s hobby?)

216
00:16:20,401 --> 00:16:21,414
(Third question)

217
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:24,441
(What is his favorite food?)

218
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:33,687
(Fourth question)

219
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,927
(What is his favorite color?)

220
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:45,720
Babe,

221
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:47,870
let's eat.

222
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,446
Later.

223
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,420
Okay.

224
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:56,712
I'll see you at the cafeteria.

225
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,035
I'm done.

226
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:15,850
What's your favorite food?

227
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,119
Fried rice.

228
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:20,841
Your favorite color?

229
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:22,929
Why'd you ask?

230
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:24,274
Just tell me.

231
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,062
Black.

232
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:29,630
- Your favorite movie?
- My favorite movie?

233
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,540
You've been aiming for Ares for so long,

234
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:43,736
still you failed miserably.

235
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,101
When are you guys going to start dating?

236
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,004
What can I do?

237
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:50,970
He has a girlfriend now.

238
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,876
So you stop loving him?

239
00:17:56,481 --> 00:17:59,916
No. But what can I do?

240
00:18:01,363 --> 00:18:02,903
And what’s stopping you to get him?

241
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:12,636
Richie!

242
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:14,496
So you mean I should just
keep going after him?

243
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:15,576
Richie!

244
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:34,523
Moron! You think you own the street?

245
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:37,207
My leg hurts!

246
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,081
Where's my purse?

247
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,761
Are you okay, Ma'am?

248
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:43,841
What do you think?
My heart almost stopped.

249
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,777
- Let me help you.
- Just leave me alone.

250
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:50,241
- Careful.
- My leg!

251
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,643
Are you in a bike gang too?

252
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,796
Tell your friend.

253
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,761
Stop speeding on the street.
People will get hurt!

254
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:04,870
- I'm sorry. Let me help you.
- Just leave me alone!

255
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:38,454
(Guys, Retro will lay low indefinitely.
Please take care)

256
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,836
People are accusing
Retro of criminal acts.

257
00:19:46,998 --> 00:19:48,787
That's why we are choosing
to lay low for now.

258
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:51,663
Yeah.

259
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:54,880
I can see how empty your base is now.

260
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:58,950
Laskar was just one incident.

261
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:02,676
I've got intel

262
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:06,943
they saw bikers doing criminal stuff

263
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,289
wearing Retro's jackets.

264
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:16,676
We wouldn't do such things.

265
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,383
That reminds me of Lionel.

266
00:20:21,411 --> 00:20:23,563
Do you think it has
something to do with him?

267
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,776
I can see some similarities.

268
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:32,696
But I think this time it's different.

269
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,183
What concerns me the most is

270
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:42,296
if the person behind
all of this is one of us.

271
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:46,681
Do you think

272
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:50,103
somebody doesn't like our unity?

273
00:20:52,507 --> 00:20:54,690
I'm still thinking about
our conversation last night.

274
00:20:59,807 --> 00:21:02,676
Laying low is the best solution
for us right now.

275
00:21:04,321 --> 00:21:08,130
Well, if my suspicion is legit,

276
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:10,815
it will be easier for us
to catch the traitor.

277
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:14,483
But Arka,

278
00:21:17,721 --> 00:21:21,481
I was expecting you to help me
find out who that person is.

279
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:22,628
Sorry, Ares.

280
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,721
My decision is final.

281
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:27,768
I...

282
00:21:31,152 --> 00:21:34,096
I don't want to put
my men in danger.

283
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,636
But if you still want to fight,

284
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,929
be my guest.

285
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,416
But my advice to you,

286
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:45,856
for the time being,

287
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:48,136
you better watch your back.

288
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:51,163
We still don't know who's friend or foe.

289
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,286
Okay.

290
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:03,510
Some bike gang randomly attacked
a group of men on the street.

291
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:09,836
Fino!

292
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,801
Fino, are you okay?

293
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:15,201
Get up!

294
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:16,401
- Come on.
- Slowly.

295
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:17,601
Derlangga is under attack.

296
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:18,961
Let's go.

297
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,681
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

298
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,161
Ares!

299
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:23,956
Let him go.
Help me carry him.

300
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,884
Are you thinking about Ares?

301
00:22:34,547 --> 00:22:36,980
Not really.

302
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:38,757
It's okay.

303
00:22:38,877 --> 00:22:42,023
When I was your age,
I always thought about my husband.

304
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:45,667
Seriously, I'm
not thinking of him.

305
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,129
If you miss him, call him.

306
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,041
I'm going to see him again
tomorrow in school anyway.

307
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:57,041
See, my guess was right.
You’re missing him.

308
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:02,981
- You jokester.
- Eat the food.

309
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:16,899
(Motorcycle gang carrying sharp weapons)

310
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,857
(Three students were grabbed
by a motorcycle rider in a black jacket)

311
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,982
(Members of a motorcycle gang
make residents restless)

312
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,620
(Hey, wake up! Ares, are you up?)

313
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:28,258
(I'm going to school on my own.
Don't pick me up.)

314
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,945
(I don't want to be late.)

315
00:24:30,046 --> 00:24:31,982
(Drive carefully. See you)

316
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,096
What time is it?

317
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:45,830
Bye, Mom.

318
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:50,201
I want to ask you about the gala dinner.

319
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:54,347
I'm late. Bye.

320
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,739
But I asked you in the group chat,
and you still haven't said anything.

321
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,516
Ares! Which cake do you like?

322
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:18,007
Where's Megan?

323
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:22,581
His bike broke down.
He said it needs some fixing.

324
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,001
- Do you need a ride?
- What?

325
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:28,142
- Do you want a ride?
- You're not picking up Zea?

326
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,972
- I'm late.
- Okay.

327
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,103
Let's go.

328
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:47,263
Thanks.

329
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:53,583
Cleo.

330
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:56,921
- Bye.
- Okay.

331
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:10,130
- Did you come with Ares?
- Yeah, we met on the way.

332
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,950
- You live near him?
- Yes.

333
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,370
You don't know?

334
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,773
Girls, don't forget
our rehearsal today.

335
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:24,001
I have a new choreography
for the opening.

336
00:26:24,102 --> 00:26:25,475
It's going to be awesome.

337
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:42,836
Morning.

338
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,136
Scary.

339
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,850
Can you be serious for once?

340
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:55,131
Sure.

341
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,343
There's an old saying about

342
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,010
leaving the past behind.

343
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:09,216
Never bring it to the present time,

344
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:12,263
especially not to the future.

345
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:16,963
But I don't think that quote

346
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:20,090
applies to you.

347
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,230
Do you want to discuss
about the future now?

348
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,561
Maybe you don't realize it.

349
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:34,180
But everything you do today,

350
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,090
is a continuation of what
you did yesterday.

351
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:40,127
You won't enjoy your present

352
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:42,023
if you run away from your past.

353
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,403
Morning!

354
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:56,630
Morning, gorgeous.

355
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,873
Morning, Richie.

356
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,076
You look good.

357
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,395
Thanks.

358
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:09,963
Which perfume do you use?

359
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:11,830
It smells so good.

360
00:28:15,474 --> 00:28:16,570
Really?

361
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,743
What's wrong with him?

362
00:28:30,749 --> 00:28:31,756
Jealous, maybe?

363
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,763
So, this is the picture of
superior vena cava.

364
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,240
This is the right ventricle.

365
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:45,150
And this is the right atrium.

366
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:48,331
And this is the inferior vena cava.

367
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:51,261
Up to this point, do you understand?

368
00:28:52,721 --> 00:28:55,830
Right, we continue to number 19.

369
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:58,283
Zea.

370
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,130
What's the answer
for question number 19?

371
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:10,638
Blood flow through the
pulmonary circuit which is

372
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:16,816
C. Right ventricle-pulmonary artery-
lungs-left atrium.

373
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:18,276
Correct.

374
00:29:19,441 --> 00:29:21,336
Moving on to question number 20.

375
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:23,394
Selina.

376
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:26,321
read the question please.

377
00:29:41,593 --> 00:29:42,683
Ares.

378
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:44,683
What's wrong?

379
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:48,123
Ares.

380
00:29:51,001 --> 00:29:54,683
I thought you promised not to wear
your gang's outfit to school.

381
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:01,640
I'll be back.

382
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,960
- See you.
- Bye.

383
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:09,363
I don't want to see you in
school wearing those jackets again.

384
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,129
She's so annoying.

385
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,230
You two go ahead, I'll see you there.

386
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,087
How nice if your boyfriend
is in the same school.

387
00:30:34,081 --> 00:30:38,081
- You can be like her too.
- How?

388
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:39,296
By dating Moreo.

389
00:30:41,063 --> 00:30:42,089
Gosh.

390
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,881
What's wrong with him?

391
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:46,883
Don't play cupid with me
like those matchmaking shows.

392
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:52,490
Ardhan told me that Retro gang
is laying low right now?

393
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,196
Ares.

394
00:31:00,882 --> 00:31:02,983
you can tell me anything,

395
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,567
maybe I can help.

396
00:31:05,721 --> 00:31:07,001
No.

397
00:31:07,974 --> 00:31:10,180
I don't want to involve you
any deeper into this mess.

398
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:12,181
I can take care of myself.

399
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:14,254
You know me.

400
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:16,430
I'm a Capo Wolves, remember?

401
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:19,550
- Please listen to me, Zea.
- Do you trust me or not?

402
00:31:19,914 --> 00:31:22,913
- It's not that...
- Do you trust me or not? Just tell me.
