1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,840
Don't draw.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,320
Your math questions are still wrong.
And now you're drawing.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,040
Be serious when studying.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,960
This isn't art class.

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,040
Get serious.

6
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:35,046
Carry on.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,400
We will start a war soon.

8
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:59,122
(Kerambit)

9
00:00:59,223 --> 00:01:01,143
(Bike Gang Teror)

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,396
We haven't found the kerambit yet.

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,160
The mastermind of this incident
is yet to be found.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,440
Brother Baren
and other senior members of Calderioz

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,000
will help find the kerambit.

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,480
Zea will ask Wolves to help carry on
the investigation.

15
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,840
We will have the exam soon.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,080
I...

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
We

18
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,820
have to pass.

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,843
But that just makes my focus blurred.

20
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,800
I will not leave Calderioz.

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,280
But for the time being,

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,520
I have to focus

23
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,600
on the tryout and the exam.

24
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:05,767
And I think

25
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,420
we all have to.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,360
I want to leave.

27
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,043
Where are you going?

28
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:18,122
I'm not finished talking.

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,000
Go on, then. I'm sleepy, I want to sleep.

30
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:31,400
Don't fight again.

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,920
Ares, stay here. Don't mind him.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
Just let him be.

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,600
Ares!

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,553
Don't leave while I'm talking.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,560
And you can't just leave
because of the tryout.

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,176
If I don't pass the tryout,

37
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:53,757
I...

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,080
I have to quit Calderioz.

39
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,340
What kind of dumb deal have you made here?

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,920
What about the "Slice of Happiness"?

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,413
Do you think I don't care?

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,760
I am watching them.

43
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm adopting your method
and not randomly attacking.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
Did you tell the guys?

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,813
I will keep you posted.

46
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:32,279
But if I see those bad guys again,

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
I will attack them.

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,520
Focus on the tryout. I don't care.

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
There's something I want to tell you.

50
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
It's about my Mom.

51
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,539
My Mom

52
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:11,665
was the most romantic woman in the world.

53
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,126
Even to her own son.

54
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:20,506
Do you know why it is called
"Slice of Happiness"?

55
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Mom said,

56
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,600
she wants to give out
slices of happiness to many people.

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
She was so philosophical, right?

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,480
Looks like you were very close
to your mom.

59
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,606
There is one more of her dreams

60
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:50,366
that I have to fulfill.

61
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:52,473
What is it?

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,960
She wants her son to have a girlfriend.

63
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:02,679
Seriously.

64
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
Mom said,

65
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,000
if I have a girlfriend,

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,600
she must be pretty.

67
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,480
How come it's so quiet?

68
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:36,533
Right?

69
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,389
Because the 12th grade students
are preparing for the tryout.

70
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,950
Are the Calderioz members
studying for it too?

71
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:45,216
Of course. How can they pass
the tryout if they don't prepare?

72
00:05:47,043 --> 00:05:49,360
Especially Moreo,
he has to study really hard.

73
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,800
Because his brain is just so and so.

74
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,080
He's not guaranteed to pass
even if he studies really hard.

75
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:54,334
I swear.

76
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:57,040
You're talking about Moreo all the time.

77
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,680
Selina, let's take a walk.

78
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's walk around.

79
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,020
Let me borrow Selina.

80
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,800
- Please do.
- Come on, Selina.

81
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:20,093
Selina.

82
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:24,506
Is there anything unusual
about our relationship?

83
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,760
What relationship?

84
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,840
Are we really a couple?

85
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,640
No, of course not.

86
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,720
But I asked you.

87
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,600
What kind of proposal was that?

88
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,480
Okay, I will do it again.

89
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
Selina.

90
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,550
I like you.

91
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

92
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,099
Moreo.

93
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,960
I don't want to be
in a relationship just yet.

94
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,080
But,

95
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:25,160
I want you to pass the exam.

96
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:27,680
Study hard.

97
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,600
After that, we'll see.

98
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,800
Then we will be a couple?

99
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,640
Okay.

100
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,560
So, I have to pass the exam first.
Then we'll be a couple?

101
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,200
- Yes.
- Deal?

102
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,940
Ares!

103
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:01,573
What's up, Moreo?

104
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:03,526
What's the matter?

105
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,212
One moment, let me catch my breath.

106
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:07,506
Okay.

107
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:10,811
Do you still have that private tutoring?

108
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,480
- At home?
- Yes.

109
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:17,180
- Yes, I am.
- Really?

110
00:08:18,013 --> 00:08:19,693
- Why?
- May I join?

111
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,446
What subject did you fail?

112
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,779
He failed all of them. All of them.

113
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
"All of them"?

114
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,063
Except for Art.

115
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,846
"Except Art"?

116
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,360
Ardhan, what subject did you fail?

117
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,360
It's math, Sir.

118
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:44,816
Megan.

119
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,506
- Sir?
- What subject did you fail?

120
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,160
- It's economics, sir.
- Economics.

121
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,036
Economics and math.

122
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,456
- And you passed in Art only.
- Art.

123
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,960
Alright, so today we study music.

124
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,983
If you kid around, why can't I?

125
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,679
Hey, what's this?

126
00:09:30,086 --> 00:09:31,353
What do you mean?

127
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,320
What do you think I am?

128
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,903
I am a teacher, not a vegetable soup.

129
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,720
You put salt on me.

130
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,141
And why didn't any of you do anything?

131
00:09:41,686 --> 00:09:43,165
You're in this together, aren't you?

132
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,600
Do you want to embarrass me?

133
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,623
I am punishing you all.

134
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,356
First punishment.

135
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,760
Put your hands on your ears.

136
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,289
Cross your arms.

137
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,170
Moreo, you are so out of line.

138
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,750
If one of you makes a mistake,
it's everyone's fault.

139
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,703
Second punishment.

140
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:05,652
Raise your right leg.

141
00:10:08,256 --> 00:10:10,776
Go on, quick.

142
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,859
Hold it right there. Hold them up.

143
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,040
Stay that way, I want to go to the toilet.

144
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,080
- Sir!
- Sir!

145
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,840
It's your fault.

146
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,200
Sorry.

147
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,960
- Do you want to nudge me?
- No, I don't.

148
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,640
If I nudge you, you will fall.

149
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't mean it, no.

150
00:10:34,736 --> 00:10:36,000
I feel smarter this way.

151
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:37,661
Guys!

152
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
What is he doing?

153
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,010
Have you finished studying?
Are you all smart now?

154
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,676
Poor Megan, he is shivering.

155
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,280
You are so noisy.

156
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,800
You are so noisy,
what are you doing here?

157
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,436
This is my second home. Right, Ares?

158
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,090
Let me talk to Ares for a bit.

159
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:54,893
What's up?

160
00:10:57,233 --> 00:11:00,870
I just found out
that there's CCTV in your dad's car.

161
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,400
I took out the card.

162
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,520
Look.

163
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:09,706
Yes, that's right.

164
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,780
Okay, sir. Thank you.

165
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:23,553
What's the matter?

166
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:24,779
Ares.

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
They want us to go
to the police station.

168
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,326
Where were you on

169
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,806
Thursday night, 20th of March, 2022?

170
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,520
My friends and I have a good alibi
for that question of yours.

171
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,440
I was at the base, Sir.

172
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,343
Do you have any evidence
to back up your statement?

173
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,443
This is my story post.

174
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,230
At our base with my friends.

175
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,800
This is my chat with my girlfriend.

176
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,000
If you were with your friends,

177
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,179
where were you?

178
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,143
According to our investigation,

179
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,740
they said you have a weapon like this.

180
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,833
This isn't mine, Sir.

181
00:12:13,993 --> 00:12:15,966
So where is yours?

182
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,259
Is it lost?

183
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:21,646
Ares.

184
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:22,987
What's going on, Ares?

185
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:26,520
You can't just take my son

186
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,793
because he has something that looks
similar with the weapon!

187
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,033
It's okay, Dad.

188
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,980
Everything's clear now.

189
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,960
I'm sorry, we are just doing
our duty here.

190
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,160
Excuse us.

191
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
Let's go, Ares.

192
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,080
(Please be quiet. Exam is in progress)

193
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,338
Thank you, Sir.

194
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
I passed.

195
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:30,226
I passed.

196
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,560
Ares, please come to my office.

197
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,936
How come you guys didn't pass?

198
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,856
We had a deal, Ares.

199
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,510
This means you failed.

200
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,230
You couldn't manage your time
between school and the bike gang.

201
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,840
If you want to do the national exam

202
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,530
and enter college like your friends,

203
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,046
here's my advice.

204
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,880
You should quit Calderioz

205
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
and focus on your studies.

206
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Surely you don't want to fail
the national exam

207
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
like you failed the tryout.

208
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,616
I didn't expect this.

209
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,083
The only Calderioz member to pass
is only Moreo.

210
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,240
Ares didn't pass
even after he had private tutoring.

211
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,940
It looks like
Ares has his mind on Calderioz.

212
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
Megan has studied very hard too.

213
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,610
Your choice is difficult.

214
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,200
It's either school or Calderioz.

215
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:56,425
It's not something I can choose.

216
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,800
Yes, I know.

217
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,920
But you have to choose now.

218
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,380
You said you don't want
to leave Calderioz.

219
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:10,013
This doesn't mean
you are leaving it for good.

220
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,920
I still have to find the kerambit.

221
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Yes.

222
00:15:19,433 --> 00:15:20,653
We will still look for it.

223
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,400
Eros and I are planning to meet Radit.

224
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:32,312
But you can't ignore the deal
between you and Mrs. Anin.

225
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,000
The main condition to become a leader
is to keep your commitment.

226
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:52,553
What do you want?

227
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,559
I have to know something.

228
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,040
Who is your boss?

229
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:03,858
I don't know.

230
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:07,879
Who is it?

231
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,533
I don't know.

232
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,680
It's not possible that
you did all this just for revenge.

233
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,640
I have asked the leader of the Wolves.

234
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,160
The one you said is your brother.
He doesn't even know you.

235
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:23,861
My brother is not a member of Wolves.

236
00:16:25,179 --> 00:16:28,289
If I knew who sent me,
I would've told you.

237
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
So you only did what that letter said?

238
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:41,733
This is your chance.

239
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,920
Speak now

240
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:47,813
or never again.

241
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,680
He knows everything about me.

242
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,220
The man who sent me,

243
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
I only got the information.

244
00:17:02,046 --> 00:17:04,766
He knows about everything.
I only carried it out.

245
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,800
How did he provide you
with the information?

246
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,503
He put it inside a box.

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,160
Something like a meal box. I don't know.

248
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,960
Sometimes there was money in it.

249
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,080
Sometimes there was
only this scent of cake.

250
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,490
There was information

251
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,119
about the where and when
of the bike gang's activities.

252
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,320
I knew he is dangerous,
that's why I did everything.

253
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,796
What was the scent you said?

254
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:37,135
Cake.

255
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,080
The aroma of cake
like the ones from the bakery.

256
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,760
I have something to tell you.

257
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,040
Tonight,

258
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,560
I resign as the leader of Calderioz.

259
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,160
What's the matter?

260
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,353
What is going on?

261
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,039
If you resign from Calderioz
just because of the tryout,

262
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:07,786
I won't approve of it.

263
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,160
Even if it's for another reason,
I won't approve it either.

264
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,386
Of course not.

265
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,293
Me too.

266
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,362
No.

267
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,520
Please calm down.

268
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,936
I resign

269
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,720
not because of my promise to Mrs. Anin.

270
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
I resign

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,400
because of all of you.

272
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,520
I have failed to protect you all
several times.

273
00:18:41,158 --> 00:18:42,276
Aiden.

274
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,880
Laskar.

275
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,640
Yesterday, you.

276
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,480
The kerambit is gone.

277
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
My decision is final.

278
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,996
And for my replacement.

279
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
From now on,

280
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,759
Ardhan.

281
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,280
He will be the 31st leader of Calderioz.

282
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:17,853
You deserve this.

283
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:57,053
(Do not imitate this scene)

284
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,763
If you scream, you die.

285
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,480
What are you doing
at the "Slice of Happiness"?

286
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,080
- Answer me!
- That hurts.

287
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,703
Don't hit me again, okay?

288
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,600
Someone told me.
I got an unmarked letter.

289
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,400
If I don't do it,
my life will be in danger.

290
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,003
- And you believe it?
- Of course I do.

291
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,353
My wife was being followed

292
00:20:23,453 --> 00:20:26,520
from home to the market.

293
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,320
It scares me.

294
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,280
I got this.

295
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,850
There was a cake in it.

296
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,280
But I ate it.

297
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,920
- Ares?
- Richie.

298
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,000
Meet me at the "Slice of Happiness", now.

299
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:30,479
- Cleo.
- Hi.

300
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:32,406
I want to get my order.

301
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Mrs. Athena ordered it, right?

302
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,220
Yes, right.

303
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,280
Okay, one moment.

304
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,920
She saw my secret door?

305
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,400
Thank you.

306
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,680
By the way, how are things
between you and Serra?

307
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,826
Yes, about it.

308
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,630
I am not good with girls.

309
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:28,746
Don't say that. Just get close to her.

310
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,923
You like her, don't you?

311
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,760
Did Serra ever speak about me?

312
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,680
Yes, she did.

313
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,463
She said that...

314
00:22:41,564 --> 00:22:42,820
Let's not talk here.

315
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:44,642
I don't want anyone to see.

316
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,022
Let's speak outside.

317
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:50,913
Yes, okay.

318
00:22:51,627 --> 00:22:52,707
Come on.

319
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,570
Why did we come out here?

320
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,720
Did you order an online taxi for me?

321
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,046
Get inside.

322
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
I don't get it.

323
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,040
Get in!

324
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,187
Get in.

325
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,519
(To be continued)
