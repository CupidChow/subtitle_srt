1
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,140
Why are they taking so long?

2
00:00:27,246 --> 00:00:28,406
Babe.

3
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:31,673
Babe, hang on. Please.

4
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,033
We've broken up, Ardhan.

5
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,820
But I can't, Babe.

6
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,020
No more "Babe".

7
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,380
Hi, Karissa.

8
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:21,773
Do you know

9
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,260
that Ardhan

10
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,260
is devastated without you?

11
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,380
Ardhan!

12
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,780
Ardhan

13
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,300
wants to be your boyfriend again.

14
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,306
- Do you want to...
- Ardhan!

15
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,959
We've broken up.

16
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,660
Karissa.

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
I love you so much.

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,420
Please. Babe.

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,100
Come on, Megan. We'll win.

20
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:30,193
Left. Left!

21
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,006
Oh, no!

22
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm dead because you didn't back me up.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,720
What's wrong with you, Ardhan?

24
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:47,893
Nothing.

25
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,580
Karissa?

26
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,260
You're a fool for love,
that's why you're miserable like this.

27
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:07,566
Shut up.

28
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:13,213
How did this happen?

29
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:15,539
Were you rejected again?

30
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,180
I've tried everything.

31
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,060
It still didn’t work.

32
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,300
Hello.

33
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,730
Mr. Muscle.

34
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,693
What's wrong with you?
Are you single?

35
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,953
Do you want to be with me?
I'm going to hug you.

36
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,599
Let's do things.

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,486
- Shut up!
- Just relax.

38
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,780
Rest assured.

39
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:01,401
I've prepared a lot of tricks you can use.

40
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,780
I've been reading romance books written by

41
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,940
- J.K. Rowling.
- Whatever.

42
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,620
- Seriously.
- Morning, guys.

43
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:13,761
Morning.

44
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,780
Ares.

45
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,780
Ares.

46
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,700
What's on your mind?

47
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,220
Is it about Radit?

48
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,860
If it has something to do with Wolves,

49
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,700
don't you want to tell Aeros?

50
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:49,926
No.

51
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:51,966
I don't want him to be more worried.

52
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,799
Sorry, he was exaggerating.

53
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,980
No. He's not exaggerating.

54
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,327
He's right.

55
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,060
The terror is getting worse.

56
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,060
Since they're attacking us personally.

57
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,100
Laskar and Moreo
were attacked on the street.

58
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,020
But your attack

59
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:17,979
was at home.

60
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,500
It's as if the perpetrator's
trying to tell us

61
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,380
that he knows everything about us.

62
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:33,173
Yeah.

63
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,860
And I don't want

64
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,900
anything to happen to you.

65
00:05:47,426 --> 00:05:48,506
Let's go.

66
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,460
So, you're going to stay at Zea's
for the next few days?

67
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,260
Yeah. Poor Zea.

68
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,930
Aren't you scared

69
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:07,620
that they'll come back
while you're there?

70
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:09,733
I'm not.

71
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,540
Because Ares and the members
will come straight away if that happens.

72
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,140
There's also Aeros, Zea's brother,
at the house anyway.

73
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,340
You surprised me, Jayden!

74
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,020
Sorry.

75
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,620
But that's how it's done.

76
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,660
Okay. Scary.

77
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:34,973
You want to try it?

78
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,780
Okay.

79
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,020
- Okay.
- Try it.

80
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:46,527
I'm going to slam it, okay?

81
00:06:49,286 --> 00:06:50,326
Try it.

82
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,700
- Not like that?
- No. Like this.

83
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:57,593
Now, slam it.

84
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,940
The dough needs more flour.

85
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,793
I'm going to get more.

86
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:30,672
Here.

87
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,420
Thank you.

88
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,620
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

89
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,540
I'm happy that Zea's friends
are staying the night here.

90
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,500
It's not quiet anymore.

91
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,820
- Please, have a drink.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,493
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry.

93
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,220
Aeros. You surprised me.

94
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,740
What are you cooking?
It looks delicious.

95
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,140
I'm sure everyone will be addicted to it.

96
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:04,836
Aeros, you should join
the girls for dinner.

97
00:08:04,973 --> 00:08:06,549
So you can be like an oil tycoon,

98
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:09,020
surrounded by beautiful girls.

99
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,813
What are you talking about?

100
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:12,194
Excuse me.

101
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,046
So funny.

102
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:19,020
- Hi.
- Hi. Zea, is Ares coming?

103
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,780
I don't know. Why?

104
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,220
Nothing.

105
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,340
- Carry on.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,100
- Bye.
- Bye.

107
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:28,241
Bye.

108
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,806
- What are you doing?
- He's mine.

109
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,639
- You already have Moreo.
- What are you two doing?

110
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,700
You've had a boyfriend.

111
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,420
You're being flirty.

112
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
I broke up. So, it's okay.

113
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,318
I've lived for 17 years...

114
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,580
- Never?
- I've been single.

115
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,833
I want to show you something.

116
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,272
That's right.
That's a Wolves sticker.

117
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,329
But I don't know

118
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,525
if we have a member named Radit.

119
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,127
Aeros knows more about that.

120
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:10,573
Here.

121
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,300
Radit.

122
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,660
It's blurry.

123
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:17,746
You better ask Aeros in person.

124
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,660
Okay.

125
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,620
What?

126
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,060
I'm helping you hit the mosquito.

127
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,719
This is taking too long.

128
00:10:03,093 --> 00:10:04,213
Let's go to them.

129
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,060
- Let's go in.
- Of course not. Do you want to die?

130
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,660
Don't play around.
Can you stay put?

131
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,340
Don't be crazy.

132
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,140
Don't ruin this or we'll have to
start from scratch.

133
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,660
When will we stop
snooping around like this?

134
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,780
You two should do this
without me tomorrow.

135
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,500
You can't just diddle around.

136
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,260
When I was in junior high,

137
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,180
I asked a girl to be my girlfriend
with a loud speaker, and it worked.

138
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,819
But we were only together for a month.

139
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,520
And then she broke up with me

140
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,460
using a loudspeaker too.

141
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:45,546
It's actually embarrassing.

142
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:47,253
Ardhan.

143
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,540
Of course I'm left alone
if his girl is around.

144
00:10:55,747 --> 00:10:57,467
Miss, here's your noodles.

145
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:02,759
Do you have the exact amount?
I don't have the change.

146
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,360
- How much is it?
- You don't need to.

147
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,580
- I don't have it.
- It's okay.

148
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,940
Hang on. So, what is it going to be?

149
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,940
- How much is it?
- This? Thirteen rupiahs.

150
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,380
Here.

151
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:19,607
- I still don’t have change for this.
- Keep the change.

152
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,860
Thanks.

153
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,999
Babe.

154
00:11:28,719 --> 00:11:29,839
Thanks.

155
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,620
But you shouldn't have bothered.

156
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,559
But...

157
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,213
The vice president of Calderioz.

158
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,300
How can you be this blue
just because a girl broke up with you?

159
00:11:47,946 --> 00:11:50,226
- Hi, Ardhan.
- Let's eat.

160
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,860
Why didn't they talk to me?

161
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,506
Ardhan.

162
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:59,473
You were approached by two girls.

163
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,913
But you still want
to be back with Karissa?

164
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,412
I'm amazed by you.

165
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,436
You're incredible.

166
00:12:10,126 --> 00:12:11,166
How about this?

167
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,420
Why don't you ask Megan for a suggestion?

168
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,220
He seems to have
a steady relationship with Cleo.

169
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,940
Maybe he has tips and a solution

170
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,540
for you to get back with Karissa
and be happy, and I'll also be happy.

171
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,206
How about that?

172
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,906
(Derlangga High School)

173
00:12:36,152 --> 00:12:37,372
(Error 404)

174
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:46,973
(You have been hacked,
Stop or Die)

175
00:13:11,326 --> 00:13:14,206
I always notice the students at school.

176
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,080
Especially the Calderioz members.

177
00:13:17,786 --> 00:13:19,466
I don't think there's another way.

178
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,020
We have to call their parents here.

179
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,980
I want to give a warning

180
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,647
that if Antares still continues to do
the same thing,

181
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,180
the same violation,

182
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:39,620
- How does this happen?
- I...

183
00:13:40,926 --> 00:13:42,013
I was just...

184
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,318
That...

185
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,660
This is not a trivial matter.

186
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,220
A lot of damage has been done
to the school.

187
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,380
Rocks are often thrown at the school.

188
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,803
So, I hope this is the last time.

189
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,900
Let's hope it's not going to happen again.

190
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:00,776
So, if I still see

191
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:04,940
your son's involvement
in the bike gang at this school,

192
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,733
I will suspend him with a heavy heart.

193
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,140
And I hope this will be
his last violation here.

194
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,100
We can't underestimate the terrors.

195
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,179
The more we underestimate them,

196
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,780
they crazier they get.

197
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,360
You're right.

198
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,540
I'm so pissed.

199
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,140
My mom's lecturing me non-stop at home.

200
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,359
She tells me to study all the time,
just like she tells me to eat.

201
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,220
She should know my brain capacity.

202
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,900
She tells me to join tutoring classes.

203
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,452
Because she knows,

204
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:46,860
that's why she tells you to study.

205
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,140
We don't have any other way for now.

206
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,100
He has succeeded in
reducing our time in Calderioz.

207
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,713
I will not be satisfied
until we have captured Radit.

208
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,580
I agree.

209
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:01,340
I don't care what you're going to do.

210
00:15:01,806 --> 00:15:03,460
But, I'm still going to chase that guy.

211
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,260
I don't care what you're going to do.

212
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,820
But, don't be violent.

213
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,460
What's your name?

214
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,253
- Moreo, Sir.
- Murio?

215
00:15:14,746 --> 00:15:15,786
Moreo.

216
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,820
Oh, Murio.

217
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:21,206
So, what subject do you need tutoring in?

218
00:15:22,846 --> 00:15:25,966
I need tutoring in every subject.

219
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,433
Except for art.

220
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,140
Oh, dear.

221
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,580
Then you need to be tutored from birth.

222
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,140
Okay, I'll tutor you.

223
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,180
But, you have to maintain discipline.

224
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:41,593
Can you do that?

225
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,380
- Serious and disciplined.
- I can.

226
00:15:45,393 --> 00:15:46,673
- Deal?
- Deal.

227
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:48,059
Okay.

228
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,580
Let's start. We will continue
with the previous one.

229
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,846
Hello?

230
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,033
I have a visual on Radit.

231
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,965
(Moreo: Guys, I'm going to follow Radit)

232
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,826
(Ardhan: You're serious? Where are you?)

233
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:22,886
(Ares: Share your location now,
I'm coming!)

234
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,199
Hey!

235
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,020
You can't escape now.

236
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,060
You have to pay for what you did
to the bike gangs.

237
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,960
Come on, Moreo.

238
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:03,459
Go.

239
00:18:03,986 --> 00:19:53,670
(Do not attempt to do this act)

240
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,740
Are you ready?

241
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:13,469
(Do not attempt to do this act)

242
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,060
Come!

243
00:20:15,553 --> 00:21:10,820
(Do not attempt to do this act)

244
00:21:17,047 --> 00:21:18,127
Hello?

245
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,599
What?

246
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,146
Are you sure it's Calderioz?

247
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,180
Okay, I'm on my way.

248
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:46,418
Aeros?

249
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,700
Where are you going?

250
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,152
Aeros, where are you going?

251
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:53,260
Lock the doors!

252
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,780
Aeros!

253
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,353
You won't be able to get it off.

254
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,106
You're not a Wolves member, right?

255
00:22:06,813 --> 00:22:07,853
Answer him.

256
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,206
I'm a Wolves member.

257
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:13,366
You're not.

258
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:16,073
Who gave you the order?

259
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,453
Answer him!

260
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:26,486
The split between Lionel,

261
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,233
Aeros, and Zea who came to Jakarta.

262
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,820
I know everything.

263
00:22:37,926 --> 00:22:39,006
Aeros.

264
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,540
Is he a Wolves member?

265
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,060
How's your sister?

266
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,940
She's getting prettier. I want her.

267
00:22:55,572 --> 00:22:56,612
Who are you?

268
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:00,066
Who are you?

269
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,480
Can't you talk?

270
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:10,759
My little brother

271
00:23:11,246 --> 00:23:12,326
was a Wolves member.

272
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,340
Lionel's best friend, your deputy.

273
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,300
But since Calderioz interfered
in the Wolves’ matters,

274
00:23:22,343 --> 00:23:23,703
my brother has been put in jail.

275
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:25,020
Satisfied?

276
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:28,699
His brother

277
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:30,892
is the one who attacked you
at the hospital.

278
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:33,686
Lionel's guy.

279
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:36,267
And why are you terrorizing us?

280
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,266
Do you have a grudge against me?

281
00:23:39,926 --> 00:23:41,846
- You all talk too much.
- You talk too much.

282
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,380
I talk too much?

283
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,599
- Do you want to die now?
- Aeros.

284
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,746
- Do you want to die now?
- Enough, Aeros.

285
00:23:52,033 --> 00:23:57,206
(Do not attempt to do this act)

286
00:23:58,946 --> 00:24:00,060
You know something?

287
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,860
Your actions can put you in jail.

288
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,260
Do you think I care?

289
00:24:04,933 --> 00:24:06,013
Bastard.

290
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,860
If you are working alone,

291
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,087
how can you be in two places at once?

292
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,580
At the market

293
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:19,780
and near the street vendors.

294
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:21,706
Just admit it.

295
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:25,353
You were the one
who sent those hoodlums, right?

296
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,340
You're all idiots.

297
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:38,905
Ares, let's end him.

298
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:50,693
I'm not the only one worried.

299
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,200
My Mom, too.

300
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:58,247
Ares.

301
00:25:03,513 --> 00:25:04,913
I'm taking Zea back to Bandung.

302
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,600
I'm not coming with you.

303
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,420
Although the perpetrator
has been captured,

304
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,220
we still don't know
how his guys will react.

305
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,180
Don't you feel bad for Mom?

306
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,820
I do feel bad for Mom

307
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,060
because you left her alone in Bandung.

308
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,700
So, you better go back to Bandung
to accompany Mom.

309
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,180
Aeros.

310
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,780
Trust me.

311
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,020
I'll be okay.

312
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,840
I have Ares.

313
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:02,859
I have my friends.

314
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,980
You have to trust me.

315
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,380
- I also have a plan to finish everything.
- What else is there to finish?

316
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,900
- Just like you said.
- What?

317
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:16,513
If Radit really has guys under him

318
00:26:17,146 --> 00:26:20,106
and they run his missions, this means...

319
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,140
That means you're still their target.

320
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,300
Zea, you're coming with me to Bandung.

321
00:26:31,346 --> 00:26:32,355
No.

322
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:34,033
I'm staying here.

323
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:43,913
How about this?

324
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:48,140
I promise to tell you
straight away if something happens.

325
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,100
- How about that?
- No.

326
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,363
You never tell me anything.

327
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:54,099
I always know from someone else.

328
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,197
That was yesterday.

329
00:26:56,302 --> 00:26:59,986
From now on, I promise to tell you
straight away.

330
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,400
Okay?

331
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:03,932
Promise?

332
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:06,753
Promise.

333
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:15,633
What happened?

334
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,540
She's staying.

335
00:27:18,653 --> 00:27:20,333
She's stubborn.

336
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:26,332
- What about you?
- I'm going back to Bandung tomorrow.

337
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:27,633
I have things to do.

338
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,380
Ares.

339
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,340
Let me know if something happen.

340
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,420
Okay. I will.

341
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,420
The police will handle
this case from now on.

342
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,439
- We're leaving first.
- Thank you, Sir.

343
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,100
- Thank you, Sir.
- Bye.

344
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,900
Our problem is finally solved.

345
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,333
We can relax. Am I right?

346
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:30,793
At least we have to celebrate this.
How about that?

347
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,300
Am I right?

348
00:28:33,046 --> 00:28:34,246
Come on.

349
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,500
Yeah, man.

350
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,140
Okay, that's it.

351
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:42,100
I'm going to leave.

352
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:44,079
Where are you going?
We're going to the base.

353
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,540
I'll be there later.

354
00:28:47,046 --> 00:28:48,126
Moreo.

355
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:51,452
Your cheek's salty.

356
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,420
Why did you kiss me?

357
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,700
I've never even been kissed by Selina.

358
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,580
No!

359
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:12,936
(Ardhan: Baby, I'm sorry)

360
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:15,703
(Ardhan: Don't break up with me)

361
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:18,503
(Ardhan: I love you so much)

362
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:30,773
For me?

363
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,519
Thanks, Ares.

364
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,720
Where's Richie?

365
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:16,406
He hasn't come yet.

366
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:24,486
Ares.

367
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,020
Richie isn't that bad, you know.

00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:47,306
Hello?

369
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:50,333
Come home, quick.
Something’s happened at home.

370
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,359
What's wrong, Sandra?

371
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:13,893
- Oh, dear!
- Dad!

372
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,460
How could there be burglars?

373
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,900
I don't know. We just got back home.

374
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:22,513
They broke our CCTVs.
