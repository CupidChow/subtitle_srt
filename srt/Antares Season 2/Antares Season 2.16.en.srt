1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,520
Hi, Mom.

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,760
Calm down.
I've done my detox a few days ago.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,840
I'm good. I'm okay.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,320
Relax, Mom, okay?

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,400
Okay.

6
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:23,999
I love you.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,120
Hi, Zea!

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
Where have you been?

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,760
Why? Miss me?

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,720
Has the school been quiet without me?

11
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:04,153
Want one?

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,720
Why does no one want this?

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,240
It's yummy, you know.

14
00:01:13,953 --> 00:01:15,173
You want to go to the canteen?

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,440
I've had my breakfast.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, okay.

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,760
I'm going there.

18
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:32,526
Hi, guys.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,240
Anya, miss me?

20
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,942
Richie!

21
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:39,880
Hi, of course. Where have you been?

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,520
Of course, yes. Hang on.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,960
Hi!

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,067
I had urgent business.

25
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,160
Not bad, I got a few days off school.

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,760
Is that so? But nobody is asking.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,360
Nobody asked.

28
00:01:57,739 --> 00:01:59,459
I thought you all missed me.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,400
I know Zea missed me.
She asked me earlier where I have been.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
What did you say about Zea?

31
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,846
Chill, Ares. I won't take her from you.

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
Guys.

33
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:15,253
I'll pay everything you all want,
order anything and leave it to me.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,600
Thank you.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,120
Ares.

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,360
Do you know that Anya still adores you?

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,080
If you don't want her,

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,320
let me take a shot at her.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,360
That's impossible.

40
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,940
What do you think?

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,640
If he wants her,
he would've long been with her.

42
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
Okay.

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
So,

44
00:02:45,953 --> 00:02:49,193
is there any update while I was gone?

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
You talk too much.

46
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,246
You want this?

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,230
You want this?

48
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:11,842
Ares.

49
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,360
See you.

50
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,680
Thank you again, Richie.

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,980
Come on.

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,440
Karissa and Selina are being terrorized.

53
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680
Terrorized how?

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Someone keeps texting them.

55
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,440
Asking for pictures, asking to meet them.

56
00:03:36,213 --> 00:03:37,253
What about you?

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,160
Are you also being terrorized?

58
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,160
It was only a while ago.

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,720
I thought he was only fooling around.

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,200
Eventually he stopped.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
Why didn't you tell me?

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,720
That's the reason.

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,240
I thought they were going to stop.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,440
But after Radit was apprehended,

65
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,440
the messages have become more frequent.

66
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,920
Then, it stopped.

67
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,560
But suddenly, Selina is terrorized again.

68
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,320
And Karissa, too.

69
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,087
So who else you said?

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,560
Karissa, Selina, and I.

71
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,599
But they're different people.

72
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,560
The one terrorizing them
is different from the one bothering me.

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,040
Where are the others?

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,600
I think they're at the canteen.

75
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:36,880
Cleo.

76
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,906
What's up?

77
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you know,

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,400
what's the problem
between Ares and Richie?

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,316
Why does it feel like
there's a distance between them?

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,240
I don't know.

81
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,640
They should've been friends again
after my incident.

82
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:10,899
But I think they had a fight
right after that.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,320
Well, I don't know for sure.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,240
They had made up
and something must've happened.

85
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,080
You get what I mean.

86
00:05:20,207 --> 00:05:22,967
You mean, there was another problem?

87
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
I don't know.

88
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,760
Is there no clue at all?

89
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,559
Someone sent a package.

90
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:54,586
For whom?

91
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,840
It's written here, "To Calderioz."

92
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:07,247
Moreo.

93
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,860
- This isn't your diet pills, right?
- No.

94
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,006
The address was to my house.

95
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,356
(The kerambit will be returned)

96
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:03,680
(After all the motorbike gangs
stop operating)

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
I will never disband Calderioz.

98
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,560
So, it's true.

99
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,313
Their intention is to
disband all bike gangs.

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
I've always paid attention to you, Ares.

101
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,520
So, I know that
you're still active in Calderioz.

102
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,520
Do you remember
when I called your parents?

103
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:02,800
Remember what we talked about?

104
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,840
If you're going to focus on your studies,

105
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,040
you need to leave Calderioz.

106
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm only talking to you

107
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,520
because the others
will follow their leader.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,560
The national exam is approaching.

109
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,360
Aren't you thinking about your future?

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
I know you're smart.

111
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,080
That's why I'm confused,
why would you be in a bike gang?

112
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,120
I can still focus on the national exam

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,640
while taking care of Calderioz.

114
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,470
A rock was thrown at our school,

115
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:38,360
our website was hacked.

116
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,960
Those have something to do
with Calderioz, right?

117
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,920
I will find out who did it.

118
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,520
No. That's not what I mean.

119
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,080
You need to focus on your studies.

120
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,600
You need to be out of Calderioz.

121
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,520
I can expel you if need be.

122
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,146
Sorry.

123
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,840
But I can't leave my responsibilities
in Calderioz.

124
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,680
I will find out who did it.

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,240
How about this?

126
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,920
If you don't pass the tryout,

127
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
you have to leave Calderioz.

128
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,840
If you can't keep your promise,

129
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,000
I will expel you.

130
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,920
You're not alone, bro.

131
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:57,973
(Lilbuddy: Can't help but
to text you 24 hours)

132
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,390
(Selina: Guys, I'm scared.
I think someone's stalking me)

133
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,742
(Zea: When, Selina? Where are you now?)

134
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,283
(Selina: At home, Zea)

135
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:33,893
- Hello, Moreo.
- Hey. What's up?

136
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,160
- I think someone's stalking me.
- What do you mean?

137
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,200
He's in front of my house right now.

138
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,840
I'm scared. No one else is home right now.
What should I do?

139
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:46,021
I'm with my mother,
visiting my relative at a hospital.

140
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,840
How about this?
Order some food online, okay?

141
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,200
To look as if people are in the house.

142
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,960
And make sure to lock your doors.

143
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm going to pick you up in the morning.

144
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,013
Calm down. The person's not here anymore.

145
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,280
The person's not here anymore.

146
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm scared. What if he's targeting me?

147
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,680
"Targeting you"?

148
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,520
No one else is targeting you! Only me!

149
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,120
- I'm serious!
- Why are you hitting me?

150
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,440
You'll like me even more.

151
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,520
Don't kid around!
I don't want to go to school with you!

152
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,665
Okay, then. I'll leave you alone.

153
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:30,400
I'll let you get stalked
by that creepy guy.

154
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,560
Moreo.

155
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,680
- Are you coming with me?
- Okay.

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
You're safe with me.

157
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,440
Are you sure this is going to work?

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
Trust me.

159
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
Your agreeing to meet with them

160
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
will put them into our trap.

161
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,880
When will we execute this plan?

162
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,800
I can't wait to beat the person
who's bothering my baby!

163
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm ready any time for Cleo.

164
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,600
Salma.

165
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,800
Salma, come here.

166
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,640
- Salma.
- Serra? Why don't you come in?

167
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,000
- I'd like to ask you something.
- About what?

168
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,400
A few days ago,
I saw you getting scolded by Jayden.

169
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,680
Jayden even broke a plate.

170
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,396
Oh, that.

171
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,040
Here's what happened.

172
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,320
I broke the plate by accident.

173
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,320
He scolded me because of my clumsiness.

174
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,520
- So, he...
- No.

175
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,680
He's the nicest guy.
He never scolds any staff.

176
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,400
I had made a big mistake that time.

177
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,320
But he was nice again to me afterwards.

178
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:33,859
- Okay.
- I'm going to head over there.

179
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,840
- Aren't you going in?
- I will.

180
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,840
- Bye.
- Thanks.

181
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,640
- Is it spicy? Really, you sure?
- No.

182
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,920
Selina's sending me a message.

183
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,026
A photo of them.

184
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,040
The bastard's around here then.

185
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,160
Look at the photo again.

186
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:23,086
There he is! Come on!

187
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,800
I got you now!

188
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,763
(Do not attempt to do this act)

189
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,120
These guys here are
the girls' boyfriends you're stalking.

190
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:52,132
So, you better tell us
why you're doing this.

191
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:53,966
Answer her!

192
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,400
Get up! Come here!

193
00:15:03,376 --> 00:15:05,440
I swear I was only did what I was told do.

194
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,906
By whom?

195
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,413
I don't know.

196
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,640
I got the orders by phone.

197
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,200
I was told to terrorize you guys.

198
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,160
- Don't lie.
- I swear. I'm not lying.

199
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
What were the exact orders?

200
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,240
I was only told to terrorize you all.

201
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,960
I got a call and I was given money.

202
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,280
Why would you obey someone you don't know?

203
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,833
Freak!

204
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,870
- You got the orders by phone?
- That's right.

205
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,440
A guy or a girl?

206
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,760
A guy. It was a guy's voice.

207
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,520
Calderioz.

208
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,240
Retro, Delasga.

209
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:05,673
Adams.

210
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,560
And all the bike gangs.

211
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:10,086
We all need to unite.

212
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,800
We need to find the perpetrator together.

213
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,880
We already have a clue.

214
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
Calz Angels' girls were terrorized.

215
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,520
And after we investigated it,

216
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,040
the perpetrator was only an accomplice.

217
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,280
He purposely made lots of accounts
to terrorize them.

218
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
And what's more important,

219
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,080
he was instructed by someone
whom we still don't know.

220
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,360
It could be anyone.

221
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,440
But one thing is for sure,

222
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,720
he knows everything about bike gangs.

223
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,480
Everything about us.

224
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,920
One more thing.

225
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,480
I found a pattern.

226
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,180
This guy

227
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,440
got instructions from someone who knows
he has a vendetta against Calderioz.

228
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,680
This social media guy, too.

229
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,760
He claimed he got orders from someone.

230
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
But they don't know who contacted them.

231
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,640
They were just given money

232
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,760
and were threatened
if they didn't obey.

233
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,560
Our enemy is invisible right now.

234
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,800
We can't move individually.

235
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,640
And we can't use our usual ways.

236
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,560
We need to set a strategy

237
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,900
to catch this bastard.

238
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,840
And I hope,

239
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,760
Retro, Delasga, Adams

240
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,200
and all the bike gangs...

241
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,680
We need to unite as one.

242
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,560
Retro will follow you, Ares.

243
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,120
Thank you.

244
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,140
Thank you.

245
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,460
Nice, Arka.

246
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,160
Delasga won't just stand by
and do nothing.

247
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,840
Thank you, Delasga.

248
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,920
Retro comeback.

249
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,560
Delasga's on board.

250
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,360
Ares.

251
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,760
I know you don't like this.

252
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,720
But now we know
that Richie isn't the perpetrator.

253
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:39,073
The bike riders criminal acts
are happening again.

254
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,277
The criminal used a sharp weapon,

255
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:45,120
a small blade to hurt the victim.

256
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:48,703
Oh, my God!

257
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:53,160
These bad things done by these people!

258
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:57,526
Knives are used to
cut onions or veggies,

259
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,400
not to hurt people!

260
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,280
How uncivilized!

261
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,640
How could people do that? Heartless!

262
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,880
- Hello?
- It's different from our kerambit, Ares.

263
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,080
- Just similar.
- Really?

264
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,800
I'm certain.

265
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,093
Don't think about it.

266
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,920
Let's just focus on
finding the perpetrator.

267
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,880
Let's not be distracted by these things.

268
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,080
Maybe that's what the perpetrator wants.
He wants us to divide us.

269
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,360
Okay.

270
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,320
Thanks.

271
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,760
What did he say?

272
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,360
Only that they're similar.

273
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:53,185
Okay. I think I need to map out

274
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,463
the locations of the crimes.

275
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,600
Maybe it'll help us
find the perpetrator faster.

276
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:44,526
The ones that have never been attacked
are Karissa's house,

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,920
Serra's house, Slice of Happiness

278
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,680
and Cleo's house.

279
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,280
The guys and I went to Cikini.

280
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,599
But we didn't find anything.

281
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,320
But the guys said
there's something suspicious in Manggarai.

282
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,686
But I..

283
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,706
Richie.

284
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
You don't need to apologize.

285
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
I've forgiven you.

286
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,480
I need to apologize

287
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,400
for accusing you.

288
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,240
Forgive me.

289
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,040
You accused me

290
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,400
because you hoped I was the perpetrator.

291
00:22:09,486 --> 00:22:11,686
But it wasn't me, Ares.

292
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm not the old Richie.

293
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,840
I have totally quit now.

294
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,560
I'm a different person.

295
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,240
Why would I go all the way to New York
if it wasn't for rehab?

296
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,160
And this...

297
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,960
I've heard those words before.

298
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,240
I lied at that time. I'm sorry.

299
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,000
But not now.

300
00:22:56,053 --> 00:22:57,093
Ares.

301
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,960
I miss the old times, dude.

302
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,520
Really.

303
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,800
Tonight, we're going to race
at the usual place, right?

304
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,200
- You're not going to be weird, right?
- No way. Chill, man.

305
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,320
Okay.

306
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,640
- Alright.
- I think it's done.

307
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,600
Hang on.

308
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,480
Try turning it on.

309
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,373
Okay.

310
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,520
Come on.

311
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,200
We did it, bro!

312
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
- Bro for life.
- Bro for life!

313
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,600
It was fun, Ares. Relax.

314
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:08,890
It's not funny, Richie!

315
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,501
What if we got caught?

316
00:24:11,253 --> 00:24:13,377
No one can chase us.

317
00:24:13,477 --> 00:24:15,773
We won't get caught, there was nobody.

318
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,240
Are you on it again?

319
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,040
What? No!

320
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,960
No! No, man. Come on.

321
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
Don't lie!

322
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,073
Listen to me!

323
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
You can ruin Calderioz!

324
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
Ruin our dreams!

325
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,640
Sweet dream, bro.

326
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,720
If you're really clean,

327
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm proud to have you back in Calderioz.

328
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,459
But if you haven't...

329
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
I won't be here if I haven't.

330
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,320
I have my own reason for being missing
the other day.

331
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,320
I was in detox and I was exhausted.

332
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,880
Just to stop...

333
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,840
I had too much sugar intake.

334
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,880
Maybe I got a sugar rush.

335
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,480
You're funny.

336
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,840
Reduce your lollipop consumption.

337
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,906
The guys don't know
anything about me, right?

338
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,000
If they knew,

339
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,760
they won't accept you.

340
00:25:56,812 --> 00:25:57,919
You're right.

341
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,520
You still owe me a race.

342
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,760
We don't need to do that
because I will surely win.

343
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:08,536
Try me. Prove it.

344
00:26:08,637 --> 00:26:10,880
I will surely win.
Don't you even try.

345
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,800
Guys.

346
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,160
That's more like it.

347
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,765
You're silly.

348
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,640
Let's play a guessing game.

349
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:41,566
- "A guessing game"? Okay.
- Yeah.

350
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:44,013
- Guess the card game? No!
- No.

351
00:26:44,121 --> 00:26:48,327
No, what’s the tenth letter
of the alphabet?

352
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:50,516
"J".

353
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:51,680
Right.

354
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:54,061
The first letter of Ares' name.

355
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,040
- "A"?
- The fourth letter of the alphabet?

356
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:58,741
The fourth... "D".

357
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,800
The first letter of our country's name?

358
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:05,061
- Indonesia, "I".
- Right.

359
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,880
The first letter of Karissa's ex's name.

360
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,680
- So long, what are we doing?
- Just go along with it. Please.

361
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,200
- Ardhan, "A".
- Correct.

362
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,720
What about the first letter
of my favorite anime character?

363
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
- How would I know? What?
- Naruto!

364
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,760
- "Naruto"?
- N.

365
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,120
Okay.

366
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
Can you be serious?

367
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,080
Okay.

368
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,440
Can you be serious?

369
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,840
I need you to be serious.

370
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,280
The second last letter of the alphabet.

371
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,360
The second...
Are we doing this until tomorrow?

372
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,880
- Selina.
- What?

373
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,770
This is important.
Very important for the both of us.

374
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,901
For...

375
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:48,273
For the whole world.

376
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:50,146
So, I suggest you write this down.

377
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,000
- It'll be more important from now on.
- Hang on.

378
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
Okay?

379
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,207
Okay.

380
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,040
J-A-D-I-A-N And then what?

381
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,480
- What?
- Y, was it?

382
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,840
Yes, Y.

383
00:28:03,793 --> 00:28:07,709
And when we want to borrow some money,

384
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:09,883
We...

385
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:13,086
- "Utang" (borrow).
- Right, but without the "ng".

386
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,720
"U"?

387
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,760
And the eleventh letter of the alphabet.

388
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,116
- The eleventh... "K".
- Right.

389
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,440
- And then?
- That's it.

390
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:25,246
"Jadian yuk" (Let's be a couple)?

391
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:26,639
Let's go.

392
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,880
- You're crazy!
- You're hitting me. You're touching me.

393
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,160
There's no doubt you like me.

394
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,520
There's no doubt, you like me
since you were touching me.

395
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,120
TM, Touching Moreo.

396
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,200
You're so full of yourself. No way!

397
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,960
So...

398
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,920
- What?
- Yes or no? No or yes?

399
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:58,386
Will you be my girlfriend?

400
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,360
- What?
- I forgot to bring something.

401
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:18,993
Are you going to get it?

402
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,076
I think it'll take some time.

403
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:22,920
It's heavy.

404
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,800
- It's okay.
- Would you wait a moment?

405
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,960
Okay.

406
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,280
- I'm going to take care of that.
- Okay.

407
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:14,590
(To be continued)
