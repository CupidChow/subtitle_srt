1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,063
I can't stop thinking,

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,800
do you know the places he often visits?

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,150
There are some places,

4
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,240
but I'm not certain if he's there.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,797
No problem. Can you send them to me?

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,420
Okay.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,600
I've sent them.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,957
Okay. Thanks, Serra.

9
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:49,759
Zea

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,553
What's up, Serra?

11
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,960
Are you sure Jayden is involved?

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,677
I know you're shocked.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,820
But his alibi is strong.

14
00:01:19,026 --> 00:01:20,046
I'm going to leave, okay?

15
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:22,743
Please, when you hear from him,

16
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,000
let me know right away.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,440
- Bye.
- Bye.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,320
(Jayden: Thanks for accompanying me
to my mom's grave)

19
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,680
Excuse me, have you seen this guy?

20
00:01:57,183 --> 00:02:00,299
- Sorry, I haven’t.
- Me neither.

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,003
- Thanks.
- Okay.

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,436
Excuse me, have you ever seen this guy?

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,800
- No.
- No?

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,560
Thank you.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Excuse me, have you ever seen this guy?

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,800
- No.
- No.

27
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,200
Thanks.

28
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,600
- No.
- Thanks.

29
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:25,713
Excuse me, have you ever seen this guy?

30
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:26,923
No.

31
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,664
- Thanks.
- Excuse me...

32
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:49,863
Why did you do all this?

33
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:52,083
Where's Cleo?

34
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:55,760
Why did you do this?
Why did you lie to me?

35
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,200
I was forced to do it!

36
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:59,403
You kidnapped Cleo, my best friend.

37
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,542
Have you lost your mind?

38
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,469
And the police are involved now. I...

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,180
I just don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

40
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:14,040
I didn't mean for it to go this far.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,530
You know

42
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,040
how painful it is to lose someone.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,617
That's what I've been feeling.

44
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,820
Them!

45
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,853
Whoever they are!

46
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,020
They have taken the only person I had.

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,777
My mother, Serra.

48
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,426
I just want them to disband.

49
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,097
I know I'm wrong.

50
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:13,797
But, there's nothing else I can do.

51
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,420
I need to

52
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,400
find the person responsible
for my mother's death.

53
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,357
If they're not disbanded,

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,333
I will keep on being like this.

55
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:42,773
Jayden.

56
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,719
Jayden.

57
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,763
Jayden, listen to me.

58
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,530
Listen to me, Jayden.

59
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,190
It's not too late. You can still change.

60
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:58,296
I know you're a good person, Jayden.

61
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,003
I'm sure you can change.

62
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,393
You can't be vengeful.

63
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,120
This is not what your mother
would've wanted, Jayden.

64
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:19,463
I'm sure she wanted you to live happily.

65
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,680
To run your cafe, to live your life

66
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,223
and not like this.

67
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,180
Nothing is too late.

68
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,560
You can change. I will help you.

69
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,483
I will help.

70
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,206
But, please.

71
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,419
I'm begging you to let Cleo go.

72
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,960
You can find Cleo at this address.

73
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,320
The address is on the back.

74
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:07,127
Where are you going?

75
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,210
Where are you going?

76
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,759
Don't ever look for me anymore.

77
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,353
Please.

78
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,483
Give that to Ares.

79
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:48,523
Jayden.

80
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:55,526
Did you ever

81
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,186
really love me?

82
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,246
- Cleo. Hang on.
- Cleo!

83
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,456
Are you okay?

84
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,876
Cleo! Oh, dear!

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,800
- Cleo!
- Thank God you're okay, Cleo.

86
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,723
I'm thankful you're safe.

87
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,690
But are you okay?

88
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,703
It's okay, darling.

89
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,410
Here. Jayden asked me to give this to you.

90
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,960
Okay.

91
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,803
He's actually a good person.

92
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:50,906
His mother died
in the middle of a motorbike gang riot.

93
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:55,397
The night before,
he had set up Mother's Day dinner.

94
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,000
- What's happening?
- There's a fight between bike gangs.

95
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,320
- "Bike gangs"?
- Yes, Calderioz.

96
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,600
Mom!

97
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,000
Mom!

98
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,080
Mom.

99
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,363
Don't leave me, Mom.

100
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,890
Mom!

101
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
Mom!

102
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,617
Can you imagine?

103
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:45,364
The only person he had in this world
was his mother.

104
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,463
And that riot took everything he had.

105
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,260
I've told him that Calderioz was attacked,
not the one who hit her.

106
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,886
The one who hit her
were the thugs who attacked Calderioz.

107
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,360
But I don't know if he understood.

108
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,400
But what he did was wrong.

109
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:05,440
It was wrong.

110
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,567
I'm not going to justify that.

111
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:11,546
Especially, since he involved
Cleo in this.

112
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,497
I don't know why, but I'm certain

113
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,457
that he can change.

114
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,813
I can't hate Jayden.

115
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:27,086
Whatever he has done,
I can never hate him.

116
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,317
Because I know he had a strong reason.

117
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,937
He just wants

118
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:36,226
bike gangs to stop creating
riots or disturbances.

119
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,000
That's what he wants.

120
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,603
Not every bike gang creates riots.

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,777
But still, there are victims.

122
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,600
As long as bike gangs
are still out there,

123
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,186
Jayden thinks there will
always be victims.

124
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,946
- Yes, Ares?
- I have the karambit.

125
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,406
As the investigator team,
we would like your permission

126
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,200
to investigate Cleo's case.

127
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:31,877
Okay, go ahead.

128
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,383
I know the person.

129
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,040
His name is Jayden.

130
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,797
Hey. Let's go home.

131
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,633
I'm leaving first.

132
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,520
Bye.

133
00:12:13,852 --> 00:12:14,990
What's wrong with your foot?

134
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,000
- Are you okay?
- It still hurts a bit.

135
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,680
It's fun.

136
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,240
- Can you do that?
- I can't.

137
00:12:58,397 --> 00:12:59,397
It's Moreo.

138
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,120
- So weird.
- Moreo?

139
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,080
Moreo!

140
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:16,916
Ares, too?

141
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:20,699
Richie, too?

142
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,720
What is this?

143
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,160
Girls, what are you doing?

144
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:30,739
Babe.

145
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm sorry

146
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,410
that all this time

147
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,139
I asked too much from you.

148
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,426
Yet, I didn't have a lot of time for you.

149
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,840
You shouldn't have had
to make a bucket list

150
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,950
just to get some time with me.

151
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:01,830
You're more important than everything.

152
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,523
I miss your smile, Karissa.

153
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,203
I will fulfill everything you ask of me.

154
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,920
I will practice dance if need be.

155
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,497
Because I want to be inside your world.

156
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:52,725
Babe.

157
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,386
Let's fall in love again.

158
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,830
Now I'm going to focus
on the national exam.

159
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,323
Whatever your decision,

160
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,839
I'll support it.

161
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:41,445
Because I know
you've thought about it well.

162
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,013
Thank you.

163
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,979
Isn't the dance competition soon?

164
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,353
But everything's ready,
including the costume.

165
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,520
We just have to perform.
I hope we win.

166
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Amen.

167
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,400
What about your street race?

168
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,753
Are you going to join?

169
00:17:03,913 --> 00:17:05,103
The guys would love to join.

170
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,750
But I think I'm going to focus
on the national exam.

171
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I want us to be like this forever.

172
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:19,152
I don't.

173
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:21,863
Why?

174
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,553
You want us to forever be high schoolers?

175
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,480
That's not what I meant.

176
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,017
Without further ado,

177
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,400
let's welcome Calz Angels!

178
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,440
I just found out
that they are called Calz Angels.

179
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:07,547
Okay.

180
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:11,299
There are two candidates
in front of us

181
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,320
for the Winners of
High School Dance Competition 2022.

182
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,880
Okay, I'll announce the winner.

183
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:29,973
The winner of the
High School Dance Competition 2022 is...

184
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:40,845
Congratulations to Calz Angels
from Derlangga High School!

185
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:55,393
Calz Angels, rawr!

186
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,957
Congratulations.

187
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,459
- Thanks.
- Congrats, guys.

188
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,006
Thanks.

189
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:06,419
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

190
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,640
Can we...

191
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,440
What? What is it?

192
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:22,313
Selina.

193
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,750
Let's move up our
official relationship date.

194
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,235
What do you mean?

195
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,230
Well, let's not wait for me to graduate.

196
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:35,513
So?

197
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,233
Let's make it official now.

198
00:20:45,219 --> 00:20:46,319
What do you think?

199
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,619
Do you want to?

200
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,380
Do you?

201
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,186
Why are you forcing me?

202
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,536
I'm not forcing you.

203
00:20:58,346 --> 00:20:59,503
I'm persuading you.

204
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,633
Okay, then.

205
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:15,499
- Okay, then.
- Okay, then?

206
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,777
Yes.

207
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,440
- "Okay, then" what?
- Let's date.

208
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,560
Let's...

209
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,520
Let's date.

210
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,120
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

211
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:31,813
Seriously?

212
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Congratulations on our new couple!

213
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:45,899
What are you fussing about?

214
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,440
- What's happening?
- Someone has a girlfriend.

215
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:52,301
- We are besties.
- "Besties"?

216
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:02,037
Congratulations

217
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,160
on winning the dance competition.

218
00:22:08,893 --> 00:22:09,933
Thanks.

219
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,266
I realize now

220
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,910
that you're worthy for Ares.

221
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,583
All this time,

222
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
I thought I would never let go of Ares

223
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,950
if the girl isn't better than me.

224
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,963
But it turns out,

225
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,443
one's feeling isn't about who is better.

226
00:22:44,126 --> 00:22:45,236
So,

227
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,399
forgive me.

228
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,170
Are you being sincere?

229
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,703
Very much.

230
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,553
I feel like it's not my time

231
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:02,113
to be envious anymore

232
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,040
especially it's almost national exam.

233
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,600
I could fail my test
if someone wished me bad.

234
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:08,610
I forgive you.

235
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,015
Don't worry.

236
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,596
If you fail your exam,

237
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,880
I'm willing to fail with you.

238
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,782
Let it go.

239
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,956
Instead of thinking about Ares,
you're better off with me.

240
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,777
I'm more good looking than Ares.

241
00:23:27,026 --> 00:23:28,306
Am I right?

242
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,010
We're leaving.

243
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,363
Thanks, Richie.

244
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:48,406
You're so cheeky.

245
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:50,186
Really?

246
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,800
(Be Quiet, Exam in Progress)

247
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,640
I passed!

248
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,080
- What about me?
- I passed!

249
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,040
- You! You passed!
- I passed!

250
00:24:25,253 --> 00:24:28,297
We passed!

251
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,480
(Graduates)

252
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,680
Congratulations to all of you.

253
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,080
And I'm proud of Ares

254
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,920
for graduating with great scores

255
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,920
and able to split his time,
just as he promised.

256
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:05,285
And I hope all of you

257
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:07,680
can get into the major
you want in college.

258
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,160
Once again, congratulations to all of you!

259
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,680
- I'd like to write, too!
- Please.

260
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:03,212
Ares.

261
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:06,846
There's something
I need to talk to you about.
