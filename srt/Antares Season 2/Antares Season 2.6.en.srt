1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,043
If this keeps happening,

2
00:00:08,157 --> 00:00:10,233
one by one, the Calderioz members
will get hurt.

3
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:13,503
I don't want you to get hurt.

4
00:00:14,627 --> 00:00:16,883
At least, watch your back.

5
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:21,729
Don't worry,

6
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:24,183
I can take care of myself.

7
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:26,776
Are you sure Richie is behind all this?

8
00:00:32,146 --> 00:00:33,889
I have suspicions.

9
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:35,726
But,

10
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,023
maybe it's not him.

11
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:21,216
Selina.

12
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,229
Do you remember when Ares' gala dinner is?

13
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:27,947
It's on Saturday, 17th.
Why are you asking?

14
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,766
I have a photoshoot.

15
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Karissa.

16
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:35,340
Ardhan will be mad at you
if you don't come.

17
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:39,143
Please come or it's going to
get awkward with Ares.

18
00:01:39,507 --> 00:01:41,337
This is the first time
the Aldevaro's family

19
00:01:41,437 --> 00:01:43,323
has invited us to their gala dinner!

20
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:46,720
What should I wear?

21
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,387
Don't make my head hurt even more.

22
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:52,667
He's here, I'm scared.

23
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:56,176
Hi, babe.

24
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:58,547
You look tense.

25
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:00,076
Why did you post that picture?

26
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,049
Why not?

27
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,549
You've become a model,

28
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,353
but I don't feel comfortable
seeing you in those pictures.

29
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:12,663
Do you think I'm comfortable

30
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:15,227
seeing you everyday with your gang

31
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:17,093
since it's facing serious problems?

32
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:19,906
But have I ever forbid you?

33
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:21,819
Never.

34
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,136
Because I know it's your hobby.

35
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:26,769
I know Calderioz is your dream.

36
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,576
Have you ever thought of mine?

37
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:30,836
The point is,
I don't like you doing that stuff.

38
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:33,409
I have the right to wear whatever I want.

39
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:35,408
My body, my choice!

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,149
You have no right to control
what I should wear.

41
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,287
I know you're my boyfriend.

42
00:02:42,493 --> 00:02:44,046
But that doesn't give
you the right to tell me

43
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:46,202
what to do, where to go, or what to wear.

44
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:47,903
You don't!

45
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:50,783
Your ego being bruised
doesn't grant you the right to control me.

46
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:55,956
What just happened? Babe!

47
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:58,358
One, two, three and four.

48
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,850
Five, six, seven, eight!

49
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,164
Guys, can we take a break?

50
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:14,209
Guys, did you hear Moreo
got into an accident last night?

51
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:15,916
Yeah.

52
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,482
Do they know who did that to him?

53
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:21,569
Not yet.

54
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,883
But, Moreo doesn't know who it is.

55
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:27,311
- This is scary.
- I know.

56
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:32,616
I have to go.

57
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,557
Another photoshoot?

58
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:45,959
Will you be my date for the gala dinner?

59
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,676
- What are you wearing?
- Something dashing, of course.

60
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:56,436
You have something on your mind?

61
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:00,296
Tell me.

62
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:04,109
I'm tired.

63
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,269
If you are tired, sleep.

64
00:04:09,385 --> 00:04:11,083
I don't understand Karissa.

65
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:13,543
She's the dance squad captain.

66
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:16,556
But she doesn't seem to care
about practice.

67
00:04:19,105 --> 00:04:20,905
Does she know the dance competition
is so important

68
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,336
and we have to defend
the championship title.

69
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:27,793
Being the winner of this competition

70
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,869
is the only thing that
I could be proud of.

71
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:31,369
I don't understand.

72
00:04:32,465 --> 00:04:34,180
I'm not as smart as Cleo.

73
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,643
Or even Serra.

74
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:38,983
I'm not as courageous as Zea.

75
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,529
I'm not as pretty as Karissa
who can become a model.

76
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,496
I don't have any accomplishments.

77
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:50,601
Being in the dance squad

78
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:53,025
is the only thing that I'm proud of.

79
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:55,788
Selina.

80
00:04:58,905 --> 00:04:59,993
Coming from me,

81
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:02,545
this might sound cliche.

82
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:06,323
But you should stop comparing yourself
with your friends.

83
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:09,029
It'll only gives you headaches.

84
00:05:11,197 --> 00:05:14,957
If I compare myself
with the other Calderioz members...

85
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:18,505
You know how good looking they are, right?

86
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,416
I'm good looking too,

87
00:05:20,517 --> 00:05:22,090
but not striking hot like they are.

88
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:24,303
That would send me
right into depression.

89
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,876
I know for sure

90
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:31,844
that your team will win.

91
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,820
I know you created the routines,

92
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,985
and I think you're talented.

93
00:05:49,185 --> 00:05:50,403
What's that for?

94
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,149
I've never seen this side of you before.

95
00:05:54,905 --> 00:05:57,345
- But that's just who I am.
- Really?

96
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:04,309
Thanks anyway.

97
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:09,189
Are you okay after the attack?

98
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:13,229
And you suddenly care about me?

99
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:17,883
I'm fine.

100
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:20,723
Selina.

101
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:23,436
You're going to the gala with me, right?

102
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,373
Here's your order.

103
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,573
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

104
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:43,236
Take away?

105
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:46,262
Sorry, yeah.

106
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:53,029
It's pouring.

107
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,682
Don't worry, I have an umbrella.

108
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,018
Oh, my God.

109
00:07:10,366 --> 00:07:12,203
You're soaking wet.

110
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,736
I'm fine, get in.

111
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:16,829
Thank you.

112
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:19,265
Take care.

113
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,130
Bye.

114
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:28,616
Has Ares replied to you yet?

115
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:32,829
Will he come?

116
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:35,143
I think he has a fitting appointment
for the gala dinner.

117
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:39,033
Then he's not coming?

118
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:41,506
I don't know.

119
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:45,949
Guys,

120
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:48,463
what is he actually focusing on?

121
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:51,483
He's too busy
with his own life, apparently.

122
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:55,802
With his girlfriend, and the gala dinner.

123
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:57,415
Shut your mouth!

124
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:59,596
I bet you're coming
to his gala dinner too.

125
00:08:02,906 --> 00:08:04,622
At least I'm here now

126
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:07,001
after you got attacked.

127
00:08:07,849 --> 00:08:09,243
But the leader is too busy to care.

128
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:12,076
We don'tt have a commander-in-chief.

129
00:08:12,734 --> 00:08:14,622
We did nothing
even though we got attacked.

130
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,716
I can't imagine the future of Calderioz.

131
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,776
You look so cute, Sandra.

132
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,883
And my boy is so handsome.

133
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:40,346
The suit fits perfectly on him.
Thanks, Patty.

134
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,052
Are we done?

135
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,162
The dinner is just in a few more days.

136
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:52,266
No funny business.

137
00:08:55,226 --> 00:08:58,136
Don't create a scene at the gala.

138
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:04,483
Respond when your parent
is talking to you.

139
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:07,536
What do you want me to say?

140
00:09:08,706 --> 00:09:12,069
I thought you're making a point,
not asking me a question.

141
00:09:13,989 --> 00:09:15,545
So, it's still on then?

142
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:20,552
For heaven's sake.

143
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:24,669
Here, let me explain it to you again.

144
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:29,499
Our family has a tradition
of hosting an annual gala dinner.

145
00:09:30,306 --> 00:09:32,026
All the relatives from my side of family
and your father's side of family

146
00:09:32,106 --> 00:09:34,009
will be there.

147
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:38,309
How many times can the whole family meet?

148
00:09:38,848 --> 00:09:40,498
Once a year.

149
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:43,669
Your friends are welcome too.

150
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:46,283
You're having a party
in the middle of a depression.

151
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:50,816
My generous son,

152
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:54,849
we're going to

153
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:57,805
open donations for charity too.

154
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:59,709
Have you forgotten?

155
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,709
That was a question, by the way.

156
00:10:05,211 --> 00:10:06,256
Where's your answer?

157
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:09,742
I remember.

158
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,299
Serra!

159
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,666
Look at this dress.

160
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:54,426
(We're going to the ball together, right?)

161
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,193
(Who's gaining from this?)

162
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:40,453
(Incidents)

163
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,676
(Bombs, attacks, social media terrors)

164
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:46,403
(Who?)

165
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:22,883
Hi, Grandma.

166
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:24,485
Hi!

167
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,632
Hi.

168
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:29,605
So, is this Zea?

169
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,529
Yes, Grandma, this is Zea.

170
00:12:32,987 --> 00:12:34,296
Good evening, Grandma.

171
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,963
You're a perfect couple.

172
00:12:39,186 --> 00:12:40,763
- Please sit down.
- Yes, Grandma.

173
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:42,845
- Zea.
- Auntie.

174
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:45,476
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

175
00:12:46,706 --> 00:12:48,903
Our future daughter-in-law.

176
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,826
The future daughter-in-law.

177
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,743
Enjoy the party, just ignore her.

178
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:59,266
It's okay, Auntie.

179
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:03,129
- Why are you late?
- I had to pick up Zea first.

180
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,486
All the food has been carefully selected,

181
00:13:08,586 --> 00:13:09,986
all of them are delicious.

182
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:13,076
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hello, Moreo.

183
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:16,866
Auntie, Uncle. Sandra!

184
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,165
Enjoy yourselves!

185
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,806
We will.

186
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:21,906
You look cool.

187
00:13:23,426 --> 00:13:25,583
I'm going to get cake, care to join me?

188
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:29,595
- Go!
- Yes, Grandma.

189
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:31,969
I'm going to borrow your girlfriend.

190
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:40,565
Someone's getting married at a young age.

191
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,186
Sandra.

192
00:13:57,306 --> 00:14:00,736
Ares may look tough on the outside,

193
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,403
but he's very soft and caring inside.

194
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:06,597
He's a perfect match for you.

195
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:08,706
Thanks, Grandma.

196
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:14,746
He has a strong sense of pride.

197
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:18,696
He hates to be seen as a weak person.

198
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:20,885
But,

199
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:24,205
he never wants to burden people.

200
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,403
Please be there for him.

201
00:14:29,546 --> 00:14:32,385
I know he's facing
a lot of problems lately.

202
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:37,936
I know all about it from Athena.

203
00:14:40,266 --> 00:14:43,796
I want you to always be beside him.

204
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,196
Because there are so many
bad people out there.

205
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:52,729
So I want you both
to be more careful, okay?

206
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:54,163
Got it?

207
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,219
Yes, Grandma.

208
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,416
I love you.

209
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,350
Moreo.

210
00:15:11,571 --> 00:15:12,623
Looking for someone?

211
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,746
Where's Ardhan?

212
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:15,383
Karissa is not coming either.

213
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:16,796
Where is she, by the way?

214
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:18,943
She has a photoshoot today, right?

215
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:21,658
- It's not the same without her.
- Yeah.

216
00:15:25,306 --> 00:15:26,343
Hello.

217
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:29,496
Good evening, everybody.

218
00:15:30,426 --> 00:15:33,716
It's an honor to be here with you tonight.

219
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,946
And thanks to Uncle Chrysander
and Auntie Athena

220
00:15:37,026 --> 00:15:40,819
for arranging this beautiful gala.

221
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:42,369
You guys are awesome.

222
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,289
And before they force me to sit back down,

223
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:52,639
I just want to say,

224
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:55,386
life is short,

225
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:58,426
so live it well.

226
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:02,336
Enjoy the night, darlings.

227
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:20,879
Ares, take Zea to dance
on the dance floor.

228
00:17:07,906 --> 00:17:09,365
You look so pretty tonight.

229
00:17:11,806 --> 00:17:12,919
You too.

230
00:17:14,257 --> 00:17:15,334
What?

231
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:16,731
I look pretty too?

232
00:17:18,466 --> 00:17:19,716
Of course not.

233
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,383
Thank you for coming.

234
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:33,576
I'm so happy to be welcomed
by your family.

235
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:58,056
(Please don't attempt to do this act)

236
00:17:58,397 --> 00:17:59,969
(Stop or die!)

237
00:18:05,306 --> 00:18:06,496
Care to dance?

238
00:18:09,426 --> 00:18:11,566
Sorry, but I can't.

239
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:13,466
Me neither.

240
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:48,672
You need to come with me outside.

241
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,618
- What's wrong?
- Right now!

242
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,536
- What is it?
- Look at that!

243
00:19:12,266 --> 00:19:13,656
No one's here.

244
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,323
(Stop or die!)

245
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:36,095
Ares, come here!

246
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:38,335
Are you satisfied?

247
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:40,122
Happy?

248
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,800
Are you thrilled to have
ruined the gala dinner

249
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,862
I've worked on for so long?

250
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:47,255
All ruined because of you.

251
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:52,263
I want to hear
his side of the story first.

252
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,723
I don't understand you.

253
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,453
You have a thing for attracting trouble.

254
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:09,906
Can you please just once...

255
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:13,283
I'm sorry I ruined the party.

256
00:20:14,786 --> 00:20:17,103
I promise, I'll find the culprit.

257
00:20:17,312 --> 00:20:18,769
I'm not asking you for that.

258
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,250
But for once in your life,

259
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,569
stay away from trouble.

260
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:28,133
Are you happy to see scared

261
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,706
and worried to death?

262
00:20:29,786 --> 00:20:31,259
Did you even read the message?

263
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:33,842
What does "stop or die" even mean?

264
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:37,579
In front of everybody! Poor, Grandma.

265
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:39,844
Ares.

266
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,212
Enough.

267
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,889
"Stop or die."

268
00:21:09,525 --> 00:21:10,528
Megan?

269
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:20,126
Moreo?

270
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:27,459
Ardhan!

271
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:32,129
Watch your back, Ares.

272
00:23:26,266 --> 00:23:27,576
I heard about last night.

273
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:31,029
We must do something, Ares.

274
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,056
Has anybody dreamt about Aiden?

275
00:23:39,826 --> 00:23:41,393
Last night, I dreamt about him.

276
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:44,769
This is the second time
he appeared in my dream.

277
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:49,549
I think there's something
he is trying to tell me.

278
00:23:50,106 --> 00:23:52,356
Why have I never dreamt about him?

279
00:23:53,746 --> 00:23:55,119
What was he trying to say?

280
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,609
I don't know.

281
00:24:01,327 --> 00:24:02,713
But in my dream,

282
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:05,763
our base is in shambles.

283
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:09,763
Our group pictures are torn apart

284
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,243
as if we've broken up.

285
00:24:16,503 --> 00:24:17,543
Ares.

286
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,682
Last night's incident is a proof

287
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:22,306
that we need to do something.

288
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:25,814
If you are so reluctant to act,
let me do it.

289
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:26,946
I can do it.

290
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:30,123
Let's talk more about that at the base.

291
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,666
Ares!

292
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:39,396
Where were you last night, by the way?

293
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,445
Karissa and I had a fight.

294
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:45,936
And you skipped the gala dinner
because of that?

295
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:47,709
What did you expect me to do?

296
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,269
I'm going to go find Karissa.

297
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,039
Fine.

298
00:25:02,786 --> 00:25:03,945
Where is she?

299
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:23,356
Okay.

300
00:25:23,959 --> 00:25:24,962
What do you want?

301
00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:29,891
I want your help.

302
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:32,146
What kind of help?

303
00:25:36,705 --> 00:25:37,763
Come on.

304
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:42,356
This is ridiculous.

305
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:50,295
Elect me as the commander-in-chief.

306
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:52,902
Come on.

307
00:25:53,625 --> 00:25:55,783
I know you're not
on the same page with Ares.

308
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:58,768
Neither am I.

309
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,309
The situation is very dire.

310
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:07,499
And we can't let it get worse.

311
00:26:08,506 --> 00:26:11,616
Because in my opinion,
last night was the last straw.

312
00:26:12,063 --> 00:26:13,549
We have to do something right now.

313
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:19,216
No, I can't just give you the position.

314
00:26:19,903 --> 00:26:21,172
I'm not the leader.

315
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,059
Come on, man.

316
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,109
We need to do something.

317
00:26:42,026 --> 00:26:43,129
Come on.

318
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,816
I'm still at school.
Just finished with dance practice.

319
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:05,040
What's up?

320
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,703
Yes, Mom.

321
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:26,396
(Please don't attempt to do this act)

322
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:29,269
Zea is fighting outside the gate!

323
00:27:32,186 --> 00:27:52,186
(Please don't attempt to do this act)

324
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,356
Who are you?

325
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,169
Who sent you?

326
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,659
Ares!

327
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:10,029
Zea?

328
00:28:13,856 --> 00:28:19,049
(To be continued)
