1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,780
I'm Ratna, the head of this
boarding house.

2
00:00:05,893 --> 00:00:07,166
You work at that hijab store, right?

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:08,966
I'm worried you'll convert.

4
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:10,979
My faith is strong!

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,686
Astagfirullah!

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,987
- I'm Dika.
- We have similar names.

7
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:18,100
I'm Chika.

8
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:19,220
And you're Dika.

9
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:21,720
The old Ali is gone.

10
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,719
You may now call me "Alim" (*pious).

11
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,612
Help me find a job,
I'll do make up for anyone.

12
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,212
Do you want to be
a mortuary cosmetologist?

13
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:31,973
It's nice since the customer
won't have any requests.

14
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:33,087
(Imperfect The Series 2)

15
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:35,940
(Coming soon on WeTV)

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,940
Ares.

17
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:28,574
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

18
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:35,241
I can't be Calderioz's leader.

19
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:40,568
I don’t have the capability.

20
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:45,838
You're the one who is suitable to lead us.

21
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:50,345
I'm just your deputy.

22
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:52,151
I will always back you up

23
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:54,765
and be by your side.

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,821
I...

25
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:10,174
have failed you too many times.

26
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:17,761
You're the only one who can lead us, Ares.

27
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,114
Come on. Hey.

28
00:02:25,894 --> 00:02:26,924
Hey!

29
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,168
What are you discussing there?

30
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,488
- Hey!
- Crazy!

31
00:02:33,768 --> 00:02:35,408
- Come here!
- Laskar!

32
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:37,269
Laskar!

33
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,648
Laskar!

34
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:41,888
Where have you been?

35
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,288
- Where have you been?
- Miss me?

36
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:46,968
You bet!

37
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,248
I'm moved that you're here.
Do you know why?

38
00:02:53,488 --> 00:02:54,808
Because I'm not single anymore.

39
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:57,288
Oh, dear!

40
00:02:58,408 --> 00:03:00,448
Welcome home, bro!

41
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:02,848
Hey!

42
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:07,706
- Group hug!
- Let's hug!

43
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,128
Let's do a spin!

44
00:03:20,928 --> 00:03:22,218
I'm glad.

45
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,151
It's finally over.

46
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:28,808
And right at the time of Laskar's visit.

47
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:39,621
Honey, hang on.

48
00:03:43,528 --> 00:03:45,218
This picture is from Serra, right?

49
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,361
Right. Why?

50
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:17,865
I don't think it's over yet.

51
00:04:23,528 --> 00:04:24,938
There going to be a finale.

52
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,368
I'm at the location of the street race

53
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:30,448
which is being held
with the permission from the police

54
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:33,848
and bike gangs from
Jakarta and Bandung are participating.

55
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,808
It's good that I came
right when this event is being held.

56
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:40,328
You're right. It's fun.

57
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:43,125
It's cute.

58
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:45,210
Babe.

59
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:47,411
Imagine if I was there.

60
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:49,267
I bet you would be scared, right?

61
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,408
That's for sure.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

62
00:04:51,488 --> 00:04:54,848
You're underestimating me.
I'm an expert. No way.

63
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:56,648
I still won't allow you.

64
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:59,018
If I was there,

65
00:04:59,118 --> 00:05:01,328
I would certainly win.

66
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,821
Don't. It's dangerous.

67
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,227
"Dangerous"? I'm an expert at this.

68
00:05:06,328 --> 00:05:08,328
But you better stay with me.

69
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,681
We finally have a legal place
to hang out like this.

70
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,338
I'm also happy about this.

71
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:15,891
Finally.

72
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,888
- Hey!
- Hey!

73
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:21,608
Selina.

74
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:23,238
Tonight is for you.

75
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:32,928
You can do it!

76
00:05:34,128 --> 00:05:35,608
Win this, Moreo!

77
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,749
Come on, Moreo!

78
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:42,768
Come on, Moreo!

79
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,248
You ended up with him anyway, right?

80
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:58,741
You're annoying.

81
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,288
Okay.

82
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,448
Okay.

83
00:06:40,528 --> 00:06:41,968
The winner is

84
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:43,248
Moreo.

85
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:51,808
- Moreo!
- I told you, it would be Moreo.

86
00:06:52,528 --> 00:06:53,728
Guys.

87
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,447
Moreo.

88
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:04,601
Moreo! You won!

89
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:10,808
I won!

90
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,848
- I want to hug you.
- Can you act normally?

91
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:20,574
Don't do that in public, I'm embarrassed.

92
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:23,504
Let's make up.

93
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,571
Congratulations.

94
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:30,861
Moreo.

95
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:37,208
You're not so bad.

96
00:07:38,648 --> 00:07:39,781
Thank you, bro.

97
00:07:40,328 --> 00:07:42,701
No, man. He's not that good.

98
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,788
He's just lucky.

99
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:48,525
You're just envious. Race with me, then.

100
00:07:51,118 --> 00:07:53,208
Come on, Karissa. You versus me.

101
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:54,938
Now it's my turn.

102
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,248
Laskar!

103
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,421
Stay away, Selina!

104
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:26,048
Leave, hurry!

105
00:08:28,368 --> 00:08:29,968
Hey! Let's go!

106
00:08:30,444 --> 00:09:17,444
(Do no attempt to do this act)

107
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:21,044
Jayden hasn't done anything
these past few months.

108
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:22,931
No attack.

109
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:25,408
He must be preparing something.

110
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,601
Here.

111
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:31,551
He will certainly infiltrate this event.

112
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,051
We need to find a way

113
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:38,051
to differentiate our guys

114
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,207
and theirs.

115
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,488
We're going to wear
the same clothes there.

116
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:48,674
Same color.

117
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:50,948
And we will wear jackets.

118
00:09:51,768 --> 00:09:53,848
When the situation becomes chaotic,

119
00:09:55,014 --> 00:09:56,534
we're going to take off our jackets.

120
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,018
If it's chaotic,

121
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,565
the police will give
a warning shot.

122
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:05,451
At that moment,

123
00:10:06,728 --> 00:10:08,198
we're going to take off our jackets.

124
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,154
And we will know

125
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:13,391
who's on our side

126
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:15,398
and who's the enemy.

127
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,525
One thing is for sure,

128
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,731
we all need to unite

129
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,407
to fight him.

130
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:45,378
(Do not attempt to do this act)

131
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:48,168
Let's go!

132
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:49,928
Hey, come here!

133
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,108
Freeze!

134
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:55,111
Stand still!

135
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,088
What is this?

136
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:00,654
Jayden?

137
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,045
Let me go!

138
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:08,208
What is this?

139
00:11:09,008 --> 00:11:10,334
Ares!

140
00:11:43,324 --> 00:12:29,198
(Do not attempt to do this act)

141
00:12:29,728 --> 00:12:31,331
It's all your fault.

142
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:36,808
My mom is dead because of you
and the bike gangs, bastard!

143
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:48,661
Can you bring her back to life?

144
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:53,138
Can you bring her back to life?

145
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:58,827
Can you bring her back to life?

146
00:13:07,893 --> 00:13:12,980
(Do not attempt to do this act)

147
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:15,128
Richie!

148
00:13:15,848 --> 00:13:17,448
Richie, enough!

149
00:13:17,528 --> 00:13:19,562
Ares! He's the one
we've been looking for!

150
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:20,688
Enough!

151
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:22,120
Enough!

152
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:31,945
Is he the one who ran away?

153
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:33,158
Yes, Sir.

154
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,331
- Take him.
- Yes, Sir.

155
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,411
Stand up.

156
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:41,134
Take him.

157
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,473
Get on your feet!

158
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:47,888
Yes, Sir.

159
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:58,598
- Get in!
- Come on, get in!

160
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,328
Serra, I'm going over there.

161
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:07,988
Sir!

162
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,908
Sorry, but can I talk to him
for just a minute?

163
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:13,151
- Please.
- Thank you, Sir.

164
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:30,088
Ares!

165
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,124
It's over now.

166
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:33,301
Is it?

167
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,467
What do you mean?

168
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:51,187
Ares, stop! Ares!

169
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,481
What's wrong, Zea?

170
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:01,978
I'm certain Jayden did something.

171
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,665
Zea?

172
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,727
Ares!

173
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:20,968
(Bike Gang Tour)

174
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,238
Ares.

175
00:16:28,474 --> 00:16:30,174
- Richie!
- Ares!

176
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:33,021
- Let me go!
- It's dangerous, Richie!

177
00:16:35,568 --> 00:16:38,008
- Ares!
- No!

178
00:16:38,109 --> 00:16:41,309
- Zea.
- Ares!

179
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:42,888
Calm down, Zea.

180
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:45,591
Ares!

181
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:07,018
Guys.

182
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:08,477
Let him be.

183
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,865
It's fine. Ares is okay.

184
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,591
Thank you.

185
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:30,888
Thank you.

186
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,688
Does it hurt? But it's better, isn't it?

187
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,158
Eat this.

188
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:12,661
Open your mouth.

189
00:18:23,248 --> 00:18:24,578
Bro!

190
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,745
So cute!

191
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:38,334
He loves you, too.

192
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:40,648
Cute!

193
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,648
I want that, too.

194
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:51,768
Yes! I win!

195
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,528
Again.

196
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:59,845
The perpetrator behind
the horrible terrors

197
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,488
these past few months
has finally been captured,

198
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:06,488
assisted by several bike gangs
during a street race.

199
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:08,698
I feel like I know him.

200
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:10,917
Isn't he your friend?

201
00:19:12,191 --> 00:19:13,478
Did you know about this?

202
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:17,064
Ares?

203
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,514
I'm asking you.

204
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,088
Is that your friend?

205
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:48,544
I'm not worthy of this.

206
00:19:52,014 --> 00:19:53,141
Ares.

207
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:59,698
As long as there's still anyone
who believes in your leadership,

208
00:20:05,888 --> 00:20:07,388
this is still yours.

209
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,328
Me

210
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:14,991
and the senior Calderioz members

211
00:20:15,968 --> 00:20:17,465
are proud of you.

212
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:22,207
Here.

213
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:24,203
Keep it safe.

214
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:30,551
Thank you.

215
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,970
Yeah.

216
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,658
Guys, look here.

217
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:37,568
One, two...

218
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:44,034
Don't do that!
See? You're going to fall.

219
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,978
The moment we've been waiting for
is finally here.

220
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:57,008
Let's start our bike touring.
Everyone's ready?

221
00:20:57,088 --> 00:20:59,888
- Retro's ready!
- Yeah!

222
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,488
- Delasga's ready!
- Ready!

223
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:04,888
- Is Adams ready?
- Ready!

224
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:07,928
- Calderioz?
- Ready!

225
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,440
Let's go!

226
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:03,728
Boss

227
00:22:04,815 --> 00:22:05,958
A new kid.
