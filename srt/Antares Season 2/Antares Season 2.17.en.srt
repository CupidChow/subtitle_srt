1
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,619
The Kerambit is gone.

2
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,839
That's crazy!

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,933
There was a thief in my house.

4
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,120
Nothing else was stolen.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,720
Just the kerambit.

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,600
If he is the only suspect,

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,446
my kerambit wouldn't be missing.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,160
Radit has been caught by the police.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,360
He did that to...

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,760
To cover up who the real perpetrator is.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,160
He got instructions from someone

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,600
who knows he has
a grudge against Calderioz.

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,360
So the suspect is still out there?

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,760
Even after Radit has been caught?

15
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:05,125
This has something to do
with your missing kerambit.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,426
How many times have you done this?

17
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,459
You fool!

18
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,920
You told me you can manage your time

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,360
between school and the bike gang.

20
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,000
The tryout is just around the corner.

21
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:23,886
If you don't pass,

22
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,040
you have to leave Calderioz.

23
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,160
Can you take up the commitment?

24
00:03:42,547 --> 00:03:43,587
I can, Ma'am.

25
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:46,393
Okay.

26
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,153
Ares, let's go.
You said you're coming to Serra's.

27
00:03:58,254 --> 00:03:59,265
Yes.

28
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:00,719
Let's go.

29
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

30
00:04:08,673 --> 00:04:10,869
Do you want to ride with me or Ardhan?

31
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
With you.

32
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,253
But my shock-breaker is broken
so you can't ride with me.

33
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:20,634
You go with Ardhan.

34
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,720
Here's the helmet.

35
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,250
Sorry we interrupted
your resting time, Serra.

36
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,710
It's okay. I'm glad you all came here.

37
00:04:56,811 --> 00:04:58,131
Thank you, guys.

38
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,933
We came here
because we were worried about you.

39
00:05:01,212 --> 00:05:03,746
Yes, you didn't reply to any of our texts.

40
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:07,099
That's why we were worried
something had happened to you.

41
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,080
Yes, we were.

42
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,960
That's why you should rest well
and be well again.

43
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,160
So, we can practice the dance together.
It's hard to practice without you.

44
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,786
Relax, I'll feel better tomorrow.

45
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,321
I'll come to school tomorrow.

46
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
It's okay, Serra.

47
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,520
We already have someone to cheer us
while we're practicing.

48
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,400
Sorry, not us.

49
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,280
Moreo only watches Selina.

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,880
That's okay.

51
00:05:31,981 --> 00:05:35,176
I can wear the dance outfit
for Selina, it's okay.

52
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:42,000
Serra, the guys brought this for you.

53
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,440
Thank you, you shouldn't have.

54
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:09,206
What are you doing here?

55
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,436
Serra.

56
00:07:19,343 --> 00:07:20,432
Let's go outside.

57
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,520
What is this?

58
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,899
Wait a moment.

59
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,613
You don't think that I have anything to do

60
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,920
with the bike gang issues recently, right?

61
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,293
I can assure you,

62
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't have anything
to do with that.

63
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,301
Then what is this?

64
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,880
Okay, one moment.

65
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,640
(A Woman Was Killed In A Hit and Run
by A Bike Gang Member)

66
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,600
The victim was my mother.

67
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,495
I did all this

68
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,719
to find the killer!

69
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,360
But with the way things are going,

70
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,320
made my investigation even harder.

71
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,686
If the police is involved,

72
00:08:17,493 --> 00:08:19,040
searches are getting more frequent.

73
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,008
Those kids are getting more violent!

74
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,983
The killer is getting more obscure.

75
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,680
Because they act the same.

76
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,560
I didn't tell you this

77
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,400
because of this, Serra.

78
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,080
This is a very personal matter to me.

79
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,840
Of course.

80
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,513
I can't lie to you, Serra.

81
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,760
Please forgive me, Jayden.

82
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,320
I apologize for
thinking negatively about you.

83
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
Jayden.

84
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,903
I can ask for Zea's help.

85
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:26,412
Ares can also help find the killer.

86
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,806
They will certainly help us.

87
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,560
You said

88
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,470
they are going through
a lot of problems now.

89
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,093
Never mind.

90
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,320
It's alright.

91
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:45,053
Let me solve this myself.

92
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,480
Okay?

93
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,050
(Get well very soon beautiful)

94
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:41,936
What?

95
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,753
Nothing.

96
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,923
Is my face dirty?

97
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:51,113
No, it's not.

98
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:54,326
Wipe it, please.

99
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:56,158
No, I won't.

100
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,720
Wipe it.

101
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
No, I won't.

102
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,183
So stingy.

103
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:27,273
Did you assemble this yourself?

104
00:11:28,965 --> 00:11:30,078
A long time ago.

105
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,120
Me and Richie.

106
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,880
I'm glad you made up with Richie.

107
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,080
It turns out, he is a good person.

108
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:51,833
If he's the same as he used to be,

109
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,640
I don't agree
if you call him a good person.

110
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,760
Everyone deserves a second chance.

111
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:04,698
Will it start?

112
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,919
Let's try it.

113
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,680
Yes!

114
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,760
Done.

115
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,400
Thank you, Babe.

116
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:28,165
Ares.

117
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,453
Ares.

118
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Ares.

119
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:34,261
- Meow.
- Stop.

120
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,920
Antares

121
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,873
Sebastian

122
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,000
Aldevaro

123
00:12:45,076 --> 00:12:48,749
(Ardhan: Babe, please don't avoid me.
I miss you)

124
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Your coffee, Sir.

125
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,720
I want to break up.

126
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:07,467
Why?

127
00:13:07,946 --> 00:13:09,135
Because I said so.

128
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:14,656
We can talk this over, Babe.

129
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,300
Ardhan.

130
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,840
We are still in high school.

131
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,480
We should be having fun now.

132
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,880
And not busy with our own problems.

133
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,320
Just go over it one by one, bro.

134
00:13:43,473 --> 00:13:44,753
How come you are here?

135
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:48,347
You're a ghost, aren't you?

136
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,796
You only look big.

137
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,400
Are you afraid of me?

138
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,920
You know

139
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,560
that I'm always here by your side.

140
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,100
Come on, don't think about me.

141
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,046
Just focus on it.

142
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,040
Focus on Karissa.

143
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,360
She is lonely

144
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
because you are too busy.

145
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,280
But what if I get rejected again?

146
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,610
Calderioz never gives up.

147
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,210
Right?

148
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,500
I know you need support.

149
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,279
But remember,

150
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,786
a woman needs attention.

151
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,040
Keep your spirit up.

152
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,720
I miss you, Aiden.

153
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,183
(Ardhan: Karissa, where have you been?
Are you still interested in modeling?

154
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,360
(Ardhan: Babe, what's up?)

155
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,400
You are too cocky.

156
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,501
Come here.

157
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,006
What about our costumes?

158
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,592
Everything is done.

159
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,440
I am so excited! I swear.

160
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,400
Guys, I'm leaving.

161
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,040
But we have to practice after this, Serra.

162
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,800
The competition is soon.

163
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm sorry, but I have
an appointment already. What can I do?

164
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,520
I'm sorry, okay?

165
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:04,979
You're going on a date, aren't you?

166
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,580
What?

167
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,090
Stop it. I'm sorry.

168
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,480
- I'm going, okay.
- Serra is in love.

169
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,840
- Bye.
- Take care, Serra.

170
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,983
I'm happy to see Serra like this.

171
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,480
At last, she's in love again.

172
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,920
At last.

173
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:35,499
Hi, Cleo. Are you alone?

174
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Where are the others?

175
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,920
They all left.

176
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,222
Are you okay?

177
00:16:41,253 --> 00:16:43,033
"Slice of Happiness"
is a safe place, right?

178
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,330
I don't know.

179
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:48,339
Did Serra tell you anything?

180
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,080
No, but I'm worried
for Serra and Jayden.

181
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,196
I like to see Serra with him.

182
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,880
I don't want anything to happen to them.

183
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,500
Relax.

184
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:04,466
I'm sure Serra will tell us
should anything happen.

185
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,359
Hi.

186
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:11,218
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

187
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,440
- Bye.
- Bye, Richie.

188
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,370
So how?

189
00:17:55,913 --> 00:17:57,383
Any news about the kerambit?

190
00:18:20,426 --> 00:18:23,073
(Ardhan)

191
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:31,430
(Ardhan)

192
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:46,953
What's with you?

193
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:48,907
It's about Jayden.

194
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,080
The cake shop owner?

195
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,870
I went there yesterday.

196
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,636
Guess who was there?

197
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,520
The bad guy that I hit
at the marketplace.

198
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,080
I think Jayden's cafe
will be the next target, Ares.

199
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,400
I don't want you
to accuse someone like that.

200
00:19:12,606 --> 00:19:14,206
Our focus is to find the kerambit.

201
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,513
You do you.

202
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,980
Let me handle this.

203
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,440
I won't cause any trouble,
I'll be careful.

204
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:24,686
Trust me, Ares.

205
00:19:27,313 --> 00:19:28,473
Okay.

206
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:34,250
Yes, bro?

207
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:37,846
Any progress on the kerambit?

208
00:19:41,699 --> 00:19:43,285
I'm still investigating it.

209
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,865
You're taking too long to investigate.

210
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
Are you really serious about this?

211
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:51,613
Kerambit is about trust, Ares.

212
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,190
As a leader,
you have to take care of it.

213
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,290
Who can we rely on if not you?

214
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:59,111
I will find the perpetrator.

215
00:20:08,472 --> 00:20:09,983
There must be a lot on his mind now.

216
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,680
Who should ask him? Me or you?

217
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:17,530
You don't have to tell me.

218
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,890
Ares is my boyfriend,
so I know more than anyone.

219
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:23,240
Are you sure?

220
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
What do you know?

221
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,800
I think I know better.

222
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,736
Really? So why aren't you his girlfriend?

223
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,503
I know the answer.

224
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,476
Ares chose me.

225
00:20:36,073 --> 00:20:38,033
Don't be too cocky.

226
00:20:38,134 --> 00:20:39,614
Don't be cocky about what?

227
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,930
Nothing, Ares.

228
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:45,863
You look troubled.

229
00:20:46,386 --> 00:20:47,466
I'm not.

230
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:59,219
- Hey guys.
- Hi, Serra.

231
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,473
Can I ask something?

232
00:21:00,813 --> 00:21:01,893
Sure.

233
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,940
Do you remember a woman victim

234
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,460
during one of Calderioz attacks?

235
00:21:10,113 --> 00:21:11,313
"A woman"?

236
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,673
I thought we fought with the bad guys.

237
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,480
- Okay, thank you.
- Anytime.

238
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,880
Selina, where should I put this?

239
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:24,141
Just put it there.

240
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:26,632
How about I put it in your heart?

241
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,416
Oh my, in her heart?

242
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,080
Don't do that, okay?

243
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
Guys. Where is Serra?

244
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,240
I don't know.

245
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,160
Does she know we have to practice today?

246
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,960
Yes, she does. I already told her.

247
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,760
Let me call her first.

248
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:56,981
Alright.

249
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,410
Her phone is inactive.

250
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,810
She must be busy with Jayden.

251
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:18,106
I'm more afraid if Serra's with Jayden

252
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:20,533
and the bad guys attack Jayden's cafe.

253
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:22,713
Serra once told me about it.

254
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,560
Yes, you're right.

255
00:22:26,132 --> 00:22:27,692
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

256
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,446
Zea, don't ride too fast.
Something might happen to you.

257
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,920
Think positively. Serra is alright.

258
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,493
If you don't go there fast,

259
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:46,400
the cafe may already
be under attack now.

260
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:48,747
Especially it's been so hard
to contact Serra lately.

261
00:22:49,472 --> 00:22:51,104
She didn't even come for dance practice.

262
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,800
Don't think negatively,
Jayden will protect her.

263
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
How do you know?

264
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,120
- Hi, Zea.
- Hi.

265
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:18,621
What are you doing here, Zea?

266
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,520
I wanted to drop by.

267
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,680
But I was checking my tire first.

268
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:26,581
- It's flat.
- I see.

269
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,259
The girls are concerned about you.

270
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,863
Why didn't you come for dance practice?

271
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,240
Oh, my God. That's today?

272
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,600
Oh my, I forgot.

273
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,840
The girls must be mad at me.
Especially Selina.

274
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,120
No, they're not mad.
They're just worried about you.

275
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,880
They thought you got sick again.

276
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,920
Or maybe, something happened.

277
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Serra.

278
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,113
One moment.

279
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:51,539
I just bought food coloring for cakes.

280
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,320
It's nice. It's a beige color.

281
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:56,993
Come in.

282
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,753
Let's go.

283
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,247
Okay.

284
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
May I ask you something?

285
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,040
About what?

286
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,236
When Wolves had split up,

287
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,310
were there any victims who died?

288
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:18,987
I mean when Wolves and Calderioz
were still fighting then.

289
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,960
No, there weren't any. Why?

290
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,960
No, it's nothing. I just wanted to ask.

291
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,416
Maybe there were some innocent victims.

292
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,896
Maybe there was a victim
during the fight.

293
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,563
There was none supposedly.

294
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
Usually, the parties involved
are only the gang members.

295
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,320
My Mom didn't die during that incident.

296
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:55,573
She died several months before.

297
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,856
She didn't die when Calderioz
and Wolves were fighting with each other.

298
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,360
How do you know
when Calderioz and Wolves fought?

299
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,876
- I do.
- How come?

300
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Was it on the news?

301
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,920
If I'm not mistaken, I know it from...

302
00:25:10,021 --> 00:25:11,871
Try this first, Zea.

303
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,490
It's my favorite donut here. It's tasty.

304
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,830
- Thank you, Jayden.
- You're welcome.

305
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,840
I will go to the kitchen.

306
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,480
Enjoy.

307
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,440
Which one you'd like?
Everything here is my favorite.

308
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,080
(Ares: I just finished studying)

309
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,030
What's the matter?

310
00:26:02,499 --> 00:26:05,659
Don't smile like that, Zea.

311
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,200
You make me scared.

312
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,860
It's Ares.

313
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:15,120
The cutie guy.

314
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,672
Yes, right.

315
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
Alright, enjoy you two.

316
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,760
Last night, Wednesday. March 19, 2022,

317
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,400
an illegal road race was held
at Mangga Dua last night.

318
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,880
The race involved six motorcycle riders.

319
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,400
Three riders do not have
proper documentations.

320
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,960
Calderioz is not doing
stuff like this, right?

321
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:46,565
No, Mom.

322
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,640
To prevent any crime from happening
in the illegal road race

323
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,920
which have are famous among youngsters,

324
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,440
the Jakarta police are taking actions
to prevent such illegal road race.

325
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,000
The police will make it
a legal street race.

326
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,396
They are going to make it legal.

327
00:27:05,113 --> 00:27:06,113
Street race.

328
00:27:06,214 --> 00:27:09,934
I don't like this. I am against it.

329
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,520
I'm worried, Ares.

330
00:27:17,973 --> 00:27:19,013
What do you want?

331
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:25,709
Let's have breakfast together.

332
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,063
I'm sorry, but my driver is waiting.

333
00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:40,776
Please, Baby.

334
00:27:41,373 --> 00:27:43,093
You can go with me.

335
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,640
It's early. We can make it.

336
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,119
Please, Babe.

337
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,720
Thank you

338
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,640
for having breakfast together with me.

339
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,560
Honestly,

340
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,560
I'm very sad.

341
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,320
That you had to put
having breakfast like this

342
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,520
on your bucket list.

343
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,520
Did I really not have time for you?

344
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,640
I apologize

345
00:29:33,353 --> 00:29:36,593
that I haven't spent time with you lately.

346
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,360
But I promise

347
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,640
we will have a lot of time together.

348
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Just like we used to.

349
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,900
Okay?

350
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,510
Last night, Wednesday. March 19, 2022,

351
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:16,150
an illegal road race was held
at Mangga Dua last night.

352
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,857
To prevent any crime from happening
in the illegal road race

353
00:30:18,937 --> 00:30:21,137
which are famous among youngsters,

354
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:25,657
the Jakarta police are taking actions
to prevent such illegal road race.

355
00:30:25,737 --> 00:30:28,217
The police will make it
a legal street race.

356
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,530
Oh, my God!

357
00:30:30,823 --> 00:30:31,823
My goodness!

358
00:30:32,317 --> 00:30:33,317
Ares!

359
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,430
You scared me.

360
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:37,203
Why are you here all of the sudden?

361
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:39,083
I've been here since earlier.

362
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,810
You guys look so tense.

363
00:30:42,177 --> 00:30:43,177
Ares, Ares.

364
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:46,709
My God, my heart almost fell off.

365
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:49,099
Such a tease.

366
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,430
Want me to feed you?

367
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:16,356
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

368
00:31:21,663 --> 00:31:22,663
My phone.

369
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:29,943
Where is it?

370
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,136
Where is it?

371
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:35,506
Morning.

372
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:37,388
Good morning, Richie.

373
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:00,169
Your boyfriend?

374
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:04,002
No.

375
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:05,610
It's Jayden.

376
00:32:10,203 --> 00:32:12,523
No, it's just, I like to go there.

377
00:32:12,624 --> 00:32:13,754
No, no.

378
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:15,686
You know, I can smell it.

379
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:18,356
I think it's alright
if he is your boyfriend.

380
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,483
But, please be careful.

381
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,283
There were a lot of bad guys
at Jayden's cafe.

382
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:32,603
Yes. Thank you.

383
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:44,277
What's up?

384
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,559
Nothing.

385
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:48,089
Let's go.

386
00:32:49,563 --> 00:32:51,163
- Really?
- Yes.

387
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:04,703
Babe.

388
00:33:05,643 --> 00:33:07,046
The tryout is next week.

389
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:09,563
You better focus on your study.

390
00:33:13,602 --> 00:33:14,783
It is my responsibility

391
00:33:16,397 --> 00:33:18,197
to find the kerambit.

392
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:22,363
And find out the mastermind
behind all these incidents.

393
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:25,216
But if you fail the tryout,

394
00:33:25,923 --> 00:33:28,123
you have to resign from Calderioz.

395
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:38,069
Let's put it this way.

396
00:33:39,795 --> 00:33:42,079
I will ask for Eros' help

397
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:45,896
to further find out
who the mastermind is.

398
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:50,569
Wolves are involved anyway
if what Radit said is true.

399
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:53,923
About the kerambit,

400
00:33:55,243 --> 00:33:57,213
you can ask for help
from the other Calderioz members

401
00:33:57,723 --> 00:34:01,043
or from the Calderioz senior members
to find out.

402
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:07,683
Babe.

403
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:10,423
It's only for a while.

404
00:34:11,323 --> 00:34:14,409
After the tryout and the exam,

405
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:17,243
you can be active again in Calderioz.

406
00:34:18,163 --> 00:34:19,843
Now you just have to focus
on your studies.

407
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:23,083
I don't want to leave Calderioz.

408
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:26,683
Fine, then don't.

409
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:35,056
But, I have disappointed
the guys too much.

410
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,043
Ares.

411
00:34:40,396 --> 00:34:41,396
No.

412
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,243
You are the best.

413
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:02,923
Don't draw.

414
00:35:03,003 --> 00:35:05,403
Your math questions are still wrong.
And now you're drawing.

415
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:08,123
Be serious when studying.

416
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,043
This isn't art class.

417
00:35:13,803 --> 00:35:15,123
Get serious.

418
00:35:21,049 --> 00:35:22,129
Carry on.

419
00:35:36,923 --> 00:35:39,483
We will start a war soon.
