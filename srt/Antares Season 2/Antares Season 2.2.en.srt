1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,083
Ares.

2
00:00:17,845 --> 00:00:18,890
Aiden?

3
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
(Can we meet tomorrow?)

4
00:01:30,277 --> 00:01:32,024
Why did you ask to meet here?

5
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:34,029
We can meet at our base.

6
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:35,893
Yeah.

7
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:38,495
My mom is being
super strict with me lately.

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,862
She's very concerned
with the news regarding bike gangs.

9
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:44,986
That's why I don't hang out
with everyone as often anymore.

10
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:46,712
They're not from the bike gangs.

11
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
Yeah, the culprits were riding bikes.

12
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:52,533
She thinks that’s the same thing.

13
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,170
She's just very paranoid.

14
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:58,610
Especially after Aiden died.

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,203
He has nothing to do with this.

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,280
I know. But my point is...

17
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,586
My mother is sending me to Den Haag.

18
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,960
My father has been assigned to work
in their office there.

19
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,943
When the day comes,

20
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:28,218
I have to leave the gang.

21
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,143
(Eros)

22
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Hi, what's up?

23
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,840
Have you heard about Arka?

24
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:32,516
(Do not attempt to do this act)

25
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:48,863
(Do not attempt to do this act)

26
00:03:48,964 --> 00:04:00,124
(Do not attempt to do this act)

27
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,340
- Who are you?
- Finish him.

28
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,289
Please don't hurt me!

29
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,210
Are you okay?

30
00:04:51,338 --> 00:04:53,238
I saw one of them
was wearing Retro's emblem.

31
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,413
Are you serious?

32
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,873
Calm down.
It doesn't mean they did it.

33
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,703
Laskar, let's go home.

34
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:02,964
Ares.

35
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:07,588
Please stop with the bike gang.

36
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,200
What happened to Aiden
has nothing to do with the gang.

37
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,506
Whatever it is,

38
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,520
I just don't want my son in any bike gang.

39
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:18,358
You're going to Den Haag, anyway.

40
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,987
You know that.

41
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:22,546
Yes, Ma'am.

42
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,873
- Let's go, Mom.
- Take care.

43
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:32,777
You knew?

44
00:05:33,726 --> 00:05:34,872
Let's head back.

45
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,712
Aiden is gone.

46
00:05:49,612 --> 00:05:51,151
And now Laskar is leaving.

47
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,533
My biggest fear is that
the gang breaks up.

48
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
Hello, Zea?

49
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,593
Retro and Delasga are being attacked.

50
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,863
Let's split up.

51
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,983
You and Moreo to Delasga's base.

52
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:27,897
Megan and I to the Retro's base.

53
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:29,590
Okay?

54
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:37,345
- Watch your back.
- You too.

55
00:06:45,106 --> 00:06:46,649
I saw it with my own eyes.

56
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,892
I don't know if they
targeted Retro or Delasga,

57
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,464
but one thing I know for sure,

58
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:54,559
we got the message.

59
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,683
And about Laskar attack,

60
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,974
I can guarantee you,

61
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,580
Retro didn't do it.

62
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,877
Guys.

63
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,819
We have no problem with you all, right?

64
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,363
Yeah, none.

65
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,052
But someone is definitely
having problems with us.

66
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,672
It's no longer only Retro and Delasga.

67
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,130
They attacked Calderioz too.

68
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,223
And probably other bike gangs too.

69
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,357
Maybe someone doesn't like us
getting united.

70
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,723
But do you think
the people who attacked us

71
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:38,943
are the same people
who attacked Laskar?

72
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,106
Well,

73
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,459
it's too early to judge.

74
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,880
Wait, this...

75
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,760
- Isn't that Laskar's car?
- I think so.

76
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,743
Finally, you're back!

77
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,282
- Let me touch that.
- No, it hurts.

78
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,800
- Just a touch.
- Are you nuts?

79
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,000
- But, you're good now, right?
- Of course.

80
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:17,846
A commander should recover quickly.

81
00:08:23,818 --> 00:08:25,900
This is my last week in this school.

82
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,053
Next week, I'm leaving for Den Haag.

83
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,250
Come on.

84
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,172
Wipe those sad looks from your faces.

85
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:40,330
I hate to see you sad.

86
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:42,586
How about

87
00:08:43,966 --> 00:08:45,705
we throw a farewell party this weekend?

88
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,196
But no more sad faces.

89
00:08:48,838 --> 00:08:50,970
I just want us to enjoy the party. Okay?

90
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:53,793
It's hard not to think about losing you.

91
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,760
But maybe this is the best for you.

92
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,683
We'll support you from here.

93
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,010
You are a Calderioz
for the rest of your life.

94
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,194
Whenever you return,

95
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:09,716
you are welcome in our gang.

96
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:13,240
Calderioz won't be the same without you.

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,243
It's devastating that
Laskar were attacked.

98
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,512
Will you shut up?

99
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:27,210
Chill man, relax.

100
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:30,430
I left you guys for so long
and you've become so emotional.

101
00:09:35,766 --> 00:09:36,926
Laskar is back!

102
00:09:42,378 --> 00:09:45,006
To Calz Angels!

103
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,948
- Moreo!
- He fell.

104
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:12,650
You're going down!

105
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,760
It's wet!

106
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:23,267
Laskar.

107
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,111
When are you coming back here?

108
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:27,541
That I don't know yet.

109
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,516
But I'll be sure to let you know.

110
00:10:29,676 --> 00:10:31,056
Then how about Calderioz?

111
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:32,916
Calderioz will still be here.

112
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:35,986
It's just that we're left
without a commander.

113
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:37,656
Our ace.

114
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,777
This is the first time you compliment me.

115
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,025
Anyways, take care guys.

116
00:10:50,278 --> 00:10:51,932
I will definitely miss you all very much.

117
00:10:57,915 --> 00:10:58,922
Laskar.

118
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:01,797
We have something for you.

119
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,243
Thank you guys.

120
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,729
Guys, let's take
a self-portrait photograph.

121
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,350
What did you say?

122
00:11:44,457 --> 00:11:45,503
Selfie, I mean.

123
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,406
Alright.

124
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,903
One, two, three.

125
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:54,549
Can our hand be like this?

126
00:11:55,189 --> 00:11:56,189
Okay.

127
00:11:56,903 --> 00:11:57,963
One, two, three.

128
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:01,098
Let me see.

129
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:02,783
- I want to see.
- Kiss me, first.

130
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,496
Here.

131
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:07,630
You're so fierce.

132
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,018
Here.

133
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:10,842
Hilarious!

134
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:13,606
Guys.

135
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,509
I will miss you all very much.

136
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:23,997
Take care of Calderioz.

137
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:25,910
You too, Laskar.

138
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:27,813
Don't forget to take care of yourself.

139
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:40,703
Keep in touch.

140
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:42,529
- For sure.
- Don't cry.

141
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:43,855
Of course not.

142
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,575
Take care of yourself.

143
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:48,591
- Keep in touch.
- You bet.

144
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,441
- Our ace.
- Stop by anytime.

145
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:51,562
My ace.

146
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:34,937
I think

147
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:37,802
we must immediately find
a replacement for Laskar.

148
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:40,656
You know that's
the most important position.

149
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
Right?

150
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:43,768
Don't rush it.

151
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,778
We can talk about it in our base.

152
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:49,634
Okay.

153
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:56,135
Do you remember
when I pulled down his pants?

154
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,817
He wore that spongebob underpants, right?

155
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:02,558
- We did that on the field sidelines.
- Yes, on that field.

156
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:05,435
It's too quiet now.

157
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:08,870
There were six of us.

158
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:11,777
And now only four are left.

159
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:29,503
Babe.

160
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,383
Are you thinking about the attack?

161
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,697
No.

162
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,350
Then what are you thinking about?

163
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:45,369
You.

164
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:52,077
It just comes in mind,

165
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,250
Aiden's no longer here.

166
00:14:58,577 --> 00:14:59,650
Laskar

167
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,276
left for Den Haag.

168
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:05,936
Please don't leave me too.

169
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,450
This is a difficult time for us.

170
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,910
I don't want anything bad happen to you.

171
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:46,497
The attack on Laskar
was an unfortunate incident.

172
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,743
And up to this day,

173
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:52,303
we still don't know who did it.

174
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:55,177
Megan and I went to Retro's base.

175
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,934
Ardhan and Moreo went to Delasga's.

176
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,077
Apparently,

177
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,503
they got attacked too.

178
00:16:04,657 --> 00:16:07,303
And until now, I have no idea why.

179
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:11,014
Whether the perpetrators

180
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:13,630
are the same people or not.

181
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:16,923
But one thing is for sure,

182
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:22,465
someone wants to destroy our unity.

183
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:24,965
What are you going to do about it?

184
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:41,037
Just sit around and do nothing?

185
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:46,727
What are you doing here?

186
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,887
Me?

187
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:55,930
What am I doing here?

188
00:16:58,446 --> 00:16:59,563
Have you all forgotten?

189
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,943
I'm still a member of Calderioz.

190
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:06,857
I was second in command

191
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:09,430
before I left for New York.

192
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:11,923
Right?

193
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,170
I'm telling you,

194
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,963
don't waste your time
unifying all the bike gangs.

195
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,255
You can see
what it cost you now, right?

196
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:37,804
Look what happened
to Calderioz because of it.

197
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,383
You lost Aiden.

198
00:17:44,036 --> 00:17:45,937
You lost Laskar.

199
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:52,337
So, in my humble opinion,

200
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:58,423
we can't just sit around and do nothing.

201
00:18:00,217 --> 00:18:01,323
Right, guys?

202
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:08,243
Okay, sorry.

203
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:11,457
Go on with your meeting.

204
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:29,063
That guy is getting on my nerves.

205
00:18:30,617 --> 00:18:31,830
Did you see him?

206
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:33,787
So obnoxious.

207
00:18:35,217 --> 00:18:37,752
I bet he has a hidden agenda
for coming back home.

208
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:40,250
Stop it.

209
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,239
After all, he's still one of us.

210
00:18:44,217 --> 00:18:46,910
Don't forget, defend each member.

211
00:18:47,557 --> 00:18:48,983
I think he's got a point.

212
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:52,259
We have to act now and find out
who the culprit is

213
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,057
before it gets worse.

214
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:56,942
I told you countless times,

215
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,463
don't rush.

216
00:19:00,636 --> 00:19:02,230
We have to weigh in the pros and cons.

217
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:05,510
Don't forget, the bike gangs
are on high alert as well.

218
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,833
And many criminal actions

219
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:11,117
were done by a bunch of men on bikes.

220
00:19:11,954 --> 00:19:13,435
One single misstep

221
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:16,475
would only justify their suspicions.

222
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:19,723
That will limit our movements even more.

223
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,857
(You're home already?
Why didn't you text me?)

224
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:24,498
(Don't you know that I miss you?)

225
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:29,215
(I'm home, Babe.
Why are you still up?)

226
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:35,016
(Waiting for you to come home)

227
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:37,639
(Well, I'm home now.
You can go to sleep)

228
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,370
(I don't want you to be late
when I pick you up tomorrow morning)

229
00:20:40,451 --> 00:20:44,417
(Okay! See you tomorrow)

230
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,213
(Where's my kiss?)

231
00:20:53,343 --> 00:20:59,263
(Muah! I love you!)

232
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:04,677
(I love you more!)

233
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:20,643
Babe.

234
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,637
I need to tell you something.

235
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:25,396
About what?

236
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:27,947
I already told you on the way here.

237
00:21:28,047 --> 00:21:29,290
Did you even listen?

238
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:30,993
Do you know something?

239
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,589
Ever since his return,

240
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:35,029
everything becomes odd.

241
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:36,297
Who are you talking about?

242
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:45,877
You mean Richie?

243
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,161
I think he's harmless.

244
00:21:48,497 --> 00:21:49,717
You don't know anything.

245
00:21:50,537 --> 00:21:52,047
Fine.

246
00:21:52,147 --> 00:21:54,617
I want to cheer you up.

247
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,890
So how about you hang out
with me after school?

248
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,990
Babe, I can't.

249
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:02,917
I promised to meet my friends at the base.

250
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,543
You know we're facing
lots of problem right now.

251
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:10,823
We'll find another time, okay?

252
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:14,457
Alright.

253
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,817
Babe.

254
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:27,337
- Where's Karissa?
- I don't know. With Ardhan maybe?

255
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:30,850
How about you and Megan?

256
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,180
You're with Richie now?

257
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:39,950
Him? No way!

258
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,756
Hi.

259
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:45,270
Cleo, let's go to the cafeteria.

260
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:47,237
I'm starving.

261
00:22:48,777 --> 00:22:51,083
I don't think so.

262
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,817
Stay cool, Megan.

263
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,610
Stay away from Cleo

264
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,283
or Megan will get jealous.

265
00:22:58,384 --> 00:22:59,390
Really?

266
00:22:59,537 --> 00:23:00,957
Is he the jealous type?

267
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,076
All right.

268
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:10,297
If nobody wants to walk with me,
then I'll head there first.

269
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,290
Okay?

270
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:15,777
Don't miss me. Bye, girls.

271
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:21,516
What changed him?

272
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:25,883
Don't let him touch you again.

273
00:23:26,964 --> 00:23:29,447
Okay, Karissa. Open your legs,

274
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,156
one hand on your hip.

275
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:32,450
Nice, okay.

276
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,056
One more.

277
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:36,683
Again. One, two.

278
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:40,423
Now cross your legs. One, two.

279
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:41,657
Nice!

280
00:23:41,997 --> 00:23:42,997
Yes.

281
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:46,057
- I like this one.
- Great photo, right?

282
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:48,697
- Yeah!
- The result is so good.

283
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:51,257
Great model.
I think she has potential.

284
00:23:51,337 --> 00:23:53,403
Karissa, good job.

285
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:11,156
(Do not attempt to do this act)

286
00:24:11,857 --> 00:24:13,803
- Run inside!
- What's going on?

287
00:24:14,224 --> 00:24:15,330
Fino!

288
00:24:15,431 --> 00:24:16,436
Zea.

289
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:19,923
- Selina, tell the Calderioz.
- Cleo, let's go.

290
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:24,376
Be careful.

291
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,969
Fino! Be careful, Serra.

292
00:24:27,077 --> 00:24:29,224
Get up, slowly.

293
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:34,994
- Where are we taking him?
- Over there!

294
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:37,550
What the hell are you guys doing?

295
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:48,989
Cleo!

296
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,717
That's your girl, Moreo.

297
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,430
My girl? That's my wife.

298
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,890
- Guys.
- Hi.

299
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,010
Derlangga is being attacked.

300
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,943
What happened, Fino?

301
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:14,537
They're throwing rocks at us.

302
00:25:14,617 --> 00:25:17,036
- Derlangga is under attack.
- Zea, let's go the the health clinic.

303
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,377
- I'm coming with you.
- No. Let's go, guys.

304
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:22,718
- Ares!
- Let him go.

305
00:25:28,834 --> 00:25:52,376
(Do not attempt to do this act)

306
00:25:52,477 --> 00:26:07,903
(Do not attempt to do this act)

307
00:26:08,617 --> 00:26:10,490
We're totally outnumbered.

308
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:13,023
Since when are numbers a problem?

309
00:26:14,337 --> 00:26:17,777
Attack!

310
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:01,583
Damn, Richie.

311
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:06,950
Ardhan, focus!

312
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:11,230
Damn!

313
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,656
Move, Moreo!

314
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:49,096
Police is on the way!

315
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:51,640
If you don't stop fighting,

316
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,217
all of you will be jailed forever!

317
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,008
Leave this place!

318
00:27:56,897 --> 00:28:00,657
Don't ever set foot
in this school ever again! Leave!

319
00:28:03,257 --> 00:28:06,490
Moreo! Are you okay?

320
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:08,777
Moreo, you okay?

321
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:12,536
Moreo!

322
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,130
Moreo.

323
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:18,993
Moreo?

324
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:21,516
Moreo?

325
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:26,077
- Please wait outside.
- Moreo!

326
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,310
How is he? Fino woke up.

327
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:34,117
Moreo is still unconscious.
What should we do?

328
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:38,123
You all have crossed the line.

329
00:28:41,297 --> 00:28:42,657
Do you even realize that

330
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:47,796
that our school is a place
for all of you to study!

331
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:50,163
Don't mistake it for a boxing arena!

332
00:28:51,087 --> 00:28:53,457
And especially not a place for brawling.

333
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:56,490
Someone told us,

334
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:01,774
the attack is a message for you.

335
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,719
The Calderioz.

336
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:08,451
They want you to break up.

337
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:14,177
Yeah. I know you're the leader, Ares.

338
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:19,666
I know it's not my job
to break up your gang.

339
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:23,247
But as the principal,

340
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:27,274
my job is to keep order in the school.

341
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:32,449
And my job is to discipline all students

342
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:35,378
and to make sure they obey our rules!

343
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,036
if you still want to call
this as your school.

344
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,636
All right.

345
00:29:45,955 --> 00:29:48,727
Considering the current situation,

346
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,299
as the principal of your school,

347
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,994
I'm telling all of you

348
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:58,317
to leave your gang, the Calderioz.

349
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:12,303
(To be continued)
