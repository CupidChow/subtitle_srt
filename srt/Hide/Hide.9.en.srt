00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:25,863
Jae Pil, you're a true friend.

5
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:29,913
You should've explained your situation to me.

6
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:32,523
You thought I wouldn't understand?

7
00:00:32,523 --> 00:00:35,473
Thank you, Heo Jae Pil.

8
00:00:36,153 --> 00:00:37,573
<i>Drink up.</i>

00:00:37,573 --> 00:00:39,773
<i>Let me pour you another one.</i>

10
00:00:41,313 --> 00:00:43,883
<i>My daughter and I are about to die.</i>

11
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:46,223
Stop whining!

12
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:49,463
Hey, that's enough now!

13
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:56,033
Hey, hey. Let's just both die today!

14
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,473
Die, bastard!

15
00:00:58,473 --> 00:01:01,553
- Hey, come to your senses.
- Get up.

16
00:01:01,553 --> 00:01:03,263
Get up!

17
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,723
Hey, Jae Pil! Please stop!

18
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:11,333
What will you do with my life? My life-

19
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:21,543
Jae Pil!

20
00:01:22,813 --> 00:01:24,913
Jae Pil!

21
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,343
Stay there!

22
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:32,833
I'll come get you!

24
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,553
Na Moon Yeong,

25
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:14,553
listen carefully.

26
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:20,343
The day after tomorrow, go to the police station

27
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:22,923
and ask them to look for me.

28
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:30,523
The cliff you and I went to before.

29
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:35,343
Tell them I died there.

30
00:02:46,923 --> 00:02:50,963
I need to die for you to survive.

31
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:47,823
Is this your father?

00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:10,653
(Hide)

33
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:22,313
Dad.

34
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,393
Mr. Ha Jae Pil.

35
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,733
Is that you?

36
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:56,973
Moon Yeong.

(Cheongwon District Prosecutors' Office - Haejeon Branch)

38
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:01,513
I sent the syringe and the drug to the National Forensic Service.

39
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:04,173
They said the autopsy report will come out quickly, too.
(Episode 9)

40
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:07,813
By the way, Geumshin has been quiet.

41
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:12,183
I'm sure they want Chairman Choi's death to go unnoticed.

42
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:17,803
Ha Jae Pil, this man committed all sorts of petty crimes.

43
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:21,553
Assault, fraud, and obstruction of justice.

44
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:25,533
They might insist it was a simple overdose.

45
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:31,063
But he happened to die in time when Geumshin's stock value plummeted.

46
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:33,313
Choi Ho Shik must've ordered Ha Yeon Joo to kill him.

47
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:36,493
I'll use this opportunity to catch both Ha Yeon Joo and Choi Ho Shik.

48
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,753
So you'd better not represent him.

49
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:40,973
You might get screwed.

50
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:45,883
Since when was Mr. Ha Jae Pil Ha Yeon Joo's father?

51
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:49,673
What do you mean, since when?

52
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:51,893
Probably when she was born.

53
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:54,313
Well...

54
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:58,073
I was wondering if...

55
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:01,903
they confirmed he was her father.

56
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,323
She's exactly like her father.

57
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:07,113
The fingerprints match, and there's no name change record.

58
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:09,553
The family registry hasn't changed, either.

59
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:13,513
Hey, I told you not to represent him. Why won't you answer?

60
00:07:15,623 --> 00:07:18,303
Ha Yeon Joo's father, Ha Jae Pil.

61
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:22,433
The body I confirmed 25 years ago was

62
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:26,033
the real Ha Jae Pil, right?

63
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:30,353
- Did you also-
- It was an accident.

64
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:33,663
It was an accident.

65
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:35,733
I never killed anyone.

66
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,443
What difference does that make?

67
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:42,373
I said someone else's body was yours.

68
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,863
And I tried not to wonder who that man was.

69
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:51,713
Calling it an accident...

70
00:07:51,713 --> 00:07:54,813
won't make everything just go away.

71
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:57,553
How about...

72
00:07:58,453 --> 00:08:01,493
Choi Moo Won, then? That was an accident, too?

73
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:06,703
I just gave him a shot, as usual.

74
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:11,013
I've always done it while caring for the Chairman.

75
00:08:11,013 --> 00:08:15,703
I was told to give him a shot when he hyperventilates.

76
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:20,983
I was trying to save him.

77
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,333
I didn't know this would happen.

78
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:29,773
And I don't know why you're representing me...

79
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:36,853
His family requested to join you.

80
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:54,753
Could you tell me your strategy for winning?

81
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:57,323
You finally reunited with your father.

82
00:08:57,323 --> 00:09:00,203
You can't part ways again.

83
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:04,793
You wanted this from the beginning, didn't you?

84
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:09,883
Because the person I have to defend isn't your father, Ha Jae Pil,

85
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,523
but my father, Na Seok Jin.

86
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:15,533
You...

87
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,043
don't know anything.

88
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:30,643
- Ha Yeon Joo.
- Yes?

89
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:34,543
Do I have to dye your fingernails now?

90
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:38,343
Of course, Dad. All of my friends are doing it.

91
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:41,563
Dad, are you sure you won't fail?

92
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,443
Gosh, seriously.

93
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:47,143
I already asked the lady next door and...

94
00:09:47,143 --> 00:09:49,763
learned all about it.

95
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,833
I don't think I can trust you.

96
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,553
- Take all of them out, then.
- No, no.

97
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:55,573
I'll keep them.

98
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,883
- Yeon Joo.
- Yes?

99
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:01,733
I'll go see a friend briefly.

100
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,533
Am I coming, too?

101
00:10:03,533 --> 00:10:05,233
No.

102
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,773
Just to be safe...

103
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,803
I'll give you emergency money.

104
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:14,663
I'll sleep over there just one night.

105
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:17,803
You can't go out on your own because it's dangerous, okay?

106
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,453
One night?

107
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,553
Yes, just one night.

108
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,083
We'll go swimming when you come back, okay?

109
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,043
Promise.

110
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:27,673
Promise.

111
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:32,463
Yeon Joo, don't remove the dye on your fingers, okay?

112
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:33,723
- Okay.
- Alright.

113
00:10:33,723 --> 00:10:36,093
I'll remove them for you tomorrow morning.

114
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,543
See you, Dad.

116
00:10:44,183 --> 00:10:48,163

118
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:56,943

<i>why he told me to wait...</i>

121
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:11,823
<i>if he wasn't going to come back.</i>

122
00:11:18,493 --> 00:11:22,003

Don't make faces like that. Don't apologize, either.

136
00:12:48,953 --> 00:12:52,763
I hate it when people try to end things with pathetic apologies.

137

It wasn't Moon Yeong's fault.

138
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:57,873
Dad, what the f*** are you talking about?

139
00:12:57,873 --> 00:13:02,533
Do you suddenly feel fatherly love because she's your daughter?

140
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,443
Just stay put, please.

141
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:12,833
I recognized that he was not my father, and

142
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,693
you recognized that he was yours instantly.

143
00:13:16,693 --> 00:13:19,083
Why did you do that then?

144
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:21,993
Were you mistaken because you were frazzled?

145
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:27,763
Or didn't you recognize him because the body was too bloated?

146
00:13:27,763 --> 00:13:31,823
- It's because I-
- No, you said that intentionally.

147
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:35,043
You looked for your father even after you became a prosecutor.

148
00:13:35,043 --> 00:13:37,463
To live as a successful prosecutor...

149
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:41,253
and a daughter-in-law of a prominent family,

150
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,553
you would've been better off with a father like him.

151
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:49,863
- What am I supposed to do-
- How many times did I tell you?

152
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:54,193
Represent my dad and get him acquitted.

153
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:59,693

Yes, he was shaking a lot.

165
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:39,013
I thought you were refusing to testify.

166
00:14:39,013 --> 00:14:40,163
Why would you say that?

167
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:43,163

Why are you still doing this, then?

178
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:19,483
Are you afraid to be responsible after seeing her?

179
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,753
I just wanted to see if she was doing well.

180
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:29,833
I was able to check, thanks to Attorney Na.

181

I was being thoughtful.

183
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:39,293
I didn't want a happy kid to meet her ex-con dad

184
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:43,133
and suffer. I was being considered as a human.

185
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:50,313
You're right. That's why I'll only observe her from a distance.

186
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:52,733
I learned that recently thanks to you.

187
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:56,663
How much a father who committed murder and adultery

188
00:15:56,663 --> 00:16:00,283
can hurt their young child.

189
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,663
Why was it Tae Soo, not me?

190
00:16:07,613 --> 00:16:12,493
I suppose you didn't want to steal the identity of a criminal.

191
00:16:18,573 --> 00:16:20,503
That's true. And...

192
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,843
Tae Soo was easier, too. It would've been you otherwise.

193
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:30,513
Jin Woo, you're the one who brought Hwang Tae Soo.

194
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:34,813
You said he was the only thing close to a family and asked for help.

195
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:39,603
You even implored me and brought him yourself.

196
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,463
You son of a bitch!

197
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:43,503
Shit.

198
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,653
Hey, let go of that!

199
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:48,763
You killed Hwang Tae Soo, you bastard!

200
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:51,703
What do you mean I killed him?

201
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:53,503
Watch your mouth, you bastard.

202
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,743
And you...

203
00:16:54,743 --> 00:16:56,353
Hey!

204
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,813
What are you people doing at a police station?

205
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:01,643
- I'm okay.
- Calm down.

206
00:17:01,643 --> 00:17:03,903
- Mr. Cha Seong Jae.
- Yes?

207
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:09,093
I know. What was he doing?

208
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:16,403
Keep your mouth shut.

209
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,643
Did you interrogate Ha Yeon Joo? I heard her father is a suspect.

210
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:34,153
Did you look into how she approached Chairman Choi?

211
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:38,203
Mr. Cha, focus on testifying if that's what you're here for.

212
00:17:38,203 --> 00:17:39,463
Instead of giving me orders.

213
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:44,303
It's because I'm frustrated. You always get them away in front of your eyes.

214
00:17:48,143 --> 00:17:52,563
Why did you go to Chairman Choi's house that day?

215
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:56,723
I was on my way to my house right next door. Does that answer your question?

216
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:02,173
What are you trying to ask... Oh, right. Ha Jae Pil.

217
00:18:02,173 --> 00:18:03,753
I saw him for the first time that day, too.

218
00:18:03,753 --> 00:18:07,123
It's him, right? Ha Jae Pil.

219
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:09,233
(Active Criminal Arrest Report)

220
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:11,653
What's this?

221
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:12,983
What?

222
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,433
(Active Criminal Arrest Report - Ha Jae Pil)

223
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:33,593
You look familiar.

224
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:36,913
Have we met before the Chairman passed?

225
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:38,573
No.

226
00:18:38,573 --> 00:18:41,163
Didn't Ha Yeon Joo talk about me?

227
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:45,773
Looks like you weren't that close with your daughter.

228
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:49,253
What made you come here?

229
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:57,553
You know I'm the only witness who witnessed the scene, right?

230
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,053
I'll say,

231
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,613
"He had no intention to murder.

232
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:06,673
Ha Yeon Joo always prepares the injections that you use."

233
00:19:06,673 --> 00:19:08,243
I'll testify that.

234
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:12,973
You can get acquitted of murder if you confess once.

235
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,563
Say your daughter made you do it.

236
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:23,113
Or say they threatened to kill your daughter.

237
00:19:23,113 --> 00:19:25,943
So you had no choice but to follow their order.

238
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:30,133
By "they," I mean the late Choi Moo Won's son, Choi Ho Shik's people.

239
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:31,693
I...

240
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:37,123
never received orders from anyone.

241
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:40,033
Is it your hobby to kill people, then?

242
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:43,483
Just think about it. He was about to die anyway.

243
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:48,063
Why would you even try planning to jab him on purpose?

244
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:51,003
You have nothing to do with him.

245
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:56,443
Attorney Na Moon Yeong...

246
00:19:56,443 --> 00:20:00,083
Your attorney, Na Moon Yeong, is my wife.

247
00:20:04,673 --> 00:20:06,443
That means I'm on your side.

248
00:20:06,443 --> 00:20:09,003
You can trust me and talk to me.

249
00:20:19,683 --> 00:20:22,793
I've seen him somewhere.

250
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:25,323
<i>Why did Cha Seong Jae...</i>

251
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:28,343
go there that day?

252
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,563
It seemed like he was after the Chairman.

253
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,353
It seemed that way afterward, too.

254
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:36,643
Was he trying to hold someone hostage or something?

255
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:39,893
I thought he reached the bottom.

256
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:42,533
How much further is he trying to fall?

257
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:45,253
I think he'll continue to interfere with us.

258
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,983
Maybe it's not too late to take care of him.

259
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:57,193
It's not time yet.

260
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:59,853
His testimony will be useful to us.

261
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,503
Bom.

262
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:31,463
Wait here for a moment, Bom.

263
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:33,873
I'll check something inside and come out soon.

264
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:35,373
Okay.

265
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:24,583
Cha Seong Jae,

266
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:26,653
how did you get in here?

267
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:28,523
How interesting.

268
00:22:30,593 --> 00:22:32,333
No,

269
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,683
should I say unbelievable?

270
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,583
Bom.

271
00:22:45,103 --> 00:22:48,123
You should say hello if you saw me.

272
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:51,663
Wait upstairs, Bom.

273
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,333
It's okay.

274
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:08,673
I've been thinking when I heard you became Ha Jae Pil's attorney.

275
00:23:08,673 --> 00:23:12,603
There's plenty of evidence for murder. How will you defend him?

276
00:23:12,603 --> 00:23:14,193
Did Ha Yeon Joo threaten you?

277
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:16,823
Or are you taking a risk to catch her?

278
00:23:16,823 --> 00:23:19,283
If not, was there some kind of a deal?

279
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:24,683
Why did Ha Jae Pil look at me with such an interesting look on his face?

280
00:23:24,683 --> 00:23:27,693
Everything was full of question marks, but...

281
00:23:27,693 --> 00:23:31,413
this photo you used to look at behind my back.

282
00:23:32,403 --> 00:23:34,713
The answer was in here.

283
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:40,793
The suspect in the murder of the chairman, Ha Jae Pil.

284
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:42,733
No, actually...

285
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,973
it was your father, Na Seok Jin.

286
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:53,683
Didn't you act like you lost the entire world

287
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,443
when your father supposedly died?

288
00:23:56,443 --> 00:23:59,903
I was the one who saved you when you wanted to die.

289
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:04,743
Me pretending to have died doesn't even compare.

290
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:07,263
All those years, huh?

291
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:12,673
You're so impressive, Na Moon Yeong.

292
00:24:12,673 --> 00:24:15,453
Does scamming people run in your family?

293
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,953
You and your father are so good at lying. It must've been so fun...

294
00:24:18,953 --> 00:24:22,383
playing me and my parents, who offered a helping hand.

295
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:23,493
Cha Seong Jae.

296
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:25,993
Do you really believe your father is innocent?

297
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:28,563
He abandoned his young daughter and ran away to survive on his own.

298
00:24:28,563 --> 00:24:29,763
You think you can judge him for that?

299
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:30,913
So, that makes him innocent?

300
00:24:30,913 --> 00:24:34,653
I'm the witness who saw him giving him the shot.

301
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:40,503
Don't you know his verdict will be dependent on my testimony?

302
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:43,273
Say what you saw. I'm not afraid.

303
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,783
Is that so?

304
00:24:46,383 --> 00:24:48,723
Say Ha Yeon Joo threatened him and instigated the murder

305
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:51,213
and get Na Seok Jin released on probation.

306
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,803
Save your father and put Ha Yeon Joo in prison.

307
00:24:56,803 --> 00:24:59,653
Isn't that what you truly wanted?

308
00:25:14,063 --> 00:25:18,523
And change the passcode for the front door.

309
00:25:18,523 --> 00:25:22,913
Don't you think Bom's lunar year birthday is a bit risky?

310
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:30,153
Bom, Dad is leaving.

311
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:33,293
I'll be back soon.

312
00:25:33,293 --> 00:25:35,163
I love you.

313
00:25:48,553 --> 00:25:50,383
<i>Bom, are you sleeping?</i>

314
00:26:06,843 --> 00:26:10,923
<i>I think Cha Seong Jae met Ha Yeon Joo's father.</i>

315
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:16,103
He went to the detention center.

316
00:26:16,103 --> 00:26:19,013
He's the only one he could've met there.

317
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:24,533
How do you know so well about Cha Seong Jae's whereabouts?

318
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:30,583
- Jin Woo.
- It's nothing.

319
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:33,663
I tracked his location.

320
00:26:36,873 --> 00:26:40,863
- What if you-
- He killed someone, but he's walking around freely.

321
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:42,393
Is tracking such a big deal?

322
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,193
I understand you're angry at him.

323
00:26:45,193 --> 00:26:48,143
But why are you obsessing over him so much?

324
00:26:48,143 --> 00:26:50,353
You told me once.

325
00:26:50,353 --> 00:26:54,273
That you'll stop people around you from getting hurt because of you.

326
00:26:54,273 --> 00:26:56,343
I'm the same way.

327
00:27:00,103 --> 00:27:01,743
Tae Soo...

328
00:27:03,053 --> 00:27:05,713
ended up that way because of me.

329
00:27:05,713 --> 00:27:09,083
I heard they were providing housing here.

330
00:27:09,083 --> 00:27:11,523
So I insisted he move to Haean Village.

331
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:14,983
I'm the one who blindly believed someone like Cha Seong Jae.

332
00:27:16,353 --> 00:27:19,033
But he got killed for no reason.

333
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:23,573
That's why I can no longer let people be sacrificed because of him.

334
00:27:23,573 --> 00:27:26,753
I'll follow him around with all my might

335
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:29,143
and stop him with my own hands.

336
00:27:44,213 --> 00:27:47,613
Cha Seong Jae went to the detention center to see Father yesterday.

337
00:27:47,613 --> 00:27:52,023
He told him to blame everything on you and get out on probation.

338
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:55,143
That sounds like him.

339
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:03,163
Looks like Chairman Choi liked pastries a lot.

340
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:08,213
I need his medical record.

341
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:13,343
Seok Goo, she needs the medical record.

342
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:16,483
I'll send it through Chief Yoon.

343
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:18,463
Do you have anything else to say?

344
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,803
<i>Ha Jae Pil's attorney will visit Mr. Ha at 11.</i>

345
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,483
Yes, this is she.

346
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:37,203
Na Moon Yeong.

347
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,323
Eastern District Prosecutors' Office's Wolverine.

348
00:28:41,323 --> 00:28:43,883
That used to be my nickname.

349
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:48,863
I wanted to have principles without compromising.

350
00:28:50,373 --> 00:28:54,523
Because I wanted to feel proud of myself

351
00:28:54,523 --> 00:28:57,343
if I ever saw you again.

352
00:28:57,343 --> 00:28:59,903
I didn't even know I'd see you again like this.

353
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:05,523
The whole world will find out about Ha Jae Pil in no time.

354
00:29:05,523 --> 00:29:08,283
Ha Yeon Joo must've planned out her next move.

355
00:29:08,283 --> 00:29:12,353
You should stop now for that reason, too.

356
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:17,863
The moment I became Ha Jae Pil, I thought I had no control over my fate.

357
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:20,033
No.

358
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,413
If there's no way to get away from Ha Yeon Joo,

359
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:25,553
I decided to reveal the truth instead.

360
00:29:25,553 --> 00:29:27,063
Moon Yeong.

361
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:29,283
I'll ask you one last time.

362
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:34,533
Chairman Choi Moo Won...

363
00:29:34,533 --> 00:29:36,993
Are you sure you didn't kill him?

364
00:29:49,463 --> 00:29:54,003
I'm neither Ha Jae Pil's family nor attorney right now.

365
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:56,633
I'm a human, Na Moon Yeong.

366
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:59,643
I'm talking to you as a mother of a child.

367
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:03,183
Because I think I'd be able to face her

368
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:07,013
only if I revealed the truth,

369
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:10,383
Dad.

370
00:30:13,823 --> 00:30:16,463
Let me ask you again.

371
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,443
Chairman Choi Moo Won...

372
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:21,773
Did you not kill him?

373
00:30:24,063 --> 00:30:25,603
No.

374
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:55,923

375
00:30:56,923 --> 00:31:00,063

389
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:35,683
Moon Yeong's father is alive?

390
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:37,653
How?

391
00:32:37,653 --> 00:32:40,803
Did Moon Yeong know about it, too?

392
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,693
Apparently.

393
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:48,253
But I helped her give up on inheritance-

394
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:52,193
We've been played by the father and daughter.

395
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:02,063
Things are about to get noisy.

396
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,523
You'd better start preparing, too.

397
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:08,853
What's going to happen to us now, then?

398
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:12,353
The election and development of Haean Village.

399
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:14,743
That's why we need to immobilize Ha Yeon Joo first.

400
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:16,463
What will you do?

401
00:33:16,463 --> 00:33:19,583
There are so many eyes on her right now.

402
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,733
She's the only one who has access to Chairman Choi's money now.

403
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:25,413
We need to take the 80 billion before she does.

404
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,523
I'll get her arrested...

405
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:29,603
for instigating murder.

406
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:34,783
You said Ha Yeon Joo got the prescription and administered the medicine, right?

407
00:33:34,783 --> 00:33:38,763
Yes. He had to take the medicine at a certain time every day.

408
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:42,413
The question is if she killed him on purpose or accidentally.

409
00:33:42,413 --> 00:33:44,613
Either way, Ha Yeon Joo was in charge of the medication.

410
00:33:44,613 --> 00:33:48,953
They're both dead once the autopsy result comes out.

411
00:33:48,953 --> 00:33:52,043
But whether the culprit is Ha Yeon Joo or Ha Jae Pil,

412
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,963
it'd be very strange in both cases.

413
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:59,403
Because she asked Attorney Na to represent him.

414
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:00,913
I know.

415
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:05,463
Why did she choose her sworn enemy, Attorney Na?

416
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:07,943
Mr. Do and Detective are right.

417
00:34:07,943 --> 00:34:10,353
I see that you're being tortured by her,

418
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:14,083
but don't act as if you really are his attorney.

419
00:34:15,593 --> 00:34:19,753
No, I won't quit representing him.

420
00:34:19,753 --> 00:34:21,883
My goal is to get him acquitted.

421
00:34:22,903 --> 00:34:25,033
- What?
- Why?

422
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,493
You aren't telling us something.

423
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:28,633
Ha Jae Pil, the suspect...

424
00:34:30,463 --> 00:34:32,753
His real name is Na Seok Jin.

425
00:34:32,753 --> 00:34:34,743
What?

426
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,153
Na Seok Jin?

427
00:34:36,153 --> 00:34:37,673
Who's that?

428
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:39,373
Na Moon Yeong, by chance...

429
00:34:39,373 --> 00:34:40,863
Yes.

430
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,113
My father, Na Seok Jin.

431
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,213
But he passed away.

432
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:56,743
The one who passed away was Ha Yeon Joo's father.

433
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:58,813
The real Ha Jae Pil.

434
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:05,983
The name of Attorney Na's father is Na Seok Jin.

435
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:09,653
And the person who actually died was Ha Jae Pil.

436
00:35:09,653 --> 00:35:11,963
He fell during a physical fight.

437
00:35:11,963 --> 00:35:15,683
Why is your father not able to say anything, then?

438
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:21,773
Ha Yeon Joo thinks my father killed hers in the incident I mentioned.

439
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:24,343
But that's not true.

440
00:35:24,343 --> 00:35:26,563
He lived as a dead man.

441
00:35:26,563 --> 00:35:28,503
But he didn't kill him, you said.

442
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:31,073
Are you sure he didn't?

443
00:35:31,073 --> 00:35:34,173
He left you leaving nothing but debt behind.

444
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:37,193
He's basically a stranger.

445
00:35:37,193 --> 00:35:39,903
You can't even call him a father.

446
00:35:39,903 --> 00:35:45,273
It means he lived as someone else pretending to be dead for 25 years.

447
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:49,853
And you want to defend someone like that?

448
00:35:58,633 --> 00:36:02,433
I would've run away myself rather than living as a father

449
00:36:02,433 --> 00:36:06,313
who continues to hurt his young daughter, but...

450
00:36:06,313 --> 00:36:08,523
stealing someone else's identity is-

451
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:10,993
Sir, we'll have a bottle of soju!

452
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:13,933
- It was an accident.
- So what if it was?

453
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:17,883
That means you identified someone else as your father.

454
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:24,403
Most importantly, the suspect is Ha Jae Pil, not Na Seok Jin.

455
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:26,853
You need to reconsider representing him.

456
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:28,583
No, I'll do it.

457
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:29,883
It wasn't an easy decision.

458
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:32,583
Seriously, Na Moon Yeong!

459
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:37,493
Gosh, seriously...

460
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:45,983
Back when you were a prosecutor,

461
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:50,243
our team was disbanded because we got caught forcing an investigation

462
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:52,783
and I was demoted.

463
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:54,983
I really hated you, then.

464
00:36:54,983 --> 00:36:56,393
But...

465
00:36:57,393 --> 00:37:00,253
I respected your determination.

466
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:01,693
I hope...

467
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,773
I wasn't wrong about you.

468
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:22,483
People make mistakes when they're 17.

469
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:26,503
I even killed someone when I was 19.

470
00:37:27,463 --> 00:37:29,553
It wasn't a mistake.

471
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:33,043
I knew it was wrong,

472
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:39,733
but I thought I'd no longer have to run away once that moment passed.

473
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,863
I've forgotten about it until now.

474
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:46,153
Shin Hwa is right. It's terrible.

475
00:37:49,263 --> 00:37:51,403
I might be doing the same thing...

476
00:37:52,993 --> 00:37:55,343
I did back then.

477
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:58,483
Attorney Na, for now,

478
00:37:59,783 --> 00:38:02,853
you should only focus on saving your father.

479
00:38:02,853 --> 00:38:04,343
Even if...

480
00:38:05,343 --> 00:38:07,503
that was a mistake,

481
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:11,603
you can turn everything back.

482
00:38:14,743 --> 00:38:16,373
Thank you.

483
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,783
You've been going to my empty house and

484
00:38:48,783 --> 00:38:51,003
visiting my father in the detention center.

485
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:54,023
You're busy moving back and forth, Attorney Cha.

486
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:55,923
Your father?

487
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,963
Right, he's your father-in-law.

488
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:04,253
Yes, you were trying to convince your father-in-law to blame me.

489
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:07,413
What are your detailed plans?

490
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:11,213
I might allow them if they sound very appealing.

491
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:15,633
You approached me on purpose and did all this. You tell me first.

492
00:39:15,633 --> 00:39:18,543
I was never the target.

493
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:23,663
Wasn't I a bridge for you to take revenge on Na Moon Yeong?

494
00:39:23,663 --> 00:39:26,173
Na Moon Yeong's husband happened to be...

495
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:31,523
young and capable lawyer, Cha Seong Jae, from my company's legal team.

496
00:39:31,523 --> 00:39:33,603
It brought out my competitive edge.

497
00:39:34,653 --> 00:39:38,093
Keep doing what you were doing regardless of my goal.

498
00:39:38,093 --> 00:39:41,043
The money. You need to get it back.

499
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:45,623
I see. So, money isn't your priority?

500
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:51,113
Who else knows Ha Jae Pil is Na Seok Jin?

501
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:56,773
Fight between the two of you if you want.

502
00:39:56,773 --> 00:39:58,293
I'm not interested in getting involved

503
00:39:58,293 --> 00:40:00,963
and I can't afford to die from your trickery.

504
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:03,143
That's why you should testify.

505
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,993
I'll give you what you want.

506
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:10,273
Power of attorney to withdraw money from the bank in Switzerland.

507
00:40:12,073 --> 00:40:15,693
You can withdraw the entire amount with the power of attorney from me.

508
00:40:15,693 --> 00:40:18,323
You just need to give me the half of it.

509
00:40:18,323 --> 00:40:21,333
But I can accept an IOU for it.

510
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,293
You don't trust me.

511
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:25,673
What are you trying to pull now?

512
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,723
There is money dormant somewhere without an owner.

513
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:31,213
There'd be no use in delaying.

514
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:34,883
You don't know when Choi Ho Shik will change his mind, either.

515
00:40:36,373 --> 00:40:39,043
My father's first trial is starting soon.

516
00:40:39,043 --> 00:40:41,613
I'll request you was a witness.

517
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:47,443
Say my father killed Chairman Choi Moo Won...

518
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:50,643
and you saw it with your own eyes.

519
00:40:50,643 --> 00:40:52,603
Just testify that.

520
00:41:04,893 --> 00:41:08,103
Bom, your tennis skills improved a lot.

521
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:10,423
You can play with me now.

522
00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:15,363
May I speak to Mom for a moment?

523
00:41:15,363 --> 00:41:19,023
Bom, wait in the car.

524
00:41:30,213 --> 00:41:32,293
You met with Ha Yeon Joo, didn't you?

525
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:33,653
So...

526
00:41:34,653 --> 00:41:37,833
did she tell you to be a witness for the Chairman Choi trial?

527
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:39,013
Go ahead.

528
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:43,103
I'll reveal how untrustworthy you are

529
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:46,143
as a witness in detail in court.

530
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:48,083
That's what I've been hoping for.

531
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:50,403
You'll get hurt, too, then.

532
00:41:52,103 --> 00:41:55,693
Whether you like it or not, you and I are tangled up as much as possible.

533
00:41:55,693 --> 00:41:57,483
I'll get hurt if I need to.

Yes, I no longer want to let Bom see us like this.

539
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:21,873
I wanted you to remain as the father

540

Mr. Ha fell due to an accident and

the water level was high due to the high tide.

So there was nothing you could've done.

605
00:47:53,283 --> 00:47:58,143
So, the cause of death was drowning, not falling.
