(Episode 1)

00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:29,763
(Year 1998)

00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:55,453
(Promissory Notes)

8
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,753
What are you doing? There's no time. Let's go.

9
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,323
D-Dad.

10
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:41,333
We can pick him up later.

11
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,393
When?

12
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:49,013
Let go of this.

13
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:55,973
- Let's go.
- Bo Bae...

14
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,883
Moon Yeong.

15
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:38,233
It's you. I looked for you everywhere.

16
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:42,343
You remember me, right? You know, your dad's friend.

17
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:49,053
You know, your dad and I are supposed to meet today.

18
00:02:49,053 --> 00:02:51,793
Could you tell me where he is?

19
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:01,293
<i>Hey, I could only count on friends.</i>

20
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:05,203
You should've explained your situation to me.

21
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:07,773
- Drink.
- Thank you.

22
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,313
Geez, seriously.

23
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:16,363
<i>Just drink up. I'll pour you another glass.</i>

24
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,403
Moon Yeong.

25
00:03:58,123 --> 00:04:00,233
I need to die...

26
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:03,723
for you to survive.

27
00:04:11,183 --> 00:04:20,603
(Hide)

28
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:35,273
(Year 2023)

29
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:06,823
I like your lipstick today.

30
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:10,133
- Really?
- Yes, it goes well with your outfit.

31
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:15,663
"Look upside down through your legs. You'll see me then."

32
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:45,573
You're making me nervous. A mom shouldn't be this pretty. Should she?

33
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:50,383
I haven't had fun in two years. I can't go out in my sweatpants.

34
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,863
Are you going there for fun?

35
00:05:52,863 --> 00:05:56,653
I thought you were wining and dining Prosecutor Joo Shin Hwa, who's starting today.

36
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,643
Hey, Cha Seong Jae.

37
00:05:59,303 --> 00:06:02,453
Yes, you should comfort her.

38
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:06,003
She must be lonely after moving to Haejeon City so suddenly.

39
00:06:06,003 --> 00:06:09,903
Try to get info on what's going on at the Prosecutors' Office, too.

40
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,833
Thinking now, our law firm's future depends on you, Moon Yeong.

41
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:16,703
Geez, you know how to schmooze.

42
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:19,363
You want to stay home? I'd love that.

43
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:22,983
Should we complete the four seasons by having Bom, Yeo Reum, Ga Eul, and Gyeo Wool*?
(Four seasons in Korean, also names of kids)

44
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,603
Gosh, don't scare me like that.

45
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:29,783
What? You still have some time.

46
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:35,183
<i>Bom, Mom will be right back.</i>

47
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:37,403
Mom!

48
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:50,213
Bom, I made fried rice. Eat it later, okay?

49
00:06:50,213 --> 00:06:52,443
Dad didn't make it?

50
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,693
Mom's is good, too.

51
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:58,903
You think I'll starve her? Just don't drink too much, CEO Na.

52
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:02,303
I can't anymore, even if I wanted to, CEO Cha.

53
00:07:02,303 --> 00:07:03,453
I'll be right back.

54
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,493
Okay. See you.

55
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,803
See you.

56
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:20,243
Na Moon Yeong, Class 48, still got it.

57
00:07:20,243 --> 00:07:22,463
I missed you, alcohol.

58
00:07:22,463 --> 00:07:24,793
Here, have some.

59
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:27,913
- Let's go. Cheers.
- Let's see the end.

60
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:34,123
Having alcohol in my blood makes me feel alive.

61
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:38,293
Wow, the mighty Na Moon Yeong has been suppressing herself a lot.

62
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:43,343
I should've gotten you a room, Ms. Prosecutor.

63
00:07:43,343 --> 00:07:45,923
What kind of celebration is this?

64
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,603
What are you saying? What do you mean, "Ms. Prosecutor"?

65
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:53,933
My husband told me I need to wine and dine you properly.

66
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:57,123
You two have always been on the same page.

67
00:07:57,123 --> 00:08:01,443
You want to make your divorcée friend who got demoted jealous? How annoying.

68
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:05,393
You're just a CEO on paper. Quit your sales pitch.

69
00:08:06,173 --> 00:08:09,723
I need to do sales, at least, to save my face.

70
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:15,793
I quit my job as a prosecutor to be a mom and came all the way down here.

71
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:18,993
But Bom is still all about her dad.

72
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:22,113
I always study cooking, but why don't I get better?

73
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:24,623
It's because you try to study it.

74
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:26,893
Forget it. Give up quickly if you can't.

75
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:29,983
Let whoever is good at it do it all.

76
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:31,683
Should I?

77
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,983
Two o'clock direction.

78
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,723
Don't look too obvious.

79
00:08:40,723 --> 00:08:43,253
Those two are obviously having an affair.

80
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,453
How do you know that?

81
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:48,973
CCTV blind spot.

82
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:52,603
They got a table in a dark spot with no lighting.

83
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:55,353
I have a good reason to be suspicious.

84
00:08:55,353 --> 00:08:57,413
Look at those suitcases.

85
00:08:57,413 --> 00:09:00,393
Their spouses must think they're on business trips.

86
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:08,413
Gosh, Prosecutor. Calm down and have a drink, please.

87
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,643
Don't blame the innocent people who are here to drink.

88
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:13,543
Seriously, I get the hunch.

89
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,983
I learned from my experience.

90
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:17,703
Just look at his face. Look.

91
00:09:17,703 --> 00:09:20,353
He's making the same face as Yoo Jeong...

92
00:09:20,353 --> 00:09:25,763
Why did I say his name? It's just like my ex, Mr. Yoo's.

93
00:09:28,253 --> 00:09:33,083
Anyway, I'm legally single now. You'd better get me someone.

94
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,273
Someone way better than my ex-husband bastard.

95
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,183
Should I?

96
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,783
What the heck? You got wasted before me?

97
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:47,723
Come on, I'm not wasted.

98
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:50,973
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

99
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:54,003
- Hello.
- Hello.

100
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:57,443
Do you mind if we join you?

101
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:59,183
No...

102
00:10:01,703 --> 00:10:04,793
- Where...
- There's a room back there.

103
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:07,773
Come and join us if you'd like.

104
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,323
Sounds good. Okay.

105
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:13,663
Na Moon Yeong, let's go.

106
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:53,593
<i>- Fruit.</i>
<i></i><i>- No.</i>

107
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:55,953
<i>Vegetable, then.</i>

108
00:10:55,953 --> 00:10:59,043
<i>Vegetable. You can eat this.</i>

109
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:02,973
<i>What are you eating, then?</i>

110
00:11:02,973 --> 00:11:05,043
<i>Eat.</i>

111
00:11:05,043 --> 00:11:07,493
Eat while you do it.

112
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,753
It's protein. Here.

113
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,263
Who do you resemble?

114
00:11:12,263 --> 00:11:13,873
You.

115
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:16,803
I can't argue with that.

116
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,913
- Eat just two more.
- No.

117
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:29,293
How about this? Ms. Yeon Joo made this.

118
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,983
- Say ah.
- Ah.

119
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,723
Geez.

120
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:38,103
I'll pick you up when you're done. Come out immediately, okay?

121
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:39,563
Okay.

122
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:55,183
Did you get hurt?

123
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:57,673
I cut myself while peeling fruit.

124
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:05,693
How did I get home last night, by the way?

125
00:12:09,493 --> 00:12:11,143
Geez, hot.

126
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,773
I need to get to my trial.

127
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,283
- Put this in your mouth.
- I don't want to.

128
00:12:17,923 --> 00:12:20,343
- Please clean that up.
- Okay.

129
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,053
Wait for me!

130
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:25,983
- It's uncomfortable, isn't it?
- Yes.

131
00:12:26,023 --> 00:12:27,623
There.

132
00:12:36,153 --> 00:12:38,253
Eat something for your hangover.

133
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:42,403
You need to get a car wash.

134
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,283
Gosh, okay, I will.

135
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:45,793
I'll be back.

136
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:59,563
Ms. Na.

137
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,443
Yeon Joo.

138
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:05,613
Hello.

139
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:08,513
What are you planning to do today?

140
00:13:08,513 --> 00:13:11,683
I wanted to make a strawberry tart since the strawberries are nice.

141
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,003
Gosh, sounds good.

142
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:16,343
I brought pumpkin, too. Bom likes pumpkin puree.

143
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:18,523
Should I make some and bring it over later?

144
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:20,343
Thank you.

145
00:13:43,193 --> 00:13:46,253
(To Shin Hwa)
<i>I can't remember how I got home last night at all.</i>

146
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:48,683
<i>I didn't make any mistakes, right?</i>

147
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,383
(Calls - Paralegal Go Choon Hee)

148
00:14:31,993 --> 00:14:34,383
- Yes, Ms. Go.
<i>- Why isn't CEO Cha coming to work?</i>

149
00:14:34,383 --> 00:14:39,933
<i>He should be meeting the witness at the court. He won't pick up the phone, either. Where is he?</i>

150
00:14:40,973 --> 00:14:43,123
He went to work?

151
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:48,023
No, it's not a TV show taping. We're too busy for that these days.

152
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,493
I'm going crazy here.

153
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:52,143
If you don't know, who'd know?

154
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,963
He got off work in a hurry yesterday.

155
00:14:53,963 --> 00:14:56,413
Are you sure nothing happened at home?

156
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,693
No, nothing happened.

157
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:02,223
<i>- Leave now.</i>
- I'll look into it and-

158
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:03,493
<i>Run over.</i>

159
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,783
Pardon? Me?

160
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,203
CEO Cha is missing, and Advisor Cha is on a business trip.

161
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:10,583
Is there another attorney, but you left?

162
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:13,223
Be on your way now. Check the trial records on your way.

163
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:15,873
Ms. Go, the thing is...

164
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,973
Right now, I...

165
00:15:24,763 --> 00:15:26,363
<i>You know Geumshin Corporation, right?</i>

166
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:28,463
<i>The company CEO Cha worked for in Seoul.</i>

167
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:31,183
<i>They're developing a resort in a coastal town.</i>

168
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:35,103
<i>A local resident who refused to sell his property got hit by a car and died.</i>

169
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:37,743
<i>- The suspect is a female employee from that company.</i>
- Hey...

170
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:42,273
A female employee? Who's the victim?

171
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:43,783
<i>A man in his 50s.</i>

172
00:15:43,783 --> 00:15:46,013
<i>It was difficult to prove her innocence,</i>

173
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:49,703
<i>but a witness who saw the victim dashing into the car appeared.</i>

174
00:15:49,703 --> 00:15:51,393
A witness?

175
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:55,873
<i>Today is the first day of witness questioning.</i>

176
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:58,493
<i>It's the only chance to turn things around.</i>

177
00:15:58,493 --> 00:16:01,743
<i>I sent In Gyu. Let him explain the rest.</i>

178
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:07,183
He never misses important things.

179
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,623
(Liberty / Equality / Justice)

180
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:22,463
Here she is. This is Attorney Na Moon Yeong, whom I told you about.

181
00:17:22,463 --> 00:17:26,843
She's the other partner at the firm. She worked as a prosecutor for 12 years.

182
00:17:26,843 --> 00:17:28,583
This is Geumshin Corporation's Chief Ma Gang.

183
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,263
This is our client, Ms. Kim Yoon Seon.

184
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:36,343
Hello. I'm Na Moon Yeong, a partner at Chawoong Law Firm.

185
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:38,423
Where's Attorney Cha?

186
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:41,183
Can he not come today?

187
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:44,073
No, there's a bit of a situation.

188
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:47,813
Oh, my goodness. Don't worry-

189
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:56,733
What kind of situation would let an attorney abandon his trial?

190
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,333
Our apologies.

191
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,213
We'll make sure it won't affect the trial.

192
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:04,813
In Gyu, where's the witness?

193
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:06,493
There he comes.

194
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:09,053
It's Mr. Do Jin Woo.

195
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:26,483
Mr. Do, this is Attorney Na Moon Yeong.

196
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:29,383
Attorney Cha couldn't make it today.

197
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:30,443
Why not?

198
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:33,093
I'll make sure the trial won't be affected.

199
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:38,203
By the way, will you be on the witness stand in that outfit?

200
00:18:39,143 --> 00:18:42,363
It's important for the witness to appear trustworthy in court.

201
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:45,393
Switch outfits with him, In Gyu.

202
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:47,883
Okay. Pardon?

203
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:06,473
You want me to go in looking like this?

204
00:19:06,473 --> 00:19:08,373
Doesn't look too bad.

205
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:14,153
Hey, why isn't Deputy Kim coming out of the restroom?

206
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,013
I'll check.

207
00:19:30,363 --> 00:19:32,263
She's gone.

208
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:37,043
F***!

209
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:44,013
So...

210
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:47,073
(Defendant)
are you saying the defendant is absent?

211
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:57,293
You submitted the explanation for

212
00:19:57,293 --> 00:20:00,463
Defendant Kim Yoon Seon's absence 10 minutes before the trial.

213
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:05,193
We got a new defense attorney, too.

214
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:13,423
Yes. I'd like to clarify that the replacement of the defense attorney and

215
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:17,493
request to postpone the hearing isn't because we're trying to delay the trial.

216
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:22,913
The defendant's condition suddenly deteriorated while waiting outside the court-

217
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:34,273
I don't need to know the defendant's personal reason for being absent.

218
00:20:34,273 --> 00:20:37,053
Will she be able to attend after a month?

219
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:38,443
Pardon?

220
00:20:40,763 --> 00:20:43,363
Yes. I'll make sure nothing goes wrong.

221
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:44,553
Your Honor.

222
00:20:44,553 --> 00:20:48,273
The rescheduled hearing date will be on the 17th of next month.

223
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:51,573
The final trial will be on the 24th of next month.

224
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:57,463
Make sure to submit any additional claim or evidence in time.

225
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:01,593
We'll move on to the next trial, then.

226
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:32,863
(Seong Jae)

227
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:36,833
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be...</i>

228
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:39,903
Why isn't he answering? Is he out of his mind?

229
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:42,013
I should at least be able to reach him.

230
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:44,323
The hearing ended in five minutes.

231
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:47,253
The client ran away while we were worrying about the witness.

232
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:50,633
Thankfully, the judge was generous about it.

233
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:53,113
I know.

234
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,913
Maybe Attorney Cha ditched the case.

235
00:21:54,913 --> 00:21:57,623
He didn't want this case.

236
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:00,403
Attorney Cha didn't want this case?

237
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:06,933
He did express his dislike a bit, but...

238
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,883
What was the reason?

239
00:22:08,883 --> 00:22:11,863
I'm not so sure, either...

240
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:56,933
C-CEO Na, you should look ahead while driving.

241
00:23:02,413 --> 00:23:04,143
CEO Na!

242
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,843
What's wrong, CEO Na?

243
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,863
CEO Na...

244
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:27,953
Wait...

245
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:33,883
Wait. It's red! It's red! It's red!

246
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:37,833
CEO Na!

247
00:23:44,973 --> 00:23:48,093
This is crazy. Why are you doing this, seriously?

248
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:15,203
CEO Na!

249
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:18,673
3398239, In Gyu.

250
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:25,403
(Seong Jae)

251
00:24:37,063 --> 00:24:41,483
(Written Opinion of the Legal Councel)

252
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:47,233
<i>Where's Attorney Cha?</i>

253
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:49,533
<i>Can he not come today?</i>

254
00:25:02,323 --> 00:25:06,403
Their wall is 30 cm into our property.

255
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:09,433
I have already told Attorney Cha many times,

256
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:12,263
but this is theft. Theft.

257
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:18,163
(Clean Dry Cleaning, Haecheon. 15% off everything until tomorrow)

258
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:21,623
I explained everything to the male attorney last time.

259
00:25:21,623 --> 00:25:23,493
Do I have to explain again?

260
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:27,843
How could he bring that young thing into my house behind my back?

261
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:30,723
I'll lock her up for trespassing.

262
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:47,083
Any word from CEO Cha?

263
00:25:47,723 --> 00:25:49,613
We haven't heard from him.

264
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:53,013
Everything must be okay, right?

265
00:25:53,013 --> 00:25:56,353
We checked with the police and 911 just in case,

266
00:25:56,353 --> 00:25:58,333
but they didn't find anything.

267
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,503
I wonder if he's getting fresh air somewhere.

268
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:05,793
He's having an affair, more like.

269
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:07,463
Like running away in the middle of the night.

270
00:26:07,463 --> 00:26:09,053
Attorney Cha would never do that.

271
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:11,393
Maybe you'd do that.

272
00:26:11,393 --> 00:26:13,703
I've never been in a relationship.

273
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:15,273
Gosh, seriously...

274
00:26:18,573 --> 00:26:22,743
Geumshin's Mr. Ma keeps calling. He wants us to find Attorney Cha.

275
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,273
Were you able to reach Ms. Kim Yoon Seon?

276
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:28,553
She can't be reached, either.

277
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,653
What's with today? What's wrong with everyone?

278
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:34,213
Ask her if she was notified of the trial reschedule

279
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:38,653
and tell her it'd be to her disadvantage if she misses the next trial.

280
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:43,333
Attorney Choi, it's been a while.

281
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,783
Have you seen Seong Jae today, by chance?

282
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:50,523
He has a bar association training. I thought he might've gone there.

283
00:26:51,683 --> 00:26:53,143
Okay.

284
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:57,943
I'm getting a call. Thank you.

285
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:03,193
- Hey, Bom.
<i>Mom, where are you?</i>

286
00:27:03,193 --> 00:27:05,403
<i>Dad isn't answering his phone.</i>

287
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:08,023
My gosh, are you finished with your class?

288
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:11,623
Wait a moment. I'll be there right now, okay?

289
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:13,763
<i>No, the thing is...</i>

290
00:27:13,763 --> 00:27:15,813
<i>I brought Bom home.</i>

291
00:27:15,813 --> 00:27:17,483
Mother.

292
00:27:28,923 --> 00:27:31,833
You should've told me if you were busy.

293
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:35,453
What if something happened while she was alone at school?

294
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:38,463
I'm sorry. I suddenly can't reach Seong Jae.

295
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:40,813
I heard he's been very busy lately.

296
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:43,813
I'm sure something urgent came up.

297
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:47,533
But he still wouldn't miss an important trial.

298
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:53,553
Moon Yeong, your conclusive attitude is the problem.

299
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:58,503
If you're having a hard time since this is happening

300
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:00,873
while your father's in Seoul,

301
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:03,503
I understand.

302
00:28:03,503 --> 00:28:06,403
He definitely promised to pick up Bom.

303
00:28:06,403 --> 00:28:08,313
The fact that he didn't call Bom, either-

304
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,983
It's not like he's a child.

305
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:16,733
You guys didn't have a fight, right?

306
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:18,343
No.

307
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,463
He'll come back, then.

308
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:24,723
Take this to Bom.

309
00:28:24,723 --> 00:28:26,573
She's in her room.

310
00:29:13,493 --> 00:29:19,043
(Chief Ma Gang)

311
00:29:25,273 --> 00:29:28,463
- Yes, Chief.
<i>- Show up in front of me in an hour.</i>

312
00:29:28,463 --> 00:29:30,253
<i>I'll kill you otherwise.</i>

313
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:32,373
<i>Got it? You hear me?</i>

314
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:35,363
Bring Attorney Cha, then.

315
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:38,583
How could I have a trial without him?

316
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:54,023
<i>What are you trying to do?</i>

317
00:29:54,023 --> 00:29:56,343
<i>You want to survive on your own?</i>

318
00:29:56,343 --> 00:29:58,203
<i>Call me immediately!</i>

319
00:29:58,203 --> 00:29:59,693
<i>Immediately!</i>

320
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:06,773
Kim Yoon Seon and Cha Seong Jae.

321
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,823
Are they both high or something?

322
00:30:10,823 --> 00:30:13,523
They're making the easy task annoying.

323
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:16,523
You haven't found Attorney Cha yet?

324
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,333
Not yet.

325
00:30:22,183 --> 00:30:24,733
I thought he understood me.

326
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:28,633
I wonder what he's thinking.

327
00:30:31,283 --> 00:30:33,903
Wow, it's so pretty. Isn't it?

328
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:35,133
Yes.

329
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:38,743
Mom, when is Dad coming home?

330
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:42,693
I know. He's taking a bit long.

331
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:44,163
Should we try calling him?

332
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:45,963
Yes. Let's.

333
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:52,503
(Shin Hwa)

334
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:57,823
Shin Hwa, why is it so hard to reach you?

335
00:31:04,473 --> 00:31:06,453
Man? What man?

336
00:31:06,453 --> 00:31:08,433
You don't remember at all?

337
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:10,543
How those men picked us up?

338
00:31:11,443 --> 00:31:14,963
We weren't picked up. All I did was drink.

339
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:16,983
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i></i><i>- Hello.</i>

340
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:20,493
<i>Do you mind if we join you?</i>

341
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:22,943
Did we join them?

342
00:31:22,943 --> 00:31:24,873
<i>I don't know if you can call it that.</i>

343
00:31:24,873 --> 00:31:28,403
We were about to go wild, but your husband came and ruined everything.

344
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,283
Seong Jae came last night?

345
00:31:30,283 --> 00:31:33,503
<i>What? How much are you blanking out?</i>

346
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:35,013
Did you call him?

347
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:36,543
You're out of your mind.

348
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:39,123
What? Didn't you call him?

349
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:40,623
Me?

350
00:31:44,133 --> 00:31:45,313
I didn't.

351
00:31:45,313 --> 00:31:48,853
<i>What? How did he know we were there, then?</i>

352
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:52,293
Do you guys track each other's locations?

353
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:54,503
No, we don't.

354
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:59,073
Maybe we should've done that.

355
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:05,093
What? What's wrong? Is something going on?

356
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:06,803
<i>He's gone.</i>

357
00:32:08,323 --> 00:32:11,263
My husband is gone. He disappeared.

358
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:15,743
He missed an important trial and won't pick up his phone, either.

359
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:18,033
<i>Shin Hwa,</i>

360
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:21,633
do you think he thought I-

361
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:23,883
I know what you're thinking,

362
00:32:23,883 --> 00:32:26,953
but you behaved yourself last night. Don't worry.

363
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:29,703
He couldn't have disappeared because of that.

364
00:32:50,183 --> 00:32:51,623
(To Seong Jae)<i>Where are you?</i>

365
00:32:51,623 --> 00:32:53,513
<i>Why is it so hard to reach you?</i>

366
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,713
<i>By chance, last night... You're mistaken.</i>

367
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:58,413
<i>Let's talk in person.</i>

368
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:00,253
<i>Come home quickly.</i>

369
00:33:16,913 --> 00:33:19,073
Ms. Kim Yoon Seon?

370
00:33:49,463 --> 00:33:51,943
What brings you here so late?

371
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:55,383
I needed to speak to Attorney Cha.

372
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:57,793
He's not answering his phone.

373
00:33:57,793 --> 00:34:00,993
Are you not able to reach him yet, by chance?

374
00:34:03,923 --> 00:34:07,393
It's late now. I'll tell him to call you tomorrow.

375
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:08,803
Not me, Mr. Ma-

376
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:11,763
Yes. He'll call Mr. Ma Gang.

377
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,003
Try to call instead from now on.

00:34:58,623 --> 00:35:01,113
<i>Starting tomorrow, for a month, the police...</i>

383
00:35:01,113 --> 00:35:03,883
I stopped by because I was worried.

384
00:35:04,683 --> 00:35:08,763
<i>Through the test, the National Police Agency will analyze the crimes and...</i>

385
00:35:08,763 --> 00:35:11,773
I'm sorry. Did he contact you by chance-

386
00:35:11,773 --> 00:35:14,673
Have you heard from Seong Jae at all?

387
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:22,643

388
00:35:22,643 --> 00:35:27,573

389
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:29,953
<i>There was an accident by the shore, too.</i>

390

<i>- Attorney Na Moon Yeong.</i>

<i>This is Ma Gang of Guemshin Corporation.</i>

398
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:20,133
Yes.

399
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:23,673
<i>Did Attorney Cha come home?</i>

400
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:25,893
No, not yet.

401
00:36:27,283 --> 00:36:29,773
By the way, Attorney Na,

402
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,193
you need to find him quickly.

403
00:36:32,193 --> 00:36:35,233
We're in a very difficult situation right now.

404
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:38,393
Of course. I understand completely.

405
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:39,803
I'll take care of that case-

406
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:41,983
<i>It sounds like you don't understand.</i>

407
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:47,703
<i>This isn't the only case he's been working on with us.</i>

408
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,153
I see.

409
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:54,613
Are you able to reach Ms. Kim Yoon Seon by chance?

410
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:59,023
I think I saw her in front of my house last night but can't reach her.

411
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:03,563
<i>Deputy Kim was in front of your house?</i>

412
00:37:04,563 --> 00:37:07,193
<i>Look for Attorney Cha first.</i>

413
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:17,423
Looks like Kim Yoon Seon changed her mind.

414
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:21,063
I'll look into it.

416
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:37,123
Ms. Go, are you at the office?

417
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:40,063
Did you check the license number I told you-

418
00:37:49,923 --> 00:37:52,703
Oh, my God. What do we do?

419
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,703
Yeah, right.

420
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:56,963
I'll call the police first.

421
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:59,013
Yes, Attorney Na. Come quickly.

422
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:06,793
My gosh...

423
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:08,243
Gosh.

424
00:38:13,913 --> 00:38:15,483
In Gyu, call. Call.

425
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:17,553
Yes, let's call the police.

426
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:27,213
<i>Gosh, there's no end to this. This is crazy.</i>

427
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:42,613
Lieutenant, this was caught on CCTV.

428
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:44,253
Oh, okay.

429
00:38:44,253 --> 00:38:45,523
Okay.

430
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:54,523
In Gyu-

431
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:07,693
Hello, Prosecutor Na.

432
00:39:07,693 --> 00:39:10,863
No, you're an attorney now.

433
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:13,643
Long time no see, Prosecutor Na. Aigoo!

434
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:16,363
She's an attorney. Seriously.

435
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:18,143
I'm not used to it.

436
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:21,113
Long time no see, Lieutenant Baek.

437
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:24,483
Wow, what a small world. Right?

438
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:28,663
We aren't the only former prosecutors and police officers in the country.

439
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:31,553
How do we run into each other in this countryside?

440
00:39:31,553 --> 00:39:36,093
I'll talk to another detective if you think you were punished because of me.

441
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:38,283
It'd be uncomfortable for both of us.

442
00:39:38,283 --> 00:39:40,213
Gosh, not at all.

443
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:43,963
I'm not an amateur. I'll investigate professionally.

444
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:45,753
Okay, then...

445
00:39:45,753 --> 00:39:49,613
The men who were caught on CCTV.

446
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:52,153
Do you know them by chance?

447
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,313
I don't know them.

448
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:03,413
The office is a mess,

449
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:05,443
but nothing is missing?

450
00:40:07,283 --> 00:40:09,563
Got it. I'll go to the station,

451
00:40:09,563 --> 00:40:13,513
identify the suspects, and contact you.

452
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:16,813
There's something missing.

453
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:20,843
My husband is missing.

454
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:23,493
It's been over 24 hours.

455
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:26,393
Was there an accident with an unidentified person yesterday?

456
00:40:28,373 --> 00:40:32,233
We can't do much when an adult leaves home voluntarily.

457
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,513
Shouldn't you be investigating it?

458
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,603
Is there evidence that this case is related to your husband's missing?

459
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:43,013
I know when a normal adult disappears, you assume it was voluntary.

460
00:40:43,013 --> 00:40:47,103
But as soon as he disappeared, our office was broken in overnight.

461
00:40:48,223 --> 00:40:49,723
Why wouldn't you investigate this?

462
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:52,293
Did you two have a fight, by chance?

463
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:53,903
No.

464
00:40:54,883 --> 00:40:57,273
Have you noticed anything weird about him or-

465
00:40:57,273 --> 00:40:59,813
- Not at all.
- Perhaps he was depressed or...

466
00:40:59,813 --> 00:41:01,303
hinted at committing suicide...

467
00:41:01,303 --> 00:41:02,653
No, he didn't.

468
00:41:02,653 --> 00:41:05,293
My husband never invested in stocks or gambled.

469
00:41:05,323 --> 00:41:11,223
He never had an accident, a criminal record, a notable medical record, or suicidal tendencies at all.

470
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:13,433
He has no reason to run away.

471
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,253
Please find out if it could've been an accident.

474
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:41,303
Yes, Branch Manager.

(Attorney Cha Jeong Jae)

477
00:42:18,433 --> 00:42:22,833
The vehicle you mentioned has nothing to do with CEO Cha...

478
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:27,073
Is CEO Cha's credentials on his laptop?

479
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,523
He probably kept it in a USB drive.

480
00:42:31,523 --> 00:42:33,393
Do you know which one?

481
00:42:33,393 --> 00:42:34,593
Of course, not.

482
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,723
You just need to plug them in one at a time. Do you know his password?

483
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,603
I'll have to guess.

484
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:44,063
The seal is...

485
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:45,953
Well, CEO Na.

486
00:42:45,953 --> 00:42:48,183
He carried the driver's license with him.

487
00:42:48,183 --> 00:42:51,123
I think he left his residence ID card here.

488
00:42:53,163 --> 00:42:56,993
Are there extra copies of the front and the back of his ID?

489
00:42:56,993 --> 00:42:59,153
Why don't you ask him when he comes back?

490
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:01,123
We might go bankrupt.

491
00:43:01,893 --> 00:43:05,773
I'm supposed to be a partner, but only on paper. What have I been doing?

492
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:11,293
I heard he took out a big loan last time. But I didn't know it was so serious.

493
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:14,353
Did you not know, either?

494
00:43:31,173 --> 00:43:34,153
(Loan amount: 3 billion won. Outstanding loan amount: 3 billion 75 million won)

495
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:38,443
He's quite behind on various expenses and rental payments.

496
00:43:38,443 --> 00:43:41,153
He hasn't paid the employees yet, either.

497
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:44,713
Since when?

498
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:46,423
It's been three months.

499
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,943
You should've told me.

500
00:43:48,943 --> 00:43:50,753
What did CEO Cha say?

501
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:54,503
He asked me to wait a bit, saying he'd get money soon. What can I say?

502
00:43:54,503 --> 00:43:57,613
He told me not to tell you because you'd be worried.

503
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:01,593
Does Father know?

504
00:44:01,593 --> 00:44:06,033
It'd be a disaster if he found out. He trusted his son on everything.

505
00:44:06,033 --> 00:44:09,463
He's only the advisor because of Chawoong Law Firm's reputation.

506
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:12,353
He's only been helping us get cases.

507
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:15,423
It's been a while since he hasn't been involved in management.

508
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:19,043
He had great hopes for his son.

509
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:23,313
I'm sure CEO Cha got scared as he was in charge of accounting.

510
00:44:24,343 --> 00:44:26,303
I can understand that.

511
00:44:26,303 --> 00:44:28,753

527
00:45:20,503 --> 00:45:23,323
He could go recluse for a few days if he's overworked.

528
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:25,993
Aren't you overreacting, Moon Yeong?

529
00:45:25,993 --> 00:45:29,903
You're not considering he might've disappeared voluntarily?

530
00:45:29,903 --> 00:45:31,803
Hello-

531
00:45:31,803 --> 00:45:33,493
Na Moon Yeong!

532
00:45:34,633 --> 00:45:36,803
Does she think I have no marriage experience?

533
00:45:36,803 --> 00:45:39,203
She's a friend of yours, right?

534
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:42,313
The Cinderella of Chawoong Foundation.

535
00:45:42,313 --> 00:45:44,003
Cinderella who?

536
00:45:44,003 --> 00:45:45,983
Is that what you guys call her?

537
00:45:45,983 --> 00:45:48,173
Well, no. It's not exactly ill-intended.

538
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:49,773
She's famous, you know.

539
00:45:49,773 --> 00:45:54,123
They've been dating since they were young and got married.

540
00:45:54,123 --> 00:45:56,653
I admit that Cha Seong Jae is a prince,

541
00:45:56,653 --> 00:46:00,833
but Na Moon Yeong, that warrior, Wolverine, is Cinderella?

542
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,963
Whoa, my classmates would lose it if they heard it.

543
00:46:02,963 --> 00:46:05,543
By the way, is something going on?

544
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:08,333
It's nothing. She suddenly can't reach her husband.

545
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:11,623
She worries too much since she's getting older.

546
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:15,793
What?

547
00:46:19,203 --> 00:46:21,043
The thing is...

548
00:46:33,963 --> 00:46:35,413
(Mother)

549
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:44,403
- Yes, Mother.
<i>- What's with missing report for Seong Jae?</i>

550
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:46,473
Well, this morning, the office was-

551
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:49,283
<i>It's not like he'd do anything weird somewhere.</i>

552
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:52,463
<i>He'll be back in a few days. Why make things worse?</i>

553
00:46:52,463 --> 00:46:54,553
<i>You're creating rumors for no reason.</i>

554
00:46:54,553 --> 00:46:57,713
It's even weirder because he wouldn't do anything strange.

555
00:46:58,713 --> 00:47:01,523
I'll make sure to find him.

556
00:47:01,523 --> 00:47:04,463
Don't worry. Okay.

557
00:47:12,433 --> 00:47:13,903
(Bom gets off school)

558
00:47:18,423 --> 00:47:20,573
(Call - Mother)

559
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:36,243
Well, Yeon Joo.

560
00:47:36,243 --> 00:47:39,623
I'm sorry, but by chance...

561
00:47:42,663 --> 00:47:46,293
I think I'll be on time if I leave now.

562
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:50,993
Don't worry. Okay.

563
00:48:12,633 --> 00:48:14,403
So annoying.

564
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,413
Bom.

565
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:35,073
Ms. Ha.

566
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:37,733
- Did you get a call from Mom?
- Yes.

567
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:41,013
It sounds like she's swamped today.

568
00:48:41,013 --> 00:48:43,423
I'll make you cookies. Do you want to come with me?

569
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:44,963
Yes.

570
00:49:27,493 --> 00:49:32,023
(Profits and loss - Chawoong Law Firm)

571
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:37,383
(Bom)
<i>I'm going home in Ms. Ha's car.</i>

572
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,013
(Client Kim Yoon Seon)

573
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:47,643
Ms. Kim?

574
00:49:47,643 --> 00:49:49,713
I'm Attorney Na Moon Yeong.

575
00:49:50,563 --> 00:49:52,063
Ms. Kim.

576
00:49:52,883 --> 00:49:54,373
<i>Yes.</i>

577
00:49:55,673 --> 00:49:58,263
After you disappeared from the court yesterday,

578
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:00,943
you came to my house last night, right?

579
00:50:00,943 --> 00:50:03,383
Why did you come and just leave?

580
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:06,693
Is it because of CEO Cha? Were you able to reach him?

581
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:09,993
Did you and CEO Cha, by chance...

582
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:14,203
We should just talk in person.

583
00:50:14,203 --> 00:50:17,323
<i>Attorney Cha hasn't come back yet?</i>

584
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:19,613
No. So we should talk in person right now-

585
00:50:19,613 --> 00:50:22,573
<i>Attorney, please save me.</i>

586
00:50:24,823 --> 00:50:26,683
<i>Meet me under the Haejeon Bridge.</i>

587
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:28,643
<i>There's something you need to know.</i>

588
00:50:30,313 --> 00:50:32,723
<i>You need to come alone. Otherwise,</i>

589
00:50:32,723 --> 00:50:35,193
<i>I won't be able to trust you.</i>

590
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:05,253
You came to my house last night, didn't you?

591
00:51:05,253 --> 00:51:07,693
What do you mean, save you?

592
00:51:07,693 --> 00:51:10,703
You really didn't hear from Attorney Cha?

593
00:51:10,703 --> 00:51:13,953
He never contacted me. I wanted to ask you that, too-

594
00:51:13,953 --> 00:51:16,403
He ran away, then.

595
00:51:16,403 --> 00:51:19,633
Traitor. He wants to survive on his own?

596
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:22,823
He just wants me to die alone, huh?

597
00:51:22,823 --> 00:51:25,693
Ms. Kim, what do you mean-

598
00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:27,713
It wasn't me.

599
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:28,813
Pardon?

600
00:51:28,813 --> 00:51:32,083
The one who killed. I didn't do it.

601
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,313
I took all the blame, trusting what Attorney Cha said.

602
00:51:34,313 --> 00:51:37,983
Who could I trust and go through the trial if he doesn't show up without a word?

603
00:51:37,983 --> 00:51:42,403
I made it clear that it wasn't me and I didn't want to do it.

604
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:44,263
Ms. Kim, what do you mean-

605
00:51:44,263 --> 00:51:48,813
All I did was follow Chief Ma.

606
00:51:48,813 --> 00:51:52,463
When Attorney Cha said I just need to do as I was told,

607
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:55,123
I shouldn't have believed him.

608
00:51:57,263 --> 00:51:59,243
CEO Cha made you do that?

609
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:02,003
He told you to take the blame for the case?

610
00:52:02,003 --> 00:52:03,983
How about the witness, then-

611
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:05,873
Do Jin Woo.

612
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:11,153
I should've known when they brought him in as the witness.

613
00:52:11,153 --> 00:52:14,503
He's a completely disposable person.

614
00:52:20,733 --> 00:52:24,243
What? I thought you came alone.

615
00:52:27,413 --> 00:52:30,223
- Pardon? I-
 - Why did that bastard come here?

616
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:31,513
Did you call him?

617
00:52:31,513 --> 00:52:35,363
- Wait, listen-
 - You just need me to die, huh?

618
00:52:35,363 --> 00:52:37,413
Ms. Kim.

619
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,023
<i>Please save me.</i>

620
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:19,723
<i>Why did that bastard come here?</i>

621
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:22,473
<i>You just need me to die, huh?</i>

622
00:53:47,483 --> 00:53:49,563
Mr. Do Jin Woo?

623
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:00,663
Who were you following?

624
00:54:00,663 --> 00:54:03,703
Me? Or Kim Yoon Seon?

625
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:09,053
Mr. Do, you were going to commit perjury, huh?

626
00:54:09,053 --> 00:54:11,573
Don't you know that perjury is a crime?

627
00:54:15,983 --> 00:54:18,483
Do you find this situation funny?

628
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:21,613
You don't know anything, but you're fearless.

629
00:54:21,613 --> 00:54:24,893
Yes, I don't know anything.

630
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:27,563
So please tell me.

631
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:29,463
You should...

632
00:54:37,103 --> 00:54:40,583
ask your husband, Cha Seong Jae, about it.

633
00:54:58,273 --> 00:55:00,833
<i>I'm Officer Lee Pil Seung of Haejeon Police Station.</i>

634
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:02,893
<i>You're Mr. Cha Seong Jae's wife, correct?</i>

635
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:04,703
Yes, that's correct.

636
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,373
<i>You reported Mr. Cha missing, right?</i>

637
00:55:08,373 --> 00:55:10,943
Yes, did you find him?

638
00:55:10,943 --> 00:55:15,583
<i>Well, we found an ID at an accident site.</i>

639
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:19,043
<i>I think you should come and check.</i>

640
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:29,763
<i>Did you get hurt?</i>

641
00:57:29,763 --> 00:57:32,503
<i>I cut myself while peeling fruit.</i>

642
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,613
<i>It goes well with your outfit.</i>

643
00:58:06,553 --> 00:58:08,353
<i>I'll be back.</i>

644
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:31,183

(Hide)

646
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:47,343
<i>There's no way it was suicide. He wouldn't do that.</i>

647
00:58:47,343 --> 00:58:51,323
<i>I'll find out what happened to my husband.</i>

648
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:54,273
<i>Seong Joon considered filing bankruptcy for his firm.</i>

649
00:58:54,273 --> 00:58:57,143
<i>The problem is, the law firm's debt isn't everything.</i>

650
00:58:57,143 --> 00:59:00,893
<i>Does it mean Seong Jae was deeply involved in something bad?</i>

651
00:59:00,893 --> 00:59:02,303
<i>Did you kill him, Mr. Do?</i>

652
00:59:02,303 --> 00:59:04,343
<i>You were going to commit perjury for money.</i>

653
00:59:04,343 --> 00:59:06,793
<i>It probably wasn't impossible for you to kill.</i>

654
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,413
<i>Did Chief Ma Gang tell you to?</i>

655
00:59:08,413 --> 00:59:13,333
<i>Look into it. Once you start digging the dirt on Attorney Cha Seong Jae,</i>
