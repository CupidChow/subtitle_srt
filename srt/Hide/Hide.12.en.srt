(Hide)

00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:18,951
(Last Episode)

5
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,731
What's wrong?

6
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,191
I should've seen that face before coming here.

7
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,021
What face?

8
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:08,701
I left my last present to Na Moon Yeong.

9
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:12,131
It should be revealed soon.

10
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:13,991
You're always, "Na Moon Yeong, Na Moon Yeong."

11
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,931
Please stop that now. Okay?

12
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:20,131
You won't be seeing her anymore.

13
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:24,481
So... what did Choi Ho Shik say?

14
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:27,531
Are you paying for the ship fare by killing me?

15
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:32,161
This is why you're no good, Cha Seong Jae.

16
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:37,461
Of all the people, you got help from Choi Ho Shik?

17
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,851
I don't care. Whatever trick he plays,

18
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:47,451
I just need to go to Switzerland.

19
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:54,881
You can't even leave the country on your own.

20
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:01,211
Would you even be able to get the 80 billion?

21
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:13,421
This is why I brought you all the way here.

22
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,901
Sunbaenim, should I search all the anchored ships?

23
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:37,471
Yes, go behind the building over there and send some here since the car is here.

24
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:38,511
Got it.

25
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:40,961
We'll split into two teams and search ships first.

26
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,131
<i>The call is not going through.</i>

27
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,601
Why isn't she answering her phone?

28
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,061
Help me just once. Help me just once.

29
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,561
Ha Yeon Joo. Ha Yeon Joo?

30
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:26,461
Ha Yeon Joo!

31
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:29,011
Bye.

32
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:31,171
Bye-

33
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:33,731
This bastard lost it.

34
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:38,671
You're an evil murderer, aren't you, Cha Seong Jae?

35
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:44,371
You two showed up side by side again.

36
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,651
What are you, the fighters of justice?

37
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:55,081
I need to take care of Ha Yeon Joo. You should stay out of it.

38
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:56,481
Give me a break.

39
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:59,631
I'm here to catch the scumbag criminal.

40
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:03,241
Move. I won't give you a pass anymore.

41
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:12,061
Stop, you bastard!

42
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:33,891
You killed Chief Yoon and ran away to...

43
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:36,391
Cha Seong Jae in the end?

44
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:38,141
Is that all?

45
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:40,501
That's what you want to ask me?

46
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:47,941
You haven't received the present I sent yet, have you?

47
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,381
Answer it.

48
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,951
Yes, Shin Hwa.

49
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,681
<i>Moon Yeong, don't be shocked and listen to me.</i>

50
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,831
<i>Your father... is in the ER.</i>

51
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:14,991
<i>He's not in great condition.</i>

52
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:17,171
<i>Did he get injured?</i>

53
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:18,581
<i>What happened, exactly?</i>

54
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:23,521
The thing is... Ha Yeon Joo apparently visited him.

55
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:26,671
<i>And he did this to himself.</i>

56
00:05:26,671 --> 00:05:30,081
<i>I think Ha Yeon Joo did something.</i>

57
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,701
<i>Hello?</i>

58
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,041
<i>Moon Yeong.</i>

59
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:38,041
Thank you, Shin Hwa.

60
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:42,331
Could you stay there for a moment? I'll be right there.

61
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:47,651
How tenacious.

62
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,051
- Ha Yeon Joo.
- He only cared about his survival.

63
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,401
Shut your mouth!

64
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:57,071
Your dad only cared about himself, no matter what happened to his daughter.

65
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:25,461
Don't try to do anything stupid, Ha Yeon Joo.

66
00:06:25,461 --> 00:06:27,351
You'll never die here.

67
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:31,071
I'll save you no matter what and put you in court.

68
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,171
You'll serve life in prison, anyway.

69
00:06:34,171 --> 00:06:35,831
Instigating my dad's suicide?

70
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:39,051
That won't add anything to your sentence since you maxed out.

71
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:57,001
Yes, Lieutenant.

72
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,171
We're on a ship right now.

73
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:09,931
Don't you have any respect for Hyung?

74
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:19,291
I'll still add all the punishment for your crimes... and put you in court.

75
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:22,461
Don't speak of punishment with that mouth of yours.

76
00:07:37,211 --> 00:07:41,401
Cha Seong Jae, this won't change anything! Stop!

77
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:44,201
Move. You might end up dying, too.

78
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:51,351
All right. You both want to die?

79
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,911
Fine.

80
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:00,061
Cha Seong Jae!

81
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:09,361
Stop...

82
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:13,151
Na Moon Yeong.

83
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,441
Attorney Na.

84
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,361
Aigoo... How do we find them here?

85
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:56,691
Do Jin Woo!

86
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:01,591
Na Moon Yeong!

87
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:06,201
Sunbaenim, they found castaways but something's strange.

88
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:08,941
I don't care. The coastal guards will take care of them.

89
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:12,561
Castaways?

90
00:11:12,561 --> 00:11:14,031
Yes.

91
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:34,441
Come on, people!

92
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:37,071
Are you okay?

93
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,431
Are you okay?

94
00:11:55,011 --> 00:11:58,751
Doctor, what do you think?

95
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:02,551
She needs to be treated more, but her life isn't in danger.

96
00:12:03,661 --> 00:12:06,831
When will she gain consciousness, then?

97
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:08,221
I'm not sure.

98
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:11,721
We'll move her to a ward and keep an eye on her.

99
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:15,991
- Ms. Kim, transfer her to the general ward.
- Okay.

100
00:12:15,991 --> 00:12:17,331
Watch her closely.

101
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:19,631
Put handcuffs on her as soon as she wakes up, okay?

102
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:21,151
Okay.

103
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:28,881
(Emergency Patient Treatment Area)
Hey, how did you go up there?

104
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:32,121
I saw Geumshin's logo on a container on the ship.

105
00:12:32,121 --> 00:12:35,381
I went up there just to look for Cha Seong Jae.

106
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:38,361
I didn't know the ship would sail so quickly.

107
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:43,141
We couldn't have recovered your body if they tossed you in the ocean.

108
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,831
That's why I jumped down immediately, Detective.

109
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,401
Yes, I'm proud of you.

110
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:52,131
Ma'am, you can make it more painful for him.

111
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:04,631
(Intensive Care Unit)

112
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:06,971
Aren't you overstraining yourself?

113
00:13:06,971 --> 00:13:10,101
I'll stay here. Go get some rest.

114
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:19,941
You're Mr. Na's guardian, correct?

115
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:22,011
Yes.

116
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:25,711
He'll live since he was treated quickly at the scene.

117
00:13:25,711 --> 00:13:31,241
But I'm suspecting hypoxic brain damage due to a heart attack.

118
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:33,281
The important thing is the complications.

119
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:38,501
I think he should receive oxygen therapy in the ICU for a while.

120
00:13:57,881 --> 00:14:00,201
<i>Director Joo is alive?</i>

121
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:10,191
I'll have to get her a caretaker or something.

122
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:12,311
How about Cha Seong Jae?

123
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,971

126
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:34,281
<i>He must've arrived in Switzerland by now.</i>

127
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:36,801
<i>There's no time!</i>

128
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:39,361
Hwang Tae Soo's DNA result hasn't come out yet?

129
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:42,281
<i>I-I'll look into it now. Just one moment.</i>

130
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,271
Hey, did Hwang Tae Soo's DNA result come out?

131
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:47,721
- Not yet.
- Why not? Tell them to do it faster!

132
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,671
You heard that, right? Yes, I'll be in touch. Yes, yes.

133
00:14:56,151 --> 00:14:58,861

134
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:03,361
Thank you, sir.

135
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:22,411
Could you please wait a moment, sir?

136
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:24,151
Sure.

137
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:33,701
Hwang Tae Soo's DNA test result came out.

138
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:37,571
Hwang Tae Soo is officially deceased.

139
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:40,641
We should put Cha Seong Jae on the wanted list, right?

140
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:42,591
Yes, got it.

141
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,921
- Pil Seung.
- Yes.

142
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:46,421
- Contact Interpol.
- Got it.

Is there any problem?

146
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,241
Not at all, sir.

147
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:08,991
They're here for your own personal protection.

148
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:12,011
We want to proceed as safely as possible.

Hello, this is Anna Yorson.

156
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,691
Really?

157
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:36,451
Okay.

158
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:41,691
Excuse me, sir, are you really Mr. Hwang Tae Soo?

159
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:43,301
Really?

160
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:53,971
You may need to check more of my identification.

161
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,371
I have an international driver's license in my car.

162
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:59,201
I'll bring it. I'll be right back.

163
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:08,111
He's gone.

164
00:17:26,121 --> 00:17:29,261
Hwang Tae Soo is registered dead. You should've stopped that!

165
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:31,421
<i>You mean you couldn't take out the money, right?</i>

166
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:33,801
No one can take out that money anymore.

167
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:37,361
Only Hwang Tae Soo can take out that money!

168
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:38,691
<i>Is that so?</i>

169
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,411
<i>What a pity.</i>

170
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:44,571
<i>I still sent you a gift. I hope you like it.</i>

171
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,361
What? Hello?

172
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,491
Mr. Cha Seong Jae.

173
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:10,811
We contacted Interpol.

174
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:12,671
Yes, he's the most wanted.

175
00:18:12,671 --> 00:18:15,001
He'll never cross the Swiss border.

176
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:17,881
He'll get sent to Korea as soon as he gets arrested.

177
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,181
Yes.

178
00:18:25,761 --> 00:18:27,671
Is Ha Yeon Joo awake yet?

179
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:31,001
No, she's still unconscious.

180
00:18:31,001 --> 00:18:35,021
<i>She'd better wake up. The arrest warrant is waiting for her.</i>

181
00:18:35,021 --> 00:18:36,151
How about Choi Ho Shik?

182
00:18:36,151 --> 00:18:38,681
<i>I updated the evidence already.</i>

183
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:41,561
<i>Don't worry, and just keep an eye on Ha Yeon Joo.</i>

184
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:44,121
<i>Are you sure you don't need extra police assistance?</i>

185
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:47,121
She'll be summoned as soon as she wakes up, right?

186
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:51,241
I need to see her wake up, too.

187
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,591
It wasn't easy to keep her alive.

188
00:18:55,631 --> 00:18:58,821
Okay, got it.

189
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,161
(Time to visit Father)

190
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:28,781
Attorney Na, this is your first visit here, right?

191
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,271
Is your head okay?

192
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,721
Yes.

193
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:35,851
Here. Detective Baek asked me to give it to you.

194
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:43,711
This was the only belonging your father submitted when he was imprisoned.

195
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:54,641
You said he ran away without anything back then, right?

196
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:58,811
He probably didn't have time to grab a photo, then.

197
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:04,281
(Intensive Care Unit)

198
00:20:16,501 --> 00:20:19,151
This is a very unflattering photo.

199
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:22,931
I was quite pretty then.

200
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:31,411
Out of the faces of mine that I remember,

201
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,651
how many of them did you get to see?

202
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:41,471
If you were by my side, then...

203
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:46,301
If you'd been protecting me by my side,

204
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:52,441
I wouldn't have had to put you in jail myself

205
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:58,461
and meet you on the hospital bed like this, right?

206
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:10,481
I knew you were alive, but I didn't look for you

207
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:13,111
because I blamed you.

208
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,961
You shouldn't have made me do that.

209
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:23,001
You made me see the man who died under your name.

210
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:26,821
You made me lie that he was my father.

211
00:21:26,821 --> 00:21:30,001
Those are the things you made me do.

212
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:35,891
But...

213
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,151
I was the same, too.

214
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:49,021
Just like how you blamed him for your sins,

215
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,551
I got you punished for my responsibilities.

216
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,441
Because I had no choice.

217
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,061
I was young...

218
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:00,651
and you told me to do it.

219
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,901
I knew I had made the decision myself,

220
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,711
but I turned the other way.

221
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,601
I know it's a bit late,

222
00:22:16,861 --> 00:22:19,671
but I want to finally correct things.

223
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:26,211
Because I finally realized... that I can't be free from the past...

224
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:29,281
and I still need to move forward.

225
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:35,111
So Dad,

226
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:40,541
it's not time yet.

227
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:42,401
Don't die.

228
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:46,361
You can't save anything by dying.

229
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,761
If you care about me,

230
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:53,191
you must live.

231
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:59,701
I can no longer...

232
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:03,461
let anyone die anymore.

What do you mean?

243
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:31,391
Were you not able to take out the money?

244
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:35,031
I just got a text from the police station.

245
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:38,251
It says I'm the suspect of Hwang Tae Soo's murder-

246
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:39,641
<i>Ignore stuff like that!</i>

247

Whether you're Cha Seong Jae or Hwang Tae Soo, you're good at running away.

253
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,891
I'll pay you double.

254
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:17,801
I'll give you twice as much as Choi Hoi Shik.

255
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,901
I mean, three times as much.

00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,891
Excuse me.

260
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:47,651
Hold on.

261
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,881
Who are you?

262
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:15,081
CEO Choi is so impatient.

263
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,901
Yes, Detective Baek.

264
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:24,731
Choi Ho Shik sent someone to Ha Yeon Joo.

265
00:27:24,731 --> 00:27:27,471
I managed to stop her, but...

266
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:31,821
the police officer who was guarding the ward disappeared.

267
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:36,601
Give me your car key.

268
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:39,611
Ha Yeon Joo, you'll die if you move around like this.

269
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:47,741
Me dying here...

270
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:50,971
is probably not the result you want.

271
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,001
You think I can't?

272
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:16,851
Let's go.

273
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:18,611
I'll drive you.

274
00:28:18,611 --> 00:28:21,151
You can't drive like that.

275
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:29,841
She's holding her hostage now?

276
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,381
Attorney Na should've screamed, at least.

277
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:35,081
There are tons of people at the hospital.

278
00:28:35,081 --> 00:28:38,981
Gosh, why is it so hard to keep them apart?

279
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:42,871
She's not exactly acting like a hostage.

280
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:44,111
Pardon?

281
00:28:44,111 --> 00:28:46,471
She wasn't forced to go with her.

282
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:49,361
I know where Attorney Na is.

283
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:51,131
Let's go now.

284
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:58,881
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

285
00:29:21,541 --> 00:29:23,261
Did you do it?

286
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:27,661
When did you change it?

I didn't think about coming here before that.

290
00:29:44,961 --> 00:29:51,351
Putting your father in jail made you finally want to come here?

291
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,501
I see. Because he paid for his sin?

292
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,261
I don't think he paid for his sin.

293
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:02,521
I just decided not to avoid it anymore.

294
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:08,301

Yes.

If it wasn't for my lie, then,

304
00:30:45,921 --> 00:30:47,871
you might've lived like me...

305
00:30:47,871 --> 00:30:50,921
and I might've lived like you.

306
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:55,931

00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:58,971
Mom.

361
00:36:00,621 --> 00:36:04,021
Are you okay? You're not injured anywhere?

362
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:08,271
I wanted to come sooner, but...

363
00:36:09,431 --> 00:36:14,141
I've been waiting for you for so long.

364
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,021

Bye.

370
00:37:43,191 --> 00:37:45,721
I was going to arrest you at the arrival,

371
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:50,521
but Attorney Na asked me to let Bom remember you as a good grandmother.

372
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:58,141
Ms. Park Myeong Hee, you're under arrest for the kidnap, assault, and murder of Hwang Tae Soo.

373
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:00,751
- You have the right to remain silent-
- No.

374
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:03,881
I won't remain silent.

375
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,431
I'll tell you everything.

376
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:07,381
I... I did everything.

377
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:09,051
My son didn't do anything wrong.

378
00:38:09,051 --> 00:38:10,791
I told him to do everything.

379
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:13,821
Okay, okay. Let's go.

380
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:16,421
It's great. She'll tell us everything.

381

382
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:29,801

383
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,961
What do you mean? You have to figure it out.

384

<i>and additional evidence.</i>

399
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:26,111
When you got him exonerated, you kept the evidence of arson, right?

400
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:28,371
I apologize for that.

401
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,451
How about your father? How's he doing?

402
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:35,971
There's no news yet.

403
00:39:35,971 --> 00:39:37,641
I'm sure he'll wake up soon.

404
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,371
He'll recover in no time.

405
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:41,681
I can just feel it.

406
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:46,961
Did you decide where to go?

407
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:50,041
I'll rest intensely. Don't stop me.

408
00:39:50,041 --> 00:39:52,741
I'll no longer be a prosecutor for the first time in 13 years.

409
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:55,071
I need to enjoy this time.

410
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:59,121
Don't cause a scene trying to catch someone there.

411
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:00,261
Just have fun.

412
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:02,831
What do you mean, cause a scene?

413
00:40:02,831 --> 00:40:08,071
Right. They're apparently re discussing the Haenan Village redevelopment.

414
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:11,491
Geumshin says they repaid the construction fee they embezzled.

415
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:16,221
Looks like the investors will get their money back even if the construction gets scrapped.

416
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:20,301
Detective Baek will be happy again.

417
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:24,221
The 80 billion stuck in the Swiss bank will be sent to the treasury, right?

418
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:26,871
Of course. It's money from a crime.

419
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,211
It'd take about five years.

420
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:32,501
There's nothing Cha Seong Jae can do anymore.

421

Choi Hoi Shik has plenty of evidence and witnesses.

422
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:39,531

- I don't think this would be easy.

448
00:42:04,951 --> 00:42:09,171
<i>Come now. At least we didn't get involved in that. Isn't that a relief?</i>

449

Congratulations, Mr. Do. That's so great.

she might need me someday.

471
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:08,591
If she extends her hand, I'll hold it tightly.

472
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:12,761
I'm sure you'll be a great support to her then.

473
00:44:12,761 --> 00:44:15,881

537
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,921
You don't have any criminal record similar to this?

538
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:10,681
You need to be honest with me.

539
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:15,651
The inspectors are looking around your office right now.

540
00:51:18,651 --> 00:51:21,131
<i>Yes, yes. I'm in front of the office.</i>

541
00:51:21,131 --> 00:51:23,771
I don't think there's anyone in here.

542
00:51:27,691 --> 00:51:31,311
The window's open here. Should we just go in?

543
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:32,921
Hey, hey!

544
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:35,241
What are we, thieves?

545
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:38,301
We're inspectors. Inspectors.

546
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:40,671
Oh, you're right.

547
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:46,331
He could be a drug dealer.

548
00:51:46,331 --> 00:51:48,981
Let me try unlocking the door.

549
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,141
Hey, you punk.

550
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:54,581
You're not going inside...

551
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:56,571
- Mr. Do?
- Excuse me.

552
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,751
The paralegal who consulted me on the messenger.

553
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:01,561
Did she go somewhere?

554
00:52:01,561 --> 00:52:04,881
Our competent paralegal is on vacation right now.

555
00:52:04,881 --> 00:52:09,221
By the way, how many days is she off for?

556
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,951
Where... Where are you going?

557
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,951
The king crabs just arrived. I need to receive them.

558
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:20,141
I can give you a discount.

559
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:25,971
If you put this on top at the end...

560
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:30,031
One, two, three, four, five, six...

561
00:52:30,031 --> 00:52:32,061
Oh, yay!

562
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:38,381
I can tell you put a lot of effort into it.

563
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:41,621
Bom is responding well to therapy sessions.

564
00:52:41,621 --> 00:52:45,111
The signs of somatization are almost gone, too.

565
00:52:45,111 --> 00:52:48,861
I could say she's stable now.

566
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:51,051
That's a relief.

567
00:52:51,051 --> 00:52:58,041
And Bom rarely talks about her father abroad.

568
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:03,151
I think we should give her more time on that.

569
00:53:03,151 --> 00:53:08,101
Children continue to develop while we're waiting, too.

570
00:53:09,141 --> 00:53:12,731
I'm sure Bom will be okay.

571
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,431
Thank you, ma'am.

572
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:18,841
By the way, when is her father coming back?

573
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:26,661
He probably won't be able to.

574
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,201
Pardon?

575
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:36,891
We weren't able to identify him as neither his name

576
00:53:36,891 --> 00:53:40,281
nor nationality was confirmed.

577
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:44,391
Investigating takes priority.

578
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:48,441
I said he couldn't be released without a warrant.

579
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:50,931
Just look at his condition.

580
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:56,781
Doctor, he could be either residing illegally or a criminal.

581
00:53:56,781 --> 00:54:00,621
If something happens to him after releasing him,

582
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:03,931
will the police take responsibility?

583
00:54:11,871 --> 00:54:13,441
Hello, Grandpa!

584
00:54:13,441 --> 00:54:15,981
How are you doing, Father?

585
00:54:15,981 --> 00:54:20,981
Seeing my granddaughter makes me feel all better.

586
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:22,301
How are you?

587
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:23,561
- Good.
- Yeah?

588
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,241
Yeah.

No. 813.

597
00:54:56,591 --> 00:55:00,471
I'll force you to eat if you refuse to eat again.

598
00:55:00,471 --> 00:55:02,411
Okay?

599
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:06,661
She's saying no to visits or letters.

600
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:09,161
But they won't stop writing to her.

601
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:13,081
(Shin Hwa)
<i>Hey! Your vacation is over. You'd better come back now.</i>

602
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:17,201
<i>Not to mention your pay, I won't be able to pay the rent at this rate!</i>

603
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:24,231
What is it, Mom?

604
00:56:24,231 --> 00:56:25,781
It's nothing.

605
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:27,501
I was wondering how your mood was.

606
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:29,091
My mood?

607
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:33,661
Seon Ah!

608
00:56:33,661 --> 00:56:35,631
Bom!

609
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:38,871
Seon Ah, are you leaving the academy?

610
00:56:38,871 --> 00:56:41,011
Yes. Bom, let's go to my place.

611
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:42,561
Your place?

612
00:56:42,561 --> 00:56:46,021
Well, I need to do my homework.

613
00:56:46,021 --> 00:56:47,821
The thing is...

614
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:51,711
- Really?
- Yeah.

615
00:56:56,001 --> 00:56:58,361
So cute.

616
00:56:59,561 --> 00:57:03,621
Mom, can I see the puppy at Seon Ah's place?

617
00:57:03,621 --> 00:57:08,231
Her puppy is really cute. Please?

618
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:10,671
Mom!

619
00:57:10,671 --> 00:57:12,471
Please.

620
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:13,631
I don't think I can stop her.

621
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:15,911
What can we do?

622
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:17,411
I'll have to leave her with you.

623
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:20,821
- Sure.
- Yes!

624
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:24,111
Wait for me! Wait!

625
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:27,291
Slow down!

626
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:31,741
Bye, Mom!
