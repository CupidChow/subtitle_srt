00:00:01,615 --> 00:00:03,765
(Park Ji Il / Nam Gi Ae / Kim Sang Ho / Kim Gook Hee)

3
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:15,865
(Hide)

4
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:20,085
I'll make you the murderer of Chairman Choi.

5
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:24,195
Whether I insist on your innocence or admit the guilt,

6
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,595
Ha Yeon Joo will turn us into murderers.

7
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,435
I know you're not the real culprit.

8
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:35,165
So I've been thinking a lot.

9
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:38,115
What does Ha Yeon Joo want from me?

10
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:40,945
I'm sure this trial must be a trap.

11
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,895
But there's one truth.

12
00:00:46,895 --> 00:00:50,085
You didn't kill Chairman Choi,

13
00:00:50,955 --> 00:00:53,275
but you neglected Mr. Ha Jae Pil.

14
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:57,545
You and I have to pay for that sin somehow.

15
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:01,735
Consider this as a punishment for running away

16
00:01:01,735 --> 00:01:04,535
and looking the other way 25 years ago.

17
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,295
I will do the same.

18
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:10,025
<i>Ms. Ha Yeon Joo and Mr. Choi Ho Shik</i>

19
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:14,335
lost their fathers because of my father.

20
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:17,785
I sincerely apologize to them.

21
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,485
Don't think...

22
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:03,345
you can just apologize!

23
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,225
By making a false statement,

24
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:22,325
I destroyed one family. I will not...

25
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:27,115
try to avoid legal and moral responsibility, and...

26
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,745
if an investigation is initiated,

27
00:02:29,745 --> 00:02:33,555
I'll be assisting diligently.

28
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,295
Here she comes!

29
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,645
(Episode 10)

30
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:06,335
You had no idea he wasn't your biological father?

31
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:08,575
How do you feel now? Please say something.

32
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:11,075
Since he left when I was very young,

33
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:14,435
I didn't think he might not be my father.

34
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:16,255
That's all.

35
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:23,215
Attorney Na Moon Yeong!

36
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:25,435
What's the reason you exposed your father's crime?

37
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:29,855
A rumor says the motivation was resentment toward Geumshin Corporation's executives.

38
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:33,525
I said everything I could say in court.

39
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:35,575
I'm very sorry.

40
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:37,345
I'm willing

41
00:03:37,345 --> 00:03:42,485
to be legally responsible and will take on the criticisms.

42
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,755
Why did you expose him?

43
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:11,215
You became a very conscientious lawyer.

44
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:17,775
Is it because you're still legally Chawoong Law Firm's daughter-in-law?

45
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,225
I know there's no going back.

46
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,615
I won't avoid getting punished by you.

47
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:25,505
So let's please stop.

48
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:28,655
Stop? Stop what?

49
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:31,005
I've been hurting for 25 years.

50
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:34,465
You think talking for five minutes was enough?

51
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,375
You said you'll see what decision I make.

52
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,765
This is my decision.

53
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:44,335
But you don't want an apology or legal punishment.

54
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,025
What is it that you want, then?

55
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:48,165
Apology?

56
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:51,765
This isn't an apology. It's surrender.

57
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:55,895
You sacrificed your father and surrendered just now.

58
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,575
You know I have evidence to prove his innocence,

59
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:03,185
but you turned your father into a murderer to save yourself.

60
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:05,795
In order to be forgiven for lying,

61
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:10,085
you dodged a bullet by lying again.

62
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:12,925
How dare you call that trickery an apology?

63
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:16,065
Were you going to accept it if I insisted he was innocent?

64
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:20,515
So what is it you really want?

65
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:22,315
You...

66
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,445
need to become painfully lonely, too.

67
00:05:27,325 --> 00:05:29,185
Like me.

68
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:31,235
It'd be fair that way.

69
00:05:32,135 --> 00:05:36,725
You took my only family away from me.

70
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:40,115
That's why I'll...

71
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:43,855
try to take everything you have, too.

72
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:49,695
Your husband and father.

73
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,935
It was a pretty good course meal, right?

74
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:55,175
There's only dessert left now.

75
00:05:55,175 --> 00:06:00,375
You already know how much I love sweets.

76
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:07,795
Don't even try to mess with Bom.

77
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:18,115
Yeah.

78
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:26,255
Client Ha Yeon Joo's deputy, Hwang Tae Soo. He's the one.

79
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:35,405
The delegation detail is to withdraw the entire amount of the account.

80
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:38,695
Perfect. I'll see you soon.

81
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:04,005
(Bom)

82
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:14,545
<i>Bom, how about you live with me at Grandma's?</i>

83
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:26,925
Both the law firm and the foundation are about to go down.

84
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,615
You're driving me crazy. Please sit down.

85
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,925
Try to calm down.

86
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:32,705
Calm down?

87
00:07:32,705 --> 00:07:36,775
The entire Haejeon City is talking about Moon Yeong and her father right now.

88
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:41,225
I'm the one who did all sorts of dirty work for those scammers!

89
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:43,015
If the party finds out about this-

90
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:44,905
We also thought...

91
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:47,375
<i>that man was dead, too.</i>

92
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,295
<i>We were fooled, too.</i>

93
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:52,765
Do you think people would believe that?

94
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:58,765
Don't get too anxious.

95
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,795
You took donations from Geumshin Corporation

96
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:09,145
and sold off homeless people's names.

97
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:13,275
You should worry about the campaign funds and backdoor dealings instead.

98
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,525
Shouldn't you be thankful if Na Seok Jin's case covers things up

99
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,985
the entire election period?

100
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:25,215
People are saying Moon Yeong is an exemplary attorney who told the truth

101
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:29,095
and she's as impressive as her father-in-law.

102
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,355
He's been hiding for decades.

103
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:36,015
Why did he have to show up now and cause a scene?

104
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,575
And did he even kill the chairman?

105
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:44,115
He might've been screwed by Ha Yeon Joo.

106
00:08:44,115 --> 00:08:47,425
But he admitted to the crime calmly in court.

107
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,085
Maybe he did that for his child.

108
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:51,715
You probably wouldn't understand it.

109
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:11,055
What are you planning to do?

110
00:09:11,825 --> 00:09:15,335
I confirmed that the power of attorney is legit.

111
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:17,625
Will you leave the country?

112
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:21,055
How? Last time you-

113
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:24,235
Mom,

114
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:28,605
I can't leave as Hwang Tae Soo, who's banned from leaving the country.

115
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:34,725
This is my last chance to leave as Cha Seong Jae. So Mom,

116
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:37,475
please take good care of Bom.

117
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,665
Don't worry about her.

118
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:42,725
I'll leave safely with her.

119
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,825
I never ordered this.

120
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:14,875
You didn't answer my call. So I just decided to bring it.

121
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,995
You should eat something.

122
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,065
Thank you.

123
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,555
Sure.

124
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,055
Na Moon Yeong!

125
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:01,615
After all that,

126
00:11:02,585 --> 00:11:04,975
do you even have any appetite?

127
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:11,555
I don't even want to talk to you,

128
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:13,795
but let me ask you since I'm so lost.

129
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,545
Why did you do that?

130
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:19,035
I'm sorry, Shin Hwa.

131
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:24,625
Yes, you did the wrong thing back then.

132
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:27,915
You knew it was someone else's body, but you ignored it. Of course, that's bad.

133
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:31,795
But you were 17 back then.

134
00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:37,175
You can make mistakes at that age, but not anymore.

135
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:40,585
Na Moon Yeong, don't you know what this trial is about?

136
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:45,055
It was a great chance to fix things regardless of your father.

137
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:47,645
We could've locked up all the bastards at Geumshin Corporation.

138
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:49,785
- Shin Hwa, I-
- No.

139
00:11:49,785 --> 00:11:52,115
I'm not done talking.

140
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:57,365
Today, you covered up the murder those bastards committed.

141
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:07,925
It's normal to hear rumors during the election season,

142
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:10,675
but this is such a serious issue.

143
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:13,935
It's my fault for welcoming the wrong person to the family.

144
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:17,555
But my daughter-in-law is good-natured that...

145
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:22,375
she stubbornly refuses to tolerate anything illegal.

146
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:24,135
Geez...

147
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,715
Gosh, Director Cha.

148
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:35,655
You shouldn't have troubled yourself.

149
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,185
Come join us.

150
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,645
Yes.

151
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:42,715
Pardon?

152
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:46,325
Candidate Cha Woong's supporters' association?

153
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:50,015
Not only were you a good friend of the late chairman,

154
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:54,635
but you and your son cared for the homeless community as if they were your family.

155
00:12:55,585 --> 00:13:00,485
Chairman said money makes a successful public servant, not luck.

156
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:05,195
That's why I'd like to donate to your campaign.

157
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:07,135
Gosh.

158
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:11,835
You won't be short of campaign funds for the election.

159
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:16,985
Of course, it will be through the party's official supporters' association.

160
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:19,015
Of course, of course.

161
00:13:20,205 --> 00:13:21,515
Geez, phone call.

162
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:26,005
Allow me to answer this for a moment.

163
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:39,625
What are you trying to do right now?

164
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:43,465
Ever since you made a pact with my company,

165
00:13:43,465 --> 00:13:46,465
we've been forever allies, haven't we?

166
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:48,505
Why would you say that now...

167
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:52,085
I'll cancel the Haean Village project.

168
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:58,495
To do so, I need to throw bait at the angry investors and investigative agencies.

169
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:05,815
I think an attorney at Chawoong Law Firm would be appropriate.

170
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:09,405
Either your daughter-in-law or son.

171
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:15,415
Bring me the evidence that one of them got involved in the Haean Village project and ruined it.

172
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:18,335
Even if it requires fabricating.

173
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:25,155
Gosh, I'm curious.

174
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,895
Who you'd end up abandoning.

175
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:41,635
Thank you.

176
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:43,625
Thanks for the meal.

177
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,945
Well...

178
00:14:45,945 --> 00:14:48,485
you know the Hwang Tae Soo case?

179
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:51,625
I think we can restart the investigation.

180
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,865
You'll reinvestigate Tae Soo's case?

181
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,495
Geumshin-

182
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:58,535
Hot.

183
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,645
Eat slowly.

184
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:04,105
Since they've been causing so much noise,

185
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:08,725
we're revisiting all the related cases.

186
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:11,285
We should reveal the truth behind his unfair death.

187
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:14,185
Thank you.

188
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,705
How's Attorney Na?

189
00:15:18,705 --> 00:15:20,485
You're in touch with her.

190
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:24,475
How could she be okay?

191
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,595
She revealed that her father killed someone

192
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:29,215
and locked him in herself.

193
00:15:32,145 --> 00:15:36,355
It'd be a disaster if something goes wrong with the Haean Village project.

194
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:40,115
Honestly, I want Geumshin to go out of business,

195
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:42,285
but I want the resort to be completed.

196
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:46,335
No, it has to be completed.

197
00:15:46,335 --> 00:15:47,805
Why?

198
00:15:48,935 --> 00:15:51,505
Did you purchase a unit?

199
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,495
(Haean Village Task Force)

200
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:05,345
(Haean Village project's main contractor, KS Miracle, is rumored to have gone bankrupt)

201
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:07,365
What's this?

202
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,985
What in the hell...

203
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:14,075
Where are you going?

204
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:15,955
<i>Geumshin Corporation's...</i>

205
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:19,975
The Haean Village resort project will be tentatively suspended.

206
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:23,415
What's she saying? What's going on?

207
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:27,315
<i>It's unclear if it will be completed by the planned date.</i>

208
00:16:27,315 --> 00:16:30,265
<i>I can't even imagine how devastating this news must be.</i>

209
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:34,725
When will you start building if you're suspending now?

210
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,835
It's not our fault the chairman's dead.

211
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:39,845
Who will be compensating for our loss?

212
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:47,325
Our inspection process revealed serious corruption within the company

213
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,785
<i>while developing Haean Village and...</i>

214
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:52,945
<i>we learned that an attorney at a law firm in Haejeon City was involved.</i>

215
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,735
<i>We're currently investigating.</i>

216
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:58,845
<i>After confirming the connection, we'll request an official investigation</i>

217
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:02,985
to avoid investors' potential loss as much as possible.

218
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:05,425
What are you talking about?

219
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:25,315
I'll be right there after meeting Aunt Shin Hwa.

220
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:30,065
Don't go anywhere after the class and wait right there, okay?

221
00:17:33,665 --> 00:17:35,145
Bom,

222
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:38,465
should we take a break from the academy?

223
00:17:38,465 --> 00:17:40,605
No, I'm okay.

224
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,545
- You are?
- Yes.

225
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:47,015
I'm okay if you're okay.

226
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,985
Bom, wait in the car.

227
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:58,205
Okay.

228
00:17:58,205 --> 00:18:01,525
<i>Attorney Na, did you hear about the Haean Village?</i>

229
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,445
<i>The construction was suspended.</i>

230
00:18:03,445 --> 00:18:05,885
- The resort construction?
<i>- Yes.</i>

231
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,165
<i>They found out about corruption involving a lawyer during the development.</i>

232
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:12,825
<i>They're probably talking about Cha Seong Jae, right?</i>

233
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:18,515
They had no intention of building the resort from the beginning.

234
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:19,965
What?

235
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:24,565
What if they took Chairman Choi's money pretending to be building

236
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:28,535
the resort and now using me to bury the project

237
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,775
since they don't need it anymore?

238
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:35,665
And they'll frame you for Ha Yeon Joo's embezzlement, too.

239
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:40,755
She's seriously...

240
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:44,485
a 2XL-sized crazy bitch!

241
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,025
Mom!

242
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:52,745
Let's go.

243
00:18:52,745 --> 00:18:54,915
Did you have fun?

244
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:05,725
Bom.

245
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:10,595
Long time no see.

246
00:19:12,265 --> 00:19:14,585
Since you no longer come to the cooking class,

247
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:17,965
I prepared these for you.

248
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:21,815
I baked these thinking of you.

249
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:24,535
I wanted to set things straight with you.

250
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:32,725
I'm not the type who takes what's precious to you.

251
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:40,605
By the way, your mom is late again.

252
00:19:40,605 --> 00:19:43,125
All of your friends left.

253
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:48,085
You must be very lonely.

254
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:52,725
Mom doesn't let you see Dad often, either, right?

255
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,555
That's not true.

256
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,325
Try some.

257
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:04,995
Bom!

258
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:12,375
Both the mom and the kid refuse to take what I give them.

259
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:22,075
(CEO Choi Ho Shik)

260
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,465
(CEO Choi Ho Shik)

261
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:51,045
Bom!

262
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:55,935
Bom!

263
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:00,375
Mom.

264
00:21:03,045 --> 00:21:06,275
Why did you come out of there? You scared me.

265
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,535
Did Ms. Ha leave?

266
00:21:12,455 --> 00:21:14,715
Was Ms. Ha here?

267
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:19,645
Yes, but I didn't even say hello.

268
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,315
Is that so?

269
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:26,185
I wonder why she was here.

270
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:27,855
I don't know.

271
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:33,415
By the way, she gave me cookies,

272
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:36,245
but I said I wouldn't eat them and threw them away.

273
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:41,425
Mom, I hate Ms. Ha a lot now, too.

274
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:47,175
Let's go.

275
00:22:08,915 --> 00:22:11,395
(Na Moon Yeong)

276
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:18,525
(Attorney Na Moon Yeong put an end to the Haean Village development)

277
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,085
Bom, you know...

278
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:31,085
that sometimes people get angry at me because I'm a lawyer.

279
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:39,195
Should we move, Bom?

280
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:40,735
Move?

281
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:47,635
Why don't we go somewhere nicer and have more fun?

282
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:51,645
Will it be you and me, the two of us?

283
00:22:51,645 --> 00:22:54,805
Yes. You and me, the two of us.

284
00:23:00,815 --> 00:23:03,835
<i>I thought you were smart, Director Joo.</i>

285
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:05,925
Why are you overstepping your boundaries?

286
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:08,465
It had to be done at some point.

287
00:23:08,465 --> 00:23:12,005
And I'm sure it won't cost you anything, either.

288
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:20,905
I'm asking why you did that now, okay?

289
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:24,495
The company's market value plummeted. How is that not a loss?

290
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:29,435
The missing 80 billion, the Haean Village's project fund.

291
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:33,455
Attorney Cha Seong Jae has it under a borrowed account now.

292
00:23:37,865 --> 00:23:40,365
Here's information regarding that.

293
00:23:40,365 --> 00:23:47,275
And I added the evidence of you instigating Chariman's murder, too.

294
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:50,785
Why don't you hear your own voice?

295
00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:00,375
I expected something like this from you.

296
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:06,355
But what if you died before you used this?

297
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:12,575
I'll add the recording of this, too.

298
00:24:12,575 --> 00:24:17,925
It will be revealed to the world the moment something happens to me.

299
00:24:19,595 --> 00:24:25,385
Let's say the construction is being scrapped now, then.

300
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:28,295
You already announced that on your own.

301
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:36,495
What is it that you really want?

302
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:41,565
Starting now, I don't exist to you.

303
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:45,175
Don't get me involved or provoke me anymore.

304
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:48,815
Nothing will be revealed to the world, then.

305
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:52,535
And...

306
00:24:52,535 --> 00:24:55,005
he was your father.

307
00:24:55,005 --> 00:24:57,635
Pretend you're sad, at least.

308
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:03,785
Was it Attorney Na Moon Yeong?

309
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:09,185
I'm happy that my father's case was quieted down,

310
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:12,025
but it looks like she's tangled up with you.

311
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:25,565
Na Moon Yeong.

312
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,235
<i>Moon Yeong, I got transferred.</i>

313
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:38,915
Geumshin Corporation sure is impressive.

314
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:45,385
I was transferred to the Judicial Research Council because I went after them once.

315
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:50,035
I'm sorry, Shin Hwa. It's my fault.

316
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:52,205
It's not like we didn't know this would happen.

317
00:25:52,205 --> 00:25:54,535
We both knew.

318
00:25:54,535 --> 00:25:59,685
They would've gotten me fired by using whatever they had if it wasn't for this.

319
00:26:00,715 --> 00:26:02,255
But...

320
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:07,655
there's still some time left before the transfer. I can't just leave quietly. No.

321
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:11,595
Yes. That's your style.

322
00:26:15,435 --> 00:26:16,855
Since we're on the topic...

323
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:19,655
Hey, moving on already?

324
00:26:19,655 --> 00:26:21,885
Can't you feel bad a little longer?

325
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:29,355
(Letter of Acceptance)

326
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:35,085
Don't worry so much. Everything will be fine.

327
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:40,275
Yes, I have faith in you.

328
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:45,005
I'm more worried about Bom's custody.

329
00:26:45,005 --> 00:26:48,275
I'm definitely in a better position.

330
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:53,255
I'll emphasize the fact that her father is imprisoned for murder.

331
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,925
How could you kill someone...

332
00:26:58,525 --> 00:27:03,115
How could he have killed two people...

333
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:20,425
<i>I want to live with Mom, Dad.</i>

334
00:27:25,535 --> 00:27:29,145
I'm thinking of moving with Bom.

335
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:32,915
I won't be able to visit you for a while, Father.

336
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:35,705
Is there something wrong?

337
00:27:36,995 --> 00:27:42,495
I think this is the only way to protect Bom.

338
00:27:43,415 --> 00:27:45,265
I'm sorry...

339
00:27:46,295 --> 00:27:50,435
for making you go through what I went through.

340
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:53,945
It's okay.

341
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:57,535
Once everything gets sorted out,

342
00:27:58,605 --> 00:28:00,735
I'll visit you then.

343
00:28:01,895 --> 00:28:03,385
Okay.

344
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:18,145
Thank you for helping me always.

345
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,225
Give me a call again sometime.

346
00:28:36,155 --> 00:28:37,805
Child abuse?

347
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:42,465
Child abuse is the surest way to take a child away from the mom.

348
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:44,725
She doesn't hit her child, though.

349
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,265
Assault isn't the only form of abuse.

350
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:51,365
Negligence is considered an abuse, too.

351
00:28:52,995 --> 00:28:55,595
She always leaves her alone and...

352
00:28:55,595 --> 00:29:00,305
she even brings ex-cons to her house since she's a lawyer.

353
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:04,365
You know about the murder of Geumshin Corporation's honorary chairman, right?

354
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:09,235
I'm ashamed to admit it, but I can't believe he's my granddaughter's grandfather.

355
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:12,105
Thinking about how shocked she'd be...

356
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,865
Regardless of the outcome, the fact that she was reported alone

357
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:20,615
will jeopardize her getting the custody

358
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:24,225
and you might be able to separate Bom from her, too.

359
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:27,225
I understand what you mean,

360
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:31,925
but there's nothing we can do purely based on circumstantial evidence.

361
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:35,725
The children this center is protecting...

362
00:29:35,725 --> 00:29:40,255
are being cared for at the shelter our foundation runs.

363
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:46,355
But you refuse to help my granddaughter?

364
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:50,775
Do you not care about anything because you want to defeat Na Moon Yeong?

365
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:53,855
You ruined a trial because you couldn't control her.

366
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,065
And now you're dragging Bom in?

367
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:59,725
You shouldn't misunderstand my good intentions.

368
00:29:59,725 --> 00:30:02,275
Looks like you haven't assessed the situation yet.

369
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:07,005
Na Moon Yeong will disappear with Bom soon.

370
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,025
What do you...

371
00:30:11,475 --> 00:30:13,645
You didn't know.

372
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,385
I think she's almost ready to leave.

373
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:22,205
How many days will it last if we report? It's not like she'd just do nothing.

374
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:26,645
I thought you needed those few days.

375
00:30:26,645 --> 00:30:31,275
To take Bom before Na Moon Yeong does.

376
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:38,325
Why don't we contact the mother first...

377
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:41,725
Please take an emergency measure temporarily for now.

378
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:50,665
We strongly suspect that she's being neglected as we speak.

379
00:30:52,855 --> 00:30:56,825
Separate the child from her and investigate afterward.

380
00:30:56,825 --> 00:31:01,345
The center won't get into trouble if you follow the procedure afterward.

381
00:31:01,345 --> 00:31:04,135
We'll accept the outcome, too.

382
00:31:08,935 --> 00:31:10,915
Bom,

383
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:16,005
I found a fun school you can go to when we move.

384
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:18,555
A fun school? Where?

385
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,545
It's located at...

386
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:27,435
<i>I'm bringing pork cutlets. I'll be there soon.</i>

387
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:31,315
Huh? The motorcycle ahjussi is bringing us pork cutlets.

388
00:31:31,315 --> 00:31:32,945
It must be from a famous place.

389
00:31:32,945 --> 00:31:34,885
Pork cutlets?

390
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:40,135
He must be here.

391
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,975
- Bom! Bom!
- Mom! Mom!

392
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,435
- Bom! Bom!
- Mom!

393
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:10,355
- Bom!
- Come on, be gentle.

394
00:32:10,355 --> 00:32:12,795
Mom!

395
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:14,645
I'm okay, Bom.

396
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:17,825
There's a misunderstanding, okay? Trust me.

397
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:20,245
Look at me, Bom.

398
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:22,575
I'll be right behind you.

399
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:25,265
- I'll protect you until the end, okay?
- Okay.

400
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:27,115
We're leaving now.

401
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:30,305
Mom! Mom!

402
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:32,915
Mom!

403
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:35,255
Mom...

404
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,405
Bom!

405
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:40,245
Bom! Bom!

406
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:43,095
Attorney Na, what's going on?

407
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:46,645
We'll check the condition of the home first.

408
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:48,505
Let's go in.

409
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,665
What exactly is...

410
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:58,855
Detective, what the hell is going on?

411
00:33:00,465 --> 00:33:03,595
Someone reported her for child neglect. They said she's always alone.

412
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:05,295
Report?

413
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:08,535
You know that she won't do such a thing.

414
00:33:08,535 --> 00:33:11,335
That's why I'm here. This isn't even my case.

415
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:16,365
Wow, they separated them immediately with a single phone call.

416
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:19,735
A higher-up must've done something.

417
00:33:19,735 --> 00:33:22,415
Separate? Who reported her, then?

418
00:33:22,415 --> 00:33:24,645
How am I supposed to know?

419
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,455
Do you have to go this far?

420
00:33:46,455 --> 00:33:49,005
I have nothing to say to you.

421
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:55,065
I told you not to touch Bom.

422
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:57,385
Do I have to listen to you?

423
00:33:59,935 --> 00:34:02,605
What are you doing in front of me right now?

424
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:04,485
Let go of me!

425
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:06,815
Did you hit me just now? Did you?

426
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:09,575
- Huh?
- Call the police, Mother. That'd be better.

427
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:13,485
Police? That's great. Let's go. They're at my house.

428
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,175
Go and tell them all about what you people did.

429
00:34:16,175 --> 00:34:18,035
Attorney Na, please calm down.

430
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:21,205
"You people," did you say?

431
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:25,485
I want to raise my own granddaughter. What's the issue?

432
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:28,435
Who raised you to behave this way?

433
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:31,505
Did Cha Seong Jae become a piece of trash because you raised him?

434
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:33,555
W-What?

435
00:34:34,475 --> 00:34:35,885
You're a murderer's daughter.

436
00:34:35,885 --> 00:34:39,475
How dare you speak of my son that way?

437
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:41,935
You think he'd care how much you defend him?

438
00:34:41,935 --> 00:34:45,305
None of the stuff you're doing will do anything.

439
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:48,105
What kind of attorney are you?

440
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:50,145
You run into my house with your car.

441
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:53,005
And you dragged me around by my hair.

442
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:55,445
This is why they took your daughter away.

443
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:02,515
Attorney Na.

444
00:35:03,515 --> 00:35:05,475
That's enough now.

445
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:10,035
And you. If you take another step closer,

446
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:12,175
I won't stand for it.

447
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,915
Ha Yeon Joo,

448
00:35:14,915 --> 00:35:20,305
you lost the chance to make me feel guilty toward you until I die.

449
00:35:20,305 --> 00:35:22,575
You shouldn't have done that to Bom.

450
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:26,305
I told you not to feel sorry.

451
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:31,465
I said I don't need your apology.

452
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:35,335
Excuse me! Officer! Officer!

453
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:41,715
It was mutual assault. Reach an agreement if you can.

454
00:35:41,715 --> 00:35:43,625
Mutual?

455
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,715
How is this mutual?

456
00:35:45,715 --> 00:35:49,915
It sounds like she was assaulted the entire time.

457
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,825
It wasn't like that.

458
00:35:51,825 --> 00:35:55,075
I saw her hitting Attorney Na.

459
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:57,515
So, who hit whom first?

460
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:01,875
I heard you hit her first.

461
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,585
It's okay.

462
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:07,635
I won't make an issue out of this.

463
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:12,255
It's because I can understand how she feels.

464
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,445
Okay, then.

465
00:36:23,445 --> 00:36:26,805
Ms. Na, there was a temporary emergency order.

466
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:29,575
You must keep a minimum of 100-meter distance from the child

467
00:36:29,575 --> 00:36:31,175
until the investigation ends.

468
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:33,245
You can't call or text her, either.

469
00:36:33,245 --> 00:36:35,565
You need to sign a paper.

470
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:38,345
Just one moment.

471
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:48,485
You heard that, right? You can't be near her.

472
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:50,025
How...

473
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:53,825
How could a father...

474
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:57,175
take a mother away from a child? Are you crazy?

475
00:37:00,855 --> 00:37:03,475
Think about what you did first.

476
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:06,325
You're blaming me again?

477
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:07,785
Yes.

478
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:11,755
You always needed someone to blame.

479
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:15,335
You felt suffocated because of your father, and I was to blame for what you did.

480
00:37:15,335 --> 00:37:17,735
If something went wrong, it was Ha Yeon Joo's fault.

481
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,835
You were always like that.

482
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,985
Wake up, Na Moon Yeong.

483
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:27,725
What Bom needs now isn't a mom who keeps getting into trouble.

484
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,485
It's her dad.

485
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:33,225
And a home where she gets taken good care of.

486
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:39,745
You said you won't end up like your dad,

487
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:43,305
but you faked your death and abandoned your child. And now what?

488
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:47,195
You're a coward who uses your child whenever you need her.

489
00:37:47,195 --> 00:37:49,285
You'll never take my daughter away.

490
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:52,285
Bom doesn't need a dad like you. No...

491
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:55,005
she doesn't need a family like yours.

492
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:32,145
Bom, let's cook together.

493
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:34,665
There's a pizza, too.

494
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:36,265
Should we make it with your friends?

495
00:38:36,265 --> 00:38:39,255
Bom, your parents are here.

496
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:46,475
Bom.

497
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:09,345
Where are you going?

498
00:39:09,345 --> 00:39:11,965
- I need to go find Bom.
- You have a restraining order.

499
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:14,895
- I don't care.
- You think they'd let you see her?

500
00:39:15,915 --> 00:39:18,385
Cha Seong Jae's family planned this whole thing.

501
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:19,965
I don't care. I need to bring her back.

502
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:21,905
You can't, I said!

503
00:39:47,295 --> 00:39:49,885
I'll find her for you.

504
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:53,375
Your daughter, Bom.

505
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:57,965
You found my daughter for me, too.

506
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:01,325
So I'll be...

507
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:04,775
finding her this time.

508
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:09,685
Attorney Na.

509
00:40:11,445 --> 00:40:15,705
What do you need to do first if this were your case?

510
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:18,885
You know there's no time for this right now.

511
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:22,295
We need to hurry up and get Bom back.

512
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:34,675
Since they reported with malice, does it count as defamation or something?

513
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:37,205
Reporting won't be enough.

514
00:40:37,205 --> 00:40:39,275
I need to prove that the police's temporary action was unjust.

515
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:41,585
Let's do something, then.

516
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,675
Give me Bom's number.

517
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:50,445
You can't either call or text her now, right?

518
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:54,415
I'll be in touch with her. Give me her number.

519
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:59,705
What do you want me to tell her?

520
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,805
Tell her that Mom will bring her back soon.

521
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,045
That I'm sorry for giving her a hard time.

522
00:41:17,165 --> 00:41:20,785
<i>I'm so sorry I'm giving you a hard time because of what the adults did.</i>

523
00:41:20,785 --> 00:41:23,965
<i>I'll protect you until the end.</i>

524
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,515
<i>No matter what anyone says,</i>

525
00:41:26,515 --> 00:41:28,925
<i>trust me and wait for me.</i>

526
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:32,915
<i>I love you, my daughter.</i>

527
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:36,405
<i>Mom, I miss you.</i>

528
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:46,895
Bom.

529
00:41:49,725 --> 00:41:53,525
Look at this. This is the school abroad I told you about.

530
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:02,915
Go there with Grandma first. I'll join you as soon as I can, okay?

531
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,625
What about Mom?

532
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:11,285
Mom will...

533
00:42:11,285 --> 00:42:12,945
come later.

534
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:17,145
She won't be able to come see you for a while.

535
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:29,785
It's okay. Dad's here.

536
00:42:32,285 --> 00:42:34,475
Don't worry, Bom.

537
00:42:37,705 --> 00:42:39,445
Are you okay?

538
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:43,045
Gosh, I'm dying.

539
00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:45,275
My head is still ringing.

540
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:48,765
Did you have to humiliate yourself out on the streets?

541
00:42:48,765 --> 00:42:51,655
Gosh, don't yell at me.

542
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,695
My head is ringing, I said.

543
00:42:53,695 --> 00:42:56,465
Gosh, seriously.

544
00:43:03,655 --> 00:43:07,075
Why did you have to go there, too, Mom?

545
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:13,205
Hey, you don't know because you didn't see her.

546
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:16,405
You should've seen her eyes... You should've seen them.

547
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:18,555
She totally lost her mind.

548
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:24,355
It's a good thing we brought Bom here.

549
00:43:24,355 --> 00:43:27,325
How could we let Bom be with someone like her?

550
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:31,065
Be quiet. Bom can hear you.

551
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:37,315
Hey, what if she barges in here?

552
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,115
What if she causes a scene again?

553
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:42,525
That's why we placed a restraining order.

554
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:45,105
Everything will be over once you leave with Bom.

555
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:47,195
I'll be joining you soon.

556
00:44:34,375 --> 00:44:36,445
I'll get going now.

557
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:39,395
Seok Goo.

558
00:44:40,615 --> 00:44:42,525
Yes.

559
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:44,135
Tomorrow,

560
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:47,445
clear out this place.

561
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:51,755
Okay, I will.

562
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:58,185
You've got to be kidding me!

563
00:44:59,395 --> 00:45:02,355
Why is everything happening at once?

564
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:05,775
Poor Na Moon Yeong.

565
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:07,565
She lost her job, husband,

566
00:45:07,565 --> 00:45:11,335
she got her child taken, her friend got screwed,

567
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:14,515
and the officer she knows is screwed, too.

568
00:45:14,515 --> 00:45:18,705
Why are you suddenly bringing me up?

569
00:45:18,705 --> 00:45:21,165
You're screwed, too, Lieutenant.

570
00:45:21,165 --> 00:45:24,665
Do you think Moon Yeong is a corrupt attorney

571
00:45:24,665 --> 00:45:27,865
and ruined the Haean Village's development?

572
00:45:27,865 --> 00:45:30,385
Do you think so, too? Do you?

573
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:33,995
I...

574
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:39,935
find it so unfair and feel upset,

575
00:45:39,935 --> 00:45:43,875
but I know it's not Attorney Na's fault, at least.

576
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:48,015
Your 30 years of experience wasn't a waste.

577
00:45:56,815 --> 00:46:02,215
A prosecutor can't sue if they get fired, right?

578
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:04,545
I haven't gotten fired yet, okay?

579
00:46:04,545 --> 00:46:06,655
I can't go down like this.

580
00:46:06,655 --> 00:46:08,905
I won't let them demote me.

581
00:46:11,315 --> 00:46:14,185
The corrupt prosecutors and bastards...

582
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:17,515
I'll destroy all of them.

583
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:19,165
Don't you agree, Detective?

584
00:46:19,165 --> 00:46:22,365
The scammers who took your pocket money.

585
00:46:22,365 --> 00:46:25,095
Shouldn't you catch all of them?

586
00:46:26,165 --> 00:46:29,465
I should. I want to.

587
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:31,985
Why don't you join me, too, then?

588
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:34,965
Doing what?

589
00:46:34,965 --> 00:46:37,175
Catching the bad guys.

590
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:39,665
There are so freaking many,

591
00:46:39,665 --> 00:46:44,325
but should we start with Cha Seong Jae, the most annoying one?

592
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:47,215
How?

593
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:49,915
There isn't enough evidence for murder,

594
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,435
but there's other evidence.

595
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:54,175
Moon Yeong told me...

596
00:46:54,175 --> 00:46:57,005
that there are evidence and witnesses.

597
00:46:57,005 --> 00:46:58,315
Pardon?

598
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:07,325
(Based on the witness testimony...)

599
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,425
(According to the police report...)

600
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:20,365
<i>I'll be there as soon as I'm done with work.</i>

601
00:47:20,365 --> 00:47:22,805
Listen to what Grandma says and...

602
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:27,055
the UK, where you're going, and Switzerland, where I'm going, are very close. You know, right?

603
00:47:28,195 --> 00:47:29,685
Yes.

604
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:36,865
Okay.

605
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,335
I'll join you soon.

606
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:48,585
Wait for me just a few days.

607
00:47:48,585 --> 00:47:50,675
I'll join you as soon as I'm done.

608
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:52,335
Be careful.

609
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:55,685
(Garin Air)

610
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:14,895
Grandma, I want to use the restroom.

611
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,065
Okay.

612
00:48:16,885 --> 00:48:19,855
Let's go when we go up there.

613
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:26,065
Bom, we're late. Come out now.

614
00:48:28,765 --> 00:48:30,265
Bom.

615
00:48:45,285 --> 00:48:47,295
What's going on?

616
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,405
Bom is at the airport now.

617
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:52,855
Why is she at the airport...

618
00:48:55,055 --> 00:48:56,115
Here.

619
00:48:56,115 --> 00:48:59,055
<i>Mom, I'm getting on the plane now.</i>

620
00:48:59,055 --> 00:49:01,545
<i>You'll come, too, right?</i>

621
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:09,775
<i>The phone is powered off. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep...</i>

622
00:49:13,195 --> 00:49:14,545
Attorney Na, let me drive.

623
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:17,095
- No.
- Give me the key.

624
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:21,225
Please. Hurry. Hurry.

625
00:49:37,595 --> 00:49:39,215
Bom!

626
00:49:40,595 --> 00:49:41,995
Bom!

627
00:49:42,915 --> 00:49:44,425
Bom?

628
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:55,675
- What are you doing? You can't go in.
- Just one moment.

629
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:58,625
- Just one moment. My daughter's in there.
- You need a ticket.

630
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:04,265
What do I do?

631
00:50:04,265 --> 00:50:06,435
What do I do?

632
00:50:07,975 --> 00:50:10,005
Bom...

633
00:50:13,215 --> 00:50:16,105
What do I do?

634
00:50:24,515 --> 00:50:26,405
Yes, got it.

635
00:50:28,705 --> 00:50:31,875
I wondered why they brought up child abuse. This was what they were planning.

636
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,475
They were trying to run away with her.

637
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:37,035
Shanghai, you said?

638
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,045
Where Bom went to.

639
00:50:39,045 --> 00:50:42,045
I'm sure the final destination is somewhere else.

640
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:44,195
We need to figure that out.

641
00:50:48,405 --> 00:50:50,505
I just got this from Bom.

642
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:54,055
Maybe it's this place.

643
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:56,275
(Roujant School)

644
00:50:56,275 --> 00:50:58,005
Gosh.

645
00:50:58,005 --> 00:51:00,175
Cha Bom, that cutie.

646
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:03,585
Whom does she take after that she's so smart?

647
00:51:03,585 --> 00:51:05,735
Of course, she takes after me.

648
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,785
Yes, of course.

649
00:51:11,105 --> 00:51:13,675
She only resembles you.

650
00:51:15,495 --> 00:51:17,465
Thank you, Jin Woo.

651
00:51:17,465 --> 00:51:19,425
Thank you so much.

652
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:21,455
Will you go find her immediately, then?

653
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:24,045
Of course. Let's book a flight first-

654
00:51:24,045 --> 00:51:25,865
No.

655
00:51:25,865 --> 00:51:28,425
Just check if she arrived safely.

656
00:51:28,425 --> 00:51:30,355
I know Park Myeong Hee well.

657
00:51:31,195 --> 00:51:34,055
She cares deeply about her children.

658
00:51:35,035 --> 00:51:37,755
This is actually for the better.

659
00:51:37,755 --> 00:51:41,965
She must've been so upset watching her parents fight constantly.

660
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,845
Moon Yeong...

661
00:51:43,845 --> 00:51:46,055
A week.

662
00:51:46,055 --> 00:51:49,235
I'll take care of everything in a week...

663
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:52,455
and pick up Bom myself.

664
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:56,095
So please check if she's well until then.

665
00:51:56,095 --> 00:51:57,465
Okay.

666
00:51:58,465 --> 00:52:00,285
No.

667
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:02,295
A week is too long.

668
00:52:02,295 --> 00:52:04,165
Let's finish in five days.

669
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:06,025
I'll help, too.

670
00:52:06,025 --> 00:52:07,505
With anything.

671
00:52:09,735 --> 00:52:12,065
A way to get Ha Yeon Joo.

672
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,435
I know how.

673
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:42,305
It's Do Jin Woo.

674
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:44,905
Let him in.

675
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,355
The coffee smells nice.

676
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:01,545
Could you give me a cup, too?

677
00:53:03,655 --> 00:53:06,135
Did we have a reason to meet up?

678
00:53:07,035 --> 00:53:08,635
Of course not.

679
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:11,515
Not that there's a reason,

680
00:53:11,515 --> 00:53:13,815
I wanted to ask you something.

681
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,525
Me?

682
00:53:17,675 --> 00:53:21,845
Yes. You're the only person I can ask about

683
00:53:22,775 --> 00:53:24,915
Chief Ma Gang.

684
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:30,445
I haven't heard that name in a while.

685
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:33,655
I heard he committed suicide.

686
00:53:38,925 --> 00:53:42,965
But he was a very obsessive bastard.

687
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:47,475
There's no way he would've killed himself.

688
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:51,905
Why did you kill Ma Gang?

689
00:53:54,335 --> 00:53:57,305
It's true he deserved to die.

690
00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:00,995
How did you kill him?

691
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:02,735
Crazy bastard.

692
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:07,265
Get out of here if you'll spew bullshit.

693
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:12,365
Get him out, Seok Goo.

694
00:54:41,725 --> 00:54:43,585
What did Na Moon Yeong...

695
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:47,465
lure you with?

696
00:54:55,755 --> 00:54:56,985
<i>What did you say?</i>

697
00:54:56,985 --> 00:54:59,055
Cancel the nomination?

698
00:54:59,055 --> 00:55:01,935
Gosh, Chairman.

699
00:55:01,935 --> 00:55:04,805
Hello? Hello?

700
00:55:04,805 --> 00:55:06,585
What the hell...

701
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:10,965
Advisor Choi, you need to see this.

702
00:55:14,585 --> 00:55:17,785
(Chawoong Foundation's employee prosecuted for making backdoor dealings with Geumshin)

703
00:55:22,845 --> 00:55:24,525
Advisor Choi.

704
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:28,295
Was it not just a rumor?

705
00:55:46,895 --> 00:55:48,535
Excuse me.

706
00:55:56,845 --> 00:55:58,245
Look who's here.

707
00:55:58,245 --> 00:56:00,795
It's Attorney Cha Seong Jae.

708
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:04,585
You must be going on a trip.

709
00:56:04,585 --> 00:56:07,155
Whose name are you using this time?

710
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:08,785
It can't be Hwang Tae Soo.

711
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,285
- Detective.
- Yes?

712
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:13,785
A police officer has no right to interfere with an innocent citizen from-

713
00:56:13,785 --> 00:56:17,465
Who says you're an innocent citizen?

714
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,395
What are you doing here, Prosecutor?

715
00:56:24,395 --> 00:56:26,645
Mr. Cha Seong Jae.

716
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:30,335
Around 21:00, May 18, you met Do Jin Woo in Haean Village.

717
00:56:30,335 --> 00:56:34,995
You lied that you were bringing Hwang Tae Soo to the hospital and put him in your car.

718
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:37,915
Mr. Hwang wasn't in the condition to fight back.

719
00:56:37,915 --> 00:56:40,305
Mr. Do testified all about it.

720
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:43,885
You were filmed around 19:00 the next day, too.

721
00:56:43,885 --> 00:56:49,625
You looked very scary, punching Mr. Hwang in the face.

722
00:56:49,625 --> 00:56:51,995
What are you trying to do right now?

723
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:53,275
What do you think?

724
00:56:53,275 --> 00:56:55,725
It means I indicted you.

725
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:58,825
For imprisoning and assaulting Hwang Tae Soo.

726
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:02,875
You thought avoiding a murder charge was enough?

727
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:08,725
(Arraignment)

728
00:57:09,565 --> 00:57:11,115
I said we shouldn't have caught him.

729
00:57:11,175 --> 00:57:16,175
Like in a movie, I wanted to catch him in the crowd during the departure screening.

730
00:57:23,355 --> 00:57:24,985
Come in.

731
00:57:43,145 --> 00:57:46,255
Sorry, I'm late, CEO Choi.

732
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:47,995
Quite a bit.

733
00:57:52,205 --> 00:57:56,935
I hope you have the answer I'm hoping to hear.
