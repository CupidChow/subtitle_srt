Bom!

10
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:20,251
Mom, what's wrong?

11
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,671
- Mom.
- Be careful. Be careful.

12
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,491
Hey, you'll cut your hand.

13
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:28,721
Well...

14
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:32,771
Bom has had difficulty digesting at night lately.

15
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,951
Sorry, I must've scared you.

16
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:39,771
I-I think we should go home.

17
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:43,361
You decided to stay here for a while.

18
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:47,581
Well, Bom needs to go to school tomorrow, too.

19
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:51,691
- Bom, get your stuff right now.
- I don't want to.

20
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,621
It's dangerous at home, Moon Yeong.

21
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,001
Yes, Moon Yeong.

22
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,601
You should just rest here tonight.

23
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:01,331
But still...

24
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,991
I can take care of Bom.

25
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,691
- If you really have to go, go without her-
- No!

26
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,311
I'll sleep with Bom.

27
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,601
You know, my dad-

28
00:02:56,601 --> 00:02:58,331
What's wrong?

29
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,561
It's nothing. It's my duty to keep it a secret.

30
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:06,051
What are you talking about?

31
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:08,621
Do you want to go get ice cream after school?

32
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,491
Yes, sounds good.

My mom is coming. Sorry.

37
00:03:25,321 --> 00:03:29,121
Cha Bom, you're kind of weird today.

38
00:03:57,361 --> 00:03:59,731
Why did you send a video like this?

39
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:03,151
Your husband killed someone.

40
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:06,041
Yet you're more curious as to why I sent it?

41
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:12,581
You sent me this because you're not interested in reporting it to the police.

42
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,431
You want to threaten me again with this?

43
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,781
You must be nervous.

44
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:39,721
If you're worried about this so much...

45
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:07,961
Do whatever you want with the one you have.

00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:09,471
What are you trying to do right now?

47
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:13,141
It means I won't be using that anymore.

48
00:05:13,141 --> 00:05:17,921
You're the only one who has that video now.

49
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,311
Don't try to be clever.

50
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:23,821
You are the ones who are trying to be clever.

51
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:29,181
Your husband killed someone.

52
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:32,091
And only you have the evidence for it.

53
00:05:34,191 --> 00:05:39,091
I'm curious...

54
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:44,221
what kind of decision you'll make.

Do you know Wolverine?

59
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:22,091
He's from a movie.

60
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,671
His blades pop out whenever he gets angry

61
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:28,591
and he cuts everyone with them. He's a mutant.

62
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:32,171
Yes, I know him.

63
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:38,451
When Na Moon Yeong was a prosecutor, her nickname was Wolverine.

64

(Haejeon Police Station)

67
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,381
I saw you yesterday.

68
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:09,771
You were with Cha Seong Jae.

69
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:16,461
I'll tell the detective what I actually saw and heard now.

70
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:22,521
Cha Seong Jae, who was supposed to be dead, is with you now

71
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:28,461
and the one who shot me was Cha Seong Jae, disguised as Hwang Tae Soo.

72
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,841
So...

73
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:37,431
would you like to tell him yourself, or should I?

74

75
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:48,971
That's where your daughter was left.

76

It was in 2016, right?

77
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,451
When her mother left her.

78
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:02,731
(Video Analysis Report)
Is this why you insisted your husband didn't commit suicide?

79
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,091
Because he wasn't actually dead?

80
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:09,241
If a dead man is alive, it means an alive man has died.

81
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:14,011
Who's the one who got cremated and turned into ash?

82
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:17,161
It's the police's job to identify bodies.

83
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:22,551
You're the one who refused to investigate my husband's death.

84
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:26,741
So, that means you knew he was alive, right?

85
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:29,981
I couldn't believe he died, to be exact.

86
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:32,921

Mr. Do.

89
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:50,891
This is Hwang Tae Soo you desperately begged me to find.

90
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:52,711
Okay? Look.

91
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:54,581
Is it this man?

92
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,871
I don't know.

93
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,011
I just need to find the one who shot me.

94
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:07,251
I get that she could play ignorant to protect her husband.

95
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:09,341
But why is Do Jin Woo doing this?

96
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,361
Am I the weirdo here? Huh?

97
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:20,861
You think the police are a pile of crap.

00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,771
Excuse me, Mr. Do and Ms. Na.

99
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:29,261
I witnessed the car accident at the seashore cliff,

100
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:31,781
recovering of the body, the site inspection,

101
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:34,501
victim's belongings collection, DNA comparison with a toothbrush,

102
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,731
and the funeral that happened at the speed of light and everything.

103
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:44,091
And all of that was apparently fake, according to this document.

<i>Ms. Park is looking for Bom everywhere. Why didn't you answer your phone?</i>

113
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:38,761
I picked up Bom.

114
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:42,731
I sent you an email, Ms. Go. Please check.

115

117
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:48,651
Okay.

118
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:52,651

He's a good dad to you.

Yes.

123
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:06,741
But I don't think he's a good husband to me.

124
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,641
Why? Did he do something wrong?

125
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:18,381
What should I do?

126
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:27,501
Just tell him not to do it anymore if he made a mistake.

127
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,031
What?

128
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,821

You're the only one I can trust in Haejeon.

The people I've known aren't who I thought they were.

164
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:09,121
And I can't let Bom stay with Mother, either.

165
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:11,611
It's awful to just think about it.

166
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:14,681
What did Seong Jae say he'll do? Turn himself in?

167
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:17,271
He asked me to wait.

168

But I'm not sure.

169
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,001
It's only a matter of time that he's arrested.

170
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:26,001
He must know better. He's a lawyer, too.

171

You won't just let this slide, right?

172

Are you worried about Bom?

173
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:39,061

175
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:42,451
So I'll do it myself.

176
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:45,981
I'm the only one who could fix everything.

177
00:14:45,981 --> 00:14:48,931
Whether he gets reported or turns himself in.

178
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,751
You already planned everything, didn't you?

179
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:01,671
The police also know Seong Jae is alive.

00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:03,971
He needs to turn himself in first.

181
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,751
Turn himself in?

182
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,441
Honey.

183
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:13,601
How will we handle the shame?

184
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,671
First, we should-

185
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:27,681
Moon Yeong, where are you going?

186
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,641
Moon Yeong.

187
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:46,521
I called him.

188
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,661
What is this...

189
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:54,721
They're already investigating the shooting of Mr. Do, which involves Seong Jae.

190
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,371
- So, we should talk-
 - Don't listen to Jin Woo.

191
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,191
Be quiet.

192
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:03,231
What do you mean, a shooting?

193
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:20,371
You mean Seong Jae shot you or something?

194
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:21,751
Yes.

195
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:28,861
How do we know if Seong Jae inflicted that wound or not?

196
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,271
You know what kind of life Jin Woo lived.

197
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:37,201
See? I told you. They won't listen.

198
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:39,201
Do Jin Woo.

199
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,941
Hey, where's my daughter?

200
00:16:42,941 --> 00:16:46,761
You lied when you said you'd find my daughter, didn't you?

201
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:49,671
Yes. Why would I look for your daughter?

202
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:53,621
It's better than being with a murderer father, no matter where she is.

203
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,381
Why would I look for your daughter?

204
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,841
Apologize to Mr. Do.

205
00:16:57,841 --> 00:16:59,741
You did the wrong thing.

206
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,801
Who's apologizing to whom?

207
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:06,281
He killed someone when he was 19.

208
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:10,341
Yes, you're right.

209
00:17:10,341 --> 00:17:12,911
But I don't know what to tell you.

210
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:14,721
Cha Seong Jae is just like me now.

211
00:17:14,721 --> 00:17:16,261
Hey, you crazy bastard.

212
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:17,711
Am I wrong?

213
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:22,281
Both you and I are fathers who killed someone. We're murderers.

214
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:26,921
You killed Tae Soo.

215
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,601
How dare you call him a murderer without evidence?

216
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,461
There is!

217
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,771
That's you and Mother.

218
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,391
Right?

219
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:05,051
Did you take this video?

220
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,591
Huh?

221
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:12,301
I asked if you took this.

222
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:16,731
Did you take this, you bastard?

223
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:24,591
- Crazy bastard.
 - Ha Yeon Joo did!

224
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,701
Ha Yeon Joo is the one who sent me this video.

225
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,881
She kidnapped, threatened, and sent this video, too.

226
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,361
She's holding us by our throats.

227
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:47,141
You mean that woman took this video?

228
00:18:47,141 --> 00:18:48,901
I don't know who took it.

229
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:52,161
So, he needs to turn himself in before things get worse.

230
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:58,461
Murder of Hwang Tae Soo, allowing the culprit to escape,

231
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:02,741
and attempting to murder Mr. Do, too.

232
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:13,681
Is that true?

233
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,721
You piece of trash.

234
00:19:18,711 --> 00:19:20,351
Honey!

235
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,171
I told you to just play ignorant.

236
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:30,661
I wanted to stay as a dead man, Moon Yeong.

237
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:34,841
You...

238
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:39,471
Seong...

239
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:45,041
Cha Seong Jae!

240
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:12,011
It's dangerous.

241
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,661
Calm down, Attorney Na.

242
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:16,041
What can you do by chasing him right now?

243
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,361
Do you want to die?

244
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:48,891
So, she swung her knife in that direction.

245
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:51,511
She sure is a butcher.

246
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:02,841
You sent that video, huh?

247
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,101
Did you?

248
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:13,771
Yeon Joo.

249
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:16,381
I'm sorry you had to see such an ugly scene.

250
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:19,491
What's the date today?

251
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:31,131
Did I make this mess?

252
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:43,591
No.

253
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:49,851
I made a mistake while cooking.

254
00:23:02,941 --> 00:23:05,741
I'm sorry, Yeon Joo.

255
00:23:05,741 --> 00:23:07,611
I'm sorry.

256
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,991
Have some.

257
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:41,321
You're looking for your daughter so desperately.

258
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:46,031
So, how did you end up...

259
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:48,261
Killing someone?

260
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:53,281
I was trying to protect someone.

261
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:07,131
- What's with this?
- Where are the cigarettes?

262
00:24:07,131 --> 00:24:09,201
I mean...

263
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:12,911
since when did you get food for us?

264
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:16,331
Just keep doing what you've been doing. Is that hard?

265
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:18,861
Aren't you going to answer? Answer.

266
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,301
I'll eat this if you don't want it.

267
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:27,141
What are you doing?

268
00:24:28,221 --> 00:24:29,841
Are you crazy?

269
00:24:29,841 --> 00:24:31,641
You bastard.

270
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:36,011
Hey, what are you doing? Go back inside!

271
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,771
You're lucky today.

272
00:24:44,371 --> 00:24:47,881
I was hungry. This is great.

273
00:24:51,381 --> 00:24:53,071
Those jerks.

274
00:24:54,221 --> 00:24:55,781
Are you okay?

275
00:24:57,301 --> 00:25:00,301
Hyung, I told you to wash your clothes.

276
00:25:00,301 --> 00:25:01,911
Gosh, you got dirty.

277
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:05,811
Don't get involved in stuff like this. You'll get hurt.

278
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:10,781
Your girlfriend.

279
00:25:13,351 --> 00:25:18,221
Oh, yes. I'll get going, Hyung. See you later.

280
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:27,791
Hey, don't get involved in stuff like this.

281
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:30,891
Well, it's because I like Hyung.

282
00:25:30,891 --> 00:25:34,901
Okay, okay. Let's get something tasty after school, then.

283
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,271
What are we getting?

284
00:25:36,271 --> 00:25:38,531
Well, tteokbokki?

285
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:41,741
- I like it.
- Not bad, right? Tteokbokki?

286
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:50,561
I heard you and your boyfriend are really tight.

287
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:54,441
Why can't I have fun, too? Huh?

288
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:56,191
Hurry. This way.

289
00:25:58,131 --> 00:25:59,671
- Here.
- Hey!

290
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,321
Son of a bitch!

291
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:06,651
Shit, are you okay? Are you okay?

292
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:08,041
<i>My life was already ruined. I didn't think I'd care when I died.</i>

293
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:10,971
Jin Woo.

294
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:21,901
Have some.

295
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:23,471
Take it.

296
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:33,151
Here...

297
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:41,451
Hye Rin had a baby when you were in prison.

298
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:08,741
I owed my life to Tae Soo and...

299
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:11,641
Cha Seong Jae, who promised to find my daughter

300
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:15,741
was my hope.

301
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,471
What will you do now?

302
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:26,901
I should take responsibility.

303
00:28:26,901 --> 00:28:29,641
I'll make my husband pay for what he did.

304
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:34,401
I'll keep the promise he made to you.

305
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:39,301
I don't know anymore.

306
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:43,281
As Cha Seong Jae said,

307
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,971
it's probably better for this child not to...

308
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,791
get involved with someone like me.

309
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:52,671
I'm not sure.

310
00:28:54,591 --> 00:28:56,921
I still needed him.

311
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:01,641
Even if my dad killed someone,

312
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:07,131
I still wanted him by my side.

313
00:29:13,311 --> 00:29:14,781
Let's go.

314
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:17,691
Thank you for this.

315
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,441
Where are you going?

316
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:22,071
I need to catch Cha Seong Jae.

317
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:24,091
How will you catch him? I said it's dangerous.

318
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:26,521
He wouldn't kill me, would he?

319
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,921
Seong Jae, that bastard. He should be regretting his actions right now.

320
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:33,381
Where did he go off to?

321
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:35,721
Doesn't he care about his parents now?

322
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:38,261
That's enough.

323
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:42,031
Do you have something to say after what you did?

324
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:46,791
Mother and son worked together and dared to deceive me completely?

325
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:49,801
You were determined to ruin this family.

326
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:52,001
That piece of trash.

327
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,271
Don't badmouth my son.

328
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:58,321
He came back from the dead, and you call him trash?

329
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:03,241
Are you serious right now?

330
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:06,261
Your son wants to die because of money.

331
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:08,661
We need to save him first.

332
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:10,921
Any parents would do the same.

333
00:30:10,921 --> 00:30:13,811
You need to trust him. He's our son.

334
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:16,201
Who's the one who put us in this mess?

335
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:19,061
How could I possibly trust him now?

336
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,841
That bastard.

337
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:24,621
Keep your mouth shut and stay quiet.

338
00:30:24,621 --> 00:30:26,871
Both of you and Seong Jae.

339
00:30:45,811 --> 00:30:49,521
I'll take care of it, Father. Let's talk at home.

340
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:51,001
Okay.

341
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:21,021
License, please.

342
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:50,121
You get a ticket if you park here. Move the car right now.

343
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:51,351
You get a ticket if you park here. Move the car right now.

344
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:53,391
Thank you.

345
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,841
(Hwang Tae Soo)

346
00:32:08,841 --> 00:32:10,921
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>

347
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:14,421
<i>Cha Seong Jae has been preparing to change his identity for a long time.</i>

348
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:19,961
It started with him asking Tae Soo to get paperwork for him, saying he was busy.

349
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:21,711
Tae Soo...

350
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:25,221
used Cha Seong Jae's ID,

351
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:29,181
but no one noticed it wasn't him.

352
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:33,011
Why haven't you reported him?

353
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:35,501
Of course, I did.

354
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:37,721
They just didn't listen to me.

355
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,741
You know they rarely...

356
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,901
believe people like me.

357
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:50,981
At least he wouldn't lie.

358
00:32:50,981 --> 00:32:53,001
But he used to work with Cha Seong Jae.

359
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:56,361
Sounds like he'd been doing their dirty work, too.

360
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:07,331
I only told you what I saw and heard.

361
00:33:07,331 --> 00:33:12,961
It's up to you two to decide whether to believe me or not.

362
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:14,151
I'm sorry.

363
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:17,381
It's okay. It's not like this is the first time.

364
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:23,781
Fine.

365
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:27,671
Let's tell each other what we saw and heard. It's my turn.

366
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:32,081
Cha Seong Jae was involved in Director Joo's project when he worked for Geumshin's legal team.

367
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:33,501
Right, it's Ha Yeon Joo.

368
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:37,201
The first subcontractor for the project was Ma Gang's company.

369
00:33:37,201 --> 00:33:39,361
He must've been a puppet owner.

370
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:43,221
Ha Yeon Joo already knew Ma Gang was dead.

371
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:47,091
Partnerships often fall apart over a large sum of money.

372
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:50,341
If what Mr. Do heard from Ma Gang was true,

373
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:53,771
it means the Haean Village development went awry somehow.

374
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:58,021
If it goes wrong, the entire Haejeon City could flip upside down.

375
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:01,601
Fine. Let's lock Cha Seong Jae up first

376
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:04,871
and go after all the people involved.

377
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:07,171
What should we do with Cha Seong Jae?

378
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:14,741
Yes, got it.

379
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:16,771
Thank you in advance.

380
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:41,851
Where's Mom?

381
00:34:41,851 --> 00:34:43,841
She'll be here soon.

382
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:46,901
I have to do my homework.

383
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:49,531
Can I go to Grandpa's and come back?

384
00:34:49,531 --> 00:34:51,521
No, you can't.

385
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:53,351
Why?

386
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:55,101
Don't you like hanging out with me?

387
00:34:55,101 --> 00:34:56,601
I mean...

388
00:34:56,601 --> 00:34:59,181
I need to get supplies for my class tomorrow, too.

389
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:00,861
It'd only take a moment.

390
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:04,001
You can't even for a moment.

391
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,291
Why not? I want to become a lawyer, too.

392
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:08,831
Why not? I want to become a lawyer, too.

393
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:12,011
I need to do homework to do that.

394
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:16,541
But to do homework, I need to go home.

395
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:22,611
If you have what it takes, skipping homework once won't hinder you.

396
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:26,541
If you're too uptight, you won't make it even if you were meant to.

397
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:31,331
Let's watch TV until Mom comes back.

398
00:35:32,441 --> 00:35:34,651
Okay. What should we watch?

399
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:36,591
What do you like?

400
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:39,361
<i>- Usually...</i>
- What do you like?

401
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:43,311
Aunt, what number is the kids' channel?

402
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:45,101
<i>The typical function is...</i>

403
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,851
A kid would know.

404
00:35:46,851 --> 00:35:49,351
I'm an adult.

405
00:35:49,351 --> 00:35:50,821
<i>Oh, so the blood is...</i>

406
00:36:02,501 --> 00:36:04,251
How many times did I tell you?

407
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:07,871
I was out of my mind trying to protect you and Bom.

408
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:12,571
Ha Yeon Joo is scary. You'd better quit if you want to avoid getting hurt.

409
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:14,171
Are you blaming others now?

410
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,931
She kidnaps and kills like it's nothing.

411
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:18,701
Do you know how awful it was for me?

412
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:22,201
So, how awful do you think it was for me?

413
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:26,721
If you get tricked by someone like her, I have nothing more to say.

414
00:36:26,721 --> 00:36:29,901
So, are you saying you'll disappear again?

415
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:32,381
You want to live as Hwang Tae Soo forever?

416
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:37,261
That's the only way to protect Bom, Moon Yeong.

417
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,881
Why don't you see that?

418
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:41,871
No. You need to come back.

419
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:44,621
As Bom's father, Cha Seong Jae.

420
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,051
What are you talking about?

421
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:47,901
Mr. Cha Seong Jae.

422
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:52,071
Hello.

423
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,541
Running away won't fix anything.

424
00:36:57,541 --> 00:37:00,111
Will you not see Bom for the rest of your life?

425
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:03,601
Let's go quietly before Mother and Father find out.

426
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,011
Hey, what are you doing?

427
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:09,431
- What's wrong with you?
- What's going on?

428
00:37:12,171 --> 00:37:15,441
Open the gate. Or just come out.

429
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,301
No.

430
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:20,821
Run away, Seong Jae.

431
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,551
Open it.

432
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:24,601
No. Hurry up and run away.

433
00:37:24,601 --> 00:37:26,761
Stop causing a commotion and open it.

434
00:37:26,761 --> 00:37:29,971
I said run away. Run away.

435
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:35,851
- No, Moon Yeong.
- Please.

436
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:54,981
<i>When I bring my husband outside the house,</i>

437
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,811
take him with you, then.

438
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:58,801
<i>I beg you.</i>

439
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:04,001
You're under arrest for the murder, disposal, and abandonment of the body of Hwang Tae Soo.

440
00:38:04,001 --> 00:38:05,801
- You can't do this, ma'am.
- No. No.

441
00:38:05,801 --> 00:38:08,051
Hold on.

442
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:09,681
You can't do this, ma'am.

443
00:38:09,681 --> 00:38:12,191
Do you have to put handcuffs on him?

444
00:38:12,191 --> 00:38:15,391
- It's highly likely that he'd run.
- Moon Yeong.

445
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,631
Can these people do this?

446
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:19,111
Moon Yeong, did you report him?
You must be out of your mind-

447
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:20,831
Moon Yeong, did you report him?
You must be out of your mind-

448
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:22,301
-That's enough.
-No.

449
00:38:22,301 --> 00:38:23,781
Take him away.

450
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:25,731
- No.
- Father.

451
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:29,091
- Honey.
- I told you to stop!

452
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:36,261
Mr. Cha, you have the right to an attorney and remain silent.

453
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,441
Mother.

454
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:02,801
Yes, someone needs an urgent care.

455
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,401
This is 21 Ilshin-ro and...

456
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:09,491
Stop making a fuss.

457
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:11,371
She's breathing again.

458
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:13,671
Give me that, Father. She needs to go to the hospital.

459
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:15,791
Is this what you wanted?

460
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:19,891
Did you submit the video to the police, too?

461
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:24,091
Don't you see how humiliating it is? How dare you give that to them?

462
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:27,621
Yes, it is humiliating.

463
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:31,321
But I wanted him to remain as Bom's dad.

464
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:35,721
So, I couldn't bring myself to give them this.

465
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:39,761
I'm so humiliated that I feel nauseated.

466
00:39:58,541 --> 00:40:03,281
She didn't submit the video?

467
00:40:04,951 --> 00:40:07,481
She left a hole to escape.

468
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:11,901
What's the point of acting just and upright?

469
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,791
She's cowardly when it counts.

470
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:29,421
Chairman,

471
00:40:30,091 --> 00:40:33,891
there has been a major change to the plan.

472
00:40:33,891 --> 00:40:37,001
I'll switch to Plan B and proceed.

473
00:40:46,971 --> 00:40:50,181
Make me cookies, Yeon Joo.

474
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,881
I'm hungry.

475
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:00,141
Dear Chairman.

476
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:04,851
He went off to la-la land again.

477
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:08,271
When will he come back?

478
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:21,351
It's his eldest son.

479
00:41:22,251 --> 00:41:25,131
Looks like he can take the medicine later.

480
00:41:34,381 --> 00:41:36,501
Yes, CEO.

481
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:40,131
I'm so sorry.

482
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:43,621
Chairman fell asleep just now.

483
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:49,851
A son wants to talk to his father. How could that be a bother-

484
00:41:54,521 --> 00:41:56,941
(The Eldest)
<i>Hey, Director Joo!</i>

485
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,751
(Chairman Cha Woong)

486
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:12,081
<i>My son was arrested.</i>

487
00:42:12,081 --> 00:42:13,871
I know.

488
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:17,921
Why did you send a video like that?

489
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:23,451
<i>I did send a video, but I'm not the one who reported him.</i>

490
00:42:23,451 --> 00:42:27,691
<i>It was your impressive former prosecutor daughter-in-law.</i>

491
00:42:29,251 --> 00:42:31,611
At the time, you clearly said...

492
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:34,711
You're leaving me with no choice.

493
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:40,061
I didn't do this just because you gave me your word, Sunbaenim.

494
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:49,311
Why don't you say something?

495
00:43:05,431 --> 00:43:07,011
Don't worry.

496
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:10,061
We'll never dare to...

497
00:43:10,751 --> 00:43:13,151
mess with your son.

498
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,691
<i>I'm saying </i>

499
00:43:17,281 --> 00:43:21,221
<i> the future mayor should manage his son. </i>

500
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:23,661
<i>Understand?</i>

501
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:25,341
Director.

502
00:43:28,131 --> 00:43:30,131
Please help me.

503
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:40,421
I bought this dining table with my hard-earned money working as a prosecutor.

504
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:45,571
Are you a good girl or a bad girl for doodling on it?

505
00:43:45,571 --> 00:43:48,591
Aunt, don't be yoochi*.
(Means "childish.")

506
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:54,701
Yoochi. "Yoo" as in young, and "Chi" as in young.

507
00:43:54,701 --> 00:43:58,521
Which means "very young."

508
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:00,031
You are young.

509
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:02,551
It's right to treat you childishly.

510
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:08,241
You little.

511
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,661
- Mom!
- Mom is here.

512
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:16,741
- Bom.
- Did you wait long?

513
00:44:16,741 --> 00:44:18,351
Yes.

514
00:44:19,421 --> 00:44:22,691
So, did everything go well?

515
00:44:24,291 --> 00:44:26,741
Mom, let's go home right now.

516
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:28,411
Dad...

517
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:32,091
Dad isn't home, Bom.

518
00:44:32,091 --> 00:44:33,921
Why?

519
00:44:36,971 --> 00:44:39,601
It's okay. Aunt knows, too.

520
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:45,541
Why is he gone again?

521
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:47,331
He'll be back soon.

522
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:51,401
He went somewhere briefly. He can come back.

523
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:07,721
(Haejeon Police Station)

524
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:11,381
I know you're mad at me.

525
00:45:11,381 --> 00:45:14,101
But if we don't end things like this,

526
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:18,141
You, me, Bom,

527
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:21,481
and your parents will get dragged around forever.

528
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,381
And we'll get sacrificed, too.

529
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:30,101
So, are you spewing nonsense that you betrayed me with Do Jin Woo for my benefit right now?

530
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:34,291
Why are you bringing up Do Jin Woo now?

531
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:37,511
Yes.

532
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:40,181
I want to believe you.

533
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:44,391
So, stop saying you want to live as Hwang Tae Soo

534
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,711
and pay for your sins first.

535
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:52,941
That way, we can be free from Ha Yeon Joo and our misery, too.

536
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:04,071
Let us remain as blameless parents in front of Bom.

537
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:05,891
"Us"?

538
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:08,361
Did you say "us" just now?

539
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:15,041
Listen to me carefully.

540
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:17,481
I gave you many chances.

541
00:46:17,481 --> 00:46:19,941
You're the one who betrayed me.

542
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:22,851
- Chances?
- Yes.

543
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:26,671
The chance to live well with Bom with the money I left.

544
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:29,011
The chance to take charge of Chawoong Law Firm.

545
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:30,481
You squandered all those chances

546
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:35,311
because of your silly sense of duty.

547
00:46:37,941 --> 00:46:39,931
Everything is over now.

548
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:43,341
So you'd better get out of my face now.

549
00:46:45,861 --> 00:46:51,051
<i>No, thank you.</i> 
 CEO Cha isn't here now. I'm sorry. I'll hang up.

550
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:58,041
Yes, this is Chawoong Law Firm.

551
00:46:58,041 --> 00:47:01,371
No, it's not true.

552
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:03,791
What a disaster.

553
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,141
Yes, this is Chawoong Law Firm.

554
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:10,211
Yes, Reporter Shim.

555
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:15,341
You mean the late CEO Cha is actually alive

556
00:47:15,341 --> 00:47:17,821
and he got arrested for murder?

557
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:20,671
Did you go day drinking? Did you?

558
00:47:21,531 --> 00:47:23,821
What is it, then? We don't know.

559
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:26,451
It's not true. I'll hang up.

560
00:47:32,751 --> 00:47:35,691
Shouldn't you let me go?

561
00:47:40,171 --> 00:47:42,461
The body in the vehicle.

562
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:44,201
Whose was it?

563
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:47,791
It was Hwang Tae Soo's, right?

564
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:52,481
There are records of you using his bank account and phone, too.

565
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:53,951
Right?

566
00:47:57,391 --> 00:48:00,721
The time Mr. Cha died is...

567
00:48:00,721 --> 00:48:07,361
The time Mr. Hwang died is presumed to be May 19, 2023, between 20:00 and 23:00.

568
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:10,441
I'll use my right to remain silent.

569
00:48:10,441 --> 00:48:12,621
Will you not testify?

570
00:48:16,111 --> 00:48:20,511
Even if you did, we can easily issue an arrest warrant.

571
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:24,401
You know, because you're a lawyer, right?

572
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:30,171
Okay, go ahead and resist.

573
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:40,551
Mr. Cha's attorney is here.

574
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:44,181
Attorney Na left earlier.

575
00:48:44,181 --> 00:48:46,421
It's a man.

576
00:48:46,421 --> 00:48:48,231
Chairman Cha Woong?

577
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:51,771
Who is it, then?

578
00:48:51,771 --> 00:48:53,731
I wouldn't know.

579
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,771
- CEO!
- CEO Na!

580
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:06,901
Please say something, CEO Na!

581
00:49:06,901 --> 00:49:09,541
A comment, please!

582
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:12,411
Yes.

583
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:19,111
It's possible for me to represent him now,

584
00:49:19,111 --> 00:49:22,951
(Confession)
but someone else might need to take over in the middle of the trial.

585
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,461
Yes.

586
00:49:26,461 --> 00:49:29,491
Don't forget the previous case I mentioned.

587
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,481
Yes. Thank you.

588
00:49:39,901 --> 00:49:44,601
CEO Na, the foundation employee you asked me to look up...

589
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,161
(Im Ye Ji)

590
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:49,241
(Im Ye Ji)
The girl who was sent by Taeil Community Church, then

591
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:51,321
was sent to Chamsarang Orphanage.

592
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:54,521
Looks like she got adopted after that. I don't know what happened afterward.

593
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:57,311
I'll look into it. Thank you.

594
00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:59,121
By the way,

595
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:03,851
is it true about CEO Cha?

596
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:18,491
Ms. Go. In Gyu.

597
00:50:20,301 --> 00:50:23,691
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

598
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,161
What?

599
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:29,551
You mean... Is it true?

600
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:35,191
Yes, Detective.

601
00:50:35,191 --> 00:50:37,621
<i>How could you screw me over like this?</i>

602
00:50:37,621 --> 00:50:40,321
<i>I'm disappointed, Attorney Na.</i>

603
00:50:40,321 --> 00:50:42,811
What are you talking about?

604
00:50:42,811 --> 00:50:45,171
<i>We found Cha Seong Jae's alibi.</i>

605
00:50:46,091 --> 00:50:48,381
His lawyer came.

606
00:50:48,381 --> 00:50:51,691
No, not Chairman Cha Woong.

607
00:50:51,691 --> 00:50:55,151
Yes, his lawyer came.

608
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:59,091
There's evidence that he was somewhere else when Hwang Tae Soo died

609
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:03,631
<i>and there's a witness who saw Ma Gang pushing the car off the cliff then.</i>

610
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:13,771
Attorney Cha was in the vacation home the whole evening.

611
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:19,021
I remember clearly because I dropped him off.

612
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:24,231
Why did he go to the vacation home at that time?

613
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:26,761
All I did was drop him off there.

614
00:51:26,761 --> 00:51:31,881
My job doesn't include being aware of his personal schedule.

615
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:40,921
Here's dash cam footage from Ma Gang's vehicle.

616
00:51:40,921 --> 00:51:46,481
It shows Ma Gang at the location at the time of the victim's death.

617
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:57,301
<i>You really didn't know?</i>

618
00:51:57,301 --> 00:51:59,501
Why don't you look into it further, then?

619
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:06,961
Cha Seong Jae.

620
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:10,401
You're egging me on.

621
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,091
Thank you so much. I dodged incarceration, thanks to you.

622
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:28,721
Don't mention it.

623
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:31,661
Things will be difficult before the trial. Be ready for it.

624
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:34,071
Yes, I'll have to cope with it.

625
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:37,411
I'm so embarrassed that you saw me like this.

626
00:52:37,411 --> 00:52:40,581
I wasn't myself because of Ma Gang's threats then.

627
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:42,931
He threatened your family, too.

628
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:45,381
Anyone would've made the same mistake.

629
00:52:45,381 --> 00:52:46,911
Cheer up.

630
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:52,241
Going through this made me realize who's truly on my side.

631
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:12,291
I'll be out for a second.

632
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,871
C-CEO Na.

633
00:53:19,791 --> 00:53:21,421
Attorney Na.

634
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:25,961
What happened? I heard Cha Seong Jae got released.

635
00:53:25,961 --> 00:53:27,461
The thing is...

636
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:34,111
I think Ha Yeon Joo sent me the video after creating an alibi for Seong Jae.

637
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:37,241
Pardon? What alibi?

638
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:39,291
I know.

639
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:43,591
We'll have to find out why Ha Yeon Joo is doing this.

640
00:53:46,071 --> 00:53:48,601
I found your daughter.

641
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,941
I barely managed to keep that promise.

642
00:53:54,551 --> 00:53:58,301
Cha Seong Jae never looked.

643
00:53:58,301 --> 00:54:00,281
It wasn't that he couldn't find her.

644
00:54:04,671 --> 00:54:06,341
I'll get going now.

645
00:54:13,371 --> 00:54:15,731
(Im Ye Ji)

646
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:20,291
Did you have a nice outing?

647
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:19,481
<i>They were putting on a show on purpose from the beginning.</i>

648
00:57:22,951 --> 00:57:25,401
(Im Ye Ji)

649
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:28,601
<i>Hey, Cha Seong Jae, that bastard...</i>

650
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:32,351
has no interest in his wife and daughter right now.

651
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:35,821
After they got together, they live together in Haejeon now.

652
00:57:35,821 --> 00:57:37,611
Right next door, even.

653
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:45,611
<i>Right under his prosecutor wife's nose.</i>

654
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,691
What?

655
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:45,861
Cha Seong Jae.

656
00:59:09,751 --> 00:59:18,431
♫ <i>You can't stop me</i> ♫
