00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,390
(Lee Min Jae)

00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,020
(Park Ji Il / Nam Gi Ae / Kim Sang Ho / Kim Gook Hee)

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,130
(Hide)

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,490
(Episode 2)

6
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:33,060
(Hide)

7
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,030
Hey. KCSI, where's your team leader?

8
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,620
Moon Yeong.

9
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,430
Seong Jae!

10
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,260
No! No!

11
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,680
Ms. Go.

12
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,090
Ms. Go.

13
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,720
Ms. Go.

14
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,370
What is it?

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,520
(From Cha Seong Jae)

16
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,420
(To Chawoong Law Firm)

17
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,380
Mr. Cha's DNA found in the toothbrush his mother brought

18
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,640
and the DNA from the body match.

19
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,940
After examining, it's assumed he died within the last 18 hours.

20
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,190
The direct cause of death was a skull fracture.

21
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,880
He died immediately as he fell.

22
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,950
He probably didn't feel pain from the fire.
(Death from the fall, suicide)

23
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,200
You can retrieve the body immediately,

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,720
but it appears we need an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death.

25
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,540
But I'm sure Attorney Na knows all of this.

26
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,080
- To request an autopsy-
- We can't.

27
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,810
We can't.

28
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,250
We...

29
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,840
We cannot damage my son's body much further.

30
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,090
Honey...

31
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,470
don't let them touch Seong Jae's body.

32
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,430
It's our son's body...

33
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,330
- Okay.
- How could we...

34
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,540
We can't do that.

35
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,890
Since we checked the autopsy report,

36
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,640
we prefer not to damage the body further-

37
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,160
No.

38
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,250
I request an autopsy.

39
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,960
I'd like to know the exact cause of death.

40
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,490
It couldn't be suicide. He wouldn't do that.

41
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,390
Moon Yeong, I got a call from Ms. Go.

42
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,010
Seong Jae...

43
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,080
sent a suicide note, apparently.

44
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,780
Please authenticate the suicide note, too.

45
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,090
I asked you for one thing when I reported him missing.

46
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,210
If only you tracked his phone or vehicle,

47
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,540
we could've prevented this.

48
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,970
You can reach that conclusion,

49
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,150
but the police have their principles and procedures, too.

50
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,550
Principles?

51
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,360
We couldn't track a personal device when we hadn't decided to investigate yet.

52
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,510
You said this once.

53
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,530
"There can't be an exception in principle."

54
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,390
Are you insisting this is an exception now?

55
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,700
I'm truly sorry this happened,

56
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,660
but I'd like to tell you there was nothing we could've done.

57
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,450
You did nothing.

58
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,880
If the family agrees to transfer the body,

59
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,780
the case will be concluded as a suicide according to the process.

60
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,740
Do you agree?

61
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,610
No.

62
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,090
It's still possible it was an accident.

63
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,290
Examining the body alone can't determine the body's condition. We need an autopsy-

64
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,520
Shut your mouth.

65
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,540
He's my son.

66
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,910
No one better...

67
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,630
put a blade on my son's body.

68
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,040
He was my husband, too.

69
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,840
I can't let go of Bom's dad like this.

70
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,360
Look at him with your own eyes, then.

71
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,580
See what happened to him.

72
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,240
Imagine how much it must've hurt.

73
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,840
He died so painfully, but you want to kill him twice?

74
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,360
Honey.

75
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,320
If you want to insist on it,

76
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,210
don't avoid it and look at him directly.

77
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,200
Honey, that's enough.

78
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,330
Moon Yeong, come here.

79
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,350
You're Na Moon Yeong, right?

80
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,030
Is this your father?

81
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,120
Na Moon Yeong.

82
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,400
Moon Yeong.

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,140
I thought you were dying, too.

84
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,950
What happened?

85
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,060
What do you mean?

86
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,260
I heard you just passed out.

87
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,140
Do you know how long you've been lying here?

88
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,500
Where did everyone go?

89
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,090
(Cha Seong Jae)

90
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,440
Stop! Stop!

91
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,110
- Stop, I said!
- Hey-

92
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,310
You can't have a funeral without discussing it with his wife!

93
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,520
Moon Yeong, we can't wait any longer-

94
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,450
You can't criminate him. We still don't know what happened!

95
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,830
Stop! Stop, I said!

96
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,970
That's enough.

97
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,900
We're saying goodbye to Seong Jae.

98
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,220
Father.

99
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,290
I can't let go of him like this.

100
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,780
How much pain he must've been in...

101
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,190
until he ended up like this?

102
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,440
Without being able to...

103
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,390
tell his mother or you...

104
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,520
He couldn't say anything at all.

105
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,160
<i>I'm a coward.</i>

106
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,560
<i>I'm trying to run away.</i>

107
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,680
<i>I couldn't keep my promise.</i>

108
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,570
<i>At what point could I have gone back to correct this?</i>

109
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,130
<i>No matter how much I think back,</i>
(Notice of Legal Action)

110
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,860
<i>there was no way to turn things back.</i>

111
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,230
<i>Moon Yeong,</i>

112
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,550
<i>you will be very disappointed.</i>

113
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,350
<i>Although it's cowardly, but please...</i>

114
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:26,100
<i>believe that this was the outcome after doing my best.</i>

115
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,470
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.</i>

116
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,510
<i>I won't ask for your forgiveness.</i>

117
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,630
<i>I'm sure you'll do fine without me.</i>

118
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,790
<i>Because you're Na Moon Yeong.</i>

119
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,070
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise, Moon Yeong.</i>

120
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,230
<i>Please protect Bom.</i>

121
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,410
Mom.

122
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,020
Yes?

123
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,130
Is Dad really dead?

124
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,940
Did he abandon us?

125
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,850
Bom.

126
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,380
your dad would never do such a thing. You know that.

127
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,930
Dad never abandoned you.

128
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,180
He wasn't that kind of a person.

129
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,530
(My loving family)

130
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,620
(Bom)

131
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,820
<i>Bom's tonkatsu is in here.</i>

132
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,990
<i>The side dishes are made without artificial seasoning and less salty.</i>

133
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,810
Bom, this is a very famous lunch box.

134
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,870
You can't even get it delivered. I waited 30 minutes to get it.

135
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,350
Looks good, doesn't it?

136
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,910
Look.

137
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,670
Here.

138
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,080
Have some.

139
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,030
Thank you, Shin Hwa.

140
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,030
Pick up your spoon, too, then.

141
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,930
You need to have the energy to cheer Bom up, too.

142
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,810
Yum, it's tasty. So tasty. So tasty.

143
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,280
It's tasty, Bom. Try some.

144
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,800
Isn't it good?

145
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,900
It's so good.

146
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,040
It's tasty, Bom. Try it.

147
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,520
Isn't it good?

148
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,010
I don't understand.

149
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,920
He was stressed out working for Geumshin, but...

150
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,340
after we moved to Haejeon and started working for Father's law firm,

151
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,590
he looked happier and more relaxed. But why-

152
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,120
Moon Yeong,

153
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,640
I know it's hard to accept, but-

154
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,780
I've seen him over 20 years since I moved to this neighborhood as a kid.

155
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,880
How could I possibly not know him?

156
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,180
They say you can never know what a person is really thinking.

157
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,410
Maybe it was difficult to run the law firm.

158
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,850
Get some rest at home for today and-

159
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,100
I need to go to work.

160
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,220
I'll go to work.

161
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,250
I need to fix everything.

162
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,780
And I'll find out...

163
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,550
what happened to my husband.

164
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,170
CEO Na.

165
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,340
Why are you here already? You should've rested more.

166
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,330
Let's take care of the law firm's debt first.

167
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,410
(Loan payment reminder)

168
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,480
(Notice of Legal Action)

169
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,940
Ms. Kim Yoon Seon's trial has ended.

170
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,420
She apparently died in a car accident.

171
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
The hearing was dismissed.

172
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,400
<i>Traitor. He wants to survive on his own?</i>

173
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,300
<i>He just wants me to die alone, huh?</i>

174
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,670
Guemshin Corporation apparently took care of the accident.

175
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,200
Guemshin?

176
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,750
The people we saw at the court?

177
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,500
Probably.

178
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,720
What's Ms. Kim's address?

179
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,470
<i>I heard it was a simple collision.</i>

180
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,070
<i>There'd be no point in investigating.</i>

181
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,160
Everything is suspicious if you look at it that way.

182
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,760

220

My investigator said he saw him.

334
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,750
The problem is that the firm's debt isn't everything.

Other than the three billion won the firm owed to the bank,

336
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,780
he personally owed 1.9 billion in total to non-banking lenders.

337
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,910
If he had that much debt to financial lenders, he must have private loans.

341
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,940
that the countless loans he took out are yours to pay now.

342
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,440

00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,710
We're all struggling right now.

358
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,180
Get going now.

359
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,330
Okay, Father.

360
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,670
Say bye.

361
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,880
- Take care, Grandpa.
- Okay, bye.

373
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:31,910
But you don't want to tell me why, right?

374

375
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,620
What?

376
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:45,020

No.

386
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,150
What a pathetic fool.

387
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,500
Is this how he tried to make up for it?

388
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,510
How did he run the business, exactly?

389

392
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,050
Father,

393
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,240
I don't think we should...

394
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,400
let go of his death like this.

395
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,500
Are you still talking about that?

396
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,130
Don't you see that he prepared all this before he killed himself?

397
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:20,290
I'm not interested in the insurance payment.

398
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:25,690
I just don't want to dismiss his death as a financial problem.

399
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,120
What else, then?

400
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,890
Something shameful other than money.

401
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:34,940
Something he wasn't supposed to do.

402
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,710
There must've been another reason he did that

403
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:46,580
as your son, my husband, and Bom's father.

404
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,120
You mean he was deeply involved in something bad the Geumshin Corporation was doing?

405
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,230
Something considered criminal?

406
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,420
That's very likely.

408
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,020
it's not always right to pursue the truth.

409

- Father.
- Seong Jae is already dead.

410
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:27,990

Yes, Ms. Ha.

414
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,620
Pardon?

415
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,030
Please make a way!

416
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:48,150
- Doctor.
- Bom.

417
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,500
What happened? Did you get hurt?

418
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,780
She got scared a bit.

419
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,770
But she isn't hurt. Don't worry.

420
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,830
Thank you so much, Ms. Ha.

421
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,610
If something bad happened to her, I would've been-

422
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,360
Not at all. I could've just taken her home.

423
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,540
I made you worry for no reason.

424
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,760
What happened? Did you misread the traffic light?

425
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,800
I told you to check if a car's coming or not, even if the light changed.

426
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,080
Why were you there when you were supposed to be at the academy?

427
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,140
The thing is...

428
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,590
Ms. Na, just a moment.

429
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:32,390
Why don't you talk to me for a second?

430
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,500
She suddenly dashed into the road.

431
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,360
I'm glad I happened to see her and stopped her.

432
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,820
What if you weren't there?

433
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,100
Thank you so much.

434
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,140
I had no idea. I was sure she was at the academy.

435
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,020
I guess she misses her dad a lot.

436
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:08,150
She asked where dad was going and kept talking to herself.

437
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,940
Losing her dad at her age must be such a great shock.

438
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,090
Don't scold her too much.

439
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:53,490
Bom.

440
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,440
I'm sorry I didn't care for you when you were struggling.

441
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,170
It's because I've been struggling, too.

442
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,930
I was afraid to live without Dad, too.

443
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,480
That's why I haven't been caring for you enough.

444
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,910
I won't do that anymore.

445
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,640
I'll stop being afraid and...

446
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,420
cheer up so I can take good care of you.

447
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,090
So please wait just a bit.

448
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,470
I...

449
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,740
saw Dad.

450
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,540
I mean, I think I did.

451
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,810
I wanted to go and check.

452
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:58,380
I was going to check before he disappeared.

453
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,150
I was trying to cross the street quickly. That's why...

454
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,400
Yes, I understand that could happen.

455
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:15,360
I've mistaken someone who looks like Dad as him, too.

456
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,950
It's because you miss him.

457
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,850
I'm like that, too.

458
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,930
I also...

459
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,550
still can't believe that he's gone.

460
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:36,850
But Bom, he did go to heaven.

461
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:44,580
So, even if you see someone who resembles him,

462
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,660
don't do that anymore, okay?

463
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,450
My daughter, you must miss him a lot.

464
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,190
Me, too.

465
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:26,800
What ended up happening to the Haean Village case?

466
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,470
You signed the case closure report yourself.

467
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,070
Might as well go to a sauna if you're bored.

468
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:39,670
When I retire, I need to rent out a resort while living there

469
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,480
and whatchamacallit, live the YOLO lifestyle.

470
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,460
I can't get in trouble now.

471
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,920
I need to work hard.

472
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,130
They haven't even sold the land yet. When will that resort be finished?

473
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,940
Geez. Stop being negative.

474
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,440
Just eat, you bastard.

475
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:57,670
Wake me up if someone calls.

476
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,210
Okay.

477
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:35,470
There's a record of Geumshin Corporation suing Kim Yoon Seon for embezzlement and canceling it.

478
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:38,380
She's been stealing the company's money little by little.

479
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,140
That must be why she admitted to something she didn't do.

480
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,740
And you must've seen Do Jin Woo's criminal records.

481
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,940
Lying for money must be nothing for someone like him.

482
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,920
Yes, let's say you're right about everything. No, you are.

483
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,520
Even so, what could we do?

484
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,190
Don't forget that Cha Seong Jae is one of those bad guys.

485
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,300
It was a lot of debt to handle.

486
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,550
There must've been temptations he couldn't resist.

487
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:15,070
So, you should consider Bom first.

488
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:18,410
She's been hurt enough that her dad committed suicide.

489
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,710
You must know better than anyone.

490
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,640

491
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,480

<i>The suicide note was found, but you're insisting he didn't.</i>

535
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,630
<i>Is it because of the life insurance-</i>

536
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,300
<i>Your husband isn't dead.</i>

537
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,930
<i>I definitely saw him here, okay?</i>

538
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,240
<i>Why would my dead husband come back to life and shoot you?</i>

539
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,360
<i>Don't think you know everything about him.</i>

00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,130
<i>Don't just hear what you want to hear.</i>

541
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,540
<i>They tried to kill you to cover that up?</i>

<i>What's happening around you, Attorney Na?</i>

543
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,480
<i>Cha Seong Jae, that bastard.</i>

544
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,320
<i>He must've done all the illegal things an attorney could commit.</i>

545
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,030
<i>Do you realize that you've been betrayed by him now?</i>

546
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:45,500
<i>You were pretty naive, Attorney Na.</i>

547
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,760
<i>You would've been better off dead.</i>
