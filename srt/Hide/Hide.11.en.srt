(Hide)

00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:19,375
(Episode 11)
A week.

5
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:23,465
I'll take care of everything in a week...

6
00:00:25,065 --> 00:00:26,585
and pick up Bom myself.

7
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:30,185
So, please check if she's well until then.

8
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:31,735
Okay.

9
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:35,395
No.

10
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:37,415
A week is too long.

11
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:39,255
Let's finish in five days.

12
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:41,105
I'll help, too.

13
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:42,695
With anything.

14
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,245
A way to get Ha Yeon Joo.

15
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:50,715
I know how.

16
00:00:53,565 --> 00:00:58,135
Please tell me in detail what happened when Chairman Choi died.

17
00:00:58,135 --> 00:01:00,895
He had a heart attack.

18
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:05,435
<i>I opened the drawer Ha Yeon Joo used to keep medicines in.</i>

19
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:08,835
<i>But it was totally empty that day.</i>

20
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,155
<i>So I went to the car.</i>

21
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:14,985
<i>I had left the first aid kit in the passenger seat.</i>

22
00:01:17,065 --> 00:01:20,015
<i>That medicine wasn't for Chairman Choi.</i>

23
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,485
The medicine Ha Jae Pil was prescribed was mixed in.

24
00:01:22,485 --> 00:01:24,505
No, no.

25
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:30,265
<i>I never went to the hospital since I started using Jae Pil's name.</i>

26
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:34,575
<i>Then, where did you get the medicines in the first aid kit?</i>

27
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:37,435
<i>I got it from Chief Yoon.</i>

28
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:40,445
He brought it to me every time.

29
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,445
Yoon Seok Goo.

30
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,115
You've got to be kidding me.

31
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:58,145
So, your father went to prison knowing this?

32
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:00,245
Are you crazy?

33
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:04,615
Even if we conceal the real culprit,

34
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:07,205
I thought Dad should still pay for his sin.

35
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:10,185
He does have to pay for his sins,

36
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:13,425
but he can't be dragged around forever.

37
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,405
The other party is not interested in stopping.

38
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:18,335
You're right.

39
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:23,065
Let's flip the script now.

40
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:26,645
- You can't go in.
- Just one moment.

41
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,035
- You can't.
- Just one moment.

42
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:30,025
It's okay.

43
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:41,165
Don't you need to receive something from Ha Yeon Joo?

44
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:47,245
Go down and wait.

45
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:56,395
I won't go after you, CEO Choi.

46
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:59,855
Ha Yeon Joo is the one who messed with my kid.

47
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:02,755
Do you know what Director Joo has?

48
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:05,735
I don't. I'm not interested, either.

49
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:09,865
I'll only help you receive.

50
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,935
You'll help?

51
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:17,855
- Under what conditions? 
- Your decision comes first.

52
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:20,755
I already have the answer.

53
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:26,635
You're really bulldozing through.

54
00:03:26,635 --> 00:03:27,915
Yes.

55
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:32,515
I don't care anymore now that my child was stolen in front of me.

56
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:39,105
Fine.

57
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,215
What is it that you want?

58
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:43,315
Let's go after...

59
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,685
Ha Yeon Joo together.

60
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:10,065
<i>We need to find out the hospital where Chief Yoon got the prescription as a proxy.</i>

61
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:20,755
<i>To silence the doctor or for whatever reason, he'll go to the hospital at least once.</i>

62
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,935
.

63
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:33,825
(Geum Jae Hong Clinic)

64
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:36,925
I can't due to the Personal Information Protection Act.

65
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:43,175
You're talking about that after providing a prescription to a proxy?

66
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:45,365
There's a CCTV, too.

67
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:48,385
I can call the police right away, right?

68
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:50,195
Hold on a second.

69
00:05:02,575 --> 00:05:06,315
Why are so many people using Mr. Ha Jae Pil's name?

70
00:05:06,315 --> 00:05:10,555
The medicine you submitted as evidence to prove my father's guilt.

71
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:17,325
(Prescription)
It turns out you got the prescription for it as Ha Jae Pil.

72
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,875
What will happen to the verdict if this is revealed?

73
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:27,725
The doctor who provided the prescription printed this himself.

74
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,695
He knew you very well.

75
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:33,755
Do you want to hear his recording, too?

76
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:39,355
They don't care who gets framed for Chairman Choi's murder at all.

77
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:43,335
It'd be either my father or you in the end.

78
00:05:43,335 --> 00:05:46,685
You and I are in the same boat right now.

79
00:05:46,685 --> 00:05:51,425
Ha Yeon Joo will cut you off immediately, not to mention CEO Choi.

80
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:52,755
Do you think they won't?

81
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:56,035
What if you took charge of the situation instead?

82
00:05:56,035 --> 00:06:00,555
Keep the money Ha Yeon Joo has been keeping to herself.

83
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:03,875
Don't worry.

84
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,265
Ha Yeon Joo will be punished alone.

85
00:06:50,795 --> 00:06:54,125
<i>Take a photo so the location of the safe is clear.</i>

86
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:02,465
.

87
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:07,825
<i>Grab everything that could make her look bad.</i>

88
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:24,405
It can't be...

89
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,445
How did Na Moon Yeong...

90
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:37,285
reel you in?

91
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:44,025
She reeled me in using what she learned from you.

92
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:49,025
I didn't know my time behind bars would come in handy.

93
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:52,815
My connections in the detention center were pretty useful.

94
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,155
Do you know a man named Ma Gang?

95
00:07:56,155 --> 00:08:00,295
Rumor has it that some bastard has been living it up since Ma Gang died.

96
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,605
Jang Geon Cheol.

97
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:05,785
- Jang Geon Cheol?
- Yes.

98
00:08:06,805 --> 00:08:09,035
Do you know Jang Geon Cheol?

99
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,975
After Ma Gang died,

100
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:14,505
Jang Geon Cheol suddenly seemed to have gotten rich.

101
00:08:14,505 --> 00:08:17,135
You know Jang Geon Cheol, right?

102
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,415
You chose the perfect pawn.

103
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,285
He's a crazy bastard.

104
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,405
Mr. Jang Geon Cheol,

105
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:30,665
I heard you've been living in luxury with your detention money.

106
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:32,985
Where did you suddenly get so much money?

107
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:36,055
You couldn't have won the lottery in the detention center.

108
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:39,655
Hey, we've already checked your bank account.

109
00:08:39,655 --> 00:08:42,615
You received money as soon as Ma Gang died.

110
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:45,775
Who was it? Who sent you money?

111
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,785
I don't know.

112
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,865
Hey.

113
00:08:49,865 --> 00:08:53,325
There's also a witness who saw you kill Ma Gang.

114
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,355
You're lying.

115
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:59,015
How do you know if I'm lying?

116
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:05,745
You got a life sentence, anyway. Just tell us.

117
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:10,155
Who was it?

118
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:12,525
Who told you to kill Ma Gang?

119
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:19,265
<i>Prosecutor Joo is tracking who sent Jang Geon Cheol money right now.</i>

120
00:09:19,265 --> 00:09:21,205
Tell her to go ahead.

121
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,915
It has nothing to do with me.

122
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:26,995
I see.

123
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,715
Is that right?

124
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:34,055
Jang Geon Cheol knows Chief Yoon very well, by the way.

125
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:38,075
I heard you visited him, too, right?

126
00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:41,125
Did you?

127
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,385
Did you kill Chief Ma?

128
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:44,765
Why did you do that?

129
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:47,915
You used to work for him at one point.

130
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:57,035
Ask Chief Yoon further questions.

131
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:03,885
Wow...

132
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:06,205
You cut him off immediately.

133
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,045
I knew that was your specialty,

134
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,275
but it won't be so easy this time.

135
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:16,165
Because you'd get hurt if you cut off too much.

136
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:18,045
You'd better watch it.

137
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:45,945
(Haejeon Police Station)
<i>I said it wasn't an abduction.</i>

138
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:50,405
You can't prosecute for assault if the victim objects. But why me?

139
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:53,975
You should argue about that at the Prosecutors' Office.

140
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:57,025
Isn't this a targeted investigation?

141
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:00,945
You must think

142
00:11:00,945 --> 00:11:04,795
Hwang Tae Soo would never report you.

143
00:11:04,795 --> 00:11:06,765
Why is that?

144
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:09,145
Because we reached an agreement.

145
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,865
Why don't you ask him, then?

146
00:11:14,495 --> 00:11:16,415
Unfortunately,

147
00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:20,305
it was a group assault. A group assault.

148
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:26,335
<i>According to the video, you weren't the only one who pushed Mr. Hwang.</i>

149
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,205
You must know since you're a lawyer.

150
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:31,165
You can be prosecuted for group assault without the victim's report.

151
00:11:31,165 --> 00:11:32,505
Right?

152
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:36,845
So, if you take a step out of Haejeon City starting today,

153
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:39,325
I'll assume you fled and get an arrest warrant.

154
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,235
Be careful.

155
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:43,735
You may leave.

156
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:55,205
Sunbaenim, Yoon Seok Goo's first round of material witness investigation is done.

157
00:11:55,205 --> 00:11:59,155
But he was more cooperative than expected.

158
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,285
Let's talk over there.

159
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:15,255
<i>Will he accept the deal?</i>

160
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:20,275
Choi Ho Shik already betrayed once.

161
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:22,215
Don't worry.

162
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:26,035
He isn't the only one who can betray.

163
00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:35,495
Sorry, I'm late, CEO Choi.

164
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:38,345
Yes, you're pretty late.

165
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:47,245
I hope you have the answer I'm hoping to hear.

166
00:12:57,905 --> 00:13:01,165
This is a vacation home where Ha Yeon Joo's safe is.

167
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:04,205
Safe?

168
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:06,755
Is this all you have for me?

169
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:12,305
I didn't think you'd expect me to find out what's inside, too.

170
00:13:12,305 --> 00:13:17,675
It'd be difficult for me to open the safe, but I'm sure it's easy for you.

171
00:13:17,675 --> 00:13:20,755
I thought I should only provide the location.

172
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:23,525
You're quick-witted.

173
00:13:24,565 --> 00:13:26,375
How did you find it?

174
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:32,015
I've been there before. So it wasn't hard.

175
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:33,385
Fine.

176
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:35,955
It's important that you found it.

177
00:13:37,445 --> 00:13:39,575
I'll accept the request.

178
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:43,135
I'll remove Director Joo from your presence completely.

179
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:45,525
That was her wish, too.

180
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,495
She wants to live as if she doesn't exist.

181
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,585
I should grant her wish.

182
00:13:50,585 --> 00:13:52,865
I was suggesting we catch her together.

183
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,835
I didn't ask you to kill her.

184
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,495
I'll take care of Ha Yeon Joo myself.

185
00:13:57,495 --> 00:13:59,495
If she dies like this,

186
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:02,165
I don't think it'd be satisfying enough for me.

187
00:14:02,165 --> 00:14:06,035
I'll get her indicted for either embezzlement or murder.

188
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:08,015
That won't be good.

189
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,785
She knows way too much.

190
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:16,255
A testimony without evidence has no power.

191
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:19,225
So don't worry.

192
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:23,205
I'll understand we have a deal and leave.

193
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:36,875
(Chawoong Welfare Foundation)

194
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:50,725
Get everything down there.

195
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:52,755
Don't leave anything behind.

196
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,595
Advisor Cha.

197
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:57,855
What are you doing? Hurry up!

198
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,205
(Hwang Tae Soo. Hwang Tae Joon - younger brother)

199
00:15:23,025 --> 00:15:25,015
Pack everything up.

200
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:36,955
(Cha Woong)

201
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,615
.

202
00:15:58,205 --> 00:16:02,255
Father has Hwang Tae Soo's DNA?

203
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:08,575
Mr. Hwang had a long-lost little brother.

204
00:16:08,575 --> 00:16:11,445
The foundation accepted requests to find family members.

205
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:15,135
And the foundation had the DNA information registered back then.

206
00:16:15,135 --> 00:16:17,605
We had no idea, either.

207
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:21,415
And Father took it with him?

208
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:26,685
I looked for a digital version of it, but I couldn't find it.

209
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:38,665
Advisor Cha, these are internal documents for ongoing cases.

210
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,335
(MOU for Haean Village Development Cooperation)
<i>The documents the law firm and foundation exchanged.</i>

211
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:44,535
<i>Advisor Cha didn't have all of it.</i>

212
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:52,505
<i>CEO Cha asked me to send all of those documents, too.</i>

213
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:00,435
I didn't know I'd be using them like this.

214
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:07,835
This is all I can do to help.

215
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:09,565
Ms. Go...

216
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:15,115
I've been walking behind Chairman Cha my whole life.

217
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:17,205
How foolish is that?

218
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,665
I didn't realize he would be so shady near the end.

219
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,715
You can fix this, right, Attorney Na?

220
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:38,945
(Confidential)

221
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,655
You knew from the start, didn't you?

222
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,835
That Hwang Tae Soo's death could've been revealed.

223
00:17:56,705 --> 00:17:59,085
Hand me the DNA and...

224
00:17:59,935 --> 00:18:04,365
take care of the Chawoong Foundation quietly yourself.

225
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:06,845
How many times did I tell you?

226
00:18:06,845 --> 00:18:10,075
Not anyone can mess with the foundation.

227
00:18:10,075 --> 00:18:12,465
Should I close it down, then?

228
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:14,325
Moon Yeong.

229
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:23,415
Here's evidence to prove the foundation's corruption.

230
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:29,235
How the corruption in the foundation happened and how often...

231
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:34,315
It was recorded in detail, including the exact dates

232
00:18:34,315 --> 00:18:36,445
by your son.

233
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,705
Should I...

234
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:49,325
give this to you,

235
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:52,155
or to the Prosecutors' Office?

236
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:57,205
Do you even know what you're doing right now?

237
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:59,375
Yes.

238
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,935
So make a decision.

239
00:19:00,935 --> 00:19:03,285
Are you determined to ruin this family?

240
00:19:03,285 --> 00:19:07,405
Your husband wasn't enough that you're after your child, mother-in-law, and me now?

241
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:10,425
You're planning to take the whole family down!

242
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,755
Did you not understand?

243
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:15,645
Cha Seong Jae left this, Father.

244
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:19,955
You've been betrayed by your son, not me.

245
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,375
I'll give it back to you.

246
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:27,745
Instead, give me Hwang Tae Soo's DNA.

247
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:31,255
Are you telling me to sell my family away?

248
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:36,785
Your son sold you away first.

249
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:42,235
Because of him, Mother left both you and the foundation behind.

250
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,945
Is it the Chawoong Foundation you've been building your whole life

251
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:50,045
or your son who killed someone

252
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:53,305
and sold you away?

253
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,885
Make your choice.

254
00:20:06,975 --> 00:20:09,865
<i>It happened so, Director Joo.</i>

255
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,275
You abandoned your son this time.

256
00:20:12,275 --> 00:20:14,585
<i>I had no choice.</i>

257
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:20,485
You gave the evidence of your son's crime to your daughter-in-law, correct?

258
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,355
But why are you telling me that...

259
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,435
<i>Help me, Director.</i>

260
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:27,825
<i>I can no longer see my family getting hurt.</i>

261
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:32,585
Rather, you must not want your reputation to be damaged.

262
00:20:32,585 --> 00:20:34,375
<i>I don't care what you say.</i>

263
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:39,235
<i>I must send my son away even if I have to stow him away.</i>

264
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:42,055
(Seong Jae)
<i>Director Joo.</i>

265
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,815
I'll check and get back to you.

266
00:21:20,265 --> 00:21:22,065
You couldn't leave after all.

267
00:21:22,065 --> 00:21:24,595
I even gave you the power of attorney.

268
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,165
You were so antsy.

269
00:21:28,215 --> 00:21:30,105
What do you want?

270
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:35,685
I never should've met you.

271
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:39,555
I shouldn't have fallen for your tempting words.

272
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:42,405
If I came clean with Na Moon Yeong and

273
00:21:42,405 --> 00:21:45,085
resolved things together, I wouldn't be in this mess.

274
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:48,145
- If only I didn't meet you.
- No.

275
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:51,255
When Na Moon Yeong started looking for you when you supposedly killed yourself,

276
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:54,745
you should've taken care of her like Hwang Tae Soo.

277
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:56,935
Things started going wrong since then.

278
00:21:56,935 --> 00:21:59,445
It's not because you met me.

279
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:02,185
No, no. It's because I met you.

280
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:08,345
You're the one who used me to try to go after Na Moon Yeong.

281
00:22:08,345 --> 00:22:10,145
If only I didn't meet you,

282
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:14,415
I wouldn't have been chased like this or be filmed like that...

283
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,905
Yes, it's all clear now.

284
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:26,665
What ended up getting me wasn't Na Moon Yeong.

285
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:30,265
It was the video you sent her. You know that?

286
00:22:32,295 --> 00:22:34,585
Now, you're getting Chief Yoon investigated.

287
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:37,665
What are you plotting, exactly?

288
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:40,605
You said you don't need money.

289
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:42,095
Were you being hypocritical?

290
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,295
You think you could get that money without me?

291
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:46,105
Only I can take out that money.

292
00:22:46,105 --> 00:22:50,035
No one in this world can take out that money without me.

293
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:56,605
You'd better hurry up.

294
00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:01,555
The DNA test result will come out in a week.

295
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:05,275
What are you talking about?

296
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:10,845
Hwang Tae Soo's DNA ended up in Na Moon Yeong's hands.

297
00:23:10,845 --> 00:23:13,545
It's only a matter of time for it to go to the Prosecutors' Office.

298
00:23:15,405 --> 00:23:18,995
Did you not know, by chance?

299
00:23:21,115 --> 00:23:25,995
The one who gave Hwang Tae Soo's DNA

300
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:29,005
to Na Moon Yeong is...

301
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:33,135
the high and mighty chairman of the Chawoong Foundation.

302
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:41,935
My father did?

303
00:23:41,935 --> 00:23:45,255
No, no, he wouldn't do that.

304
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:48,005
Does that matter right now?

305
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:50,785
Shouldn't you find the DNA first?

306
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:56,315
He wouldn't. No, no way.

307
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:12,365
<i>Open the door!</i>

308
00:24:13,925 --> 00:24:16,185
<i>Na Moon Yeong!</i>

309
00:24:16,185 --> 00:24:18,375
<i>Open the door!</i>

310
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,525
<i>Open the door, I said!</i>

311
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:25,605
<i>Open the door! Open...</i>

312
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:26,895
Where is it?

313
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:29,215
Where's the stuff you got from Father?

314
00:24:40,705 --> 00:24:42,485
Where is it?

315
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,535
Where's the USB drive?

316
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:55,025
The USB...

317
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:57,015
What are you doing?

318
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:00,435
I have to find it. Where is it?

319
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:05,395
Where... Where...

320
00:25:05,395 --> 00:25:07,015
(dialogue)

321
00:25:08,505 --> 00:25:11,675
Stop it! I already gave it to Shin Hwa.

322
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,715
You gave it to whom?

323
00:25:18,715 --> 00:25:21,345
Shin Hwa? Are you crazy?

324
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:24,695
Do you know what that is? Do you want everyone to go down?

325
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:28,755
Did you think you'd only be punished for kidnap and assault?

326
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:36,925
Hey, who do you think you are?

327
00:25:38,385 --> 00:25:42,305
You... Why do you think you're so innocent?

328
00:25:42,305 --> 00:25:46,035
Do you think you'd be okay after you submit it?

329
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:48,755
Of course, it includes what I've done wrong, too.

330
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:52,845
For all the dirty things I did to save you.

331
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:58,445
You're such a saint.

332
00:25:58,445 --> 00:26:00,355
Yes.

333
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:03,735
You're such a saint.

334
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:27,685
<i>Now you're getting Chief Yoon investigated.</i>

335
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,745
<i>What are you plotting, exactly?</i>

336
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:15,565
So, you're saying you'll get Ha Yeon Joo first by using Choi Ho Shik.

337
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,865
Isn't this the only evidence to go after Choi Ho Shik?

338
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,315
You want to let him go?

339
00:28:19,315 --> 00:28:21,235
We can open it...

340
00:28:21,235 --> 00:28:24,285
before Choi Ho Shik does.

341
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,405
What? How will you open it?

342
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:33,565
<i>I can get the key to the house from Yoon Seok Goo.</i>

343
00:28:47,585 --> 00:28:51,485
<i>I'll open the safe myself.</i>

344
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:12,515
<i>Ha Yeon Joo threatened Choi Ho Shik that she'd reveal the evidence of</i>

345
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,875
<i>instigating Chairman's murder</i>

346
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:18,165
<i>and embezzling if something happens to her.</i>

347
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:25,025
<i>There's no way she would've given that to someone else.</i>

348
00:29:26,035 --> 00:29:28,375
<i>Where would it be, then?</i>

349
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:30,815
<i>She probably kept it in the safe.</i>

350
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:39,555
<i>If something happens to her and she can't be there,</i>

351
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:43,575
<i>she let the document get uploaded and revealed automatically.</i>

352
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:49,865
She probably had to prove that she was alive regularly.

353
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:54,625
<i>Which means she has no choice but to open the safe.</i>

354
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:58,325
<i>We can find out the combination then.</i>

355
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:30,795
(Attorney Na Moon Yeong)

356
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:36,695
Yes, Attorney Na.

357
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:38,885
As you said, Ha Yeon Joo...

358
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:41,275
<i>stops by at the same time every day.</i>

359
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,835
<i>She never leaves with anything.</i>

360
00:30:43,835 --> 00:30:46,055
<i>She comes out in five minutes.</i>

361
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:06,025
This is Na Moon Yeong.

362
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:09,715
I prepared what I promised.

363
00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:14,025
The money in the safe belongs to someone else. Don't touch it.

364
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:50,545
What are you two doing here?

365
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:53,585
That's what I want to ask.

366
00:31:53,585 --> 00:31:57,785
Why were you guys here then?

367
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,025
Where is it? Where's my USB drive?

368
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:04,845
Give it to me!

369
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:17,145
Answer your phone.

370
00:32:42,975 --> 00:32:45,525
I think you'd better answer it.

371
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:58,395
Yes, CEO Choi.

372
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,785
<i>I have your things.</i>

373
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:04,165
<i>9:50 tomorrow morning.</i>

374
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:07,155
<i>I have a meeting 10 minutes after. Don't be late.</i>

375
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:23,895
H-Hey...

376
00:33:23,895 --> 00:33:25,745
How could you do this?

377
00:33:25,745 --> 00:33:27,105
What are you doing right now?

378
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:30,665
You're supposed to be a father. How could you do this?

379
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:34,005
How about you?

380
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:38,385
You're my son, but you tried to betray me

381
00:33:38,385 --> 00:33:42,185
documenting the foundation's corruption?

382
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:46,235
So, you want to put me away?

383
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:47,805
You sure are impressive.

384
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:50,255
The foundation comes before your son, huh?

385
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:51,675
I had no choice.

386
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:54,135
But weren't you always this way?

387
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:56,365
The silly reputation and medal.

388
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:59,525
You wanted to keep your reputation no matter what happens to your family.

389
00:33:59,525 --> 00:34:02,525
Even when everyone around you was dying!

390
00:34:02,525 --> 00:34:04,215
Get out.

391
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:06,825
How dare you give that to her? How?

392
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:08,435
What am I supposed to do now?

393
00:34:08,435 --> 00:34:10,305
That's why...

394
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:13,805
I'm telling you to take this and leave!

395
00:34:21,605 --> 00:34:23,565
Escaping on a boat is the only way.
(Le Havre, France - Pyeongtaek Port)

396
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:26,305
I begged Director Joo to get that.

397
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:29,465
DNA testing and registering death will take a week at most.

398
00:34:29,465 --> 00:34:32,745
Escape and take the money out before that.

399
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,165
Hwang Tae Soo is the owner of the account.

400
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:37,895
That money will be gone if you are registered dead.

401
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,215
Gosh, Father.

402
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:44,585
So...

403
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:49,285
you want to cut ties with your son, who's not worth anything. Right?

404
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:53,715
You gave away the DNA sample. So I can't come back, anyway, right?

405
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:55,955
To get you that money, at least,

406
00:34:55,955 --> 00:35:01,775
I begged Director Joo, that cocky woman, to get that.

407
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:04,995
Okay, fine.

408
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,645
You got this from Ha Yeon Joo, right?

409
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:12,475
There's no time to do this. Leave right now!

410
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:13,985
What?
(Le Havre, France - Pyeongtaek Port)

411
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:19,245
Wow, you believe her more than your son.

412
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:22,175
Why is it Pyeongtaek Port, not Haejeon?

413
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:27,205
Father,

414
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:30,215
you forgot I was still being investigated, didn't you?

415
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:33,645
If I took a step out of Haejeon City, I'd be considered a fugitive.

416
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:35,285
This is a trap set by Ha Yeon Joo.

417
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:37,245
Since she's about to get arrested,

418
00:35:37,245 --> 00:35:40,815
she's trying to buy time by getting me incarcerated.

419
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:44,365
Gosh, never mind, Father.

420
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:45,685
I'll figure out how to survive.

421
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,165
Just like how you figured out how to save yourself.

422
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:50,595
Be well. Keep your reputation alive.

423
00:35:50,595 --> 00:35:53,565
Although I'm not sure if you have any left.

424
00:35:59,795 --> 00:36:02,015
Seong Jae, Seong-

425
00:36:12,115 --> 00:36:14,335
(London, England)

426
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:19,625
<i>"That was a year ago." Jack said.</i>

427
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:24,275
<i>"Maybe someone needs help now." He shrugged.</i>

428
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:26,615
<i>Never hurts to try.</i>

429
00:36:26,615 --> 00:36:28,525
<i>Just then, something outside...</i>

430
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:29,855
<i>I was banned from leaving the country.</i>

431
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:32,295
<i>Don't leave the hotel for now.</i>

432
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:40,885
(Son)

433
00:36:47,315 --> 00:36:49,535
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected...</i>

434
00:36:49,535 --> 00:36:51,765
(Husband)

435
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:01,675
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected...</i>

436
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:13,935
(Moon Yeong)

437
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:21,045
Why was Seong Jae banned from traveling?

438
00:37:21,045 --> 00:37:23,405
Was it you again?

439
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:24,855
<i>Mother?</i>

440
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:26,815
Yes, it's me.

441
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:30,105
<i>Are you determined to separate the child from her father now?</i>

442
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:31,945
<i>How long will you do this?</i>

443
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:36,415
Mother, please put Bom on the phone. She's there, right?

444
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:39,275
<i>I'm asking you what happened.</i>

445
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,665
Where's Seong Jae right now?

446
00:37:42,665 --> 00:37:44,875
You know, too.

447
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:47,445
You can no longer avoid it like this.

448
00:37:47,445 --> 00:37:50,265
You know he committed countless crimes.

449
00:37:50,265 --> 00:37:51,725
What?

450
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:55,515
Mother, you love your son, right?

451
00:37:55,515 --> 00:37:57,935
You miss him and want to hear his voice, right?

452
00:37:57,935 --> 00:37:58,995
Me, too.

453
00:37:58,995 --> 00:38:00,455
<i>I miss Bom, too.</i>

454
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:02,785
Do you think I want to do this?

455
00:38:02,785 --> 00:38:04,125
This is why you should've-

456
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,315
<i>Mother,</i>

457
00:38:05,315 --> 00:38:10,345
Bom will remember that you didn't let her talk to me later.

458
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:13,285
<i>You know how smart she is.</i>

459
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:15,685
When did I?

460
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:20,435
Mother, please let me hear her voice once.

461
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,945
Grandma,

462
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:27,595
is it Mom?

463
00:38:28,495 --> 00:38:30,175
<i>It's Mom, right?</i>

464
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,235
Mother.

465
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:34,875
<i>Mother, please let me hear her voice once.</i>

466
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,835
Mom!

467
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:38,865
Bom?

468
00:38:38,865 --> 00:38:40,995
Bom!

469
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,755
Bom, are you okay?

470
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:45,605
Are you eating well? Are you sick or anything?

471
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:47,855
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

472
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:50,165
<i>When are you coming, Mom?</i>

473
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:55,185
I'll pick you up soon.

474
00:38:55,185 --> 00:38:58,935
So until then, be well with Grandma.

475
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:00,795
You're a good girl, right?

476
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:04,545
I listen to everything Grandma says, Mom.

477
00:39:04,545 --> 00:39:05,805
<i>Okay.</i>

478
00:39:05,805 --> 00:39:07,885
I'll pick you up soon.

479
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:09,865
So wait for me.

480
00:39:09,865 --> 00:39:11,445
Soon when?

481
00:39:11,445 --> 00:39:13,325
When will you come, Mom?

482
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:15,785
- Right now, we're-
- No!

483
00:39:16,735 --> 00:39:19,885
Bom. Bom?

484
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:21,305
Bom...

485
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:28,565
I'll be right there, Bom.

486
00:39:38,355 --> 00:39:40,215
How interesting.

487
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:42,725
So, this would've been

488
00:39:42,725 --> 00:39:46,605
sent to the press and the prosecution if you disappeared?

489
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:52,265
Wow. I'm so glad you're alive and well right now.

490
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:53,425
CEO Choi.

491
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:56,075
This is in my possession now.

492
00:39:56,075 --> 00:39:59,305
So tell me.

493
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:01,265
Do you have a plan now?

494
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:07,165
You don't have a plan, but you only have a wish?

495
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:10,875
Was it your wish for me to pretend you don't exist?

496
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:15,305
I'm sorry about everything.

497
00:40:15,305 --> 00:40:18,895
I'll never say anything, even if I get prosecuted.

498
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:20,385
Prosecuted?

499
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,885
You're getting prosecuted? Who says?

500
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:27,035
I suppose that could happen.

501
00:40:27,035 --> 00:40:29,605
My legal team sued you for embezzlement.

502
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:32,355
This is already the second time, right?

503
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:34,175
No, no, no...

504
00:40:34,175 --> 00:40:36,575
I withdrew the lawsuit last time.

505
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:39,875
Because I was being tricked by you.

506
00:40:45,825 --> 00:40:47,505
You can leave now.

507
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:51,655
All I'm willing to do is to let you walk away on your feet.

508
00:40:51,655 --> 00:40:54,035
I'll grant your wish some other time.

509
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:04,725
I heard you killed Chief Ma, too.

510
00:41:05,725 --> 00:41:09,585
There's no safe place in this world.

511
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:12,415
People die in the detention center, too.

512
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:31,215
(Haejeon Police Station - Crime Division)

513
00:41:35,045 --> 00:41:37,815
(From: Haejeon Police Station - Crime Division)

514
00:41:39,775 --> 00:41:41,745
(From: Haejeon Police Station - Crime Division)

515
00:42:08,505 --> 00:42:10,935
Don't worry about Bom.

516
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:14,825
As you said, Park Myeong Hee seems to be devoted to her granddaughter.

517
00:42:14,825 --> 00:42:17,515
This is all because of Ha Yeon Joo, that crazy-

518
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:23,385
We're almost there. Hang in there. Almost there...

519
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:26,385
Can we rush Ha Yeon Joo's arrest?

520
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:29,475
Keeping her in the holding cell would be safer.

521
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:31,195
What? Why?

522
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,655
Are you worried CEO Choi might kill her?

523
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:36,265
Geez, Na Moon Yeong.

524
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:38,305
Why do you care about her safety?

525
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,655
Just let Choi Ho Shik kill her!

526
00:42:40,655 --> 00:42:43,045
Don't you agree, Mr. Do?

527
00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:44,275
You're right.

528
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:46,785
I'd be just like Ha Yeon Joo, then.

529
00:42:46,785 --> 00:42:50,215
- What?
- I can't play ignorant again.

530
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:52,775
Aiding a murder is murder, too.

531
00:42:52,775 --> 00:42:56,075
Of course. We need to prevent the murder. Yes.

532
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,165
No one should die anymore.

533
00:42:58,165 --> 00:43:01,445
I'll end things in court. For both her and me.

534
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,015
So, we can expose Geumshin, too.

535
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:10,585
So, we need to protect Ha Yeon Joo by either arresting or imprisoning her.

536
00:43:11,585 --> 00:43:13,785
I need to go see her.

537
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:17,485
What? For the love of humanity? What are you, Mother Teresa?

538
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,175
Fine. Of course you do.

539
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:28,635
She might be with Cha Seong Jae right now.

540
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:30,495
I'll look into where he is.

541
00:43:30,495 --> 00:43:32,415
Thank you, Mr. Do.

542
00:43:34,765 --> 00:43:35,995
Yes, Detective.

543
00:43:35,995 --> 00:43:38,925
I think we need to summon Ha Yeon Joo sooner.

544
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:40,525
Sorry?

545
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:43,085
She's ignoring the summons?

546
00:43:54,155 --> 00:43:55,575
(Die, corrupt lawyer)

547
00:43:57,935 --> 00:43:59,035
(Die)

548
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:00,775
Do you like them?

549
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:04,775
This is how people treat your daughter.

550
00:44:05,985 --> 00:44:11,185
Na Moon Yeong was a good person before you came along.

551
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:13,575
She fought corruption...

552
00:44:13,575 --> 00:44:17,055
She was praised as "The Wolverine of the Seoul District Prosecutors' Office."

553
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:20,795
The elite in-laws and successful husband.

554
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:23,165
And even a cute daughter.

555
00:44:24,255 --> 00:44:29,645
But now, she got divorced, got her daughter taken away,

556
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:31,335
and she's about to lose the bar license-

557
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:35,345
Got her daughter taken away? To whom?

558
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:37,705
Did you think the great Chawoong Foundation

559
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:41,455
would just let their little girl get called

560
00:44:41,455 --> 00:44:44,235
the murderer's granddaughter?

561
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:46,965
Good thing she has you as a father.

562
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:52,375
You should've heard Na Moon Yeong cry

563
00:44:52,375 --> 00:44:54,955
when they took Bom away.

564
00:44:56,795 --> 00:45:01,465
But it turns out Na Moon Yeong was a good daughter.

565
00:45:03,435 --> 00:45:07,275
She's trying so hard to get you out.

566
00:45:07,275 --> 00:45:09,875
But CEO Choi found out about it.

567
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:13,925
You know CEO Choi's personality, right?

568
00:45:13,925 --> 00:45:18,275
Thanks to you, I don't have to do anything.

569
00:45:18,275 --> 00:45:23,805
No, I'm not interested in getting out.

570
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:28,215
I'll stay here for the rest of my life if I'm told to.

571
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:31,085
So, tell Moon Yeong not to do anything unnecessary.

572
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:33,855
Do you think she'd listen to me?

573
00:45:33,855 --> 00:45:36,845
Tell her yourself if you want.

574
00:45:36,845 --> 00:45:40,105
Oh, and don't be late.

575
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:41,915
It's my fault.

576
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:45,665
It's my fault.

577
00:45:47,455 --> 00:45:51,215
I-It's my fault. It's my fault.

578
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:54,355
It's my fault.

579
00:45:54,355 --> 00:45:57,905
What can I do... What can I do?

580
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:00,925
What can I do?

581
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,955
What can I do...

582
00:46:03,955 --> 00:46:05,955
What can I do?

583
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:18,245
You should've stopped, then.

584
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:24,795
You should've only taken money,

585
00:48:26,305 --> 00:48:28,115
Seok Goo.

586
00:48:41,935 --> 00:48:45,535
<i>What can I do? What can I do?</i>

587
00:48:46,495 --> 00:48:48,635
What can I do?

588
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:54,485
Just keep it simple and die.

589
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:00,825
You should've done that from the beginning.

590
00:49:02,265 --> 00:49:04,595
Instead of my dad...

591
00:49:05,665 --> 00:49:08,165
you should've died instead.

592
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:12,885
Because of you, my life...

593
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:15,185
and Na Moon Yeong's life...

594
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:18,705
were ruined like this.

595
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:13,115
Ha Yeon Joo!

596
00:50:13,115 --> 00:50:14,775
Ha Yeon Joo!

597
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:18,365
Ha Yeon Joo!

598
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:29,225
Hello? Where are you right now?

599
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:30,475
Where?

600
00:50:30,475 --> 00:50:32,205
<i>My vacation home.</i>

601
00:50:33,995 --> 00:50:35,705
<i>You haven't found Ha Yeon Joo, right?</i>

602
00:50:35,705 --> 00:50:38,015
<i>I think you were right.</i>

603
00:50:38,015 --> 00:50:38,925
What do you mean?

604
00:50:38,925 --> 00:50:41,615
<i>Cha Seong Jae is heading to Ha Yeon Joo's vacation home.</i>

605
00:50:41,615 --> 00:50:44,065
<i>Ha Yeon Joo is in danger.</i>

606
00:50:44,065 --> 00:50:46,585
I'll head to her vacation home right now.

607
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:00,925
Ha Yeon Joo.

608
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,825
What's this?

609
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:42,345
You didn't go to Pyeongtaek.

610
00:51:44,155 --> 00:51:46,895
Let's leave for now. There's no time.

611
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,555
Where to?

612
00:51:50,385 --> 00:51:54,285
Can't you assess the situation right now? Huh?

613
00:51:55,435 --> 00:51:57,955
You want to get arrested for murder, too?

614
00:51:58,985 --> 00:52:01,635
You and I committed so many crimes-

615
00:52:01,635 --> 00:52:04,245
If you get caught now, you'll be behind bars forever.

616
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:06,135
Let's leave now.

617
00:52:07,615 --> 00:52:09,305
Leave alone if you want to.

618
00:52:09,305 --> 00:52:12,725
Hwang Tae Soo's account is under both of our names.

619
00:52:12,725 --> 00:52:16,165
If one of us gets caught, the account gets locked. Don't you know?

620
00:52:16,165 --> 00:52:18,515
As expected of Cha Seong Jae.

621
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:21,215
Yes, I am. And there's no time to do this.

622
00:52:21,215 --> 00:52:23,995
Leave the country, take out what we need, come back,

623
00:52:23,995 --> 00:52:26,305
and kill Na Moon Yeong or whatever.

624
00:52:26,305 --> 00:52:28,205
Get dressed now.

625
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:35,685
Looks like you knew there was no boat waiting for you at Pyeongtaek Port.

626
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:39,745
Go to Haejeon Port. I found something for us there.

627
00:52:39,745 --> 00:52:42,335
I've known you long enough.

628
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,785
<i>Attorney Na?</i>

629
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,995
<i>Attorney Na!</i>

630
00:54:08,655 --> 00:54:10,435
You fool.

631
00:54:10,435 --> 00:54:13,415
Why chase the culprit? It's dangerous. It's the police's job.

632
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:14,915
We need to keep Ha Yeon Joo alive.

633
00:54:14,915 --> 00:54:17,345
Cha Seong Jae must be chasing her right now.

634
00:54:17,345 --> 00:54:20,605
They are together. They were caught on the CCTV here.

635
00:54:20,605 --> 00:54:24,075
<i>Attorney Na, the culprit who killed Yoon Seok Goo...</i>

636
00:54:24,075 --> 00:54:25,885
was Ha Yeon Joo. Ha Yeon Joo.

637
00:54:25,885 --> 00:54:27,515
The blood splattered everywhere.

638
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:29,785
<i>Cha Seong Jae didn't change his clothes when he left,</i>

639
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:32,455
<i>but Ha Yeon Joo did.</i>

640
00:54:33,455 --> 00:54:35,215
Cha Seong Jae is near the Haejeon Port right now.

641
00:54:35,215 --> 00:54:37,645
Detective Baek, it's the Haejeon Port.

642
00:54:37,645 --> 00:54:39,045
Please hurry up.

643
00:54:39,045 --> 00:54:40,325
<i>Haejeon Port?</i>

644
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:41,935
Okay.

645
00:54:41,935 --> 00:54:43,665
Pil Seung.

646
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:45,585
- Pil Seung!
- Yes.

647
00:54:45,585 --> 00:54:47,325
- Haejeon Port. Haejeon Port.
- Haejeon Port?

648
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,065
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.
- Everyone except for the inspectors

649
00:54:50,065 --> 00:54:52,035
are going to the Haejeon Port.

650
00:55:06,555 --> 00:55:08,835
(Geumshin Corporation)

651
00:55:13,925 --> 00:55:17,305
(Geumshin Corporation)

652
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,465
<i>I'll take care of Director Joo.</i>

653
00:55:22,465 --> 00:55:25,525
You're not interested in keeping her alive, anyway.

654
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:29,335
And if she spoke, many people would get hurt.

655
00:55:29,335 --> 00:55:31,685
You probably don't want to get rid of her in the country.

656
00:55:31,685 --> 00:55:34,585
Just find me a space on the Geumshim Corporation ship.

657
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:36,715
I'll be on it with Ha Yeon Joo.

658
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:39,945
I'll make sure no one can find her.

659
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:41,785
Even if they do, they won't draw a connection to you.

660
00:55:41,785 --> 00:55:44,815
I'll take care of things perfectly and leave.

661
00:55:44,815 --> 00:55:46,895
So...

662
00:55:46,895 --> 00:55:49,975
where will you go after getting rid of her?

663
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:51,625
Switzerland?

664
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:55,475
On your way to take my 80 billion won, you want a ride on my ship, too?

665
00:55:56,475 --> 00:56:00,205
Attorney Cha, I didn't know, but...

666
00:56:00,205 --> 00:56:01,945
you're thick-skinned.

667
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:05,425
That money can't be retrieved without me, anyway.

668
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:11,005
Okay. Let's talk about the travel cost, then.

669
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:14,545
The cost to get to Shanghai. And to get a flight to Switzerland from there,

670
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:17,605
it'd cost about... Gosh, it'd be...

671
00:56:18,665 --> 00:56:20,935
about 70 billion won.

672
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:25,835
Are you telling me to take 10 billion and get lost?

673
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:27,905
Are you okay with keeping Ha Yeon Joo alive?

674
00:56:27,905 --> 00:56:31,555
Tons of losers can kill a woman in this country.

675
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:37,625
But isn't your life over if you can't leave this time?

676
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,965
I thought I gave you a good deal.

677
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,875
Can I trust you?

678
00:56:46,065 --> 00:56:48,335
Why would you trust me?

679
00:56:48,335 --> 00:56:52,375
Your life depends on the money only you can take out.

680
00:56:57,365 --> 00:56:59,225
All right.

681
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,145
<i>I loaded everything.</i>

682
00:57:27,265 --> 00:57:29,215
Attorney Na, turn right here.

683
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:40,305
Please help me just once.

684
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:05,375

00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:13,185
