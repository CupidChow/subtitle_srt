(Hide)

00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,265
(Previously on Hide)
<i>Why isn't CEO Cha coming to work?</i>

5
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:22,245
<i>-See you later.</i>
<i></i><i>-He should be meeting the witness at the court.</i>

6
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:24,925
<i>He won't pick up the phone, either. Where is he?</i>

7
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:29,085
<i>Tell me. What did you make my husband do, exactly?</i>

8
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,225
<i>Go ahead and find out.</i>

9
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:33,845
<i>Once you start digging the dirt on the noble Attorney Cha Seong Jae,</i>

10
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:37,765
<i>you'll want to break his neck with your own hands.</i>

11
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,315
<i>Seong Jae considered filing bankruptcy for his firm.</i>

12
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:45,335
<i>You want to know who? Your husband.</i>

13
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,265
<i>Cha Seong Jae.</i>

14
00:00:46,265 --> 00:00:48,365
<i>You suborned perjury, switched victims,</i>

15
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,665
<i>laundered money, and even disposed of a corpse.</i>

16
00:00:50,665 --> 00:00:51,935
<i>Did you kill Hwang Tae Soo?</i>

17
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:54,525
<i>How could I kill someone, Moon Yeong?</i>

18
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,595
<i>Ms. Na Moon Yeong,</i>

19
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:03,135
<i>how does it feel to be the murderer's wife?</i>

20
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:04,845
<i>Cha Seong Jae, that bastard...</i>

21
00:01:04,845 --> 00:01:08,455
<i>He's lost it and has no interest in his wife and daughter right now.</i>

22
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:11,855
<i>After they got together, they live together in Haejeon now.</i>

23
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,105
<i>Right next door, even.</i>

24
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:15,315
<i>Was it fun playing me?</i>

25
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:17,895
<i>It must've been very fun.</i>

26
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:23,935
<i>She lived next door, and you pretended to be kidnapped.</i>

27
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:25,735
<i>That was very funny of you two.</i>

28
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:28,095
<i>Cha Seong Jae must have an ulterior motive.</i>

29
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:30,455
<i>It's time to take your medicine.</i>

30
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,225
<i>When the bank approves the loan,</i>

31
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,045
<i>the entire amount will be deposited into Geumshin Corporation's business account</i>

32
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:38,015
<i>and transfer the money to the account belonging to the paper company</i>

33
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,385
<i>purchased under Hwang Tae Soo's name.</i>

34
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:43,035
<i>We'll go to Zurich, take out the 80 billion, and we're done.</i>

35
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:47,685
<i>He said he couldn't reach his eldest son yesterday.</i>

36
00:01:47,685 --> 00:01:51,735
<i>Choi Woo Shik? Will you not do anything about Ha Yeon Joo?</i>

37
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:53,545
<i>You can't leave the country as Hwang Tae Soo.</i>

38
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:54,995
<i>You were banned from leaving the country.</i>

39
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:59,115
<i>So, if we arrest Hwang Tae Soo, we'll end up with Cha Seong Jae.</i>

40
00:01:59,115 --> 00:02:01,205
<i>Hwang Tae Soo's passport with Cha Seong Jae's photo on it.</i>

41
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,035
<i>Is there more conclusive evidence than that?</i>

42
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,825
<i>Cha Seong Jae!</i>

43
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,605
<i>Director Ha Yeon Joo.</i>

44
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:24,265
(Episode 8)

45
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:57,965
Cha Seong Jae, you bastard!

46
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:10,755
Hey!

47
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,445
Cha Seong Jae!

48
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,165
Cha Seong Jae is here!

49
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,515
You're done for now.

50
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:21,085
Mr. Hwang Tae Soo.

51
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:25,085
Who?

52
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,965
I mean, Mr. Cha Seong Jae.

53
00:04:28,965 --> 00:04:34,925
We knew you were trying to leave the country as Mr. Hwang Tae Soo.

54
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:40,225
I don't know what you're talking about...

55
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:43,865
I came all this way, chasing after Hwang Tae Soo, too.

56
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,295
So, did you find Hwang Tae Soo?

57
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:17,205
Looks like you lost him, too.

58
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,755
Let's go to Yooshin-dong.

59
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,035
Pretty good.

60
00:06:29,385 --> 00:06:31,815
(Haejeon Police Station)

61
00:06:34,035 --> 00:06:36,105
Let me ask again.

62
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:39,765
As soon as the project fund was deposited, it was transferred to another business account.

63
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,965
You know about this company, right?

64
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:46,045
The CEO's name is Hwang Tae Soo.

65
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,235
I'll use my right to remain silent.

66
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:53,865
You'll be blamed for everything by doing that.

67
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,925
I just need to catch the higher-up.

68
00:06:59,925 --> 00:07:04,875
I'm not interested in going after an abandoned card like you.

69
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:10,985
That's why you, a prosecutor, came to the police station yourself.

70
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:20,785
You're not such a loyal servant to sacrifice her life

71
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:24,065
for the company, are you?

72
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:33,465
A search and seizure in the country town of Haejeon? I finally got to warm up a bit.

73
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:36,675
No matter how she resists to testify, there's no issue prosecuting her.

74
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,775
You still got it, Moon Yeong.

75
00:07:38,775 --> 00:07:40,435
No.

76
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:43,635
Ha Yeon Joo still has the final blow left.

77
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:45,815
It's me.

78
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:48,105
What do you mean?

79
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:50,485
Cha Seong Jae was kidnapped.

80
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:53,955
Although I'm sure he pretended to be.

81
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:59,115
<i>Bribing a witness.</i>

82
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:01,355
<i>Lobbying a politician.</i>

83
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,585
<i>Pick it up.</i>

84
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:05,185
<i>Tampering with Lee Bang Cheol's trial.</i>

85
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,145
<i>I did all that to save Seong Jae.</i>

86
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:09,605
<i>I'm sure there is evidence, too.</i>

87
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,775
They made you do all the work Cha Seong Jae

88
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:15,905
used to do as a broker?

89
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,465
It's true I did those things.

90
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,045
I'll write a confession in advance.

91
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:23,345
You're kidding, right?

92
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:27,445
No. If Ha Yeon Joo tries to make an issue out of me,

93
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,485
just arrest me, too.

94
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:31,155
I'm turning myself in

95
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:35,505
so you can push forward using any possible means.

96
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,595
You'd be done as a lawyer, too, then.

97
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:42,805
It'd be ridiculous to continue to work as a lawyer.

98
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,185
Why is Ha Yeon Joo doing this to you?

99
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,635
Were you sworn enemies in your previous lives?

100
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:09,265
What a meticulous bastard.

101
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,485
Was there anything in the suitcase?

102
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:17,045
We found his fingerprints,

103
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:20,165
but that can't be evidence for identity theft, apparently.

104
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,765
How come...

105
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:37,565
How did you know Mr. Hwang was going to Tianjin?

106
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:41,705
I want to find Hwang Tae Soo more than anyone.

107
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:44,605
A ticket to Tianjin was purchased under his name,

108
00:09:44,605 --> 00:09:48,445
and all I did was go to Haejeon Port to follow him.

109
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:53,575
How did you know he purchased a ticket then?

110
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:59,155
I don't know how he registered his identity, but his emails are being sent to our foundation.

111
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:01,665
I ended up opening his email.

112
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:06,805
You know Ms. Ha Yeon Joo, right?

113
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:09,645
Yes. She's my next-door neighbor.

114
00:10:09,645 --> 00:10:12,495
I ate a lot of cookies she baked.

115
00:10:13,335 --> 00:10:15,575
Cookies?

116
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:18,805
You might not be able to eat those cookies anymore.

117
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:21,295
She's in the adjacent room.

118
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:25,105
You know why she's here, right?

119
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:31,375
I'll continue testifying when my attorney arrives.

120
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,235
Okay, then.

121
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,185
Chairman...

122
00:10:48,185 --> 00:10:51,405
CEO Choi ordered us to escort him to Seoul safely.

123
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,815
Chairman Choi is leaving now.

124
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:03,145
Thank you, Mr. Do.

125
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:08,095
.

126
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,165
Father.

127
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:19,695
You should leave if you're here because of Seong Jae.

128
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:22,655
You don't need to worry about him.

129
00:11:22,655 --> 00:11:25,565
I came because I was hired as a lawyer.

130
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,595
Considering the embezzlement amount, you'll get the maximum sentence for it.

131
00:11:48,595 --> 00:11:54,045
Telling you to lessen the sentence by confessing the accomplice

132
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:56,635
or hidden money would be...

133
00:11:56,635 --> 00:12:01,015
the only advice I can give you as your attorney.

134
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:09,415
You couldn't have hired me as your lawyer to hear stuff like this.

135
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:12,655
You know Cha Seong Jae is being interrogated in the adjacent room, right?

136
00:12:14,105 --> 00:12:18,035
I'm curious why you came all the way here

137
00:12:18,035 --> 00:12:20,545
instead of refusing to take the case.

138
00:12:20,545 --> 00:12:23,715
You must think you have something on me.

139
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:26,925
But it won't work. I'll turn myself in...

140
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:30,335
regarding all the dirty work you made me do.

141
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,185
Restoring justice.

142
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:37,915
Sounds nice.

143
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:42,555
What do you want from me, exactly?

144
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,555
Restoring justice.

145
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:48,885
Quit beating around the bush. Tell it to me straight.

146
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:54,165
You believe you have to pay for it if someone committed wrongdoing.

147
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:59,235
Since you've

148
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,705
wronged me,

149
00:13:04,245 --> 00:13:06,305
I will...

150
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,135
punish you.

151
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:23,735
Faking suicide wasn't enough that you tried to flee abroad?

152
00:13:23,735 --> 00:13:26,305
How much dumber will you get?

153
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:32,095
You should've cleaned up after yourself, whether you cheated or whatever.

154
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:35,565
Our relationship isn't that serious.

155
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,355
How much does Moon Yeong know?

156
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:42,455
Why are you here if you're so afraid of rumors?

157
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:49,645
You wanted to take 80 billion? You did all this by only relying on Director Joo?

158
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:53,525
How many times did I say you can't trust her?

159
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,325
I suppose it runs in the family.

160
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:04,255
Believing Director Joo and causing trouble. You thought I didn't know?

161
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:09,485
You agreed to ruin Haean Village in place of Geumshin to take campaign money from them.

162
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,775
You ended up wasting all the money on Haean Village

163
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:17,705
and both the law firm and foundation are about to go down.

164
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:27,225
You might as well turn yourself in.

165
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:31,445
Say Director Joo and Ma Gang blackmailed you to do this.

166
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:34,305
You want me to take the blame for everything?

167
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,955
It's already too late, Father.

168
00:14:39,695 --> 00:14:41,985
You think they'd let you get out of it at this point?

169
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,885
Who? Choi Ho Shik? Senile Choi Moo Won?

170
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:49,655
You need to wake up. The Haean Village development project was already ruined.

171
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:54,535
You want to become a politician? You're the one who was played by Ha Yeon Joo.

172
00:14:58,035 --> 00:15:01,275
So I need to get that money back.

173
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:07,375
Is that why you pulled this off by making even your mom come to the Haejeon Port?

174
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:14,815
That 80 billion... is for cleaning up after Geumshin. It's mine.

175
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:23,515
.

176
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,655
Hold on.

177
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:47,185
Ms. Ha.

178
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:49,985
You may go home for now.

179
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:52,665
Get home safely, Mr. Cha.

180
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:23,455
What happened?

181
00:16:23,455 --> 00:16:25,915
CEO Choi Ho Shik withdrew the lawsuit.

182
00:16:25,915 --> 00:16:28,665
Ha Yeon Joo's embezzlement has been voided.

183
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,475
Cha Seong Jae was freed again due to a lack of evidence of committing identity theft.

184
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:35,955
Withdrawing the lawsuit can't halt the investigation, though.

185
00:16:36,835 --> 00:16:40,935
The owner of the money says he wasn't robbed. It's practically over.

186
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,545
Geez.

187
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,755
What is he trying to do?

188
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,465
(Do Jin Woo)

189
00:16:57,455 --> 00:16:59,385
What kind of law is this?

190
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,255
They let go of the culprit because there's no evidence?

191
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:07,485
Attorney Na, is this how rich people are?

192
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,885
How could he let go of someone who tried to steal his money so easily?

193
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,775
I know.

194
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,635
They're usually more touchy about money and betrayal.

195
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,015
I think we underestimated CEO Choi.

196
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:20,895
But thankfully,

197
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:25,125
Seong Jae and Ha Yeon Joo seem to have split.

198
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,545
Attorney Na...

199
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,855
you do want to catch Cha Seong Jae, right?

200
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:33,565
You don't still think of him as your husband and Bom's dad-

201
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,475
No.

202
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:39,565
Don't give up, then.

203
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:41,775
It's not over yet.

204
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:47,315
Cha Seong Jae chose money over family.

205
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:51,775
I'm sure he'll attempt to flee abroad again.

206
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:54,235
We need to seek a solution.

207
00:17:54,235 --> 00:17:56,955
You should do it your way.

208
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:59,885
I'll continue in my old way.

209
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,985
Old way?

210
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:05,105
We can't do anything illegal.

211
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:07,435
You'd be the only one facing danger.

212
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:11,235
Will you fail legally again?

213
00:18:11,235 --> 00:18:15,635
The law keeps freeing the culprit.

214
00:18:16,635 --> 00:18:20,665
Don't worry. I won't fail twice.

215
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:42,345
Why did you touch the account?

216
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:46,725
I just borrowed the name to avoid a delivery mishap.

217
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,305
You know it's all yours, after all.

218
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:55,295
You're the one who pointed a knife at your family

219
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,265
after listening to a stranger.

220
00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,615
You were too hasty.

221
00:19:03,655 --> 00:19:05,685
Family?

222
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:07,285
Who?

223
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,525
Us?

224
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:20,195
Looks like you're very mistaken, Director Joo.

225
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:28,935
You're someone who does things I tell you to do.

226
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:31,005
Don't cross the line.

227
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:37,915
The only thing I allowed was my father.

228
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:43,295
I said he'd just be an old man with poor judgment who had an affair with a young employee.

229
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:46,415
I didn't tell you to touch his wallet.

230
00:20:02,145 --> 00:20:05,345
Pick up what you dropped and eat it.

231
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:08,985
That suits your place.

232
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,925
Let's wrap it up now.

233
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:21,715
Okay.

234
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:26,175
(Woojoo Electronics)

235
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:33,835
What happened to what I asked about?

236
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,275
One phone under Cha Woong's name. Two under his wife's name.

237
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:40,545
And one of them was activated last month.

238
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:46,755
I signed up for a tracking service connected to your phone.

239
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:49,115
I asked you to make a copy of the phone.

240
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,245
You can't do that stuff anymore.

241
00:20:52,245 --> 00:20:54,325
I risked my life doing this already.

242
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:58,925
Give me a break. I'll tell them about you first if I get caught.

243
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:02,805
- Hey. 
- Thank you.

244
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:05,835
See you. Drive safely.

245
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:13,295
Are you okay?

246
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:23,225
It had to be done at some point.

247
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:32,785
<i>( )<</i>

248
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:39,735
Chairman.

249
00:21:43,155 --> 00:21:45,465
Did the visit go well?

250
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:47,995
I missed you.

251
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:53,355
There.

252
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:57,885
Chairman, what did you do at the hospital?

253
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:00,585
Did they do a lot of painful things to you?

254
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:07,815
I don't like hospitals.

255
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:11,575
It's too stuffy.

256
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:14,905
I'm sorry.

257
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:18,095
I should've picked you up sooner.

258
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:25,245
You used to miss the ocean in your hometown.

259
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:30,795
We live nearby, but I didn't take you there often.

260
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:35,885
Yeon Joo is so mean, isn't she?

261
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:37,795
The ocean?

262
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:42,165
Yes, let's go see the ocean.

263
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:47,965
Yes, the ocean is really nice in Haejeon.

264
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:51,875
Shall we?

265
00:22:52,575 --> 00:22:57,755
Shall we go see the ocean on the way home?

266
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:02,355
Seok Goo.

267
00:23:23,155 --> 00:23:26,125
It's been almost two years...

268
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:29,825
since you came here, Chairman.

269
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:36,165
But your family hasn't visited you once.

270
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:44,165
When I first met you,

271
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,445
you told me to put everything behind me.

272
00:23:50,785 --> 00:23:54,145
You asked why I'm so suppressed.

273
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:57,945
You told me to let go of everything one by one.

274
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:03,095
I was very...

275
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:06,575
dependent on you.

276
00:24:07,735 --> 00:24:13,075
I wondered what it would've been like if you were my father.

277
00:24:13,075 --> 00:24:16,385
I imagined happy scenarios a lot, too.

278
00:24:18,735 --> 00:24:23,405
But you looked for your son whenever you were lucid again.

279
00:24:24,745 --> 00:24:27,795
I suppose you can't overcome the bloodline.

280
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:35,125
We're really...

281
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:42,115
almost there now.

282
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:53,275
Where are you?

283
00:25:09,735 --> 00:25:14,265
<i>Did you ever meet Ha Yeon Joo when you were a prosecutor, by chance?</i>

284
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:15,905
It's strange.

285
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:17,835
She made a deal with Choi Ho Shik, anyway.

286
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:20,795
Why did she insist on hiring you as her lawyer?

287
00:25:20,795 --> 00:25:22,335
What is this, stalking?

288
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:25,325
It's above and beyond just an angry mistress.

289
00:25:25,325 --> 00:25:27,055
What could it be?

290
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:29,935
I can sense something big approaching.

291
00:25:33,005 --> 00:25:36,285
<i>I will punish you.</i>

292
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:44,935
<i>Mom!</i>

293
00:25:44,935 --> 00:25:47,965
Yes, you're home.

294
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:51,425
<i>Starting to make tasty rice.</i>

295
00:26:06,805 --> 00:26:10,635
I couldn't stop you because you insisted on picking up Bom today,

296
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,055
but I'll pick up Bom from now on-

297
00:26:12,055 --> 00:26:14,685
We'll take Bom with us.

298
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:20,795
Wouldn't that be better for you to have a fresh start, too?

299
00:26:20,795 --> 00:26:23,455
What fresh start without her?

300
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:28,735
You created this mess because you couldn't give up on your son.

301
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:31,575
But you're telling me to give up on my daughter?

302
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:37,755
Do you even know what Bom's friends at school say?

303
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:42,185
Yes. I also know your son is to blame.

304
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:47,295
You're the one who told everyone and humiliated Bom.

305
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:49,745
Why make our business her problem?

306
00:26:49,745 --> 00:26:52,565
Don't you see that your son has been spreading fake news?

307
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:54,505
That's how bad he felt.

308
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,635
He must've been forced to do it.

309
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:58,425
Mother.

310
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:04,135
We better let Bom study abroad before she gets older.

311
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:05,865
No.

312
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:08,695
She'll be staying with me.

313
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:15,545
I don't care what you do for your son,

314
00:27:15,545 --> 00:27:19,365
but if you mess with Bom, I'll no longer sit still.

315
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:21,495
Since you have experience,

316
00:27:21,495 --> 00:27:26,105
you must know nothing could stop me, either.

317
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,555
Of course I do.

318
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:01,135
You're late.

319
00:28:05,015 --> 00:28:07,305
Long time no see, Chairman.

320
00:28:12,985 --> 00:28:16,885
Let's go in. Do you want to fight in front of him?

321
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:56,965
Why did Choi Woo Shik withdraw the lawsuit? And why is Na Moon Yeong your attorney?

322
00:28:56,965 --> 00:29:00,665
You stole the briefcase and tried to leave the country. You're curious about that?

323
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:04,455
You got caught embezzling, but the company is letting it slide without suing.

324
00:29:04,455 --> 00:29:08,865
Something nonsensical happened. Of course, I want to know why.

325
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,075
I'm disappointed.

326
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:14,995
About what?

327
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:20,655
I was going to forgive you if you pretended to be on my side and be affectionate.

328
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:24,845
But you're interrogating me after being questioned by the police.

329
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:36,045
I'm not done talking yet.

330
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:38,355
Talk about what?

331
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:42,245
Choi Woo Shik couldn't have let you go to let you have 80 billion.

332
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:46,355
And the money can't even be withdrawn without me.

333
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:50,165
Why would he let you go without wanting the money back?

334
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:53,025
I wonder.

335
00:29:54,095 --> 00:29:58,525
I suppose I've been a very good person.

336
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:03,285
Answer properly.

337
00:30:03,285 --> 00:30:06,425
What kind of deal did you make with Choi Woo Shik?

338
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:31,015
I guess you must still care about what your daughter thinks.

339
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:35,945
You barged in all the way here without caring about anything.

340
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:47,975
Bom.

341
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:57,205
What's wrong, Bom? Is something going on?

342
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:59,325
Dad...

343
00:31:00,795 --> 00:31:02,445
What about Dad?

344
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,385
Why isn't he coming home?

345
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:09,995
Well, the thing is...

346
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,775
He went to Grandma's to take care of something-

347
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:17,315
You're lying. I know you two had a fight.

348
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:20,795
- Bom.
- That's why he's not coming home, right?

349
00:31:21,405 --> 00:31:23,315
Why would you say that, Bom?

350
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:26,855
Dad is at Ms. Ha's right now.

351
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:49,845
You don't crash with your car anymore.

352
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:53,255
He's on the second floor right now.

353
00:32:53,255 --> 00:32:55,965
What are you guys doing in front of a child?

354
00:32:55,965 --> 00:33:00,095
He barged in, and he won't leave. How could I stop him?

355
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:03,315
I can't report him. It'd be too embarrassing.

356
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,925
All of these people would see it.

357
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:13,995
Do you want to brag to Bom about how you're cheating?

358
00:33:13,995 --> 00:33:15,705
Go back home.

359
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:17,795
Bom must be home alone.

360
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,305
Bom?

361
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:23,555
Are you pretending to worry about her after what you did?

362
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:25,955
It's not like that.

363
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,545
It's not like that, Na Moon Yeong.

364
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:38,185
Wow, why is he here?

365
00:33:38,185 --> 00:33:41,485
Did you call him? You can't help it, either?

366
00:33:41,485 --> 00:33:44,385
- Hey, Cha Seong Jae.
- Attorney Na.

367
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:49,685
What's going on? Did these assholes do something?

368
00:33:55,135 --> 00:33:58,095
It's nothing. Let's just go, Mr. Do.

369
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,475
How boring.

370
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:10,035
It ended boringly.

371
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:21,655
Hey! What's going on?

372
00:34:21,655 --> 00:34:23,505
Prosecutor.

373
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:25,455
Seriously, those bastards.

374
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,165
Shin Hwa.

375
00:34:29,925 --> 00:34:31,405
I'm sorry.

376
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:35,315
Where's Bom?

377
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:37,385
She said she'll go to bed.

378
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:41,655
I know he's having an affair, but doesn't he care about his daughter?

379
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:44,505
I'd prefer it if they were madly in love.

380
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:45,955
What?

381
00:34:46,655 --> 00:34:48,935
This was Ha Yeon Joo's doing.

382
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:53,195
Cha Seong Jae still cares a lot for his daughter.

383
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:55,805
Even if it were her, this is out of the line.

384
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:58,585
Why would they let the kid know?

385
00:34:58,585 --> 00:35:01,095
Because they want to torture me.

386
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:06,755
It was me that Ha Yeon Joo was after from the beginning.

387
00:35:06,755 --> 00:35:09,535
Ha Yeon Joo was after you?

388
00:35:09,535 --> 00:35:10,855
Why?

389
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:14,155
She approached the wrong way from the beginning.

390
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:16,305
It was neither for money...

391
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:18,715
nor to have an affair.

392
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:48,025
Did you bring up sending Bom to study abroad?

393
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,655
Don't get me started.

394
00:35:49,655 --> 00:35:53,685
She started flipping out as soon as I mentioned it.

395
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:57,185
Too bad her mother's that way.

396
00:35:57,185 --> 00:36:00,095
It's as expected.

397
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:02,505
Let's take care of one thing at a time.

398
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:07,515
You can leave as soon as you get the paperwork, right?

399
00:36:07,515 --> 00:36:09,555
Is it all done?

400
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:11,345
It's halfway done.

401
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:19,495
You just need to pretend to be Ha Yeon Joo and go to the bank with me.

402
00:36:24,255 --> 00:36:28,145
Will you leave the country immediately?

403
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:29,885
After I confirm something.

404
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:32,655
I need to know what Choi Woo Shik is after.

405
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,255
(To Bom: Bom, earlier, Daddy was...)

406
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:54,575
You insisted on going to that house. Did you leave empty-handed?

407
00:36:56,325 --> 00:36:59,125
Something is going on between Ha Yeon Joo and Choi Woo Shik.

408
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,445
She must be using Chairman Choi to threaten him.

409
00:37:02,445 --> 00:37:05,255
You never do anything properly. You're all talk.

410
00:37:05,255 --> 00:37:09,795
As Moon Yeong said, you should've turned yourself in and gone to prison.

411
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:12,865
Are you crazy?

412
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:15,185
I told you to stay quiet for a while.

413
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:19,075
When will you stop behaving recklessly for your son?

414
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:21,515
I can't let my son go to prison.

415
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:23,675
I'll go instead if he has to.

416
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:29,645
Thinking about how much Moon Yeong tortured Seong Jae makes me wake up in cold sweats.

417
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:33,255
And now, what did you tell him as his father?

418
00:37:34,065 --> 00:37:37,635
Mom, I won't go to prison.

419
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:40,135
I'll talk to Father for a bit.

420
00:37:40,135 --> 00:37:42,505
Go upstairs for a moment.

421
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,915
I talked to the party representative yesterday.

422
00:37:57,915 --> 00:37:59,845
Being nominated won't be an issue.

423
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:02,495
As long as things don't get worse.

424
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:06,585
Are you insisting on running?

425
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:14,815
That's more of the reason for helping me, then.

426
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:25,155
There's a way to move CEO Choi.

427
00:38:25,155 --> 00:38:28,265
Hwang Tae Soo's paper company is the tip of the iceberg.

428
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,695
But once he gets caught with it, the borrowed-name accounts,

429
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:33,445
CEO Choi's all sorts of corruption will be revealed.

430
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:36,125
Same with the illegally negotiated agreement.

431
00:38:36,125 --> 00:38:39,605
But I'm the one who has Hwang Tae Soo's account.

432
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:42,685
Whether they work together or not, they can't touch me.

433
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:47,085
You can have your election, and I'll get 80 million. We both get what we want.

434
00:38:47,085 --> 00:38:51,695
I'll talk to CEO Choi myself. Along with Choi Moo Won.

435
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:54,205
I'll tell him not to touch my 80 million.

436
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:00,785
What could you possibly do with an old man with dementia?

437
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:04,875
I can threaten him because he is a senile old man.

438
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,835
If I told CEO Choi I'd tell the shareholders and the media that

439
00:39:08,835 --> 00:39:12,115
he's been hiding his father, who has dementia, in the countryside,

440
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:15,375
that would be more effective than Ha Yeon Joo, don't you think?

441
00:39:25,545 --> 00:39:28,965
He cares about what others think the most,

442
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:32,435
but he mentioned sending you to prison.

443
00:39:32,435 --> 00:39:35,555
That means things aren't going well at all.

444
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:39,845
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to Bom and me.

445
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:42,085
Don't look down on me.

446
00:39:42,085 --> 00:39:44,145
I can tell that much.

447
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:47,855
Mom, I'm different than Father.

448
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:51,065
By chance, if something goes wrong,

449
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:56,375
tell them it was all me, okay?

450
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:00,425
No, Mom. That would never happen.

451
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:06,645
You just need to prepare Bom's education abroad.

452
00:40:39,765 --> 00:40:43,275
I made all the things you like. What do you think?

453
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:46,385
Mom,

454
00:40:47,795 --> 00:40:54,405
are you breaking up with Dad because I said

455
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:57,425
he was at Ms. Ha's place?

456
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:06,115
It's not because of you.

457
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:08,985
Mom and Dad are having a situation.

458
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:14,005
I should be apologizing to you.

459
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:20,685
Even if Mom and Dad split up,

460
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:24,965
it doesn't mean you won't be able to see him.

461
00:41:25,865 --> 00:41:30,355
The fact that we love you will never change.

462
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:48,715
I never got to tell you the truth from the beginning

463
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,295
and made you feel anxious.

464
00:41:51,295 --> 00:41:53,805
I'm so sorry.

465
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:55,875
I'll never do that again.

466
00:41:58,735 --> 00:42:00,215
I promise.

467
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:12,325
So Ha Yeon Joo was after you from the beginning?

468
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:13,815
Why?

469
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:17,935
That's the only way things start making sense.

470
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,075
But why?

471
00:42:20,075 --> 00:42:22,585
Maybe she resents me.

472
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:27,315
She might've been one of the people I went after as a prosecutor.

473
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:34,885
When Attorney Cha went missing, you mentioned an insurance murder.

474
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,945
- But that's-
- I'm not blaming you.

475
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:40,335
It was a reasonable doubt.

476
00:42:42,885 --> 00:42:46,525
It might've actually ended up that way.

477
00:42:47,505 --> 00:42:49,015
<i>One day, out of the blue,</i>

478
00:42:49,015 --> 00:42:52,345
<i>- See you later.</i>
<i></i><i>- the husband went missing on the way to work.</i>

479
00:42:53,325 --> 00:42:57,555
<i>Examining the body alone can't determine the body's condition. We need an autopsy-</i>

480
00:42:58,425 --> 00:43:02,925
<i>But the wife is insisting the police investigate, saying it wasn't a suicide.</i>

481
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:05,585
<i>But what if 500 million won in cash and</i>

482
00:43:05,585 --> 00:43:09,495
<i>insurance certificates worth billions were found at home?</i>

483
00:43:11,635 --> 00:43:17,875
<i>That would make me a woman who killed her husband for money.</i>

484
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:20,205
<i>Bom!</i>

485
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:21,755
<i>Bom!</i>

486
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:24,625
<i>That might've been the ending they wanted.</i>

487
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,965
But a variable in this case was...

488
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:31,145
that I trusted Cha Seong Jae too much.

489
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:37,345
Because you kept doubting that he committed suicide...

490
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,985
Things started veering off her scenario

491
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,275
and we ended up in this situation.

492
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:46,095
Kim Yoon Seon.

493
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:47,415
Ma Gang.

494
00:43:48,235 --> 00:43:52,785
If that's what caused those mysterious deaths,

495
00:43:52,785 --> 00:43:56,325
because I veered off the scenario,

496
00:43:57,195 --> 00:43:59,855
I can't tolerate any more sacrifices.

497
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:09,935
(MOU for Haean Village Development Cooperation)

498
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:18,555
Advisor Cha, these are internal documents for ongoing cases.

499
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:21,695
What if CEO Cha wants them later...

500
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:26,225
<i>Hwang Tae Soo's paper company is the tip of the iceberg.</i>

501

<i>But once he gets caught with it, the borrowed-name accounts,</i>

502
00:44:28,595 --> 00:44:31,445

503
00:44:31,445 --> 00:44:34,335
(MOU for Haean Village Development Cooperation)
<i>Same with the illegally negotiated agreement.</i>

504
00:44:45,635 --> 00:44:47,645
Cha Seong Jae was...

505
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:52,205
once a good husband and a good person.

506
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:55,805
I thought he was too good for me.

507
00:44:57,255 --> 00:45:03,585
So, at first, I was glad I could do something for him.

508
00:45:05,775 --> 00:45:07,815
No matter what happened to me,

509
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:11,435
I wanted to save him.

510
00:45:13,555 --> 00:45:16,685
I don't know how he used to be,

511
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:19,325
but he's a total trash now.

512
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,745
Forget the old Cha Seong Jae.

513
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:27,135
What are you two up to?

514
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:33,665
To my ex-husband, Mr. Do and I are officially dating.

515
00:45:33,665 --> 00:45:36,015
A love triangle won't be right.

516
00:45:39,265 --> 00:45:42,085
By the way, shouldn't you two go home?

517
00:45:42,085 --> 00:45:45,535
How could I sleep leaving you and Bom alone?

518
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,105
We don't know what they'd frame you for this time.

519
00:45:48,105 --> 00:45:51,475
At least a prosecutor needs to be with you to secure your alibi.

520
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:53,565
Don't you think, Mr. Do?

521
00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:55,045
Yes.

522
00:46:19,835 --> 00:46:23,905
Chairman, how are you feeling?

523
00:46:25,705 --> 00:46:30,365
Remember the driver who used to work for you?

524
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:33,915
He'll take you to the hospital later.

525
00:46:33,915 --> 00:46:37,175
I have a meeting at the HQ in Seoul.

526
00:46:41,805 --> 00:46:43,745
I'll be right back.

527
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,625
Travel safely...

528
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:56,245
Chairman.

529
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:02,985
Yeon Joo.

530
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:16,795
Forget everything and...

531
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,115
meet someone nice.

532
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,895
You should get married, too.

533
00:47:26,285 --> 00:47:29,545
Try everything, and if you don't like it,

534
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:33,325
come back then.

535
00:47:35,915 --> 00:47:37,975
You've done a lot.

536
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:24,215
Where's Mr. Do?

537
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:26,825
He left at dawn to do something.

538
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:31,565
Ha Yeon Joo seems suspicious.

539
00:48:31,565 --> 00:48:32,995
Why?

540
00:48:35,595 --> 00:48:38,175
That's Ha Yeon Joo's underling and...

541
00:48:38,175 --> 00:48:39,705
Who's that?

542
00:48:39,705 --> 00:48:42,715
He's Chairman Choi's driver,

543
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:46,745
but he's acting kind of suspiciously today. It bothers me.

544
00:48:46,745 --> 00:48:50,765
You can't just ignore things that bother you.

545
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:55,195
Let me look into it.

546
00:48:56,855 --> 00:48:58,795
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

547
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:01,575
- Bye.
- Bye.

548
00:49:13,665 --> 00:49:16,045
(Geumshin Corporation HQ in Seoul)

549
00:49:20,215 --> 00:49:25,815
We'll start an emergency meeting regarding Haean Village, Haejeon City.

550
00:49:25,815 --> 00:49:30,155
Yes, Shin Hwa. Did you look up the ownership of the vehicle?

551
00:49:30,155 --> 00:49:33,095
- Who?
<i>- It says Ha Jae Pil.</i>

552
00:49:34,075 --> 00:49:36,515
<i>He's Ha Yeon Joo's father.</i>

553
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,115
<i>Anyway, I have a bad feeling about it.</i>

554
00:49:38,115 --> 00:49:40,035
<i>I requested Haejeon Police Station to assist.</i>

555
00:49:40,035 --> 00:49:44,235
<i>You'd better stay at home with Bom and don't go anywhere, okay?</i>

556
00:49:46,095 --> 00:49:48,925
They even let an embezzlement case slide by.

557
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:52,095
What would be the point of having an additional internal investigation?

558
00:49:54,285 --> 00:49:56,805
Director Ha Yeon Joo, please.

559
00:49:56,805 --> 00:50:00,185
She's in a meeting? Where?

560
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,875
At the HQ in Seoul?

561
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,585
Okay, thank you.

562
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:04,285
You mean to have subsidiaries do the work without charging interest?

563
00:51:04,285 --> 00:51:07,185
Wow, that'd be too much...

564
00:51:15,195 --> 00:51:17,665
Talk after reviewing the report.

565
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:22,555
The bank already lent us tens of billions of won. On top of that...

566
00:52:04,325 --> 00:52:09,305
If we turn a blind eye, they will all crumble...

567
00:52:11,055 --> 00:52:12,905
Who are you?

568
00:52:12,905 --> 00:52:16,005
What are you doing? What are you doing?

569
00:52:16,965 --> 00:52:18,345
Right?

570
00:52:19,485 --> 00:52:22,865
Chairman. Chairman! Wake up...

571
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:29,945
I think we should talk to the stakeholders' attorney first.

572
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:35,795
Chairman! Chairman, wake up.

573
00:52:35,795 --> 00:52:37,625
Where? There?

574
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:38,975
Call 911.

575
00:52:38,975 --> 00:52:41,405
Call an ambulance, I said!

576
00:52:41,405 --> 00:52:44,085
Chairman. Chairman.

577
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,055
- Chairman?
- Yes, 911?

578
00:52:48,055 --> 00:52:50,945
Chairman! Chairman!

579
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:56,665
You can't die like this, Chairman.

580
00:53:49,635 --> 00:53:52,405
CEO Choi, something terrible happened.

581
00:54:26,715 --> 00:54:28,495
What?

582
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:30,665
I'm here to ask you a favor.

583
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,155
You must've seen it.

584
00:54:34,155 --> 00:54:37,535
Chairman dying and my dad getting arrested.

585
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:42,385
I'm here to ask you to represent my dad.

586
00:54:42,385 --> 00:54:44,565
He's your dad?

587
00:54:44,565 --> 00:54:46,995
Why would I represent your dad?

588
00:54:49,635 --> 00:54:54,365
Aren't you curious why I'm trying to punish you?

589
00:54:56,325 --> 00:55:01,285
Once you start representing my dad, you'll find out...

590
00:55:01,285 --> 00:55:03,375
the reason why.

591
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,395
They'll have to do an autopsy to determine the exact cause,

592
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:13,095
but the initial report says drug-induced heart failure.

593
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:19,065
Ha Yeon Joo's alibi was confirmed when he died.

594
00:55:20,075 --> 00:55:23,725
And the suspect is her father, Ha Jae Pil?

595
00:55:23,725 --> 00:55:26,745
There's something very fishy about it.

596
00:55:26,745 --> 00:55:31,155
He must've done all sorts of dirty work for her.

597
00:55:31,155 --> 00:55:33,495
I know she's his daughter,

598
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:37,295
but he murdered to satisfy her greed? I really don't get it.

599
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:39,995
Cha Seong Jae is still remaining silent?

600
00:55:39,995 --> 00:55:43,555
He was the first witness, but he says he doesn't remember.

601
00:55:44,415 --> 00:55:46,045
It's strange.

602
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:51,635
This means that Ha Yeon Joo's final target was Chairman Choi.

603
00:55:51,635 --> 00:55:56,705
What's she thinking while asking you to represent her father?

604
00:55:59,365 --> 00:56:04,145
Will you actually do it? Will you represent him?

605
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,395
I'll meet with Ha Jae Pil first.

606
00:56:09,345 --> 00:56:11,665
I want to know what he's thinking.
