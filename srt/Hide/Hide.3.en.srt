00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,651
(Episode 3)

5
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:10,571
I called the police on you!

6
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:17,361
Whoever it is, you'd better behave yourself.

7
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:25,961
Shit!

8
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:49,721
Mr. Do, are you there?

9
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,201
Where are you, Mr. Do?

10
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,681
Mr. Do.

11
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:13,201
Who was it?

12
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:15,821
Who did this to you?

13
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,681
You want to know who?

14
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,181
Your husband.

15
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,921
Cha Seong Jae.

16
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:36,061
Mr. Do. Mr. Do?

17
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:37,851
Mr. Do, please wake up.

18
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,621
Mr. Do.

19
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:43,161
Mr. Do, you can't pass out. Wake up right now.

(Hide)

21
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,851
It's gun violence this time?

22
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:07,131
Is it because you were a prosecutor? Cases follow you around constantly.

23
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,331
Even in this quiet town.

24
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:12,001
Attorney Na?

25
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:15,441
- Attorney Na.
 - Yes.

26
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:24,691
I submitted the dash cam memory card to the officer who came first.

27
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:30,801
Did you see the culprit's face yourself?

28
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,271
The thing is...

29
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,241
<i>You want to know who?</i>

30
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,781
<i>Your husband, Cha Seong Jae.</i>

31
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:21,971
Mom.

32
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,971
Yes, Bom.

33
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:32,141
Can't sleep?

34
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,811
Do you want to sleep with me?

35
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,491
Where?

36
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,311
I'm at the hospital.

37
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:53,391
To work.

38
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:57,491
Why, asshole? To get an additional statement from the gun violence victim.

39
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,051
Yes, bastard! I'm here to work, I said.

40
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:05,781
Hang up, man.

41
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,441
Excuse me.

42
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:09,141
(Do Jin Woo)

43
00:06:11,011 --> 00:06:13,331
Mr. Do Jin Woo did?

44
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:19,421
No, we haven't talked since yesterday, Lieutenant Baek.

45
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:22,621
All right.

46
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:39,201
(46, Haean-ro 4 gil)

00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:41,121
<i>46, Haean-ro 4 gil.</i>

48
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,011
<i>Let's meet here.</i>

49
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:05,221
(Happy Haejeon. Chawoong Welfare Foundation will be there.)

50
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:12,031
(Development Planned Area)

51
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,261
You know, the Haean Village...

52
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:21,101
Our foundation and Geumshin Corporation made a deal

53
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:24,781
to provide housing to people in need.

54
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:26,341
Geumshin Corporation?

55
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:30,621
Yes, we provide temporary housing to the homeless or

56
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:34,681
elderly people who live alone until the development is finished.

57
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:41,451
It's Mr. Hwang Tae Soo, who lives at the address.

58
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:49,071
(Housing for Economically Disadvantaged Program Beneficiary)

59
00:07:49,071 --> 00:07:52,611
Do you know Mr. Hwang by chance?

60
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:57,331
I do. He was enrolled with CEO Cha's recommendation.

61
00:07:57,331 --> 00:07:59,261
CEO Cha's recommendation?

62
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,671
Yes, there were a few like that.

63
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:04,671
Same with Mr. Oh Yeong Shik.

64
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:08,721
Is there another issue, by chance?

65
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,891
What do you mean by another issue?

66
00:08:09,891 --> 00:08:11,921
Well, you know Mr. Oh...

67
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:15,311
He lent his name for an account, but it was used as a burner account.

68
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:18,541
The police looked for him, and it was a disaster.

69
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:22,671
A lot of things tend to happen in Haean Village.

70
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:29,441
Yes, In Gyu.

71
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,971
Pardon?

72
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:35,161
That's not true. It says in the front.

73
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:37,221
Did they finish analyzing the bullet?

74
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:41,961
Yes, it's a bullet from a rifle.

75
00:08:41,961 --> 00:08:43,801
Since it's a hunting season now,

76
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:48,161
we're focusing on the boar hunters in the area.

77
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,681
But the license plate number won't come up.

78
00:08:50,681 --> 00:08:52,721
Is it a burner license plate?

79
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:57,061
Both the witness and victim said they didn't see the culprit's face.

80
00:08:57,061 --> 00:09:00,391
The witness lost her husband a few days ago,

81
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:04,251
and the victim was a witness in a trial her husband was defending.

82
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,281
Is this regarding insurance?

83
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:13,651
Lieutenant Baek, Chawoong Law Firm reported illegal debt collection.

84
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:18,961
You take care of it yourself, bastard. How dare you order me around?

85
00:09:21,591 --> 00:09:23,061
Where was it again?

86
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:24,871
Move!

87
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:27,731
Geez, seriously.

88
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:29,831
You... You can't go in there!

89
00:09:29,831 --> 00:09:31,541
Excuse me! You can't go in there!

90
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:34,861
Where's the CEO here? Where are they?

91
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:39,661
Debt collection using violence and threats is illegal.

92
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,941
Who do you think you are? Call the police right now!

93
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:44,311
I already did.

94
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,011
What?

95
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:48,901
You need to go to the police station and

96
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:52,011
get locked up to learn your lesson.

97
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:55,191
- You bastards-
 - Excuse me. Excuse me.

98
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,091
You'll get in trouble for demanding payment like this.

99
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:00,541
This is illegal.

100
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,641
Who the hell are you?

101
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:04,451
Me?

102
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:12,871
I'm a police officer.

103
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,921
You'll get in big trouble if you do this.

104
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:22,791
You got robbed last time, and you got ambushed by debt collectors this time.

105
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:26,171
You'll need new office supplies.

106
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:29,491
So, can you catch the thief?

107
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:33,071
Why does solving a case like that take forever in this small town?

108
00:10:33,071 --> 00:10:34,281
I know.

109
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:39,701
It's because there are so many sensational cases in this small town.

110
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:45,181
There's a witness the late CEO Cha worked with

111
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:49,521
and his name is Do Jin Woo. I wonder if you know him.

112
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:57,941
What about Mr. Do?

113
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,741
Is he the one who robbed our office, by chance?

114
00:11:00,741 --> 00:11:05,041
Why do you always go back to that?

115
00:11:08,141 --> 00:11:10,071
Yes, Advisor Cha.

116
00:11:10,071 --> 00:11:11,501
Yes.

117
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,241
Yes, yes, yes.

118
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:25,541
What happened? Where are the debt collectors?

119
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,701
He's famous for a reason. He got rid of them instantly.

120
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:34,211
Father.

121
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:39,721
The last few days must've been difficult for you, Moon Yeong.

122
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,491
Not at all.

123
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:43,971
Have a seat.

124
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:46,651
We need to take care of what's urgent first.

125
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:52,311
These are the cases we need to finish this month.

126
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,951
Okay.

127
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:57,521
And these are the smaller cases.

128
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:01,051
We can give them to the local bar association.

129
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:02,471
Got it.

130
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,771
I'm sorry. I should've taken care of them.

131
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,761
How about the debt collectors, by the way?

132
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,851
I agreed to be a guarantor.

133
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:12,761
I asked the police chief to tighten the security.

134
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,151
So, it'd be quiet for a while.

135
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:20,571
I'm so grateful you two decided to stay with us.

136
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:25,551
Not at all. I've always been planning to stay here forever.

137
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:29,551
Ms. Go, please sort out the rest.

138
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,041
Yes, I will.

139
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,131
Let's talk for a second.

140
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:41,561
It looks like collecting Seong Jae's life insurance won't be easy.

141
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,621
Collecting the insurance money isn't my priority.

142
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:48,081
It's not just to collect money.

143
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:54,741
I want us to pay off the debt as soon as possible and go back to normal.

144
00:12:54,741 --> 00:12:57,531
There's no way Seong Jae didn't know.

145
00:12:57,531 --> 00:13:00,541
The insurance plans he signed up for in the last few months...

146
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,751
He must've known they don't cover suicide.

147
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:10,561
If he was really planning to leave us insurance money,

148
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:14,001
he would've at least disguised it as an accident.

149
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:20,911
But he left a suicide note on purpose.

150
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:27,631
Instead of sending it to me, he sent it to the office as if he wanted everyone to know.

151
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:31,921
What are you trying to say?

152
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:35,621
I think he must've had a different goal.

153
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:39,571
Although I'm not sure what that is.

154
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:41,421
What do you mean...

155
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,611
A different goal?

156
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:47,561
Moon Yeong, don't poke around for no reason and-

157
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,641
I need to do this.

158
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,311
Why did he sign up for so many insurance plans

159
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:01,111
and what did he really want?

160
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:06,371
I'll find out myself.

161
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:25,261
<i>Mom, the pillow smells like Dad.</i>

162
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:34,761
You know my dad is a lawyer.

163
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,121
I can help you. So...

164
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,531
don't die.

165
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,791
You're not alone.

166
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,911
<i>I won't let you be.</i>

167
00:15:54,181 --> 00:15:57,511
I'll stay with you, no matter what happens.

168
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,191
Are you curious?

169
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:28,811
Geez...

170
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:31,651
What's happening to this neighborhood lately?

171
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:35,911
I'll be doing three shifts, including night patrolling. I'm screwed.

172
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:45,041
Nothing was captured on the CCTVs at the entrance of the townhouse.

173
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:50,401
No cameras face the building due to privacy concerns.

174
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,921
Check the dash cams of the vehicles parked nearby, too.

175
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:54,841
Yes, sir.

176
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,761
Is there anything missing in the house?

177
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:05,581
I'm not so sure.

178
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:09,861
I mean...

179
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:11,601
I don't think so.

180
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:16,001
When you called us after the law firm got broken into,

181
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,071
you said nothing was missing then, too.

182
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:20,521
Yes.

183
00:19:21,711 --> 00:19:26,531
Trespassing with no intention to steal? And it happened twice, too?

184
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:33,711
And you also happened to witness a shooting with your husband's old witness.

185
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:43,451
The debt collectors who barged into the office. Maybe it was them.

186
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:46,971
Bom, go upstairs.

187
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:55,811
It wasn't the debt collectors.

188
00:19:55,811 --> 00:20:02,741
The smart Attorney Na Moon Yeong was unaware of the firm's financial situation.

189
00:20:02,741 --> 00:20:06,101
The Attorney Na I know...

190
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:12,281
would've avoided bankruptcy no matter what. You know?

191
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:14,791
I would've if I had known.

192
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:17,241
- For now, my father-
- I heard.

193
00:20:17,281 --> 00:20:21,741
He promised to pay off the debt as the law firm's founder.

194
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:27,041
Do you have hidden money somewhere?

195
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:31,211
Insurance payout, for example.

196
00:20:32,561 --> 00:20:34,481
I mean...

197
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:38,581
the suicide note was found, but you're insisting he didn't.

198
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:41,821
I wonder if it was because of the life insurance

199
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:45,311
you can only collect it in its entirety if it was an accident.

200
00:20:45,311 --> 00:20:48,601
There were only the two of you at the scene during the shooting.

201
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:51,811
By chance, with Do Jin Woo once again.

202
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:00,341
If it was a crime of passion,

203
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:04,361
it had to be an accident rather than suicide to alleviate guilt-

204
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:07,061
Are you okay?

205
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:16,541
(See Everything CCTV)
If you leave the house often

206
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,581
or have a child, you need to check your home in real time.

207
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:23,311
You can check on the laptop or other devices, too.

208
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,541
Kim Yoon Seon.

209
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,971
Do Jin Woo.

210
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,821
Hwang Tae Soo.

211
00:22:13,771 --> 00:22:15,491
Dead.

212
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:40,141
(112*)
(Phone number for the Korean police)

213
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,921
Mr. Do Jin Woo?

214
00:23:03,691 --> 00:23:05,821
<i>Give me the key for my motorcycle.</i>

215
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:08,621
Where's the key?

216
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,721
Why did you have to run away from the hospital?

217
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:24,931
The one who shot you...

218
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:29,871
If it really was my husband, why didn't you tell Detective Baek?

219
00:23:33,421 --> 00:23:36,351
Her husband died. Her law firm got broken into.

220
00:23:36,351 --> 00:23:40,001
Her house got broken into. She witnessed a shooting.

221
00:23:41,611 --> 00:23:45,571
What's happening around Attorney Na, anyway?

222
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:50,841
Where did Do Jin Woo go after getting shot?

223
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:53,361
Huh? This person...

224
00:23:53,361 --> 00:23:54,471
Do you know him?

225
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,101
It's not that.

226
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,531
He caused a scene a few days ago demanding us to look for a homeless person.

227
00:23:59,531 --> 00:24:02,041
He asked us to look for Hwang Tae Soo.

228
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,941
Hwang Tae Soo?

229
00:24:06,601 --> 00:24:09,181
(Haejeon Police Station)

230
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:17,971
How could my dead husband have shot you?

231
00:24:17,971 --> 00:24:20,521
It was dark at night and...

232
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:23,851
it's possible that you were mistaken.

233
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:27,831
I'm not saying I refuse to believe you.

234
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:31,251
I wouldn't have run to meet you that night, either.

235
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:35,171
And I wouldn't have gone to the address you gave me.

236
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:36,901
You went there?

237
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:38,101
Yes.

238
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:41,751
Hwang Tae Soo, who supposedly lives there, wasn't there.

239
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:47,591
Do you really think Kim Yoon Seon died in an accident?

240
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:52,201
I'll only tell you what I saw.

241
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:56,261
The accident had already happened when I followed her.

242
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,681
So, why did you follow her?

243
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,671
Because I was worried.

244
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:01,591
It looked like Chief Ma was going to do something.

245
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:04,771
Ms. Kim came to me before she died

246
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:08,421
and told me Chief Ma was the real culprit of the Haean Village murder.

247
00:25:08,441 --> 00:25:12,041
My husband tried to cover up that murder, and you tried to assist it. Why?

248
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:14,361
I don't know why, either.

249
00:25:14,361 --> 00:25:16,061
Because Cha Seong Jae asked me, I-

250
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:19,731
So, that means Chief Ma is linked to my husband's death.

251
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:22,751
I don't know about complicated stuff like that!

252
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:30,321
You're not interested in listening to me at all.

253
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,131
Cha Seong Jae.

254
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,951
Your husband isn't dead.

255
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,121
I definitely saw him here.

256
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,801
But why?

257
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:45,111
Why would my dead husband come back to life and shoot you?

258
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,911
Hwang Tae Soo.

259
00:25:50,671 --> 00:25:52,331
Hwang Tae Soo?

260
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:55,971
I've been looking for Tae Soo.

261
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:13,461
Geez, he got drunk again.

262
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,161
- Hyung, do you need help?
- Gosh!

263
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:24,031
Hey, couldn't you make some noise and let me know you were there?

264
00:26:29,851 --> 00:26:32,581
I can't believe he still wears this.

265
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:38,351
The foundation is determining who'd stay longer at the housing, but I couldn't reach him.

266
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:40,871
So I stopped by and found him like this again.

267
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:44,731
How much did he have to drink, anyway?

268
00:26:45,651 --> 00:26:48,591
By the way, where were you trying to take him?

269
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:50,851
They won't approve him in this state.

270
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:54,211
I should give him a shot to get him to sober up.

271
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:56,041
Yes. But at this hour?

272
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:58,941
Aigoo! Should I just leave him alone, then?

273
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,941
He's in a worse state than usual today.

274
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:09,581
Careful. Careful.

275
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:13,961
What would he have done without you?

276
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:18,371
Thank you. You can go now.

277
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,121
See you tomorrow, okay?

278
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,261
Hyung.

279
00:27:39,061 --> 00:27:40,961
Hyung, are you in there?

280
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:44,281
Tae Soo!

281
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:05,271
Open the door if you're in there!

282
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:07,071
Hyung!

283
00:28:07,071 --> 00:28:11,241
Hwang Tae Soo. I'm not seeing that name.

284
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:12,441
When did he get discharged?

285
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:16,171
He was never checked into our hospital.

286
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:20,711
(Daraeul Hospital)

287
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:23,121
There's no record of someone with that name.

288
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:30,681
Welcome.

289
00:28:41,061 --> 00:28:42,661
Missing?

290
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:44,121
Yes.

291
00:28:45,481 --> 00:28:47,301
When was the last time you saw him?

292
00:28:47,301 --> 00:28:49,071
On the 18th.

293
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:55,901
Hwang Tae Soo.

294
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:59,541
He didn't really have an address before.

295
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,831
Are you sure he didn't leave out of anger?

296
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:04,681
He wouldn't do that.

297
00:29:05,421 --> 00:29:06,951
He...

298
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:11,051
wouldn't disappear without telling me.

299
00:29:12,011 --> 00:29:13,911
I'll let you report him as a runaway for now.

300
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:16,411
Come back if you still can't reach him.

301
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:18,741
You can leave now.

302
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:20,481
A person is missing, I said.

303
00:29:20,481 --> 00:29:21,721
I know.

304
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:25,001
Try to reach him and come back if you can't.

305
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:31,901
A person is missing, I said.

306
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:34,881
Sir, you can't do this at the police station.

307
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:36,221
What the hell are you doing?

308
00:29:36,221 --> 00:29:37,641
Get him out of here.

309
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,371
He didn't run away. He's missing.

310
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:40,771
He could be dead, okay?

311
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,231
- Let's go.
- Let go of me.

312
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:44,431
Let go!

313
00:29:44,431 --> 00:29:46,821
- What are you doing? Get him out of here.
- He's missing, I said.

314
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:49,951
- That's enough. Leave now.
- He's missing!

315
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:20,621
<i>Cha Seong Jae and Hwang Tae Soo switched.</i>

316
00:30:24,331 --> 00:30:26,421
And I'm aware of it.

317
00:30:30,981 --> 00:30:32,631
So...

318
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:38,051
to cover that up...

319
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:42,301
he tried to kill you?

320
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:45,831
Cha Seong Jae did? My dead husband?

321
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:50,801
If you can't believe me, look for Hwang Tae Soo.

322
00:30:51,581 --> 00:30:54,921
See if you end up finding him or Cha Seong Jae.

323
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,061
You'll finally believe me then.

324
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:02,141
No.

325
00:31:04,371 --> 00:31:08,881
Whenever Seong Jae saw a puppy on the street, he stopped and stared at it.

326
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:12,141
He's not a terrible person like that. Not to mention how he treated Bom.

327
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,871
There's no way. He'd never shoot anyone-

328
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:16,561
Did you know...

329
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:21,121
Cha Seong Jae used to go hunting with Chief Ma?

330
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:26,521
Don't think you know everything about him.

331
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:30,361
Don't just hear what you want to hear.

332
00:32:26,091 --> 00:32:29,941
<i>Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Are you serious right now?</i>

333
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:33,741
I'm totally serious right now.

334
00:32:33,741 --> 00:32:36,671
That Cha Seong Jae might not have been the real Cha Seong Jae.

335
00:32:36,671 --> 00:32:38,871
<i>Wake up, Na Moon Yeong.</i>

336
00:32:38,871 --> 00:32:41,111
<i>What did you always used to say as a prosecutor?</i>

337
00:32:41,111 --> 00:32:43,591
<i>"Scientific investigation and DNA don't lie."</i>

338
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:45,931
<i>You said that yourself. Remember?</i>

339
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:50,111
I didn't send his toothbrush as a DNA sample. It was Mother.

340
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:51,871
<i>Yes, your mother-in-law.</i>

341
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:54,151
<i>Cha Seong Jae's mother. Why would she-</i>

342
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:56,161
I know. Why would she?

343
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:58,551
Let's check just once more.

344
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:01,691
I'll send the one Seong Jae used to use again.

345
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:05,671
The DNA sample KCIS collected from the scene-

346
00:33:07,391 --> 00:33:09,991
<i>What? Why did you stop talking?</i>

347
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:12,791
<i>What is it?</i>

348
00:33:39,821 --> 00:33:41,331
Shin Hwa,

349
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:44,891
I'll call you back in half an hour.

350
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:46,981
Please call me if I don't.

351
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:50,251
And call the police if I don't answer.

352
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:02,081
You're trespassing right now.

353
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,071
Get out of here immediately.

354
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:18,561
This won't cut it. I need 6.5 billion.

355
00:34:19,571 --> 00:34:22,501
Your husband took 7 billion from me.

356
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:26,731
I got 5 million back. So there's 6.5 billion left.

357
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:30,061
What do you mean...

358
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:37,451
The money I gave CEO Cha because I trusted him

359
00:34:38,851 --> 00:34:40,751
is all gone.

360
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:45,341
What did he lose all that money to?

361
00:34:45,341 --> 00:34:46,931
A mistress?

362
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,181
Gambling?

363
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:51,041
He must've been afraid, too.

364
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:56,941
Because he knew what kind of money that was better than anyone.

365
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:01,061
I don't know anything about it.

366
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:15,691
Is it no longer true if you don't know?

367
00:35:15,691 --> 00:35:17,951
It's 7 billion.

368
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:21,621
He took 7 billion, but there's only 5 million?

369
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:24,561
This is all he left for his family?

370
00:35:25,951 --> 00:35:28,561
You were pretty naive, Attorney Na.

371
00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:32,551
I'll give you a week.

372
00:35:32,551 --> 00:35:35,411
Pay me back the money your husband squandered.

373
00:35:36,391 --> 00:35:40,611
Excuse me, Chief Ma. You're blackmailing me right now.

374
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:42,881
Your daughter should be home soon.

375
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:47,941
You don't have to worry.

376
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:52,421
We took care of her since you looked so busy.

377
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:05,251
Bom!

378
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:15,051
I'll make sure you all pay for this.

379
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:18,931
No need to thank me.

380
00:36:20,781 --> 00:36:23,231
We're willing to escort her anytime.

381
00:36:26,671 --> 00:36:29,871
I hope we can meet with a smile in a week.

382
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:32,581
Unless you want to find out what true blackmailing is.

383
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,701
Are you okay?

384
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:04,361
Ms. Na.

385
00:37:06,321 --> 00:37:08,271
Are you okay?

386
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,601
Yes.

387
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,451
Hello, sir.

388
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:17,761
Bom's kids' cooking class later-

389
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:21,481
I'm sorry. She'll have to take a break from all classes for now.

390
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,661
What?

391
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:25,701
I'm sorry. There's a bit of a situation at home.

392
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,121
No need to apologize. It's okay.

393
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:31,701
After you get things sorted out, we'll later...

394
00:37:31,701 --> 00:37:34,891
Come to the tea party if you can, then.

395
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,021
Okay.

396
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:40,371
Bom, I'll bring you the cookies later.

397
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:42,611
Thank you.

398
00:37:42,611 --> 00:37:44,361
Bom, we need to go somewhere.

399
00:37:44,361 --> 00:37:45,831
Where?

400
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,671
Just get in first.

401
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:49,991
- Put the seatbelt on.
- Okay.

402
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:53,611
Ms. Na.

403
00:37:54,341 --> 00:38:01,351
Feel free to let me know if you need my help.

404
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:02,891
Thank you.

405
00:38:02,891 --> 00:38:04,781
Thank you, Ms. Ha.

406
00:38:19,761 --> 00:38:24,841
Her daughter is really cute.

407
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:28,781
Her laughter is so lively...

408
00:38:28,781 --> 00:38:31,881
and very pure.

409
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,621
Should I invite her to our house?

410
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:37,591
No, you don't have to force her.

411
00:38:37,591 --> 00:38:40,181
I'm sure you'll like it if she comes over.

412
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:46,101
<i>Feels nice early in the morning, right?</i>

413
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:48,941
- Would you like to try this?
<i>- So, what did you prepare?</i>

414
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:51,951
<i>- I prepared tennis shoes.</i>
<i></i><i>- Well, I...</i>

415
00:38:51,951 --> 00:38:55,371
<i>- What did you prepare, boss?</i>
<i></i><i>- Me? As for me...</i>

416
00:38:55,371 --> 00:38:56,871
Okay.

417
00:38:58,451 --> 00:39:00,901
Hello, I'm Freddie!

418
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:03,651
<i>- We're taking a ship this time.</i>
<i></i><i>- Yes.</i>

419
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:05,721
<i>England is an island nation.</i>

420
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,491
<i>England is located to the north-west of mainland Europe.</i>

421
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,191
<i>In England...</i>

422
00:39:11,251 --> 00:39:12,711
We'll sue him immediately.

423
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:16,281
Trespassing, robbery, blackmailing, and even kidnapping?

424
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:20,511
How dare he blackmails a former prosecutor?

425
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:23,421
How much is 7 billion exactly?

426
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:26,321
Illegal fund and money laundering.

427
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:30,711
He must've done all the illegal things an attorney could commit.

428
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,891
Cha Seong Jae, that bastard.

429
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:37,201
You need to get it together now.

430
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:42,681
Don't say your dead husband is alive or something nonsensical like that.

431
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,811
Let's put away that psycho Chief Ma first.

432
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:49,871
How about what I asked you?

433
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,241
Shin Hwa.

434
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:59,601
Do you really have to?

435
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:01,961
A DNA test in this situation?

436
00:40:09,751 --> 00:40:12,101
The DNA sample...

437
00:40:12,101 --> 00:40:16,661
won't be hard to get since the case was concluded as suicide.

438
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:19,751
I'll request it for now. Let's wait.

439
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:23,341
Thank you.

440
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:25,081
Thank you, Shin Hwa.

441
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:27,871
Please take care of Bom for me.

442
00:40:27,871 --> 00:40:30,461
You're the only one I could ask.

443
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,331
I'm sincerely sorry about CEO Cha.

444
00:40:45,331 --> 00:40:47,401
You must be very upset.

445
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:51,931
No, I'm sorry to disturb you regarding my personal matter.

446
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:54,781
It's possible to extend the loan then, correct?

447
00:40:54,781 --> 00:41:00,161
Yes. The executive director of Chawoong came to be the guarantor.

448
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:01,801
By chance,

449
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:09,991
did CEO Cha create the accounts for the homeless sponsored by the Chawoong Foundation here?

450
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:12,261
Well, yes.

451
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:17,481
He said he wanted to give them the foundation's fund support.

452
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:20,641
But why do you ask that?

453
00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:27,171
I heard one of the accounts was used as a burner account once.

454
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:32,061
I'm not sure. There are countless accounts like that.

455
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:34,421
It happens occasionally.

456
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:39,821
In Gyu, did you look into it?

457
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:42,691
<i>Yes, out of the people who received the foundation's fund,</i>

458
00:41:42,691 --> 00:41:46,311
<i>13 of them were being managed by CEO Cha.</i>

459
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:48,171
Send me the list.

460
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:56,511
(Jo In Gyu)

461
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:01,031
(Hwang Tae Soo / Choi Beom Joon / Kim Woo Shik)

462
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:04,231
<i>Choi Beom Joon and Kim Woo Shik?</i>

463
00:42:23,571 --> 00:42:25,311
Choi Beom Joon.
(Construction Subcontractor Agreement)

464
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:27,781
Kim Woo Shik?

465
00:42:27,781 --> 00:42:29,551
(KK International CEO Kim Woo Shik)

466
00:42:29,551 --> 00:42:31,891
The contract fee was 7 billion.

467
00:42:33,211 --> 00:42:36,891
<i>Your husband took 7 billion from me.</i>

468
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:40,361
<i>I got 5 million back. So there's 6.5 billion left.</i>

469
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:56,011
How can I help you? Chief Ma is in a meeting right now.

470
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:14,401
Should I talk to you out here?

471
00:43:14,401 --> 00:43:16,511
I wonder if everyone knows.

472
00:43:19,361 --> 00:43:20,971
Please leave.

473
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:28,671
Thank you.

474
00:43:28,671 --> 00:43:32,831
- Please leave.
- For the independence of the people who struggle financially,

475
00:43:32,831 --> 00:43:35,791
you signed such a major contract.

476
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:39,351
I'm here to thank you on behalf of the Chawoong Foundation.

477
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:41,211
Let's postpone the meeting.

478
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:43,741
I have a guest, as you can see.

479
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:58,581
Are you crazy?

480
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:02,541
Do you realize that you've been betrayed by Cha Seong Jae now?

481
00:44:03,671 --> 00:44:06,251
Wake up, ma'am.

482
00:44:06,251 --> 00:44:07,411
Where's the money?

483
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,911
Do you think I'm here as Cha Seong Jae's wife right now?

484
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:13,741
No, I was a prosecutor for 13 years.

485
00:44:13,741 --> 00:44:16,771
I've dealt with too many people like you.

486
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:21,721
The 7 billion my husband supposedly took.

487
00:44:21,721 --> 00:44:24,181
It wasn't even your money.

488
00:44:24,181 --> 00:44:28,151
It was a mysterious ghost company, not Ma Gang,

489
00:44:28,151 --> 00:44:30,571
who the 7 billion belongs to.

490
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:32,731
I'm not sure what you mean.

491
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:35,641
A ghost company sent a ridiculous amount of

492
00:44:35,641 --> 00:44:39,471
7 billion construction fees to a fake homeless person's account.

493
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:42,371
That's a classic money laundering tactic.

494
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:46,151
I see.

495
00:44:46,911 --> 00:44:52,681
If you didn't know, should I thank someone above you?

496
00:44:52,681 --> 00:45:00,991
I suppose a corporation like Geumshin Corporation wouldn't launder their money so clumsily.

497
00:45:09,651 --> 00:45:12,381
You're an entertaining lady.

498
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:16,021
It's none of your concern what kind of money that is.

499
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:18,831
I'm telling you to give it back since your husband took it.

500
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:21,141
- Is there evidence?
- What?

501
00:45:21,141 --> 00:45:23,641
You should've given it to him under your name.

502
00:45:23,641 --> 00:45:27,961
Why would you trust Cha Seong Jae with such a large sum of money?

503
00:45:27,961 --> 00:45:29,641
Because he was cheap.

504
00:45:30,531 --> 00:45:33,431
Your husband charged the least amount of fee.

505
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:36,801
He was resourceful since he had the foundation, too.

506
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:40,081
You must know well since you used to be a prosecutor.

507
00:45:40,081 --> 00:45:42,571
That he had plenty of experience.

508
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:47,531
Make it public if you want to.

509
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:49,381
I have nothing to do with it.

510
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:54,841
Cha Seong Jae represented Deputy Kim Yoon Seon, who embezzled money and died.

511
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:56,731
Go ahead and expose it.

512
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:59,391
Those two teamed up and took the money.

513
00:45:59,391 --> 00:46:02,041
And I'm just trying to clean up the mess.

514
00:46:09,121 --> 00:46:11,141
You're so transparent.

515
00:46:12,141 --> 00:46:14,701
Tongues may lie,

516
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:16,721
but bodies don't.

517
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:23,651
You're scared, aren't you?

518
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:29,791
Looks like you know the higher-ups won't believe what you just said.

519
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:35,671
If there's evidence my husband took your money, bring it.

520
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:38,391
I'll be responsible if I have to.

521
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,931
If you threaten me using my daughter again,

522
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:46,631
you'll pay for it.

523
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:26,681
Mr. Do, we need to talk.

524
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:36,431
Using the support fund as an excuse,

525
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:41,491
I think CEO Cha used Mr. Hwang Tae Soo and a few others.

526
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:47,751
And the burner accounts...

527
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:52,761
Perhaps he used their bank accounts to launder Chief Ma's money.

528
00:47:52,761 --> 00:47:55,471
Like an obvious plot from a movie.

529
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:00,471
Did you want to see me to tell me that?

530
00:48:04,141 --> 00:48:05,611
Excuse me.

531
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:11,531
I don't care if you people launder money or flip out.

532
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:15,001
Cha Seong Jae, whom you believe to be dead...

533
00:48:15,001 --> 00:48:17,671
I'm just looking for him right now.

534
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:36,581
Yes.

535
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:40,911
I see that you're looking for Mr. Hwang Tae Soo

536
00:48:40,911 --> 00:48:43,961
trying to catch dead Cha Seong Jae.

537
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:48,921
This is Mr. Hwang's transaction history.

538
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:51,731
After Seong Jae died,

539
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:56,591
Mr. Hwang took out cash from just one branch.

540
00:49:01,281 --> 00:49:03,531
Let's do an exchange.

541
00:49:03,531 --> 00:49:06,251
Tell me why you believe Cha Seong Jae is alive.

542
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:18,871
<i>There's a business that deals with people who can't activate phones.</i>

543
00:49:18,871 --> 00:49:23,011
<i>I introduced them to Tae Soo, too.</i>

544
00:49:23,011 --> 00:49:27,571
Seong Jae said he needed a way to reach Tae Soo.

545
00:49:29,411 --> 00:49:32,561
Seong Jae apparently went there recently

546
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:35,131
and purchased a new number under Tae Soo's name.

547
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:39,761
That number is still active.

548
00:49:55,591 --> 00:49:59,361
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep...</i>

549
00:50:00,461 --> 00:50:04,771
(010-1812-3201)

550
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:25,661
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep...</i>

551
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:39,971
(DNA Test Report)

552
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:45,941
You should've been dead.

553
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:50,431
You should've just died, Cha Seong Jae.

554
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:12,221
(DNA Test Report)

555
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:14,561
(Result: 0.0000001% a match)
Should I tell Father?

556
00:52:14,561 --> 00:52:19,551
Thankfully, the DNA sample from the body was kept as evidence.

557
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:24,311
They compared it with the DNA from his toothbrush at home.

558
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:25,871
I...

559
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:33,151
I must've taken the wrong toothbrush.

560
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,571
It's possible you were mistaken,

561
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:39,701
but the DNA from that toothbrush can't just...

562
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:44,211
match the DNA from a stranger's body, Mother.

563
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:46,841
Are you doubting me right now?

564
00:52:48,481 --> 00:52:51,571
I heard you've been meeting up with Do Jin Woo lately.

565
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:53,901
Did he tell you that?

566
00:52:53,901 --> 00:52:55,361
Yes.

567
00:52:56,401 --> 00:52:59,171
Since the Chawoong Foundation used to sponsor him,

568
00:52:59,171 --> 00:53:02,541
I heard he was very close to you and Father.

569
00:53:05,101 --> 00:53:08,601
You must know that he got shot recently, too, then.

570
00:53:10,711 --> 00:53:12,971
I don't know if it's a good thing or not,

571
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:15,891
but he said he saw who shot him.

572
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:19,241
There's no way it was Seong Jae. He would never do-

573
00:53:23,011 --> 00:53:25,261
Why are you telling me that?

574
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:31,751
How could he have shot Mr. Do if he was dead?

575
00:53:34,891 --> 00:53:37,721
If he's alive, what's with that body?

576
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:40,931
That's murder.

577
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:44,751
If not, it's a body disposal, at least.

578
00:53:44,751 --> 00:53:47,901
Trying to kill Mr. Do is attempted murder.

579
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:52,771
How much do you want me to find out?

580
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:56,581
Let me meet Seong Jae before things get worse.

581
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:59,001
What kind of nonsense are you saying...

582
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:01,121
I know you're having a hard time, but...

583
00:54:03,301 --> 00:54:05,121
Stop saying stuff like that and leave.

584
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:07,921
This is Mr. Hwang Tae Soo's call history.

585
00:54:09,691 --> 00:54:11,821
This is your number.

586
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:13,951
Where's Cha Seong Jae right now?

587
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:23,791
I'll discuss this with Father, then.

588
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:26,571
Moon Yeong. Moon Yeong.

589
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:30,591
D-Don't be like that. Let's go out and...

590
00:54:30,591 --> 00:54:32,531
Father.

591
00:54:32,531 --> 00:54:33,861
Yes.

592
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:40,691
I'll get going now.

593
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:43,591
Oh, okay. Get home safely.

594
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:45,601
See you at the office tomorrow.

595
00:54:46,351 --> 00:54:47,921
I'll let you rest, then.

596
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:09,621
(We're against the building of the resort that mocks the locals)

597
00:55:20,511 --> 00:55:22,251
(46, Haean-ro 4 gil)

598
00:58:06,841 --> 00:58:08,771
You were actually alive.

599
00:58:26,121 --> 00:58:30,151
♫ <i>I can't take another lonely night</i> ♫

600
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:32,871
♫ <i>You know that I need to know</i> ♫

601
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:35,651
♫ <i>You know that I need to know</i> ♫

602
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:39,071
♫ <i>I'm not giving in without a fight</i> ♫

603
00:58:39,071 --> 00:58:42,661
(Hide)

604
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:45,211
<i>Did you kill Hwang Tae Soo?</i>

605
00:58:45,211 --> 00:58:47,191
<i>Let go, you son of a bitch!</i>

606
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,041
<i>I've been threatened by Do Jin Woo.</i>

607
00:58:50,041 --> 00:58:54,491
<i>I told the police that Hwang Tae Soo was the one who shot me.</i>

608
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:59,751
<i>We'll find out if the police will find Hwang Tae Soo or Cha Seong Jae soon.</i>

609
00:58:59,751 --> 00:59:01,671
<i>Any luck getting the money ready?</i>

610
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:05,001
<i>I'll ask you nicely only for a few more days.</i>

611
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:08,121
<i>You'll demand Ma Gang 7 billion for damages?</i>

612
00:59:08,121 --> 00:59:10,951
<i>Yes. I hope you look forward to it.</i>
