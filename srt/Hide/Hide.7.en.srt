5
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,638
Cha Seong Jae.

6
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,698
Hey!

7
00:01:36,158 --> 00:01:38,528
Come to your senses.

8
00:01:42,288 --> 00:01:44,828
Was it fun playing me?

9
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:48,708
It must've been very fun.

10
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,998
She lived next door and...

11
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:53,398
you pretended to be kidnapped.

12
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:55,638
That was very funny of you two.

13
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:59,848
Yes, I'm glad you brought it up.

14
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,978
How about you? Did you forget what I said already?

15
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:06,988
You're the one who betrayed me. You brought this upon yourself.

16
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,598
You should've stayed put like I told you to.

17
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:12,688
Why are you putting us in this mess? Why?

18
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:17,808
This is all because of me?

19
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,538
Yes.

20
00:02:19,538 --> 00:02:22,208
I wanted to live quietly as a dead man, but you dragged me out,

21
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,078
humiliated me, and reported me. You ruined everything!

22
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:28,618
No, I haven't even begun.

23
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:31,598
I'll ruin you even more, more, more!

24
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,728
Will you report him again?

25
00:02:35,528 --> 00:02:40,518
You'd be the one who attempted murder this time.

26
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,228
Attempted murder?

27
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:46,708
Report me.

28
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,378
Everyone in Haejeon City...

29
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:54,558
I mean, everyone in this country will hear about this.

30
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:57,908
My husband, whom I thought committed suicide,

31
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:00,758
actually killed someone, swapped a corpse,

32
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:05,528
abandoned his daughter while cheating on his wife with the woman next door!

33
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:08,588
Go ahead. Do it!

34
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,808
You're the one who abandoned our daughter.

35
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:16,368
You revealed everything and made Bom feel ashamed.

36
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:18,458
Didn't you?

37
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:25,248
<i>Open the door. Open it right now!</i>

38
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,648
<i>You must be inside! Open up!</i>

39
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:30,598
<i>Why are you banging on someone else's door? Why?</i>

40
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,338
<i>Open the door!</i>

41
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,188
(background yelling)

42
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,118
<i>Open the door!</i>

43
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:39,768
<i>Open the door!</i>

44
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,728
You can't be in here.

45
00:04:43,578 --> 00:04:45,698
It's okay. Trust me.

46
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,448
<i>Open up!</i>

47
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:38,858
Murder and fraud weren't enough that he committed adultery.

48
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,508
That crazy bastard.

49
00:06:41,508 --> 00:06:44,778
He's been doing all sorts of things.

50
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:48,268
He moved to Haejeon City to live with her from the beginning.

51
00:06:48,268 --> 00:06:51,188
What a way to deceive someone.

52
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:55,838
Shin Hwa, Joo Shin Hwa...

53
00:06:58,178 --> 00:07:00,548
We're really friends, aren't we?

54
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:01,728
What are you saying?

55
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:05,958
They say close friends' period cycles end up matching, too.

56
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:11,408
But both of our husbands cheated on us.

57
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:17,048
How can you joke around in this situation?

58
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,018
I know.

59
00:07:21,088 --> 00:07:23,918
What will you tell Bom?

60
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:32,378
Moon Yeong...

61
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,748
I've been divorced...

62
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:40,328
and demoted, so I know this.

63
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:46,078
You might feel like you're dying now,

64
00:07:46,948 --> 00:07:49,408
but it's nothing once it passes.

65
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,488
Just keep it simple.

66
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:59,168
Be a bitch and destroy everyone who wronged you.

67
00:08:00,228 --> 00:08:01,908
You'll be fine then.

68
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:27,188
Even the elegant Prosecutor Na lost it,

69
00:08:27,188 --> 00:08:30,598
learning her husband cheated.

70
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:36,138
She completely lost her marbles.

71
00:08:36,728 --> 00:08:42,318
You expected it, and yet you sent the video to torture her?

72
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,008
Why did you?

73
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:47,358
I don't understand you at all.

74
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:51,428
Is it jealousy?

75
00:08:58,308 --> 00:09:01,008
I'll let this one slide, but don't be unruly from now on.

76
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:04,088
We didn't agree upon anything beyond Hwang Tae Soo.

77
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:11,278
You'd ruin everything if you keep acting like this.

78
00:09:15,128 --> 00:09:17,428
I'm thinking of cutting off...

79
00:09:18,428 --> 00:09:21,118
Na Moon Yeong completely.

80
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:28,708
She can't interfere and ruin things.

81
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,558
Mom.

82
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,998
Hey.

83
00:09:53,748 --> 00:09:55,708
You should go back to sleep.

84
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,708
We'll go home tomorrow.

85
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,418
You said bad men will come.

86
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:04,668
It's okay. Mom can defeat them all.

87
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:31,728
Get in.

88
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:45,898
You knew about their relationship, didn't you?

89
00:10:51,518 --> 00:10:55,098
I thought it was over because Ha Yeon Joo said she kidnapped Cha Seong Jae.

90
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,338
I'm sorry I couldn't be helpful...

91
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,148
when you helped me out.

92
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,538
That used to be my signature line.

93
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:10,148
Hearing it from you feels different.

94
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,448
Did you meet your daughter?

95
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:17,058
No.

96
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:23,448
<i>I did go to the orphanage you found, but</i>

97
00:11:25,648 --> 00:11:30,368
<i>they said they couldn't tell me even if I were the biological father.</i>

98
00:11:30,368 --> 00:11:33,268
<i>Although I expected that.</i>

99
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:39,508
But they told me not to worry since she found good parents.

100
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:41,808
They told me that, at least.

101
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:43,998
You can't just take their word for it.

102
00:11:43,998 --> 00:11:47,358
Let's go back to the orphanage together.

103
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:48,678
No, I'm okay.

104
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:51,088
I'm not okay with it.

105
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:53,898
Let's request a DNA test to prove you're the biological father...

106
00:11:53,898 --> 00:11:55,948
- and-
- No, Attorney Na.

107
00:11:56,768 --> 00:11:58,748
Don't do it.

108
00:11:58,748 --> 00:12:04,288
I just wanted to check if she was doing well.

109
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:07,628
I worried she might be lonely like me...

110
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:12,458
and felt sad, thinking she was all alone.

111
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,838
But thinking now, she even found good parents.

112
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:22,498
She's probably better off without a dad who killed someone.

113
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:27,388
Are you able to give up that easily?

114
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:32,008
You've come this far looking for her.

115
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:35,178
Because some dads are...

116
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:39,278
better being gone.

117
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:44,198
I'm sorry. You helped me so much.

118
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,548
My dad...

119
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:56,698
conned people and ran away in the middle of the night.

120
00:12:56,698 --> 00:13:02,018
People criticized him for dying leaving debt behind,

121
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,828
but..

122
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,028
I still wanted him to come back...

123
00:13:10,848 --> 00:13:14,048
and just stay by my side.

124
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:18,498
If you stayed together,

125
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,818
your daughter would've felt the same way.

126
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:28,608
Because you would've been an amazing dad if you'd been together.

127
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,818
What will you do about Cha Seong Jae now?

128
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,298
I should fight him.

129
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:46,468
Where should we start, then?

130
00:13:48,468 --> 00:13:50,448
I thought you wanted to fight.

131
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:59,558
Geez, why did you make me come out?

132
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:02,278
I'm busy enough already.

00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:54,998
<i>Did he really kill someone when he was 19?</i>

181
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:57,248
<i>Is he really an ex-con?</i>

182
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:58,688
No.

183
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,508
That young criminal is my boyfriend.

184
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:04,528
Moon Yeong met him to tear us apart.

185
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:06,198
<i>What?</i>

186
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,918
I even got divorced.

187
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:10,068
I deserve a passionate affair, too.

188
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:11,508
Isn't that cool?

189
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:16,688
A romance between an ex-con and prosecutor that would put Hollywood to shame.

190
00:18:16,688 --> 00:18:19,368
<i>Hey, Joo Shin Hwa!</i>

191
00:18:27,598 --> 00:18:29,308
Sorry.

192
00:18:31,668 --> 00:18:33,508
It's okay.

193
00:18:34,638 --> 00:18:37,048
Shit! Don't look at that crap.

194
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,108
Why? It's entertaining.

195
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:41,978
What about Bom?

196
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:45,048
Kids these days already use smartphones. They're precocious.

197
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:50,458
She doesn't seem to know yet. I need to explain it to her.

198
00:18:51,228 --> 00:18:53,538
This is too absurd for even a tabloid.

199
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:58,018
The Cha Seong Jae articles all disappeared as if planned, and only weird rumors are left.

200
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,988
Are they controlling media now?

201
00:19:02,088 --> 00:19:04,328
You two aren't allowed to be together anymore.

202
00:19:04,328 --> 00:19:05,758
You don't want to feed the suspicion.

203
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:08,028
Those cheap bastards.

204
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:11,138
Spreading an absurd rumor like this

205
00:19:11,138 --> 00:19:13,888
probably means they're worried, right?

206
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:16,918
They must be after something else.

207
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:20,308
They're trying to buy time or something.

208
00:19:22,488 --> 00:19:27,988
Mr. Do, did Ma Gang say anything else on his last day?

209
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:36,028
I have a card to defeat...

210
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:40,438
those two bastards at once.

211
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,148
Card, my foot.

212
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,668
Even your minions betrayed you.

213
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:52,328
I'm slowly getting things started. Just watch...

214
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:56,578
those two getting destroyed.

215
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:08,448
A card to destroy the two bastards at once?

(Haejeon Police Station)

217
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,748
So...

218
00:20:29,738 --> 00:20:32,818
a piece of evidence suddenly fell from the sky?

219
00:20:35,018 --> 00:20:37,808
Someone tipped me off anonymously.

220
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:40,388
Isn't it sufficient evidence?

221
00:20:40,388 --> 00:20:42,088
Of course not.

222
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:45,168
The video doesn't show the killing. And...

223
00:20:45,168 --> 00:20:48,458
most importantly, there's no evidence

224
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,318
to prove that the body belonged to Hwang Tae Soo.

225
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,278
Why is that? We just need to compare the DNAs.

226
00:20:56,278 --> 00:20:58,928
There's no Hwang Tae Soo's DNA left.

227
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:00,768
His old house was demolished, and his body was cremated, too.

228
00:21:00,768 --> 00:21:03,078
and his body was cremated, too.

229
00:21:04,548 --> 00:21:10,238
We have no way of knowing who the body and the DNA from the toothbrush belonged to.

230
00:21:10,238 --> 00:21:12,858
How about Hwang Tae Soo's medical records or family?

231
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:14,898
I already looked for them.

232
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,528
Are you interrogating me?

233
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:21,318
Do you still think you're a prosecutor?

234
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:26,048
Thanks for the evidence, anyway.

235
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:56,268
In Gyu! Ms. Go!

(Chawoong Law Firm)

237
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,358
Let's talk.

238
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:19,278
About what?

239
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,138
I said everything in the interview.

240
00:22:22,138 --> 00:22:24,118
About your dismissal.

241
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:30,998
You're dismissing me as soon as you got caught cheating?

242
00:22:30,998 --> 00:22:34,678
Wouldn't it be weird if you stayed here after causing a scene like that?

243
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:37,438
Who do you think started it?

244
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:41,888
You could've asked for a divorce nicely if you didn't love me anymore, but you faked your suicide?

245
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:44,788
- Did you think I'd fall for that?
- You should've.

246
00:22:44,788 --> 00:22:48,508
Then, you could've remained a lawyer at this law firm, at least.

247
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,778
Check the articles of association in the office first.

248
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:54,088
See if you can fire me without my consent or not.

249
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:56,288
Why do you keep trying to go back?

250
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:59,188
My father wanted to dismiss you. Don't you know what kind of man he is?

251
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:03,378
You crapped on my father, not me.

252
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:08,038
Wouldn't he be more humiliated if his son was put away for murder?

253
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:12,008
Mother and Father are just as bad for covering up their son's murder.

254
00:23:12,008 --> 00:23:13,688
What could you possibly get out of this?

255
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:16,988
I see. You want to take it out on your cheating husband? What would satisfy you?

256
00:23:16,988 --> 00:23:19,988
Do you want me to kill myself like your conman father did?

257
00:23:19,988 --> 00:23:21,808
Cha Seong Jae.

258
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:24,288
I've done everything you wanted me to do.

259
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:26,778
I was a good father and a husband.

260
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:30,268
You wouldn't have known about Hwang Tae Soo or my affair if you didn't poke around.

261
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:34,028
So, Moon Yeong, shut up and stay put.

262
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:38,538
Then, you could remain a mother, at least.

263
00:23:53,658 --> 00:23:57,468
Advisor Cha insisted on not letting you in.

264
00:23:57,468 --> 00:24:00,538
Maybe you should give him a call later.

265
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,488
I'm so sorry.

266
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:07,508
Don't trust CEO Cha too much.

267
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:10,038
He's more dangerous than you think.

268
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:19,058
She said you killed someone.

269
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:22,258
How could Attorney Na say that...

270
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:25,388
I suppose she's not totally wrong.

271
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:29,538
It's true I couldn't protect Tae Soo until the end.

272
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:35,028
I should've taken him to the ER, no matter what.

273
00:24:35,498 --> 00:24:37,288
But still, this isn't right.

274
00:24:37,288 --> 00:24:40,648
I heard it was all Ma Gang's doing.

275
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:44,048
I know he was a lowly thug.

276
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:47,378
You must've suffered so much getting involved with someone like that.

277
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:49,588
What will you do now?

278
00:24:50,168 --> 00:24:52,008
I'll correct everything.

279
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:55,088
Stop pretending like you care and prepare for the election.

280
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:58,628
You came all the way here when you said you'd fix things? What if the police come?

281
00:24:58,628 --> 00:25:01,778
I'll go to the police station tomorrow.

282
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:06,988
<i>What's your name?</i>

283
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:09,188
<i>Cha Seong Jae.</i>

284
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:15,628
820314-1822471.

285
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:21,708
I don't understand this at all.

286
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,638
You ran for your life before.

287
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:26,118
But you came in yourself.

288
00:25:26,118 --> 00:25:28,298
I wanted to help you.

289
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:32,408
You need me alive and well to start a transparent investigation.

290
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:39,528
You recognize this place, right?

291
00:25:39,528 --> 00:25:42,818
This is where the body was found.

292
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,808
The time stamp says the video was taken on the day of the incident.

293
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:52,548
So, I think this could be the circumstantial evidence to prove

294
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:55,818
you two kidnapped and killed Hwang Tae Soo.

295
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:57,678
What do you think?

296
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:06,568
Ma Gang was blackmailing me.

297
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:10,228
He said I'd die if I didn't bring him Hwang Tae Soo.

298
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:16,248
So, I took Mr. Hwang there so I could live.

299
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,948
Why would Ma Gang kill Hwang Tae Soo?

300
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:22,828
You'll find out soon, too,

301
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:27,888
but Ma Gang forced me to launder his money using the homeless people's bank accounts.

302
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,278
One of the bank accounts belonged to Mr. Hwang.

303
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:34,318
Maybe it was related to that. I can only assume.

304
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:38,678
Ask Attorney Na Moon Yeong about it. She'll testify for you.

305
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:44,448
It sounds like you laundered money and kidnapped, but you didn't kill.

306
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:47,228
Because I'd be dead otherwise.

307
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:52,988
Mr. Hwang was completely drunk that day.

308
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:57,898
I took him to the cliff where I planned to meet Ma Gang, but Tae Soo started acting drunk.

309
00:26:57,898 --> 00:27:00,688
He used to have bad drinking habits.

310
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:05,238
At the time, I thought it'd be better to get him more drunk and put him to sleep.

311
00:27:05,238 --> 00:27:09,158
So, I had no choice but to end up doing that.

312
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:13,138
What happened to Ms. Park Myeong Hee?

313
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:16,808
Mr. Hwang got to know my mother well through the foundation.

314
00:27:16,808 --> 00:27:23,008
And my mother knew I was being blackmailed. So, I asked her for help.

315
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:27,258
I went home with my mother after handing Mr. Hwang over to Ma Gang.

316
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:29,148
Ma Gang?

317
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,858
How convenient.

318
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:37,548
The dead don't speak.

319
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:40,528
How about...

320
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:43,798
the toothbrush?

321
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:47,658
What happened to the toothbrush? How did your mother submit a toothbrush

322
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:50,528
that matched the DNA from the body?

323
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:53,358
As you already know,

324
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:56,248
my father has many guests over at his house.

325
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:59,918
Many stay there for longer periods, too.

326
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:03,048
I suppose my mother was mistaken.

327
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:07,568
I have no explanation for the mistake and coincidence.

328
00:28:07,568 --> 00:28:12,268
Do you think the court would agree that all of those were coincidences?

329
00:28:12,268 --> 00:28:13,688
You must know since you're a lawyer.

330
00:28:13,688 --> 00:28:17,478
I have no control over coincidences, and the truth will prevail.

331
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:20,148
I want to ask you myself.

332
00:28:20,148 --> 00:28:23,018
Did the body you found belong to Mr. Hwang?

333
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:24,678
Is there evidence for that?

334
00:28:24,678 --> 00:28:28,978
My car and the body are gone. The only proof now is that

335
00:28:28,978 --> 00:28:31,578
I wasn't at the crime scene that night.

336
00:28:31,578 --> 00:28:34,108
I submitted the evidence, didn't I?

337
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:40,778
Would it be okay if I go now?

338
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:49,398
By the way,

339
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:57,218
the body was wearing a wedding ring.

340
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:59,158
What happened with that?

341
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,738
I know.

342
00:29:07,238 --> 00:29:09,708
I'm curious myself.

343
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:12,038
I'm going crazy.

344
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:14,508
Ma Gang made the unidentified body look like mine,

345
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:19,888
made me look like I was stealing Mr. Hwang's identity. I want to ask him why...

346
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:26,988
I didn't know I'd be so upset about his death.

347
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:33,978
You're dismissed.

348
00:29:46,778 --> 00:29:49,018
Hey, let's play together.

349
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,188
Ye Eun.

350
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:54,698
How about we play tag?

351
00:29:54,698 --> 00:29:58,498
<i>You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors!</i>

352
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:06,188
Ye Eun, after school, should we...

353
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:14,228
I'm sorry, Bom.

354
00:30:14,228 --> 00:30:17,478
My mom told me not to play with you.

355
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,698
Hey.

356
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:40,358
Yes.

357
00:30:40,358 --> 00:30:41,368
Yes.

358
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:46,918
I'd like to know why you're not requesting a warrant regarding the arrest.

359
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:49,538
The prosecutor's name is...

360
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:53,098
Yes. Okay, got it.

361
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:11,308
We'll find out how severely CEO Cha will be disciplined after the trial results come out.

362
00:31:11,308 --> 00:31:15,038
I'm looking through the explanatory materials at the Attorneys Disciplinary Committee.

363
00:31:16,968 --> 00:31:20,738
How about restoring the identity of CEO Cha? How's that going?

364
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:27,588
I can't believe I'm asking you about my husband.

365
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,048
The request to amend the Family Relations Registry was submitted.

366
00:31:33,048 --> 00:31:35,388
We'll hear back soon.

367
00:31:35,388 --> 00:31:37,788
- But is that-
- Moon Yeong,

368
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:40,688
why are you taking things so far?

369
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:45,998
Yes, CEO Cha did the wrong thing, but to be honest, I'm a bit...

370
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:48,118
angry.

371
00:31:48,118 --> 00:31:53,188
I still remember what you were like when you first moved to Haejeon.

372
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:59,218
After your father passed, the debt collectors even threatened you when you were just a kid.

373
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:04,458
What would you have done without CEO Cha and Advisor Cha's help?

374
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:16,088
I know money is important, but how could they do that to an orphan?

375
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,078
Don't worry.

376
00:32:21,078 --> 00:32:23,148
We can take care of it.

377
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,548
I know.

378
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:37,138
But how could you do that?

379
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:40,788
Don't you know what kind of people they are better than anyone?

380
00:32:42,178 --> 00:32:44,768
I thought I knew them well,

381
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,408
but I was wrong.

382
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:56,748
I'll get going if that's everything.

383
00:33:10,408 --> 00:33:13,028
(Bom's Academy)

384
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:15,848
Yes, ma'am.

385
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:23,628
<i>Bom didn't come to the academy today.</i>

386
00:33:27,818 --> 00:33:30,128
- Is it good?
- Yes.

387
00:33:41,248 --> 00:33:44,528
Gosh, it's a bit too salty for you.

388
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:47,338
No, it's so tasty.

389
00:33:47,338 --> 00:33:50,628
It's tasty because you're playing hooky, right?

390
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:52,088
Yes.

391
00:33:57,948 --> 00:34:00,698
- What?
- Is it okay for you to be here?

392
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:03,908
The bad men aren't supposed to know about it.

393
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:09,688
They can't know about you playing hooky, either.

394
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,568
Bom,

395
00:34:17,518 --> 00:34:21,038
don't the kids at school talk about Mom and me?

396
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:30,988
To be honest, I don't want to go to school.

397
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:35,408
Should we live somewhere far away, then?

398
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:36,778
What?

399
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:47,208
Wouldn't it be fun to go to school here?

400
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,208
Where's this?

401
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:52,468
It's a bit far. You need to take an airplane.

402
00:34:52,468 --> 00:34:57,608
But if you go to school here, no one would bother you about Mom and me,

403
00:34:57,608 --> 00:35:00,348
you'd make many foreign friends,

404
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:04,538
and you'll eat a lot of burgers with Grandma, too.

405
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:09,058
Are Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Grandpa all going?

406
00:35:09,058 --> 00:35:12,638
Let me try talking to them. Instead, don't tell-

407
00:35:12,638 --> 00:35:15,238
Huh? Mom!

408
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:18,708
Get up, Bom.

409
00:35:20,148 --> 00:35:22,738
Mom, the thing is, Dad-

410
00:35:22,738 --> 00:35:24,328
Cha Bom.

411
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:31,158
It's okay, Bom.

412
00:35:31,158 --> 00:35:33,298
Mom is worried about you.

413
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,948
Have a seat. Would you like something to eat?

414
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:42,478
Don't ever take her away without my permission.

415
00:35:42,478 --> 00:35:44,758
She doesn't want to go to school. Did you know?

416
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:47,418
You should've thought things through before releasing the scandal.

417
00:35:47,418 --> 00:35:51,158
You're the one who stirred the pot and made us the talk of the town first.

418
00:35:51,158 --> 00:35:53,838
At least I didn't come up with a lie like you.

419
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:57,428
I'm fixing things, and you're poking around things.

420
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:00,188
Think about who's making things harder for Bom.

421
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:03,508
Think about whether you qualify as a father first.

422
00:36:25,848 --> 00:36:28,648
Bom. Cha Bom!

423
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,728
Hey, you.

424
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:44,018
Aren't you Attorney Cha's wife?

425
00:36:44,018 --> 00:36:47,908
Sir, are you feeling better today?

426
00:36:47,908 --> 00:36:49,948
It's you.

427
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:55,398
How come I'm not hearing from the legal department and my eldest son?

428
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:58,388
Well, could you please-

429
00:36:58,388 --> 00:36:59,938
Chairman.

430
00:36:59,938 --> 00:37:01,418
Yes.

431
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:09,918
Hey, Yeon Joo, why can't I reach the legal department and my eldest son?

432
00:37:09,918 --> 00:37:13,198
Chairman, you're in a good mood today.

433
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,288
Yes.

434
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:17,388
- It's time to take your medicine.
- Oh, really?

435
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:30,988
Let's eat first.

436
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:34,278
I'll try contacting them afterward.

437
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,668
(Geumshin Corporation's chairman)

438
00:37:56,158 --> 00:38:00,668
(Geumshin Corporation's former chairman)

439
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:07,118
(Geumshin Corporation's honorary chairman, Choi Moo Won's health worsened)

440
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,398
(Hospitalized for a checkup)

441
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:22,488
This is Choi Moo Won, the honorary chairman?

442
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:25,128
Geumshin's former chairman lives next door to yours?

443
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:27,378
I didn't recognize him at first, either.

444
00:38:27,378 --> 00:38:29,628
If the man who lives with Ha Yeon Joo was the chairman.

445
00:38:29,628 --> 00:38:32,648
What's their relationship? She can't be his daughter.

446
00:38:32,648 --> 00:38:36,518
The public record says he only has three sons.

447
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:38,618
Is she his mistress?

448
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:43,358
Why would she drag Cha Seong Jae in if she was the honorary chairman's mistress?

449
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,228
Most importantly, he doesn't seem to be in good health.

450
00:38:47,228 --> 00:38:49,958
He doesn't seem to recognize people well, either.

451
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,568
But sometimes, he looks totally lucid.

452
00:38:53,568 --> 00:38:55,288
Is it a soap opera or what?

453
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:59,748
A mistress is controlling the senile honorary chairman behind his back or something?

454
00:38:59,748 --> 00:39:02,888
Cha Seong Jae must have an ulterior motive.

455
00:39:02,888 --> 00:39:04,418
Isn't it weird?

456
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:08,218
If Cha Seong Jae was involved with Ha Yeon Joo,

457
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:11,948
I don't think he would've run away using Tae Soo.

458
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:17,098
The Cha Seong Jae I know wouldn't give up on everything for love.

459
00:39:17,098 --> 00:39:18,328
What else, then?

460
00:39:18,328 --> 00:39:20,448
Probably money.

461
00:39:20,448 --> 00:39:23,098
That's what Cha Seong Jae and Ha Yeon Joo are after.

462
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:28,808
He'll be indicted soon, yet he's confident.

463
00:39:29,808 --> 00:39:31,828
There must be a reason for it.

464
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:43,628
Did you finally get to have a good time with your family?

465
00:39:43,628 --> 00:39:45,238
Family?

466
00:39:47,148 --> 00:39:49,488
Can you call us that now?

467
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:52,308
Not Na Moon Yeong.

468
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:54,678
I meant Bom.

469
00:39:54,678 --> 00:39:58,828
Once you leave your spouse, you become strangers,

470
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:02,068
but parents and children are bonded by fate.

471
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:06,038
Could you go on not seeing her?

472
00:40:12,268 --> 00:40:17,288
You know we need to deposit, get approved, transfer, and leave the country in a day, right?

473
00:40:17,288 --> 00:40:21,248
If Chairman Choi's sons find out before we leave...

474
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,888
I never leave any traces.

475
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:29,498
You make sure not to make any mistakes.

476
00:40:38,768 --> 00:40:40,628
Okay, look.

477
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:44,968
When the bank approves the loan,

478
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:48,968
the entire amount will be deposited into Geumshin Corporation's business account
(Loan Agreement)

479
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:52,198
and transfer the money to the account belonging to the paper company

480
00:40:52,198 --> 00:40:54,468
purchased under Hwang Tae Soo's name.

481
00:40:54,468 --> 00:41:01,018
Of course, it will be a normal transaction approved by the old man.

482
00:41:01,018 --> 00:41:06,578
We'll go to Zurich, take out the 80 billion, and we're done.

483
00:41:09,448 --> 00:41:11,828
How about the necessary documents for the withdrawal?

484
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:15,328
Seok Goo will prepare them in time.

485
00:41:15,328 --> 00:41:17,238
Don't worry.

486
00:41:33,098 --> 00:41:35,878
Chairman Choi's eldest son, Choi Ho Shik, is the CEO.

487
00:41:35,878 --> 00:41:39,618
This is the second eldest son, and this is his wife.

488
00:41:39,618 --> 00:41:43,008
All of Choi Moo Won's family took the important positions.

489
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:46,218
How are they planning to steal the company's money?

490
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:48,578
Haean Village.

491
00:41:48,578 --> 00:41:52,068
That's right. It's Haean Village.

492
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:55,708
Haean Village's initial business fund will come in soon.

493
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:58,468
- How much is it?
- Hold on.

494
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,328
Eighty billion won.

495
00:42:00,328 --> 00:42:01,688
What?

496
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:06,298
What?

497
00:42:06,298 --> 00:42:08,338
Is everything over tens of billions now?

498
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:10,758
Do they think this is a joke...

499
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:13,768
You mean Ha Yeon Joo is stealing all the money?

500
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:15,548
Chairman Choi.

501
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:19,728
He said he couldn't reach his eldest son yesterday.

502
00:42:19,728 --> 00:42:22,968
Eldest son? Choi Ho Shik?

503
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:27,788
Looks like Choi Ho Shik was foiled by...

504
00:42:27,788 --> 00:42:29,568
Ha Yeon Joo, too.

505
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,308
Looks like white is winning today.

506
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:46,858
It's time to get a shot.

507
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:33,268
(Contract fee: 80 billion won)

508
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:36,178
(Geumshin Corporation, CEO: Choi Ho Shik)

509
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:48,288
You really aren't going to school?

510
00:43:48,288 --> 00:43:49,718
Where's Dad?

511
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:51,958
When is he coming back?

512
00:43:51,958 --> 00:43:54,518
I want Dad to drive me.

513
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:56,838
I told you he can't come.

514
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,738
It's your fault.

515
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,878
I know everything, too.

516
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:03,488
Cha Bom.

517
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:08,218
I don't want to go to school.

518
00:44:09,408 --> 00:44:12,378
I'll go with Dad.

519
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:28,098
Did Dad say he was going somewhere?

520
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:36,278
You're coming, too, right?

521
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:41,828
Departure inquiry?

522
00:44:41,828 --> 00:44:43,348
Who?

523
00:44:47,698 --> 00:44:48,808
(Statement)

524
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:08,928
Did Cha Seong Jae check the confirmation record?

525
00:45:08,928 --> 00:45:11,998
Yes, he said he'll wait at home.

526
00:45:13,908 --> 00:45:15,518
Let's go.

527
00:45:16,478 --> 00:45:18,768
We can't make him wait.

528
00:45:18,768 --> 00:45:21,608
He's about to do something important.

529
00:45:22,948 --> 00:45:25,548

Wouldn't it be better to leave together

530
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:29,008
and take care of things in Switzerland first?

531
00:45:29,008 --> 00:45:30,308
If something goes wrong-

532
00:45:30,308 --> 00:45:32,488
How many times did I tell you?

533
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:36,228
That's not what's important.

534
00:45:37,208 --> 00:45:38,548
Yes.

535
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,138
I'll take a boat from Haejeon Port to Tianjin.

536
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:05,658
I'll take a flight from Beijing to Zurich, and it's done.

537
00:46:06,698 --> 00:46:08,558
Aren't you coming with me?

538
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:11,468
There's no need to look suspicious traveling together.

539
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,778
Let's meet up in Zurich.

Both of our signatures are required to withdraw from that account.

542
00:46:27,888 --> 00:46:30,068
By chance, are you...

543
00:46:31,698 --> 00:46:33,708
doubting me right now?

544
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:39,968
If this goes wrong, I'll be the one who becomes the traitor.

545
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:45,068
And I'm the one who'd die if we get caught, too.

546
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:49,558
I'm not doubting. I'm worried.

547
00:46:53,638 --> 00:46:57,388
Like you said, you'd be dead if we got caught.

Yes, I'm almost there.

You've been working hard,

Mr. Cha Seong Jae.

<i>Why are you talking like we won't see each other?</i>

575
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:27,208
Because we aren't supposed to know each other once we get to Haejeon Port.

What was he preparing for?

583
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:31,448
Why did they go as far as killing someone in a detention center?

584
00:50:35,938 --> 00:50:38,308
Ma Gang had a card.

585
00:50:38,308 --> 00:50:42,648
And you're the only one who knows about the card.

586

You're the last person who met Ma Gang on paper, too.

587

I told you everything I heard from Ma Gang.

588
00:50:53,238 --> 00:50:56,438
It doesn't matter. It's a bait, anyway.

589
00:51:10,528 --> 00:51:12,488
Nice to meet you.

I heard it in person the last time I visited Chief Ma in jail.

593
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:41,248
He said CEO Choi Woo Shik lost perspective.

594
00:51:41,248 --> 00:51:45,388
He said he was trembling in fear without realizing his father had become a puppet.

595
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:48,558
He doesn't know Director Joo is stealing their money, either.

596
00:51:48,558 --> 00:51:54,088
Chief Ma said he'd take all the money Director Joo embezzled.

597
00:51:54,088 --> 00:51:58,458
Will you not do anything about Ha Yeon Joo?

599
00:52:30,778 --> 00:52:32,488
Should I help you carry the bag?

600
00:52:33,768 --> 00:52:35,328
Forget it, then.

601
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:49,458
It's time. Should we get going?

602
00:53:03,678 --> 00:53:05,388
Are you okay, Chief Yoon?

603
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:15,368
Yes.

604
00:53:16,418 --> 00:53:18,298
Yes, got it.

605
00:53:21,778 --> 00:53:24,078
You can't leave the country as Hwang Tae Soo.

606
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:26,008
You were banned from leaving the country.

607
00:53:26,008 --> 00:53:28,588
What are you talking about? I got the ticket just fine.

608
00:53:28,588 --> 00:53:30,438
You'll get stopped at the gate.

609
00:53:30,438 --> 00:53:32,428
It was an emergency ban, so...

610
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,458
Find out if they printed a ticket for Hwang Tae Soo.

611
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:50,728
Okay.

612
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,898
And you, ask those officers for additional support.

613
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,908
You two should search every restroom.

614
00:53:55,908 --> 00:53:57,448
Find out how many and search them all.

615
00:53:57,448 --> 00:53:59,258
- You should follow me.
- Yes, sir.

616
00:54:00,888 --> 00:54:06,038
(Witness Testimony)
So, are you telling me Hwang Tae Soo is the one who shot Do Jin Woo?

617
00:54:06,038 --> 00:54:08,958
Yes, I'm the witness. I definitely saw it.

618
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:12,148
That would mean Cha Seong Jae didn't kill anyone.

619
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,568
I thought you wanted to get Cha Seong Jae.

620
00:54:13,568 --> 00:54:15,328
That's why I'm telling you.

621
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:17,088
Cha Seong Jae is an attorney.

622
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,978
He managed to avoid being charged

623
00:54:18,978 --> 00:54:22,538
because of the lack of physical evidence to prove his countless crimes.

624
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:23,888
What are you suggesting, then?

625
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:27,048
Cha Seong Jae is attempting to leave the country as Hwang Tae Soo now.

626
00:54:27,048 --> 00:54:29,408
It'd be over once he leaves the country.

627
00:54:30,638 --> 00:54:32,298
I see.

628
00:54:32,298 --> 00:54:36,758
So, if we arrest Hwang Tae Soo, we'll end up with Cha Seong Jae.

629
00:54:36,758 --> 00:54:38,808
Hwang Tae Soo's passport with Cha Seong Jae's photo on it.

630
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,548
Is there more conclusive evidence than that?

631
00:54:44,588 --> 00:54:49,188
We'll have to put a travel ban on him first. Let's get going.

632
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:01,708
Looks like the police are after Cha Seong Jae.

633
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,708
Yes, I have the briefcase...

634
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:16,578
We have a problem, Director.

635
00:55:16,578 --> 00:55:18,558
The briefcase was switched.

636
00:55:39,728 --> 00:55:41,658
Cha Seong Jae.

637
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:49,418
Let's go.

638
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:24,918
Director Ha Yeon Joo.

639
00:56:37,748 --> 00:56:39,338
Cha Seong Jae!

640
00:56:53,428 --> 00:56:54,868
Ms. Ha Yeon Joo,

641
00:56:54,868 --> 00:56:59,708
you're under arrest for violating the Aggravated Punishment for Financial Crimes Act.

642
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:08,788
You have the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.

643
00:57:08,788 --> 00:57:12,538
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

644
00:58:05,778 --> 00:58:07,638
