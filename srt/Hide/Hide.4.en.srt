00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:04,098
(Park Ji Il / Nam Gi Ae / Kim Sang Ho / Kim Gook Hee)

3
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:16,168
(Hide)

4
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:20,528
(Episode 4)

5
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:24,008
You were alive.

6
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:36,708
Moon Yeong.

7
00:00:48,818 --> 00:00:51,128
How could you...

8
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:57,668
How could you do this to Bom and me?

9
00:00:58,748 --> 00:01:00,418
She's still looking for you.

10
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:02,788
She looks for her dad every night.

11
00:01:02,788 --> 00:01:05,528
How could you... How could you...

12
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:10,548
How could you do this, you bastard?

13
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:15,158
How could you...

14
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:40,688
If you're here,

15
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:44,288
what was the body I saw?

16
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,888
Did you kill someone? Hwang Tae Soo?

17
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,388
No.

18
00:01:53,178 --> 00:01:55,058
Explain.

19
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:59,368
If I'm not convinced, I'll take you to the police station immediately.

20
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:15,948
(Chief Ma Gang)

21
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:24,388
Tae Soo, are you okay?

22
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:27,498
Hang in there, Tae Soo.

23
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,988
Tae Soo.

24
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,508
Tae Soo, are you okay?

25
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:44,018
Wake up. Tae Soo!

26
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:45,908
Tae Soo!

27
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,428
So, Hwang Tae Soo...

28
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:54,808
died before he got to the hospital?

29
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,308
It was alcohol poisoning.

30
00:02:58,238 --> 00:03:01,448
He has had respiratory paralysis occasionally.

31
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,558
Check his medical records.

32
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,818
His doctor warned him a long time ago, but he refused to be treated.

33
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:10,658
I tried to force him to go to the hospital that day-

34
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,558
How could I kill someone, Moon Yeong?

35
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:16,768
You did need a body to replace you.

36
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,468
- You're still insisting you're innocent?
 - Moon Yeong.

37
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:23,588
You hid and destroyed a corpse...

38
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:28,598
Is that why you tried to kill Mr. Do, too?

39
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,408
So, you don't get caught for what you did to Hwang Tae Soo?

40
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:34,108
Moon Yeong, you've known me for over 20 years. You think I'd do that?

41
00:03:34,108 --> 00:03:36,288
Why did you shoot him then?

42
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:38,058
Moon Yeong, listen to me.

43
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:41,278
I'm certain Mr. Do got shot. I heard the gunshot, too.

44
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:43,478
Don't trust Jin Woo.

45
00:03:43,478 --> 00:03:45,158
What?

46
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,808
Do Jin Woo was blackmailing me.

47
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:53,288
Blackmail?

48
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:56,178
Careful. Careful.

49
00:03:56,178 --> 00:04:00,708
What would he have done without you?

50
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:05,118
Thank you. You can go now.

51
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:06,768
Hyung.

52
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:14,818
In the courtroom tomorrow, I just need to say I saw it, right?

53
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:18,508
Is it okay to lie in front of the judge?

54
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:24,288
You won't be lying. You'll be helping an innocent person like you.

55
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:27,198
I'm counting on you.

56
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,928
Hyung.

57
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:36,628
How about the money? It's guaranteed, right?

58
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:40,958
I'll send it right away.

59
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:45,628
<i>I promised to pay him 200 million for committing perjury, but I didn't get to pay him the rest.</i>

60
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:51,078
Then, he ended up learning I was alive, and he used that to demand more money.

61
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:55,758
He was the one who showed up with a gun when I said no.

62
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:58,558
He pointed the gun at me and shot me.

63
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:01,118
That makes no sense.

64
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:02,948
Mr. Do is the one who got shot.

65
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:06,378
I attacked him because I would've gotten killed otherwise.

66
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:10,248
<i>And he got shot by accident while we were wrestling.</i>

67
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,778
I took his gun and fired a warning shot. Then, he ran away.

68
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,698
I had nothing to lose then, too.

69
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:23,188
It was to defend myself, not to shoot him.

70
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,798
And when I heard your voice, I ran away.

71
00:05:25,798 --> 00:05:28,968
That's all that happened that night.

72
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:34,668
I didn't know he'd go that far, either.

73
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,978
But did that asshole come to you, too?

74
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:39,728
He didn't even mention your name while being investigated.

75
00:05:39,728 --> 00:05:42,198
That's the only way he could get paid.

76
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:44,448
He needed to threaten me to get money.

77
00:05:44,448 --> 00:05:47,438
Why would he tell the police that I'm alive?

78
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:50,618
Okay.

79
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:53,728
Let's say you're right. But...

80
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:57,608
you suborned perjury, switched victims, laundered money,

81
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,178
and even disposed of a corpse.

82
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:04,588
Are you the Cha Seong Jae I know?

83
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:07,368
Are you Bom's dad?

84
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,868
You were all I had.

85
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:12,738
You were my only ally, and if you die like that-

86
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:15,598
That's why I died. That's why.

87
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:18,218
The Cha Seong Jae you've known is gone.

88
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:20,318
By the time I realized,

89
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:23,498
I had turned into someone who deserved to die.

90
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:32,698
I didn't plan this from the start.

91
00:06:32,698 --> 00:06:35,668
<i>Why run a charity that's in deficit?</i>

92
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:38,038
Look at Haean Village, where we spent all the government funding.

93
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:39,618
It's like pouring water in a broken pot.

94
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:43,968
And the law firm will go out of business if we keep spending its profit on the foundation.

95
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,138
How did you run the business for you to say that?

96
00:06:46,138 --> 00:06:48,638
The problem is the unreasonable management of the foundation.

97
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:53,158
When I was in charge, the law firm had no issues while running the foundation.

98
00:06:53,158 --> 00:06:55,218
Things have changed since then.

99
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:57,738
Don't make excuses.

100
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:03,078
Tell me now if you're not confident. I'll take it back from you.

101
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:06,368
It's not that I'm not confident...

102
00:07:12,318 --> 00:07:14,408
<i>I had to deal with the urgent issue first.</i>

103
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:16,388
<i>I couldn't let the law firm go bankrupt.</i>

104
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:17,788
Thank you.

105
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:19,768
Cheer up, CEO Cha.

106
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:22,278
<i>- I thought...</i>
 - Don't worry.

107
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:27,548
<i>I just needed to do Chief Ma a small favor once, but...</i>

108
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,358
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,548
- I didn't know this would happen. I'm sorry.
<i>- Ma Gang...</i>

110
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:45,258
<i>would never let it go once he had something on you until one of us died.</i>

111
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:48,268
That's why I didn't pay off the law firm's debt.

112
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,178
What?

113
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:55,468
Because if I did, I'd get caught having taken Ma Gang's money.

114
00:07:57,308 --> 00:08:00,218
All of the 6.5 billion is untouched, minus the 5 million I gave you.

115
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:03,878
You would've been in greater danger if I gave you the entire 7 billion.

116
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:07,018
What about the insurance?

117
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,478
What about the life insurance payments...

118
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,258
Oh, yeah, that...

119
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,658
If something went wrong, Ma Gang was going to make it

120
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:19,178
look like an accident to get the insurance payout. So, he forced me to sign up.

121
00:08:19,178 --> 00:08:20,898
So...

122
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:27,698
you sent the suicide note so he doesn't get the insurance payout?

123
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:31,318
I didn't want to be controlled by him anymore.

124
00:08:31,318 --> 00:08:34,928
Did you think everything would be fine if you just died?

125
00:08:42,608 --> 00:08:45,508
(Ma Gang's Second Phone)
Every day is hell for me. No...

126
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,398
not just for me but for Bom and Father, too.

127
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,868
But not Mother.

128
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:53,538
Because she was in on it with you.

129
00:08:53,538 --> 00:08:55,868
How did Mother get involved?

130
00:09:00,118 --> 00:09:03,808
It was too difficult to take Hwang Tae Soo to the ER alone.

131
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:06,158
You weren't home then.

132
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:10,028
So, I asked Mom to babysit Bom.

133
00:09:10,028 --> 00:09:13,978
I told her it was a minor accident, but she didn't believe me when she saw the mess I was in.

134
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:17,028
All she did was do what I told her to do.

135
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,778
Don't worry, Moon Yeong.

136
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:26,088
I'll make sure to protect my family.

137
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,248
You faked your suicide and hid. How?

138
00:09:29,248 --> 00:09:33,178
What's next? Will you kill Ma Gang now?

139
00:09:35,878 --> 00:09:38,298
It's not necessary to pay him back.

140
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,558
There's no evidence that he entrusted me with 7 billion.

141
00:09:43,558 --> 00:09:46,528
Since he touched the company money any way he wanted,

142
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:49,318
he can't even tell the company or the police.

143
00:09:49,318 --> 00:09:54,498
He's the one who will go down first if he tries to do something.

144
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:01,228
Even if he embezzled that money from the company,

145
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:03,608
what gives you the right to take it?

146
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,908
Do you think...

147
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:11,028
all of this would end if I paid Ma Gang back?

148
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,308
You asked me why I suborned perjury, switched victims, and laundered money, right?

149
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:16,138
Do you think I wanted to?

150
00:10:16,138 --> 00:10:20,328
Yes. I've committed small crimes thinking it'd be okay and turned a blind eye,

151
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:25,078
but things got worse and worse because of that, and I got blackmailed.

152
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:27,428
I won't be free from Ma Gang even if I pay him back.

153
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:30,848
Seven billion will become 10 billion, and 10 billion will become 20 billion overnight.

154
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:34,528
That's why he keeps clinging to us and ordering us around.

155
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:40,378
We can't be free from him because of what the Chawoong Law Firm has done.

156
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:42,898
What will you do now, then?

157
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:45,688
Will you fake your death for the rest of your life?

158
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,048
Yes.

159
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:52,738
I prefer to fake my death than forcing you and Bom out on the streets.

160
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:56,548
You know what would happen if we keep getting dragged around like this.

161
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:02,398
No.

162
00:11:03,058 --> 00:11:04,698
No.

163
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,298
You're not the Cha Seong Jae I know.

164
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:12,078
You have no interest in taking a step closer to me.

165
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,998
That's why I didn't know your secret as your wife, which even Mother knew about.

166
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:18,468
Hold on, Moon Yeong. Listen to me.

167
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:20,868
- Let go, you son of a bitch!
- Listen to me first!

168
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:23,748
- Let go! Let go!
- Please.

169
00:11:33,038 --> 00:11:35,528
You drink every day and make loud noises.

170
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,408
<i>Now you bring in a woman and fight?</i>

171
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:41,068
<i>Let us live, too. Let us live, please?</i>

172
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:44,798
Why is he ignoring me? I'm talking...

173
00:12:55,638 --> 00:12:58,528
Why didn't you do anything? You should've yelled.

174
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,188
You want to believe me, too.

175
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:07,678
Right?

176
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,938
That's why I'm about to go crazy. That's why.

177
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:41,188
This will be the weapon to protect you and Bom from Ma Gang.

178
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:49,008
I had that in my hands, but I couldn't use it.

179
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:01,888
I'm sorry, Moon Yeong.

180
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:04,838
I'll live as Hwang Tae Soo.

181
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:11,688
I'll be dead to protect you and Bom.

182
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:16,588
So, you never saw me, okay?

183
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:19,338
<i>I need to die...</i>

184
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:21,808
Because I'm dead.

185
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:24,848
<i>for you to survive.</i>

186
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:58,298
(Hide)

187
00:15:02,338 --> 00:15:03,178
(Log in)

188
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:05,448
(Checking Current Account)

189
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,778
(Do Jin Woo - 30 million won)

190
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:15,438
He actually sent it.

191
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,998
(1 Unread Message)

192
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:05,808
You did a good job preparing. Good job.

193
00:16:05,808 --> 00:16:08,158
Well done.

194
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:11,418
I should've let you take charge from the beginning.

195
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,958
Father,

196
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:18,878
our law firm was jeopardized because of the foundation.

197
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:22,088
Too much money is being spent on the foundation.

198
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:42,148
How do you think the Chawoong Law Firm established itself in a rural area like this?

199
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:46,278
Without the support from the foundation, which solely focused on charity work,

200
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:48,928
it would've been impossible.

201
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:50,008
But still-

202
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:55,528
Do you think I started the foundation and ran the law firm just to make money?

203
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:59,198
Reputation doesn't get built in a day.

204
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,788
I think survival is more important than reputation right now.

205
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:09,738
Haean Village Project is being criticized for only benefitting the corporation.

206
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:13,738
I'm being awarded by the Ministry of Health and Welfare next month.

207
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:16,738
Don't you know what that represents?

208
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:21,668
No one has ever been awarded by a minister in a place like Haejeon City.

209
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:25,248
But if the public hears about the law firm's debt,

210
00:17:25,248 --> 00:17:27,188
not only would it hurt the foundation's reputation,

211
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:30,678
even the award might get rescinded, too.

212
00:17:33,288 --> 00:17:38,318
Is it because of Haejeon's mayoral election next year?

213
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:41,418
Some of the funds must've been used to secure the nomination.

214
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:44,098
- Moon Yeong.
- My husband died.

215
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:47,068
While you're being awarded and protecting your reputation,

216
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:50,128
Seong Jae had to endure pain.

217
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,578
I'll separate the law firm and the foundation.

218
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,048
It's my foundation and law firm.

219
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,918
You cannot do as you please.

220
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:59,388
No.

221
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:02,428
I'm the CEO of the law firm.

222
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:06,718
I'm not interested in sacrificing our law firm to get you

223
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,978
nominated as Haejeon's mayor.

224
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,918
(Do Jin Woo)

225
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,878
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected to...</i>

226
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:43,568
What? Na Moon Yeong gave up on the insurance payout?

227
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:46,698
No, man. It's 100% an insurance fraud.

228
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:49,068
Meet the insurance investigator, make a deal with him, and ask aggressively.

229
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:51,338
I'm sure you'll get something out of him.

230
00:18:52,028 --> 00:18:55,468
Man, you've only got three years on you. How dare you dismiss my 30 years of experience?

231
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,228
Hey, man, if only my wife were still alive, I would've...

232
00:18:59,228 --> 00:19:01,048
It's Do Jin Woo.

233
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:05,548
Wow. Hey, hang up now.

234
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:10,488
Wow. I couldn't find him when I was looking for him.

235
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,818
I'm glad I ran into you, Detective.

236
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:21,588
Pardon?

237
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,018
Why?

238
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:24,938
I'll testify.

239
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:27,568
I remembered who shot me.

240
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:31,618
- Pardon?
 - Hwang Tae Soo.

241
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:34,088
It was a man named Hwang Tae Soo.

242
00:19:42,688 --> 00:19:44,948
The one who shot me.

243
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:47,428
It was him. Hwang Tae Soo.

244
00:19:49,508 --> 00:19:51,858
You must've been very close.

245
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,158
You know his ID number, too.

246
00:19:55,748 --> 00:19:58,218
You said you couldn't identify him.

247
00:20:00,358 --> 00:20:03,388
I didn't realize it because it was dark,

248
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:07,468
but thinking about it now, I realized it was Tae Soo.

249
00:20:16,188 --> 00:20:20,878
Hwang Tae Soo.

250
00:20:25,908 --> 00:20:28,878
You reported him as a runaway recently, too.

251
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:36,278
You were close enough to report him missing. Why do you think Mr. Hwang shot you?

252
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,118
I don't know.

253
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:41,838
I'm asking you to find him to figure that out.

254
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,138
Tell me again in detail.

255
00:20:49,138 --> 00:20:53,538
About what happened during the incident and who Hwang Tae Soo is.

256
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:00,858
<i>It is Hwang Tae Soo's address.</i>

257
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:02,938
<i>He was a beneficiary of the Chawoong Foundation's housing project.</i>

258
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:06,008
<i>The place is usually empty because it's temporary housing for people like him.</i>

259
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:08,348
<i>People are upset about Geumshin's resort development.</i>

260
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:11,368
How about Mr. Hwang's phone number that Mr. Do provided?

261
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:13,528
<i>It's powered off.</i>

262
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:16,778
Okay. Keep calling.

263
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:18,738
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

264
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,538
Geez, what a rough neighborhood.

265
00:21:35,918 --> 00:21:39,488
There's no sign of electricity usage this month.

266
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:42,218
It says the tenant is missing.

267
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:45,668
But the utility bills have been paid on time.

268
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:48,078
Isn't it weird?

269
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:50,468
As if someone's managing it.

270
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:57,458
What's going on now?

271
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:03,748
Geez, they were fighting a lot.

272
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:05,148
Did something happen?

273
00:22:05,148 --> 00:22:06,408
Someone was fighting?

274
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:11,488
The man who lives here was freaking out with a woman.

275
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:13,198
A woman?

276
00:22:14,378 --> 00:22:16,348
When did they have a fight?

277
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,578
Was it yesterday or the day before?

278
00:22:18,578 --> 00:22:22,748
I thought he left because he's been quiet lately. But he's flipping out again.

279
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:26,108
The neighborhood never can be in peace.

280
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:28,928
Sounds like there have been a lot of issues.

281
00:22:28,928 --> 00:22:31,758
It hasn't always been like that.

282
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,348
It started once these people moved in.

283
00:23:14,678 --> 00:23:16,608
Bom.

284
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:19,408
What are you doing right now?

285
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:23,058
I mean, she was crying a lot.

286
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:25,828
Why are you crying, Bom? What did he say to you?

287
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:28,418
Mom.

288
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:33,208
Will you leave me behind and go somewhere, too?

289
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,748
What?

290
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:42,598
Some man just told me you'll be gone after four days.

291
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:48,858
Are you abandoning me and going somewhere like Dad?

292
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,798
Is that true?

293
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:52,778
What do you mean...

294
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:08,068
I'm sorry.

295
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:11,668
Bom.

296
00:24:12,678 --> 00:24:16,478
I'm not going anywhere. Go inside.

297
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:18,298
No...

298
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,698
That will never happen. So go inside.

299
00:24:24,678 --> 00:24:26,818
I'm not going anywhere.

300
00:24:40,538 --> 00:24:42,718
Why did you ignore my calls?

301
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:45,848
Cha Seong Jae.

302
00:24:46,448 --> 00:24:47,918
You met him, right?

303
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:51,308
No, I didn't.

304
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,618
I told the police.

305
00:24:57,218 --> 00:25:00,778
That Hwang Tae Soo was the one who shot me.

306
00:25:01,648 --> 00:25:04,088
You'll find out soon.

307
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:08,798
See if the police find Cha Seong Jae or Hwang Tae Soo.

308
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,838
- Mr. Do.
 - Be careful.

309
00:25:11,838 --> 00:25:15,378
I think you might cross paths with the Detective often now.

310
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:21,118
Chief Ma Gang's hunting buddies...

311
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:24,938
Seong Jae wasn't the only one.

312
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:40,638
I said Cha Seong Jae used to go hunting.

313
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:43,398
I never said he was the only one.

314
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:48,648
The gun that shot you.

315
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,878
Was it yours?

316
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:56,538
Do you need my answer?

317
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,848
If I did answer,

318
00:26:04,008 --> 00:26:06,078
would you even believe me?

319
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:43,528
(Ma Gang's Second Phone)

320
00:26:43,528 --> 00:26:45,809
(See you tomorrow. I'll meet you in front of the school.)

321
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:56,068
<i>Aigoo, I can't believe you called me.</i>

322
00:26:56,068 --> 00:26:59,628
I said you'll pay for it if you mess with my daughter again.

323
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:03,368
You're the one who'll pay.

324
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:05,858
Any luck getting the money ready?

325
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,448
You have four days left now.

326
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,058
<i>I never agreed to-</i>

327
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:11,968
Shut up.

328
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:16,568
I'll ask you nicely only for a few more days.

329
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:19,948
You know what will happen next, right?

330
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:23,418
Fine.

331
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:25,668
See you in four days.

332
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:30,418
I'll have the answer you want to hear, then.

333
00:27:54,878 --> 00:27:56,278
Mother,

334
00:27:57,018 --> 00:28:00,358
I'll pretend Seong Jae is dead for now.

335
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:08,558
I'm glad you're doing this. We should've sued Ma Gang sooner.

336
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:10,338
What will you sue him for?

337
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:15,078
Blackmailing, trespassing, theft, and stalking.

338
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,308
(I definitely warned you)

339
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,738
This bastard.

340
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:26,408
Is Bom okay?

341
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:28,848
I won't send her to school or the academy for now.

342
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:31,728
Gosh, those thugs.

343
00:28:32,898 --> 00:28:34,508
Are these all the texts he sent?

344
00:28:34,508 --> 00:28:35,908
Yes.

345
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:38,958
He must've used a burner phone.

346
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:41,978
I'm sure he'll deny sending them.

347
00:28:41,978 --> 00:28:44,358
He entered your house using the passcode?

348
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:46,768
How did he find out the passcode?

349
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:50,278
I don't know. Maybe he installed a hidden camera in front of the house.

350
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:53,568
Most of it is a petty crime. The best we have is theft.

351
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:57,528
It's good that he was filmed leaving with a shoe box.

352
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:00,738
But if you say there was cash inside,

353
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:04,578
you'll have to prove the source of the fund. Would it be okay?

354
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:07,858
I won't bring up the money. Just make him a pervert who stole my shoes.

355
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:09,358
What?

356
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:13,568
It's hard to prove there was money in the box.

357
00:29:13,568 --> 00:29:16,688
He'd be put on probation even if we collected the rest of the evidence.

358
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,898
So, I'll file a civil lawsuit.

359
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:21,268
It will be a small criminal case already. But a civil case?

360
00:29:21,268 --> 00:29:23,388
You'll charge him for damages or something?

361
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,718
- Yeah.
- How much?

362
00:29:25,718 --> 00:29:27,538
Seven billion won.

363
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:35,298
You'll demand Ma Gang 7 billion for damages?

364
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:36,478
Yes.

365
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:38,308
Na Moon Yeong,

366
00:29:38,308 --> 00:29:41,678
I understand you're in a difficult position, but why risk it?

367
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:43,948
You won't get much out of winning a civil case, either.

368
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,568
That asshole will obviously flip out after the trial.

369
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:51,638
Let's find a more realistic solution.

370
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:54,198
I'll file a complaint in three days.

371
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:55,708
Why in three days?

372
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:59,458
That's the day he expects 7 billion from me.

373
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,568
(Memorandum of Surrendering Body Parts)

374
00:30:31,568 --> 00:30:33,628
I'm here to pay you back.

375
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:54,448
(Written Complaint)

376
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:04,798
I told you to pay 7 billion back, but you brought me a complaint demanding 7 million.

377
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:06,208
It's a copy.

378
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,278
You'll receive the official copy later.

379
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:10,928
Stop wasting time. Let's talk about the 7 billion instead.

380
00:31:10,928 --> 00:31:13,778
I'm talking about the 7 billion right now.

381
00:31:13,778 --> 00:31:15,658
Looks like you're not interested in paying me back.

382
00:31:15,658 --> 00:31:17,578
I'm trying to pay you back.

383
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:22,118
We'll be even if I win, and you owe me 7 billion.

384
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:34,258
(Memorandum of Surrendering Body Parts)

385
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:35,768
Read through.

386
00:31:38,758 --> 00:31:41,948
Will you take my finger the old-fashioned way?

387
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:44,088
No.

388
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:48,228
Either I'll die...

389
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:49,728
or you'll die.

390
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:52,678
If you don't pay back the 7 billion,

391
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:55,398
I won't get to live, either.

392
00:31:57,098 --> 00:32:01,038
Did your higher-up demand your neck or something?

393
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:03,598
Why don't you ask him, then?

394
00:32:03,598 --> 00:32:08,638
Ask him if he wants everyone to know about what you did.

395
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,498
Will you hold a press conference or something?

396
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:15,488
Your husband's dirty work will be exposed, too.

397
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:19,278
Who cares? He's already dead.

398
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:22,648
You lost your mind while cleaning up his mess.

399
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:27,138
I already submitted the complaint.

400
00:32:27,138 --> 00:32:29,458
If something happens to me,

401
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:34,238
you'll get arrested before your damage lawsuit happens.

402
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:39,838
How could a lawyer be so naive?

403
00:32:40,568 --> 00:32:44,638
Don't you know what will happen when the trial ends?

404
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:46,358
You got nothing.

405
00:32:46,358 --> 00:32:48,088
Yes.

406
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:52,668
I'll take all of your money and pay you back since I got nothing.

407
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:54,478
Seven billion in damages?

408
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,888
I don't care if I don't get all of it.

409
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:59,088
Whether it's 100 won or 200 won,

410
00:32:59,088 --> 00:33:02,848
I'll take it from you to the last penny until I pay you back.

411
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,688
So look forward to it.

412
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:17,458
Chief, the legal department wants to see you.

413
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:28,538
<i>It's a malignant complaint to damage your reputation.</i>

414
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:30,988
<i>It's better not to let her provoke you.</i>

415
00:33:30,988 --> 00:33:34,138
<i>You're ordered not to be in touch with the plaintiff in any way before the trial</i>

416
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:37,318
<i>and don't do anything to stand out.</i>

417
00:33:44,978 --> 00:33:48,178
This and this were all taken in front of the house.

418
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:50,678
- Yes, that's right.
- This, too.

419
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:54,278
This one. If you take a look at this...

420
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:55,848
Yes.

421
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:59,888
Could I proceed under the Chawoong Foundation?

422
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,118
Yes.

423
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:08,088
I'd like to know if it was the same person.

424
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:16,878
(Son of a bitch)

425
00:34:42,758 --> 00:34:46,208
(Thank you for everything. Let's have a fresh start in these shoes. - Seong Jae)

426
00:35:08,038 --> 00:35:12,618
After my nine-year-old daughter was told by an unidentified man

427
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:15,978
that she won't be able to see me in four days,

428
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:20,128
she's been showing signs of anxiety and sociophobia.

429
00:35:20,128 --> 00:35:25,578
And Ma Gang broke into my house and stole my favorite shoes.

430
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:28,018
He's been stalking me in a perverted manner.

431
00:35:28,018 --> 00:35:32,878
Thus, for the treatment fee and psychological damage,

432
00:35:32,878 --> 00:35:37,628
I demand a total of 7 billion won through this lawsuit.

433
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:43,818
Plaintiff, are you indeed demanding 7 billion?

434
00:35:43,818 --> 00:35:45,878
Considering the actual treatment fee,

435
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:48,668
the profit from the cases I couldn't take because of the defendant's threats,

436
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:52,008
compensation for my daughter's lost opportunity to learn,

437
00:35:52,008 --> 00:35:56,888
the fact that I've been anxious and had difficulty working

438
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:01,238
since the defendant has been stalking and blackmailing me,

439
00:36:01,238 --> 00:36:07,248
and other immeasurable damages, I decided to choose that amount.

440
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:16,708
(List of Evidence)

441
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:21,618
Plaintiff, you submitted three documents for evidence.

442
00:36:21,618 --> 00:36:23,158
Yes.

443
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:26,788
Evidence No. 1.

444
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:30,488
The texts contain threats from the defendant.

445
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:35,948
The defendant sent a total of 121 text messages containing threats to my phone.

446
00:36:35,948 --> 00:36:39,258
He sent a total of 27 photos of me and my family

447
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:43,628
by following us near my workplace and house.

448
00:36:44,348 --> 00:36:45,848
This is Evidence No. 2.

449
00:36:45,848 --> 00:36:48,838
It's a CCTV recording from near my house.

450
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:55,958
What's this?

451
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:01,278
Everyone, be quiet.

452
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:03,118
Defendant, sit down.

453
00:37:03,118 --> 00:37:06,128
Your Honor, this is a different video than the one she submitted.

454
00:37:06,128 --> 00:37:07,928
Just one moment.

455
00:37:08,948 --> 00:37:11,938
Is this a different video than the one you submitted?

456
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:16,278
It's a video related to the CCTV footage submitted as Evidence No. 2.

457
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:19,328
It needs to be examined as evidence.

458
00:37:19,328 --> 00:37:25,818
It's a dashcam recording that shows the real culprit of the murder of Park Jae Moon,

459
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:30,248
a resident of Haean Village that happened on March 20th.

460
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,588
This has no relation to the case.

461
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:34,578
They, in fact, are related. The defendant-

462
00:37:34,578 --> 00:37:38,658
But it was not included in the submitted evidence list, correct?

463
00:37:39,378 --> 00:37:40,788
Correct.

464
00:37:40,788 --> 00:37:43,988
But the defendant's constant blackmailing and

465
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:49,368
two deaths that didn't get publicized started from this incident.

466
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:53,378
So please allow me to submit Evidence No. 4 and 5

467
00:37:53,378 --> 00:37:56,868
including the dashcam footage that I didn't get to submit in advance

468
00:37:56,868 --> 00:38:02,088
to this court and allow it to be examined as evidence.

469
00:38:02,088 --> 00:38:03,938
Are they crucial pieces of evidence?

470
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:09,298
Yes, they need to be examined for a speedy trial.

471
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:11,278
Go ahead and submit.

472
00:38:29,998 --> 00:38:32,088
You bastard.

473
00:38:32,088 --> 00:38:35,148
(The day Mr. Park died)

474
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:38,638
Hey, let's go.

475
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,628
You bastard.

476
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:52,308
You bastard! Get off!

477
00:38:52,308 --> 00:38:53,488
Hey, you!

478
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:55,148
You f***ing asshole!

479
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:57,138
Get off!

480
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,638
Excuse me.

481
00:39:32,688 --> 00:39:34,488
Excuse me.

482
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,228
What do we do, Chief?

483
00:39:40,228 --> 00:39:42,468
I think he's dead.

484
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:45,048
Call the police.

485
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:48,618
(911)

486
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:56,418
Not now. A little later.

487
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:57,668
Pardon?

488
00:39:57,668 --> 00:39:59,598
He's not dead yet.

489
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:04,208
He dashed into the car when it took off.

490
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,128
Chief.

491
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:11,358
Don't try to argue and do as I say.

492
00:40:12,018 --> 00:40:14,458
You can end up like him, too.

493
00:40:20,868 --> 00:40:23,138
Hey, Attorney Cha.

494
00:40:23,138 --> 00:40:25,008
Something came up.

495
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,028
Did you call the police?

496
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:56,158
If you agree to be tried,

497
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:59,318
Geumshin will rescind the embezzlement lawsuit against you.

498
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:02,808
They'll conclude it as an accounting mistake instead of you stealing.

499
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:05,108
And of course, you don't owe them.

500
00:41:07,608 --> 00:41:10,778
Okay. You started the car,

501
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:13,788
but he dashed into the car and caused the accident.

502
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:15,688
And you called 911 immediately.

503
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:17,618
Chief Ma will say that to the court, too.

504
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:20,428
We'll find a witness to prove you two right, too.

505
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:22,648
You understand what I'm saying, right?

506
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,608
My job as a lawyer will be on the line, Yoon Seon.

507
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,598
I'll make sure you'll get acquitted. Just trust me.

508
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:47,908
CEO Cha.

509
00:41:56,368 --> 00:41:58,168
Did the conversation go well?

510
00:42:01,248 --> 00:42:04,088
Yes, she'll do as I said.

511
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,828
There was an accident nearby.

512
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:16,368
But your trucked happened to be right there.

513
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,818
Could you let me check the memory card?

514
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:23,788
<i>This will be the weapon to protect you and Bom from Ma Gang.</i>

515
00:42:23,788 --> 00:42:26,888
This isn't much. I'd like to compensate you.

516
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:30,248
<i>I've had this, but I couldn't use it.</i>

517
00:42:35,388 --> 00:42:37,128
<i>Why are you so stubborn?</i>

518
00:42:37,128 --> 00:42:39,958
What are you trying to do, exactly?
(Three days before suing Ma Gang)

519
00:42:49,688 --> 00:42:52,858
Let's lock up Ma Gang. For murder.

520
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:02,938
There's no clear footage of the driver's seat or the moment of the incident.

521
00:43:06,978 --> 00:43:10,358
The moment when he hit him wasn't captured.

522
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:12,238
Backing out and driving forward was captured.

523
00:43:12,238 --> 00:43:14,118
Mr. Park ran away, too.

524
00:43:14,118 --> 00:43:16,528
It's hard to identify the driver.

525
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:23,318
They might say Ma Gang got in the driver's seat,

526
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:26,128
but someone else drove when the car backed out, so...

527
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,048
- Video Analysis Center.
- Video Analysis Center.

528
00:43:29,088 --> 00:43:30,998
Evidence No. 4.

529
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:33,668
We received the result from the Video Analysis Center.

530
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:37,148
It's hard to see the driver's seat from the dashcam footage,

531
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:40,088
but according to their analysis,

532
00:43:40,088 --> 00:43:44,378
the driver was identified as a male adult.

533
00:43:46,388 --> 00:43:48,348
(The driver is presumed to be around 180 cm tall)

534
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:52,078
Let's identify the driver and reveal him in court.

535
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:53,638
We'll put the shield up with the civil suit.

536
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:56,988
He won't be able to bother Bom and me for a while.

537
00:43:58,158 --> 00:44:00,478
By the way, where did you get this footage?

538
00:44:04,498 --> 00:44:07,388
I guess Seong Jae sent it before he died.

539
00:44:08,388 --> 00:44:10,638
I guess he had some conscience.

540
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:17,128
<i>According to the accident record, there was a record of reporting of the accident.</i>

541
00:44:17,128 --> 00:44:20,848
I remember clearly since a company's employee was prosecuted.

542
00:44:20,848 --> 00:44:22,868
According to what the plaintiff said,

543
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:27,628
someone who killed the victim and tried to hide the fact called 911 themselves

544
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:30,938
or agreed to call 911. Is that correct?

545
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:36,928
The defendant can't be accused purely based on analysis and assumption.

546
00:44:36,928 --> 00:44:39,398
Let me explain in response.

547
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:43,248
Evidence No. 5.

548
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:46,298
Please check the voice recording and call record of

549
00:44:46,298 --> 00:44:49,468
Ms. Kim Yoon Seon's call to 911.

550
00:44:50,278 --> 00:44:54,178
The first report was received at 15:23.

551
00:44:54,228 --> 00:44:56,908
But there is no record of that call.

552
00:44:56,908 --> 00:45:00,998
Ms. Kim did not receive a confirmation call from 911,

553
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,658
so she called 22 minutes later at

554
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:06,018
15:45 again and...

555
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:08,908
reported the car accident.

556
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:15,708
According to the dashcam footage, the time defendant's car left abruptly

557
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:19,088
was just one minute before Ms. Kim first called 911.

558
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:21,378
And the second call was made after

559
00:45:21,378 --> 00:45:24,318
his attorney arrived. Considering that fact,

560
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:29,458
we can conclude that the victim was neglected for at least 22 minutes.

561
00:45:30,468 --> 00:45:33,448
What were the people at the scene doing?

562
00:45:40,098 --> 00:45:43,128
When Mr. Park of Haean Village passed away,

563
00:45:43,128 --> 00:45:47,508
Ms. Kim Yoon Seon, who was forced to become a fake suspect

564
00:45:47,508 --> 00:45:51,598
died from a mysterious car accident the day after the trial.

565
00:45:51,598 --> 00:45:55,838
The indictment of the case was dismissed due to the defendant's death.

566
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:00,398
And the attorney who allowed the switching of the defendant

567
00:46:00,398 --> 00:46:03,898
and cleaned up after the case...

568
00:46:03,898 --> 00:46:08,178
did not attend the trial due to the guilt and

569
00:46:08,178 --> 00:46:13,168
ended up committing suicide. He was my husband, Cha Seong Jae.

570
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:25,228
The defendant, who blamed someone else for his crime,

571
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:27,988
kept creating more innocent victims.

572
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:32,468
One of the victims was my husband, and now

573
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:36,878
he's creating more victims by blackmailing me and my daughter.

574
00:46:37,908 --> 00:46:43,588
The footage you just saw was found while I was investigating my husband's death.

575
00:46:43,588 --> 00:46:48,008
It explains why the defendant is displaying violence to my family.

576
00:46:48,008 --> 00:46:50,478
Therefore, I'm submitting it in this trial.

577
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:56,868
I hope you consider this so the defendant's

578
00:46:56,868 --> 00:47:00,498
endless violence and lies could end, Your Honor.

579
00:47:00,498 --> 00:47:06,748
Plaintiff, are you saying the defendant committed murder right now?

580
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:11,038
Yes.

581
00:47:47,048 --> 00:47:49,658
(Arrest Warrant)

582
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:55,358
Hey! You sons of bitches...

583
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,658
Hey, what are you doing? Stop them.

584
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,938
Let go. Let go! Let go, I said!

585
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,808
Chief Ma! Chief Ma.

586
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:55,238
<i>Geumshin Corporation's Mr. Ma was arrested as a prime suspect for the murder of</i>

587
00:48:55,238 --> 00:48:57,758
<i>Mr. Park in Haean Village from last month.</i>

588
00:48:57,758 --> 00:49:01,888
<i>Mr. Ma is accused of causing the accident on purpose since Mr. Park was against the development</i>

589
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:07,678
<i>and caused his death by stopping his colleague from calling 911.</i>

590
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,508
<i>- Please say something.</i>
<i></i><i>- And in the process, Mr. Ma...</i>

591
00:49:10,508 --> 00:49:13,488
<i>made daring moves by making his colleague,</i>

592
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:18,528
<i>Ms. Kim, the suspect and threatening the defense attorney.</i>

593
00:49:18,528 --> 00:49:21,128
<i>Ms. Kim, who was tried as a defendant</i>

594
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:24,758
<i>died from a car accident after missing the first trial.</i>

595
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:29,058
<i>And the defense attorney of the case also committed suicide on the day of the trial</i>

596
00:49:29,058 --> 00:49:31,668
<i>to add to the shocking case.</i>

597
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:37,778
<i>In addition to that, Lee was arrested for arson in Haean Village recently.</i>

598
00:49:37,778 --> 00:49:42,318
<i>The local residents are demanding tighter security in Haean Village.</i>

599
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,538
<i>A peaceful village was destroyed because of the Geumshin Corporation bastards.</i>

600
00:49:46,538 --> 00:49:49,198
<i>There's fire and gun violence all the time...</i>

601
00:50:08,948 --> 00:50:11,668
<i>Come back to where you belong now.</i>

602
00:50:11,668 --> 00:50:14,678
<i>I know it's not easy to turn yourself in.</i>

603
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,568
<i>But we can fix things and take responsiblities together.</i>

604
00:50:19,568 --> 00:50:23,548
<i>When we got married, we promised to defend each other</i>

605
00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:28,638
<i>even if the whole world criticizes us. You haven't forgotten it, right?</i>

606
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:33,588
<i>I realized my life without you is hellish.</i>

607
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:37,998
<i>No matter how I end up,</i>

608
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:40,268
<i>I'll always choose you.</i>

609
00:50:41,298 --> 00:50:43,208
Bom, you might be late for class.

610
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,998
<i>Okay, I'll be downstairs.</i>

611
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:51,728
<i>Think of Bom, who still misses you, and take courage.</i>

612
00:50:51,728 --> 00:50:54,078
- Shall we go?
<i>- I'll be waiting.</i>

613
00:51:05,818 --> 00:51:08,678
- Ms. Ha.
- Ms. Ha.

614
00:51:08,678 --> 00:51:10,588
Hi, Bom.

615
00:51:11,688 --> 00:51:13,768
I saw the news.

616
00:51:13,768 --> 00:51:16,448
I don't know what to say.

617
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,548
It's all in the past now.

618
00:51:18,548 --> 00:51:20,338
Thank you for your help.

619
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,368
I didn't do anything.

620
00:51:22,368 --> 00:51:24,768
Today's tea party is at 11, right?

621
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:26,518
Yes, it is.

622
00:51:26,518 --> 00:51:29,058
Let's eat something tasty like we used to.

623
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:31,818
Come by later, then.

624
00:52:19,548 --> 00:52:20,748
Mom, I'll be right back.

625
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:24,408
Bom, stay in front of the gate when you get out of school.

626
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:26,698
I'll pick you up in time.

627
00:52:26,698 --> 00:52:29,328
You pick me up every day.

628
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:32,598
We'll go and get some tasty food today.

629
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:34,518
Yay.

630
00:52:35,748 --> 00:52:40,318
I have something to tell you.

631
00:52:41,118 --> 00:52:44,948
It's something very important.

632
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:46,898
Something important?

633
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,108
Have fun at school.

634
00:52:49,108 --> 00:52:51,478
Okay, I'll be right back.

635
00:53:20,188 --> 00:53:22,068
<i>The card is being read.</i>

636
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:24,418
<i>Please choose the transaction you want.</i>

637
00:53:24,418 --> 00:53:26,348
<i>The cash is being counted.</i>

638
00:53:26,348 --> 00:53:29,128
<i>Please wait a moment.</i>

639
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,768
<i>Please take the card.</i>

640
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:35,618
<i>Thank you for using our service.</i>

641
00:53:43,968 --> 00:53:45,548
Cha Seong Jae.

642
00:53:55,638 --> 00:53:56,878
What did you do to Tae Soo?

643
00:53:56,878 --> 00:53:59,788
What did you do to Tae Soo, you bastard?

644
00:54:02,018 --> 00:54:05,358
Jin Woo, I'll explain everything.

645
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:07,028
Tell me right now!

646
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:08,468
Let go of this, and we'll talk.

647
00:54:08,468 --> 00:54:11,128
Tell me. Tell me right now!

648
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,288
Smile.

649
00:54:25,288 --> 00:54:27,398
Am I in the shot, too?

650
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:29,878
- Looks so tasty.
- It's so good.

651
00:54:29,878 --> 00:54:31,088
Let me take one of you.

652
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:33,468
Are you talking about something complicated again?

653
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,328
Here's the tea.

654
00:54:38,688 --> 00:54:41,028
I'm glad you came today.

655
00:54:43,088 --> 00:54:44,788
It's tasty.

656
00:54:46,098 --> 00:54:48,258
It smells so good.

657
00:54:48,258 --> 00:54:49,848
So pretty.

658
00:54:49,848 --> 00:54:50,998
I want this.

659
00:54:50,998 --> 00:54:52,778
- What's this?
- Dacquoise?

660
00:54:52,778 --> 00:54:54,698
You're right.

661
00:54:54,698 --> 00:54:56,978
Here you go.

662
00:54:59,878 --> 00:55:03,898
Ms. Ha's skills are improving every day.

663
00:55:03,898 --> 00:55:05,878
I follow the instructions exactly, too,

664
00:55:05,878 --> 00:55:08,518
but I don't know why mine isn't as good.

665
00:55:10,258 --> 00:55:13,628
I never get sick of hearing your compliments.

666
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:15,078
That's why I'm giving you this.

667
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,298
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

668
00:55:17,298 --> 00:55:19,418
What's this? It's so pretty.

669
00:55:19,418 --> 00:55:22,598
Gosh, what's this?

670
00:55:22,598 --> 00:55:25,678
- Gosh. I knew it.
- For Attorney Na,

671
00:55:25,678 --> 00:55:28,138
I prepared something special.

672
00:55:28,138 --> 00:55:31,708
Is she getting special treatment for living next door?

673
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,078
I'm about to feel sad.

674
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:52,818
I prepared more cookies over there.

675
00:55:52,818 --> 00:55:54,968
Feel free to take them for the kids.

676
00:55:54,968 --> 00:55:58,068
- Really?
- Really? Thank you. Thank you.

677
00:55:58,068 --> 00:55:59,808
I'm so excited.

678
00:55:59,808 --> 00:56:03,938
- Should we try some?
- Can't believe Ms. Ha did this.

679
00:56:03,938 --> 00:56:05,658
I know.

680
00:56:05,658 --> 00:56:08,318
Ms. Ha is the best.

681
00:56:14,548 --> 00:56:16,318
(Shin Hwa)

682
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,828
Answer it.

683
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:24,678
I think she'll deliver good news.

684
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:29,188
(Shin Hwa)

685
00:56:33,528 --> 00:56:35,318
What's going on?

686
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:39,518
<i>Moon Yeong, Ma Gang is dead, apparently.</i>

687
00:56:47,018 --> 00:56:49,418
<i>He was found dead in the holding cell.</i>

688
00:56:49,418 --> 00:56:52,458
<i>Where are you right now? Let's talk in person.</i>

689
00:56:52,458 --> 00:56:55,538
<i>Moon Yeong. Hey, Na Moon Yeong!</i>

690
00:57:21,848 --> 00:57:23,878
Did your...

691
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,498
meeting with your husband go well?

692
00:57:31,388 --> 00:57:36,648
Mr. Cha isn't looking so good.

693
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:38,268
I mean...

694
00:57:39,588 --> 00:57:44,008
should I call him Mr. Hwang Tae Soo?

695
00:58:21,438 --> 00:58:24,978
(Hide)

696
00:58:26,018 --> 00:58:29,158
<i>There's something you need to do, Ms. Na.</i>

697
00:58:29,158 --> 00:58:31,128
<i>It was supposed to be your husband's job, but...</i>

<i>Why are you taking it so far?</i>
