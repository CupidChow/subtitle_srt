00:00:01,683 --> 00:00:03,683
(Park Ji Il / Nam Gi Ae / Kim Sang Ho / Kim Gook Hee)

00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:15,983
(Hide)

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,083
(Episode 5)

5
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,623
What is all this?

6
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:30,193
There's something you need to do for me.

7
00:00:30,193 --> 00:00:32,743
It was supposed to be your husband's job,

8
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:35,643
but he's pretending he committed suicide right now.

9
00:00:35,643 --> 00:00:38,883
Pretending? Yeon Joo...

10
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:43,093
I mean, Ms. Ha, I don't appreciate pranks like this.

11
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:49,923
You still pretend you don't know.

12
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:13,813
You had his funeral saying he died, but if his body is found again,

13
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:16,323
that'd be quite the spectacle.

14
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,473
Who would you say it is this time?

15
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:22,093
Right, this isn't a detention center.

16
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:26,413
Can you just hide the body, then?

17
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:28,173
Detention center?

18
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:31,963
Did you kill Ma Gang?

19
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:34,253
Who?

20
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:39,153
You mean Chief Ma?

21
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:41,993
Looks like you knew him.

22
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:47,083
Maybe a little.

23
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,243
Who are you?

24
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:55,773
Ms. Ha Yeon Joo.

25
00:01:56,673 --> 00:02:00,043
I don't know what you want, but...

26
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:05,593
I'll testify what I saw and heard today when the investigation on Ma Gang starts.

27
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:11,843
You have no interest in saving your husband.

28
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:14,083
Stop threatening me.

29
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:17,013
We need to finish our conversation.

30
00:02:17,993 --> 00:02:20,873
Bom isn't coming home for a while.

31
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:22,513
You'd better not touch her.

32
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,823
You think I would...

33
00:02:24,823 --> 00:02:27,533
I'm not like Ma Gang.

34
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:30,853
Do I look pathetic enough to hurt a child?

35
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,633
You know what I think?

36
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:39,143
Bom misses her dad a lot.

37
00:02:39,143 --> 00:02:42,703
The right thing to do is to bring him back.

38
00:02:42,703 --> 00:02:45,053
That's what I think.

39
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:48,003
But if...

40
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:53,613
you reject my proposal and tell people...

41
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:56,523
Cha Seong Jae...

42
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,263
will actually die.

43
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:09,093
Can't you make a decision?

44
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,833
There can't be other options.

45
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:18,933
Okay. Give it a thought and be in touch.

46
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:20,653
By the way,

47
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:23,683
I can't wait for long.

48
00:03:39,883 --> 00:03:41,633
Bom!

49
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:42,783
Bom!

50
00:03:42,783 --> 00:03:44,423
Mom.

51
00:03:51,983 --> 00:03:54,803
Mom, are we going somewhere?

52
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,943
Mother, Seong-

53
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:01,993
Have you heard from him?

54
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:05,923
No, he won't answer my calls, either.

55
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:07,623
Mom?

56
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:13,063
I'll head over there right now.

57
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:15,253
No, no. It's nothing.

58
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:18,403
I'd rather not discuss it over the phone.

59
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:21,043
Yes. Okay.

60
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:29,123
Hey, Shin Hwa.

61
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:32,113
I... No, I'll meet you there.

62
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:36,853
No, not right now. After I drop Bom off.

63
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:39,963
I asked where we were going now!

64
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:44,333
Shin Hwa, I'll call you right back.

65
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,003
This is all my stuff.

66
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:50,983
Aren't we going home? Why?

67
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:53,753
Bom, the thing is...

68
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:56,913
I thought we were getting tasty food after school.

69
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:59,463
You said you needed to tell me something, too.

70
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:02,463
Sorry.

71
00:05:02,463 --> 00:05:04,683
I've been so out of it.

72
00:05:05,683 --> 00:05:08,923
Let's get tasty food tomorrow.

73
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,823
Let's go get it tomorrow, okay?

74
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,633
There's nothing.

75
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,693
Is your head okay?

76
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:23,813
Yes.

77
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:26,793
Your life is very colorful, too.

78
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,473
One day, you got shot,

79
00:05:28,473 --> 00:05:31,273
and you got hit in the head and passed out.

80
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,833
Let's say Mr. Hwang shot you.

81
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,173
Who hit your head, then?

82
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,713
That's why I want you to catch him. I'm curious, too.

83
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:44,743
Nothing. Nothing.

84
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:49,663
There they are. See? It was them.

85
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:53,533
The license plate number...

86
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:59,413
This man is Hwang Tae Soo?

87
00:05:59,413 --> 00:06:00,913
Yes.

88
00:06:00,913 --> 00:06:02,513
Here.

89
00:06:04,273 --> 00:06:05,943
(02 So 0263)

90
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:09,593
Why are you just staring? Look it up now.

91
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,383
I'm about to, man.

92
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:14,373
(Cheongwon District Prosecutors' Office - Haejeon Branch)

93
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:19,473
A piece of glass pierced Ma Gang's artery.

94
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,843
The direction and the angle of the cut

95
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:25,033
shows it was self-inflicted, according to KCSI.

96
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:26,983
They found his fingerprints, too.

97
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:31,923
Ma Gang wouldn't have committed suicide.

98
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,073
You mean, a man was murdered in detention center?

99
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:36,833
You were like this about your husband, too.

100
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,633
What's your reasoning this time?

101
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:40,933
He worked hands-on for Geumshin Corporation.

102
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,403
He must've known a lot.

103
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:45,403
I'm sure. But so what?

104
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:50,623
There's someone who appears to have gotten him killed.

105
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,063
She's threatening us now.

106
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:58,903
What nonsense... Hey, how many times have we been threatened because of trials?

107
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:01,323
It wasn't just a simple threat.

108
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:04,193
What kind of threat was it?

109
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,773
Is it her? The one who threatened you?

110
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:21,243
She's using the name "Ha Yeon Joo," but it might not be her real name.

111
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,863
She lives next door to me but wasn't even registered as a resident.

112
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:25,003
Next door?

113
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:27,523
KS Miracle owns her house.

114
00:07:27,523 --> 00:07:30,723
It was apparently Geumshin's subsidiary. Please look into them.

115
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,193
I'm sure she's linked to Geumshin.

116
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:36,033
You're treating me like a private investigator again.

117
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,803
Thank you in advance.

118
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:42,673
Please look into the people who visited Ma Gang and his cellmates, too.

119
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:46,873
By the way, the witness for Kim Yoon Seon's trial.

120
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:48,523
Do Jin Woo?

121
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:51,133
I checked Ma Gang's visitor list.

122
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:55,283
Most of them looked like Geumshin's minions, but Do Jin Woo was there, too.

123
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:59,593
I heard the visiting room had a chilling atmosphere.

124
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,623
When?

125
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:04,563
The day before yesterday.

126
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,933
The day before Ma Gang died.

127
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,613
Is he also involved with...

128
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:15,663
this woman?

129
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:24,263
(KS Miracle)
This probably isn't enough to prove a connection.

130
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,043
Probably not.

131
00:08:27,393 --> 00:08:29,193
What's going on?

132
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:31,963
Who's the woman named Ha Yeon Joo?

133
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,493
I'll tell you later. I'm sorry, Ms. Go.

134
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:37,903
Did CEO Kim, the man I mentioned before, get released from jail?

135
00:08:37,903 --> 00:08:41,883
- Is he still a private investigator?
- Yes, probably.

136
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:43,783
Why? Do you need his help, too?

137
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:45,103
Would it be possible?

138
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:47,083
I need to find someone urgently.

139
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,933
I don't care how much it costs. Tell him it's very urgent.

140
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,663
CEO Na, but still...

141
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:54,023
I beg you, Ms. Go.

142
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:13,443
It's not my phone.

143
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:15,463
In Gyu, answer your phone-

144
00:09:16,253 --> 00:09:17,573
Pardon?

145
00:09:25,053 --> 00:09:31,133
It's not something I could fax. I need to go to the court and make a copy.

146
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,573
<i>Call me once you decide.</i>

147
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:14,733
<i>The photo is my gift to you.</i>

148
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,423
You came sooner than I thought.

149
00:10:28,423 --> 00:10:30,983
What is it you want? Money?

150
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:34,723
I know what situation you're in. How could I?

151
00:10:34,723 --> 00:10:36,393
I told you.

152
00:10:36,393 --> 00:10:40,163
You need to do what your husband used to do.

153
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:42,283
Be more specific.

154
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:46,383
Let's start with a simple errand for now.

155
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:50,643
The list of recipients and the amount of money is in that bag.

156
00:10:50,643 --> 00:10:52,893
Start with that for now.

157
00:10:55,653 --> 00:11:00,183
Do it yourself if it's that simple.

158
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:03,523
It's up to you to decide.

159
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:06,363
But let me tell you this one thing.

160
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:11,213
A father who's pretending to be dead because he couldn't handle the crime he committed.

161
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:14,893
And his wife who's playing ignorant about it.

162
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:19,573
What would happen if their secret gets exposed?

163
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:22,463
Of course, they'll get arrested.

164
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:26,063
Bom will be separated from her parents for years, too.

165
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:29,973
Poor thing.

166
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:35,813
I'll give you the real task once you finish the errand.

167
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:41,823
Your husband will be returned safely once you finish the task.

168
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:43,843
Why should I believe you and listen to you?

169
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:46,373
I want you to prove you're willing.

170
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,343
That way, we could trust you with a big task, too.

171
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:56,013
Our Attorney Na who is as straight as an arrow.

172
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:58,873
You're going through a lot.

173
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:04,073
If it weren't for Cha Seong Jae, you would've had a perfect life.

174
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:05,633
Don't talk about my husband like that.

175
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:09,143
That's why I'm telling you to...

176
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:11,753
decide whether he'll live or not.

177
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:20,173
I need to check if he's safe first.

178
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:29,253
Is someone here? Look over there.

179
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:32,053
- Who are you looking at?
- Isn't it funny?

180
00:12:32,053 --> 00:12:34,583
Here they come. Here they come.

181
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,293
The car's here. They're here.

182
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:41,953
Jaewon construction site. Six people to sort out rebar.

183
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:46,013
- Me! Me!
- Present your IDs.

184
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:53,053
Lady. Get in.

185
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:08,113
Come out. Come out.

186
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:09,773
Come out right now.

187
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,643
Make more room.

188
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,733
Okay, get in.

189
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:18,083
Okay. I'm closing the door.

190
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,053
Have you carried rebar before?

191
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,923
Wow, you have such a nice complexion.

192
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:44,983
Seven people for the Jaewon construction site. Get off.

193
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:46,973
<i>Okay.</i>

194
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,883
- Hurry up.
- See you, doll.

195
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,373
Let's go.

196
00:14:57,543 --> 00:14:59,703
What are you doing here?

197
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,113
What happened?

198
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,843
What's with that Ha Yeon Joo woman?

199
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,933
Is she connected to Ma Gang and Geumshin Corporation?

200
00:15:15,513 --> 00:15:18,953
Did you know Bom's cooking teacher was like that?

201
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:22,193
- A woman like that was living next door. Why-
- Don't do it.

202
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:23,803
What?

203
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:27,603
You came all this way to work for her.

204
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:31,703
- What you used to do was-
- I'm telling you not to do it.

205
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:34,903
Just run away instead.

206
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,513
Okay?

207
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,593
Okay?

208
00:15:39,593 --> 00:15:41,183
Wait just a bit.

209
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,923
See you at home.

210
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,663
Keep your promise.

211
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:04,953
The video call was enough to prove that he was alive.

212
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:08,083
Why are you taking it this far...

213
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,433
Because it's fun.

214
00:17:14,453 --> 00:17:17,293
A tear-jerking family reunion.

215
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,493
Okay, it's all there.

216
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,373
Is that it?

217
00:18:24,763 --> 00:18:28,473
I received what I needed, and the amount is correct.

218
00:18:29,183 --> 00:18:32,563
You're going through a lot in your husband's place.

219
00:18:32,563 --> 00:18:34,463
Call me any time.

220
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:37,973
You and I are in the same boat.

221
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:43,873
You're supposed to help each other out in this field.

222
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,883
(Assemblyman Kim Seong Man)

223
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:13,473
I did all the dirty work you made me do.

224
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,573
Well done.

225
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,993
You need to pay me now, then.

226
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:20,623
She wants you to wait at home.

227
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,783
(The police will start tracking. Ma Gang told me everything.)

228
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:42,543
Ma Gang?

229
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:45,853
(010-1788-3150)

230
00:20:49,353 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>You finally called.</i>

231
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:54,303
Mr. Do Jin Woo?

232
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:58,143
Attorney Na?

233
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:01,923
What did you hear from Ma Gang?

234
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:05,253
<i>Why do you have Cha Seong Jae's burner phone?</i>

235
00:21:05,253 --> 00:21:07,643
<i>Are you with him right now?</i>

236
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,443
Let's meet up.

237
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:10,683
(Prosecutor Yoo Jeong Ho)

238
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:16,853
What are you doing here?

239
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:18,243
Don't be like that.

240
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,083
I'm here to see my ex-husband since I'm on a business trip in Seoul.

241
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:24,493
It's so boring to be stuck in a town on the southern end.

242
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,963
They're telling you to quit.

243
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:29,633
Don't you know?

244
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,163
The cheater is still working. Why should I quit?

245
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:35,863
I can't do that.

246
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:38,083
Because you grabbed her by the hair, I-

247
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:39,313
Shut up.

248
00:21:39,313 --> 00:21:41,593
You know I prefer the retro methods.

249
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,413
Let me just get to the point.

250
00:21:43,413 --> 00:21:46,483
Give me any file on Geumshin you have.

251
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:48,413
What about Geumshin?

252
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:51,163
Find information like that on your own.

253
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:53,583
It'd just take a few clicks.

254
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:57,113
Do you think I drove for four hours to find stuff I could find with a few clicks?

255
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:59,393
You were in that team when they did search and seizure.

256
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,063
- No.
 - Yes.

257
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:03,943
- No, I said.
 - Yes, I said.

258
00:22:10,143 --> 00:22:12,943
There's something I haven't brought up yet.

259
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:16,823
Two years ago, during the Incheon Port smuggling case,

260
00:22:16,823 --> 00:22:19,643
you hid the informant of the chief prosecutor, I mean,

261
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:23,853
the district attorney of the Eastern District Prosecutors' Office, right?

262
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,963
(Geumshin Corporation)

263
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:33,353
Take it and get lost.

264
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:36,873
Wow, really? You'll let me take it?

265
00:22:37,783 --> 00:22:40,823
Finish it during the lunch hour, okay?

266
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:44,953
Okay, then. I'll make a few copies and leave.

267
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:53,243
I've tolerated you a lot.

268
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:56,133
Let's keep it simple, Jeong Ho.

269
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,323
I thought you were with Cha Seong Jae.

270
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:06,113
So, what did you hear from Ma Gang?

271
00:23:06,873 --> 00:23:09,743
Visit him and ask him in person.

272
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,313
He's dead.

273
00:23:11,313 --> 00:23:12,923
Who-

274
00:23:13,743 --> 00:23:15,703
Ma Gang?

275
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:18,863
The prosecution says it was a suicide.

276
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:23,163
Why did you visit him in jail?

277
00:23:23,163 --> 00:23:25,713
I told him Cha Seong Jae was alive.

278
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:30,243
And he told me something very interesting.

279
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:33,273
You know Director Joo, right?

280
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:36,483
No, I don't.

281
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:41,943
Where's Cha Seong Jae?

282
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:49,113
(Cha Seong Jae's burner phone)

283
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:03,123
He must've given you his phone because the police are tracking him.

284
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:07,533
I can try to get you money somehow.

285
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:11,153
You should quit now. Stop searching for him, too.

286
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:15,173
Did Cha Seong Jae tell you I'm doing this for money?

287
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:17,153
Go tell him this.

288
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:19,533
I don't need money or anything else.

289
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:22,063
So he'd better keep his promise.

290
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:26,583
Did he promise you something other than money?

291
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:28,153
Ask him yourself, I said.

292
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:30,713
I'm asking you because I can't ask him.

293
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:33,173
My husband was kidnapped.

294
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,773
Kidnapped?

295
00:24:36,013 --> 00:24:38,383
Are you sure you don't know?

296
00:24:39,863 --> 00:24:42,303
You've been searching for my husband.

297
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,213
That's enough.

298
00:24:47,213 --> 00:24:51,123
Your husband isn't someone who'd get kidnapped and die.

299
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,533
- Mr. Do-
- And...

300
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,563
I have nothing more to say since Cha Seong Jae isn't here.

301
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:10,443
You've been to my house, haven't you?

302
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,003
Haven't you?

303
00:25:13,393 --> 00:25:15,773
How am I supposed to trust you?

304
00:25:15,773 --> 00:25:17,143
Why did you come to my house?

305
00:25:17,143 --> 00:25:18,873
You're one of Geumshin's minions, aren't you?

306
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:21,053
How many times did I say no?

307
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,173
I said I just wanted to find Cha Seong Jae.

308
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:26,063
- I'm asking you why.
- Because Cha Seong Jae...

309
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:32,413
said he'd find my daughter.

310
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,473
Daughter?

311
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:38,523
What?

312
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:40,373
You can't believe me?

313
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,863
That someone like me is looking for his child?

314
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,673
I...

315
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,983
know that I'm a total loser, but...

316
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:55,323
I just want to see my daughter, whom I didn't even know was born.

317
00:25:55,323 --> 00:25:58,803
Cha Seong Jae is the only one who knows where she is.

318
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:01,693
And I did everything he told me to do because of that.

319
00:26:03,193 --> 00:26:04,843
By chance...

320
00:26:06,123 --> 00:26:08,993
By chance, if he was playing me,

321
00:26:10,283 --> 00:26:13,263
I'll find him and expose him myself.

322
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,213
Cha Seong Jae's true color.

323
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:36,813
<i>July 26th, Haean Village's arson suspect, Lee Bang Cheol's trial.</i>

324
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:39,413
<i>The defense lawyer, Na Moon Yeong.</i>

325
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,353
(Request for Appointment of Attorney)

326
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:57,043
(Request for Appointment of Attorney - I request Na Moon Yeong as the attorney for this case.)

327
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:11,603
What's this?

328
00:27:11,603 --> 00:27:16,803
I'm telling you to finish what you've been poking at.

329
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:20,183
Getting Lee Bang Cheol, the arsonist, acquitted.

330
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:24,153
<i>That's what you need to do on behalf of your husband.</i>

331
00:27:24,153 --> 00:27:28,363
You'll obviously keep making demands like this. Why should I listen to you?

332
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:31,033
There's no guarantee my husband will return alive.

333
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:33,113
<i>This is the last one.</i>

334
00:27:33,113 --> 00:27:38,613
<i>Your husband will return home if it goes well.</i>

335
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,983
Have faith in me.

336
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:45,893
You can't do anything other than trust me right now anyway.

337
00:28:20,213 --> 00:28:22,473
Bom, you should go to bed now.

338
00:28:22,473 --> 00:28:24,823
Are we going home?

339
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:27,163
No.

340
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,043
Sleep at Grandma's tonight.

341
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:33,083
I don't think you should be home for a while.

342
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:35,223
Why?

343
00:28:35,223 --> 00:28:38,903
You know that because your daddy and I are lawyers,

344
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:43,783
people who've been wronged or are angry come to our house.

345
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:50,063
I think there will be angry people from this trial, too.

346
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:54,233
So, you should stay here with Grandma for now.

347
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:59,643
Dad would've yelled at them if he were around.

348
00:29:04,363 --> 00:29:06,513
How would you feel...

349
00:29:09,173 --> 00:29:12,493
if Dad actually came back?

350
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:17,303
Why would you think about such a thing?

351
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:18,803
Just because.

352
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:22,983
I miss him a lot, too.

353
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:29,153
You're an adult. You should know how to endure things.

354
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:35,693
Adults aren't always perfect, either.

355
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:40,493
Sometimes, I can't endure, either.

356
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,893
So I make mistakes, too.

357
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:47,013
Are Mom and Dad like that, too?

358
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:55,993
But what's important is to acknowledge your faults and fix things.

359
00:29:55,993 --> 00:29:59,363
Mom and Dad made a lot of mistakes,

360
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:02,113
but we'll turn everything back to normal.

361
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:17,473
Lee Bang Cheol. Born in August, 1989.

362
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:19,913
Unemployed. He has no family, either.

363
00:30:19,913 --> 00:30:23,773
The victim is a nine-year-old girl, and she's receiving burn treatment.

364
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:32,263
These are the six arson cases in Haean Village that he presumably committed.

365
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:35,423
(Serial arsonist? Four arsons in a month. Haean Village is in danger)

366
00:30:35,423 --> 00:30:38,533
Cases dropped due to lack of evidence?

367
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,733
All of them?

368
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,863
There was circumstantial evidence but no physical evidence.

369
00:30:42,863 --> 00:30:46,083
You know, he's been escaping like an eel, but...

370
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,833
he got caught this time.

371
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,043
Nothing was caught on CCTV?

372
00:30:51,043 --> 00:30:53,453
No. The town is about to be demolished.

373
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:56,553
There are a lot of blind spots, and it's totally empty.

374
00:30:57,253 --> 00:31:00,233
They're trying to make the residents who are opposed to the development leave.

375
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,973
Any other evidence?

376
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:06,123
Lee Bang Cheol's fingerprints were found on a lighter found near the victim's house.

377
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:08,323
There's a testimony from a witness, too.

378
00:31:09,423 --> 00:31:12,353
There's a witness and evidence. How could we win?

379
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:15,713
Why did CEO Na accept a case like this?

380

382
00:31:57,273 --> 00:31:58,833
No.

383
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,553
I think you should.

384
00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:12,063
Pick it up.

385
00:32:33,123 --> 00:32:37,063

386
00:32:37,063 --> 00:32:38,803
No.

00:32:43,053 --> 00:32:45,613
You're the one who smokes.

389
00:32:47,643 --> 00:32:49,923
Let me ask you again.

390
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:51,813
Do you smoke?

391
00:32:59,543 --> 00:33:01,013
Yes.

392

(Liberty / Equality / Justice)

394
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,333
Come out, Attorney Na.

395
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,483
Let's hear why you're representing Lee Bang Cheol.

396
00:33:36,163 --> 00:33:38,823
Did this person tell you to represent the arsonist?

397
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:45,013
My ex-husband, Prosecutor Yoo, did a search and seizure on Geumshin. Remember?

398
00:33:45,013 --> 00:33:46,503
Did you see Jeong Ho?

399
00:33:46,503 --> 00:33:49,333
Yes. I got everything out of him while I was in Seoul yesterday.

400
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:51,503
Look.

401
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:53,513
She turns out to be a legendary figure.

402
00:33:53,513 --> 00:33:56,113
She's called "Director Joo," apparently.

403
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:58,733
Director Joo?

404
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:01,113
<i>He told me something very interesting.</i>

405
00:34:02,193 --> 00:34:04,123
<i>You know Director Joo, right?</i>

406
00:34:06,703 --> 00:34:08,733
She wasn't registered as an executive, but you know...

407
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:11,583
people like that are more influential because they deal with slush funds.

408
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,343
They think she directly works for Chairman Choi Moo Won.

409
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:18,923
She puts pipes in wherever she needs them. She's known as the queen of lobbying.

410
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:23,653
Multiple prosecutors were after her, but this is all they found out.

411
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:25,613
Her company always changes.

412
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:28,753
And looks like she works for KS Miracle or whatever.

413
00:34:28,753 --> 00:34:32,623
Do you know who the judge for this case is?

414
00:34:35,713 --> 00:34:37,963
The judge from the Kim Yoon Seon case.

415
00:34:38,863 --> 00:34:40,703
Can't you see the whole picture?

416
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,913
All sorts of accidents regarding Haean Village development,

417
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,213
Ma Gang, your husband, and Geumshin.

418
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:51,003
Now, they're using someone like Lee Bang Cheol to get rid of the annoying residents.

419
00:34:52,503 --> 00:34:54,003
I know.

420
00:34:54,003 --> 00:34:55,573
You do?

421
00:34:57,783 --> 00:34:59,923
Look at this, then.

422
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:02,803
You'll still represent him after seeing this? He's a piece of trash.

423
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:05,333
My job involves representing murderers, too.

424
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:14,273
So, let's hear the reason, at least.

425
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:18,543
Looks like you're doing this because of Ha Yeon Joo's threat. You should protect yourself first.

426
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:21,753
Everything is bound to get sorted out later.

427
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:26,723
There's no "later," Shin Hwa.

428
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:28,533
What do you mean?

429
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:33,063
I can't tell you yet.

430
00:35:34,273 --> 00:35:37,253
You'd be breaking the law if I did.

431
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:39,713
Whoa.

432
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,173
I'm so thankful I'm about to cry.

433
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:51,083
Do your job as a prosecutor.

434
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,513
I'll do mine as an attorney.

435
00:35:58,253 --> 00:36:00,443
Fine.

436
00:36:00,443 --> 00:36:03,963
You do your job, and I'll do mine.

437
00:36:03,963 --> 00:36:08,053
I'll make sure to lock him in. See you in court.

438
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:11,813
I'll cut his hand off if I have to, so he can't start another fire.

439
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:23,353
It should be on this street.

440
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:26,613
It's right here.

441
00:36:26,613 --> 00:36:29,903
I think it was a gas explosion.

442
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:32,353
I can't tell if it was an arson or an accident.

443
00:36:32,353 --> 00:36:34,623
- It's this one, right?
- Yes, that one.

Do Jin Woo's shooting suspect.

00:39:22,023 --> 00:39:23,503
His name is Hwang Tae Soo.

475
00:39:23,503 --> 00:39:29,443
He has a phone under his name. So we've been tracking it.

476

- Family comes first. Who cares about-
- Yes, family!

495
00:41:01,123 --> 00:41:04,223
If everyone finds out about what he did,

496
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:07,143
Chawoong Foundation and law firm are doomed.

497
00:41:07,143 --> 00:41:10,023
We won't be able to keep our heads up in Haejeon City.

498
00:41:10,023 --> 00:41:12,123
How could you...

499
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:15,383
How insane do you have to be?

500
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:17,453
How could you hide that from me?

501
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:20,113
I wish he were actually dead.

502
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:22,533
Before people see him walking around-

503
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:24,523
He was kidnapped.

504
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:30,693
Seong Jae might actually die.

505
00:41:45,393 --> 00:41:47,473

00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:03,883
What did you say they want?

508
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,673
They want the arsonist to get acquitted.

509
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:12,743

Yes.

What will you do?

512
00:42:19,973 --> 00:42:21,473
I need to save him first.

513
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:22,913
I'll report them later-

514
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:24,503
Report?

515
00:42:25,753 --> 00:42:29,393
What if they don't release Seong Jae after the acquittal?

516
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:33,303
Honey, you're close to the police chief.

517
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:34,933

Seong Jae's kidnapping...

522
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:53,493
Are you sure it has to do with Geumshin Corporation?

00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:56,403
Yes.

524
00:43:01,123 --> 00:43:03,183
Okay.

You said money makes a successful public servant, not luck.

535
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:35,063
You promised me you'd fund my campaign.

536
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:38,013
Is this what I get for protecting the

537
00:44:38,013 --> 00:44:44,193
homeless and criminals by sacrificing my wife and child?

538
00:44:46,863 --> 00:44:50,443
You're leaving me with no choice.

539
00:44:51,443 --> 00:44:56,583
I didn't do this just because you gave me your word.

540
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:22,783
(Prosecution)

541
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:43,153
Attorney.

542
00:45:43,153 --> 00:45:45,283
I'm counting on you, Attorney.

543
00:45:46,183 --> 00:45:47,743
Shut up.

544
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:51,393
Okay.

545
00:45:56,473 --> 00:46:00,473
The connection between the defendant's lighter and arson can't be proven.

546
00:46:00,473 --> 00:46:03,923
The defendant has been smoking for the past 20 years

547
00:46:03,923 --> 00:46:07,333
and he went through many lighters in Haean Village.

548
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:13,743
I request a Haean Village resident as a witness to prove that he's a smoker.

549
00:46:13,743 --> 00:46:15,183
All of a sudden?

550
00:46:15,183 --> 00:46:17,113
Approved.

551
00:46:17,113 --> 00:46:18,863
Your Honor!

552
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:22,023
Let's listen to them since they're already here.

553
00:46:22,023 --> 00:46:24,243
Defense, go on.

554
00:46:31,113 --> 00:46:33,113
(Witness Stand)
Yes.

555
00:46:33,113 --> 00:46:38,363
I sat with Bang Cheol and smoked together nearby.

556
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:57,253
(Court)

557
00:46:57,253 --> 00:47:02,913
<i>Therefore, as there's no evidence to prove the crime</i>

558
00:47:02,913 --> 00:47:06,443
<i>according the latter half of Article 325 of the Criminal Procedure Code,</i>

559
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:09,223
<i>the defendant is deemed not guilty.</i>

560
00:47:09,223 --> 00:47:11,553
<i>Defendant Lee Bang Cheol is not guilty.</i>

561
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:14,693
<i>Defendant, you may leave the court.</i>

562
00:47:32,653 --> 00:47:34,513
Hey, Na Moon Yeong!

563
00:47:35,893 --> 00:47:37,583
Is this it?

564
00:47:38,903 --> 00:47:41,533
Is this what you want to do as a lawyer?

565
00:47:41,533 --> 00:47:46,033
The arsonist suddenly picked up smoking

566
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:50,033
and the judge disregarded all of that evidence.

567
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,533
Shin Hwa.

568
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:54,363
How are you different from Cha Seong Jae?

569
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:57,953
I don't know.

570
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:03,363
Let's not see each other for a while.

571
00:48:03,363 --> 00:48:05,503
I can't guarantee I won't swear at your face.

572
00:48:05,503 --> 00:48:07,323
Swear at me.

573
00:48:07,323 --> 00:48:10,963
You can swear at me. Just don't say you don't want to see me.

574
00:48:12,073 --> 00:48:14,653
I couldn't have come this far without you.

575
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,783
Congratulations on winning the case.

576
00:48:32,783 --> 00:48:35,513
You created a witness out of thin air.

577
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:39,863
And you made Lee Bang Cheol a heavy smoker and scattered lighters in Haean Village.

578
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:41,883
I really loved that.

579
00:48:41,883 --> 00:48:43,453
Just keep your promise.

580
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:44,993
Of course.

581
00:48:44,993 --> 00:48:51,083
The present you've been waiting for will arrive at your house tonight.

582
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,963
You changed the passcode.

583
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:41,913
I'm sorry.

584
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,843
Yes.

585
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,263
You should feel guilty toward me.

586
00:49:49,213 --> 00:49:51,973
I've been suffering alone...

587
00:49:51,973 --> 00:49:54,243
without knowing anything.

588
00:49:56,213 --> 00:50:00,013
Do you know what I've done to save you?

589
00:50:25,043 --> 00:50:26,743
Where's Bom?

590
00:50:28,853 --> 00:50:31,653
She's waiting at Father's house.

591
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:36,733
I'm too ashamed to see Bom.

592
00:50:38,253 --> 00:50:40,453
Don't worry.

593
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:44,363
I explained things to her. She'll understand.

594
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:53,153
You need to tell her that you didn't abandon her.

595
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:01,863
You should take a shower.

596
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:12,753
Shall we go?

597
00:51:40,743 --> 00:51:42,513
It's Dad.

598
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:22,163
Bom,

599
00:52:22,163 --> 00:52:25,283
remember what I told you last time?

600
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:32,203
What's really important is to acknowledge your faults and fix things.

601
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:39,223
Mom and Dad made a lot of mistakes,

602
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:41,853
but we'll turn everything back to normal.

603
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:44,803
And...

604
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:50,553
I also said your dad would never leave you, right?

605
00:52:50,553 --> 00:52:51,973
Yes.

606
00:52:57,203 --> 00:52:58,573
Look.

607
00:52:59,573 --> 00:53:01,653
Dad is here.

608
00:53:03,433 --> 00:53:05,933
Dad!

609
00:53:18,223 --> 00:53:19,763
Bom.

610

611
00:54:39,313 --> 00:54:43,443
(Result: The two are the same person after comparing the outfit and the video footage)

612
00:54:47,473 --> 00:54:49,453
Look at them...

613
00:55:01,223 --> 00:55:03,943
Why is Cha Seong Jae showing up here?

614

(Death Certificate)

615
00:55:20,463 --> 00:55:21,833

618
00:55:57,943 --> 00:56:01,483
<i>Cha Seong Jae was alive?</i>

619
00:56:04,373 --> 00:56:07,463
Cha Seong Jae, that bastard played me?

620
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:11,623
Does Director Joo know, too?

621
00:56:13,023 --> 00:56:14,693
Director Joo?

622
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:18,823
Even you figured it out.

623
00:56:18,823 --> 00:56:21,063
There's no way she wouldn't know.

624
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:29,183
You all tricked me from the beginning?

625
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,933
<i>3784. Be quiet.</i>

626
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:42,353
Who's Director Joo?

627
00:56:43,193 --> 00:56:46,103
The one who introduced Cha Seong Jae to me.

628
00:56:53,783 --> 00:56:56,243
You said you wanted to catch Cha Seong Jae, right?

629
00:57:01,633 --> 00:57:05,333
And you want to catch this Director Joo?

630
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:07,133
Now we're talking.

631
00:57:48,913 --> 00:57:52,903
Yes, it's so nice to be reunited like this.

632
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:55,373
Yes, yes...

633
00:57:56,563 --> 00:57:58,263
I'm sorry, Mom.

634
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:01,403
Moon Yeong saved you.

635
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:03,743
She did something so dangerous.

636
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:24,063
Since Seong Jae is back,

637
00:58:24,063 --> 00:58:27,643
you'd have no issue getting nominated, right?

638
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:30,923
Didn't you say you didn't care about the election earlier?

639
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:32,913
Come on, Honey.

641
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,803
You hold grudges.

642
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,683
You know how I hold grudges.

643
00:58:48,553 --> 00:58:51,993
<i>So, Hwang Tae Soo died before he got to the hospital?</i>

644
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:53,643
<i>Check his medical records.</i>

645
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:56,423
<i>How could I kill someone, Moon Yeong?</i>

646
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:04,783
<i>It was too difficult to take Hwang Tae Soo to the ER alone.</i>

647
00:59:04,783 --> 00:59:06,393
<i>You weren't home then.</i>

648
00:59:06,393 --> 00:59:08,223
<i>So, I asked Mom to babysit Bom.</i>

649
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:10,523
<i>But she didn't believe me when she saw the mess I was in.</i>

650
00:59:10,523 --> 00:59:13,343
<i>All she did was do what I told her to do.</i>

651
00:59:22,123 --> 00:59:24,163
What are you doing?

652
00:59:24,163 --> 00:59:26,923
What are you doing over there? Come here.

653
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,713
