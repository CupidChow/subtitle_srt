The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,350
You are here

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,840
Welcome

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,690
good

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:25,940
Hello

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,790
-Thank you. -Welcome back, uncle.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,640
Jaeyeon, you really look handsome.

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,770
Hello, uncle

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,140
But what do you want for dinner?

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,890
Cai Yun is not happy because he saw the uncle

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,690
Is it because of dinner?

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,470
Auntie just said pick the one you want to eat the most and have a meal together

15
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,340
Really

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,240
But what about Komatsu...

17
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,540
It seems he doesn't know where Xiaosong is.

18
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,090
Are you Komatsu?

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,940
Are you Komatsu?

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,090
Uncle, uncle didn't recognize me.

21
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,690
You are really beautiful.

22
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,140
Oh, you've grown so big.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,870
Dr. Cui

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,730
yes

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,350
The lost lamb has returned

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,390
It's the lost old sheep.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,890
Welcome back

28
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,620
I'll watch closely like a sheepdog.

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,190
- Got it? - I'll keep it in mind.

30
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,420
-Hello. -Hello.

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,320
Oh, Father

32
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,220
I heard the medals won't be delivered until 7 o'clock.

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,720
The event starts at 6 o'clock

34
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,020
What should I do if I arrive at 7 o'clock?

35
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,820
That is to say

36
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,020
This is another test for us.

37
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,590
I'm a little dizzy from all the preparations.

38
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,690
Talk later

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,990
Patient Kim Sun-joo's pain seems to be getting worse

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,750
- I'll go see the doctor.

41
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,620
I'll go see patient Kim Sun-joo.

42
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,420
Just change the painkiller

43
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,720
Ye-na, go help the nuns prepare for the event.

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,920
Ah, okay

45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,620
Sorry, I'll take my leave now.

46
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,350
Um

47
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,950
I'm so happy that you're back safe and healthy.

48
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,350
Greetings, I'll take my time after work tomorrow.

49
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,590
Have a good meal with the kids

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,590
It turns out this isn't my welcome party.

51
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,550
Uncle, let's go eat.

52
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,420
Okay, what do you want to eat?

53
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,050
Auntie just gave me a card

54
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,440
Let's go eat something delicious

55
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,450
Let's eat beef

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,850
Walk, walk, walk

57
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,520
What do you want to eat?

58
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,350
Slightly increased the dosage of painkillers

59
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,390
It's okay now

60
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,650
But it might be hard in the early morning

61
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,920
I have an event today and will be staying in the hospital until late.

62
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,550
Tell me then

63
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,250
Thank you, doctor.

64
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,050
doctor

65
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,750
No hormone therapy is done here

66
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,850
Maybe radiofrequency heat therapy or something like that?

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,440
right

68
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,120
Not a penny charged

69
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,390
Still treating with such care

70
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,650
Stop saying weird things.

71
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,050
Bone scan, CT, MRI, etc.

72
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,090
If a spinal fracture is suspected

73
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,720
X-rays can be taken

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,630
Those are not needed

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,550
Previous radiation therapy

76
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,920
Heat therapy and so on.

77
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,290
Not suitable at all

78
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,890
No effect

79
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,390
I'm here

80
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,520
The doctor puts me at ease.

81
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,050
I think it's great

82
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,750
Very comfortable

83
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,420
You can be given medication to reduce your risk of fractures.

84
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,750
In addition, I will

85
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,420
Prepare a physical therapy program for pain relief

86
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,920
Excuse me

87
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,420
Sorry, I set it to vibrate.

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,200
I'll give it to you before the weekend

89
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,650
Sorry, doctor.

90
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,620
She felt she couldn't afford the medical bills.

91
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,690
That's why I was transferred to this hospital.

92
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,170
That's why I feel so sad.

93
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,950
Because of treatment costs

94
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,150
It seems that I also borrowed high-interest loans

95
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,690
It's okay. I completely understand your daughter's feelings.

96
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,550
thank you

97
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,040
-=Maria Welfare Hospital Patrons' Night=-

98
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,050
The Lord has said

99
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,150
Share what you have with others

100
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,650
It is love

101
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,990
Thanks to everyone's hard work

102
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,470
And generously donated

103
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,800
Past year

104
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,340
Our Maria Welfare Hospital

105
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,710
To save so many patients

106
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,940
Thank you again to all the sponsors and volunteers today

107
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,800
Let's applaud and cheer each other on, okay?

108
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,170
OK, thanks

109
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,520
Mother

110
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,200
Mom, are you okay?

111
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,050
So I said I need better treatment.

112
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,830
Mother

113
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,750
I'll find a way to raise more money.

114
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,240
Let's go back to the previous hospital to continue treatment.

115
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,300
Thank you today too. Please accept this.

116
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,800
-OK, thanks

117
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,670
- A little thought. - Thank you.

118
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,870
Thank you for joining us as a sponsor this year.

119
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,340
Although it's late, congratulations on becoming the dean.

120
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,600
Thanks

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,870
You are so busy

122
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,640
I still come to participate every year

123
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,330
We also provide sponsorship

124
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,070
Thanks to you, I am also doing good deeds.

125
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,370
You want to see it once a year and see it with your own eyes, right?

126
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,340
I've had similar experiences, so I understand.

127
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,500
After Daxian was imprisoned for drug abuse

128
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,340
I'm the same

129
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,840
Using the excuse of eating

130
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,650
Confirm the situation with your own eyes

131
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,700
Dr. Yu Suzhen went to see a doctor

132
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,270
Mr. Zhao Zhenghao of the attic

133
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,400
Died

134
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,240
After I left

135
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,440
He's been drinking again.

136
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes

137
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,000
There's nothing wrong with the autopsy report.

138
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,670
but

139
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,420
Be careful when visiting patients

140
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,940
Dr. Yu Suzhen, if a suspicious death occurs around you

141
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,470
It's dangerous, you know.

142
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,780
How does it feel to go around in a circle?

143
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,640
Are you relieved?

144
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,440
doctor

145
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,470
My mother's condition worsened.

146
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,870
Young-eun's sister

147
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,770
Is that Ji-hoon?

148
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,800
elder sister

149
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,600
Our Zhixun

150
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,240
Oh my, our Ji-hoon has grown up so much.

151
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,800
Are you doing well?

152
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,020
Um

153
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,680
I heard

154
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
You became a police officer

155
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,670
Yes

156
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,740
Awesome. Well done.

157
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,820
To be able to grow so well

158
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,850
You must have suffered a lot alone these years.

159
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,700
It's really amazing

160
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,470
If uncles and aunts see

161
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,850
How happy I should be

162
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:23,840
yes

163
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,870
You were sickly as a child.

164
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,140
When going out to play

165
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,400
She always lies on Yingen's back and is carried back.

166
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,570
But you are growing up healthy now

167
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,900
It's a blessing

168
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,920
When I was a child,

169
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,100
Thanks to my sister for taking care of me

170
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,770
-Yeah. -Thank you.

171
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,770
Thank you for what?

172
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,300
Aunt

173
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,240
I'm sorry

174
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,040
After sending you to the orphanage

175
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,980
I couldn't take good care of you.

176
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
It's okay

177
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,340
After I went to the welfare home

178
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,650
You've come to see me several times.

179
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,970
I only feel grateful

180
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,770
You are here

181
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,200
Please get me some bottles of Pavolon.

182
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,800
Don't tell my husband.

183
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,170
Ah, could it be...

184
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,670
Is it because of insomnia?

185
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
If that's the case, then Barfron is too dangerous.

186
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,100
Why don't you call me over?

187
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,900
- I'm not dangerous. - Damn it.

188
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,940
There are experiments to be done.

189
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,050
It's a business need. Please help me get it.

190
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,200
OK

191
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,940
Please go back

192
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,940
What subjects should be chosen for the experiment?

193
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,720
What to choose?

194
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,590
What to choose?

195
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,270
What to choose?

196
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,520
Ah, hello

197
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,970
That's it

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,370
This brace supports the spine very comfortably

199
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,500
But pushing too hard could cause injury.

200
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,840
Now the length is adjusted

201
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,450
Just move gently and comfortably.

202
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,690
-Thank you. -Yes.

203
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,870
but

204
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,870
Are you always alone in the ward?

205
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,800
My daughter

206
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,290
I'm busy raising money and don't have time to come.

207
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,020
She wants me to get better treatment.

208
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you want to go back to the previous hospital?

209
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,940
I definitely don't want to go there

210
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,500
You don't know how much it hurts

211
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,150
It's clearly a life-saving treatment

212
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,740
I don't know why it hurts so much.

213
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,100
It's torture.

214
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
OK, I understand.

215
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,100
You take a rest

216
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,250
OK

217
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,000
Thank you

218
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,440
The patient

219
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,420
Um

220
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,570
If convenient

221
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,340
Can you accompany me for a walk in the park in front?

222
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,430
What

223
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,770
no

224
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,640
Is there a park in front?

225
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,770
Yes, the park in front

226
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,100
It's breathtakingly beautiful when the flowers bloom

227
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,720
But no flowers now

228
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,950
I would like to

229
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,740
But you are so busy

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,770
Do you have time?

231
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,200
That's why I ask you

232
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,370
The director of this hospital is my friend.

233
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,270
But too mean and stingy

234
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,990
No time for me to rest

235
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,340
So I wanted to use the patient as an excuse to go to the park in front

236
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,120
Be lazy

237
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,200
Then I'm fine too.

238
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,500
Are you off work now?

239
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,580
Yes, I worked the night shift last night.

240
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
Thanks for your hard work

241
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,670
- Take care. - Thank you.

242
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,450
By the way, my aunt is not in the ward now.

243
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,470
What happened?

244
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,740
No, Dr. Choi Dae-hyun took her

245
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,500
Went for a walk in the park in front

246
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,870
Ah, okay

247
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,240
Doctor Cui seems to see that she is bored all day long.

248
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,940
I took her out.

249
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,300
I should have been the one accompanying you

250
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,500
Thank you

251
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,870
But Dr. Choi Dae-hyun

252
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,770
Is it the male doctor in the white coat?

253
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,340
Yes, that's him.

254
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,100
Thank you. Go back soon.

255
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,570
-Okay, bye. -Okay.

256
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,370
-=Dr. Choi Dae-hyun=-

257
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,550
-=Dr. Choi Dae-hyun: Police Assisted in the Baflon Murder Case=-

258
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,720
-=Real names of key figures in the Bafron murder case revealed=-

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,870
-There are also reeds. -When the flowers bloom here

260
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,790
It's really beautiful

261
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,070
It would be nice to see it again.

262
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,700
It's not uncomfortable now, right?

263
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,970
- Do you want to go back? - It's okay.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,770
-Are you okay? -It's okay.

265
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,420
very nice

266
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,980
The pine trees are also very green

267
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,930
The director of this hospital

268
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,400
Still didn't accept my sincerity

269
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,800
good

270
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,430
-Okay. -Thank you.

271
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,940
Your daughter came really early today

272
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,770
I wish you guys a good time then.

273
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,310
Next time, please let me take a break.

274
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
-Thank you. -It's okay.

275
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,000
-Mom -Yeah

276
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,850
Don't follow that doctor out.

277
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,980
I heard he killed someone.

278
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,710
His targets are sick elderly patients

279
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
What are you talking about?

280
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,700
He's a good person.

281
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,770
I heard he helps people with euthanasia.

282
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,110
Because of this, he killed someone and was even imprisoned.

283
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,230
I'm telling the truth

284
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,900
Do you want me to find the report and show it to you?

285
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,000
And photos?

286
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,010
What

287
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
If you don't believe me, you can ask Zhixun.

288
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,160
He's a policeman, he knows better than anyone else.

289
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,260
oh

290
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,080
It seems that the hospital will be very noisy during this period because of me.

291
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,970
How long can I keep it secret?

292
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,440
I figured this was going to get out anyway.

293
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,520
Be sure to tell the patient or guardian

294
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,720
Ask for their forgiveness

295
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,980
I think they'd be scared too.

296
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,060
If it were me, I would be surprised too.

297
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,440
I like it here

298
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,020
If I go to the same hospital again,

299
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,990
I might as well go home.

300
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,230
What kind of treatment is that?

301
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,640
If I have to go to treatment, I won't go anywhere.

302
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,430
I might as well just die here.

303
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,640
If you want to leave, go on your own.

304
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,310
I know you are afraid that I will owe more debts and you are worried about the money.

305
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,400
So stop talking.

306
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,670
If you keep doing this, I'll become shabby.

307
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,750
I'm so incompetent at my age.

308
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,730
No money to treat my mother

309
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,860
My life is so empty and sad

310
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,870
So stop doing this.

311
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,810
Zhixun will drive to pick us up tomorrow morning

312
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,830
If you don't want to go to the previous hospital

313
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,790
I'll ask for a better hospital.

314
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,810
Let's go to another hospital.

315
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,740
Auntie might change hospitals

316
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,830
Finally made this decision

317
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,090
My sister asked me

318
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,170
Is it true that Choi Dae-hyun

319
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,350
Spent time in prison

320
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,180
Stand in your daughter's shoes

321
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,370
If I knew that doctors were connected to euthanasia

322
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,020
It must be hard for her to accept

323
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,150
But they're all excuses

324
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,190
My sister from the beginning

325
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,030
I want to be transferred to a hospital that can provide more treatment.

326
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,630
And Choi Dae-hyun is just her excuse

327
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:47,760
Please help me with the discharge procedures tomorrow.

328
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,410
good

329
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:01,960
I can go by myself

330
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,380
Aren't you going back to get your luggage?

331
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,850
Not much

332
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,540
You wait for me up ahead. I'll get ready myself.

333
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,790
I'll go with you

334
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,410
I'll help you with your luggage

335
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,630
Thank you, Ji-hoon

336
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,270
Why doesn't it work?

337
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,650
Just come in with shoes on.

338
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,280
The floor is cold

339
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,600
If you stay here for too long, your feet will get so cold they hurt.

340
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,830
I'll pack my luggage right away

341
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,100
What do you want to take?

342
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,680
- No need. - This one?

343
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,370
Are you surprised to see the conditions we live in?

344
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,640
This house doesn't feel like a home, it feels more like a warehouse

345
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,920
Have you been staying in the hospital?

346
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,230
The luggage is constantly decreasing. I don't live here much.

347
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,500
Almost all of them live in the hospital

348
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,670
How did my uncle die?

349
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,240
Cerebral hemorrhage

350
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,760
He suddenly fainted and passed away without saying a word.

351
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:21,510
So we didn't receive a penny of the money we were supposed to receive.

352
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,880
So many people came to ask for the money they owed

353
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,120
Then the restaurant closed

354
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,930
Later my mother cleaned the building

355
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,630
I don't pick jobs. I do everything.

356
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,690
In this case, even my aunt got sick.

357
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,700
It must be very hard for you to be alone

358
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,610
Nothing hard

359
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,000
I couldn't do anything for my mother.

360
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,190
This makes me feel sorry

361
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,390
so

362
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,990
I will do everything I can to get my mother treatment.

363
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,510
My mother is so pitiful

364
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,590
I want her to live at least one more day.

365
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,510
What

366
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:20,760
What's this

367
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,580
You just sit down

368
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,960
Doctor, thank you for this time.

369
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm really happy here

370
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,620
We didn't do anything for you.

371
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,210
You've all been very nice to me.

372
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,860
No need to accept the painful treatment that I have suffered enough

373
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,290
This makes me very happy

374
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,570
Is treatment painful?

375
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,450
Yes, the thought of using oneself to walk into

376
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,210
That boring place is painful enough.

377
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,110
But after all, that's what the child wants.

378
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,300
I still have to go

379
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,740
Do you want to talk to your daughter?

380
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:49,370
Although it is not appropriate to say such words in front of the Virgin Mary

381
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,000
But I want to decide for myself

382
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,520
My last journey, okay?

383
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,570
mom

384
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,950
mom

385
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,420
-=Yu Suzhen=-

386
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,820
What's the matter?

387
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,700
Kim Sun-joo disappeared in the hospital

388
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,380
Hey, brother

389
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:44,620
The road surveillance near Xizhen East Convenience Store captured

390
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,470
Old lady in hospital gown

391
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,810
Looks like Kim Sun Joo

392
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,540
It's still dark now. We have to wait a long time for the bus to come.

393
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,520
Come with me

394
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,030
I don't want to go there

395
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,670
What will happen if I go?

396
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,070
Sister is waiting for you

397
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,340
I have no confidence

398
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,970
Go there again to receive painful treatment

399
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,830
Zhixun

400
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,490
Auntie has a wish

401
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,500
Give me

402
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,490
Yingen

403
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,170
Mom, I'm sorry.

404
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:32,920
mom

405
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,190
Trust me again

406
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,260
I will make sure you get treatment and live longer.

407
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,140
What I can do

408
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,210
I'm not refusing treatment because I don't trust you.

409
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,880
Otherwise why

410
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:58,450
The debt you owe now

411
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,230
Even if I can't finish it in my lifetime

412
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,900
Then I can't abandon you.

413
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,950
How can not accepting treatment be considered abandoning me?

414
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,930
What is this thing?

415
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,030
Do you want to wait for me to die and die with me?

416
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,050
Now in debt to pay medical bills

417
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,180
When I die, do you want to die with me?

418
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,390
mom

419
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:01,680
us…

420
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,310
We have to live together

421
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,870
Let's die together.

422
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,370
I can't live without you

423
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,770
I don't want to live anymore

424
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,750
Yingen

425
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,750
Let me go now

426
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,030
mom

427
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,280
I won't send you away

428
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,280
I can't just send you away like this.

429
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,130
I'm in so much pain

430
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,760
It hurts so much now

431
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,420
It will definitely hurt more later

432
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm so scared

433
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,930
Even at this age, I'm still afraid.

434
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,630
So scared

435
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,880
What kind of treatment is this?

436
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,100
That will give you cancer.

437
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,160
I'd rather die.

438
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,180
I didn't know you were in so much pain, mom.

439
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,780
I didn't know you were so scared

440
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,910
Sorry, Mom

441
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,880
But I now

442
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,660
I don't want to receive treatment anymore

443
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,630
I just want to die

444
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,210
Enjoy looking at my daughter's face

445
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,180
yes

446
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,960
Before

447
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:56,930
We're both busy making money.

448
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,680
I couldn't even look at the other person's face properly.

449
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,780
Yes or no

450
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:06,960
yes

451
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,260
You know me before

452
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,910
Undergoing such painful treatment

453
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,010
How did you manage to hold on?

454
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,810
After treatment

455
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,280
night

456
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,230
Our daughter will come to see me

457
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
I want to see your face

458
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,930
so

459
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,560
So I can stick to it

460
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,860
I now

461
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:47,610
I want to take a good look at my daughter's face

462
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,110
Then die

463
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,030
I don't want to anymore

464
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,330
Taking that treatment again

465
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,960
Don't want to

466
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,710
Mother

467
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,010
Mom, I'm sorry.

468
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,560
Mom, I'm sorry.

469
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,660
Mother

470
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,010
Sorry, doctor.

471
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,180
I changed my mind.

472
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,960
I want my mother

473
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,830
Stayed in this hospital

474
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,680
Thank you for trusting us and letting her be treated here.

475
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,510
that...

476
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,860
I jumped to conclusions and said bad things about you.

477
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,380
sorry

478
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,760
No, I should have explained my situation to you in advance.

479
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,710
sorry

480
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,860
Thank you for helping me find my mother.

481
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,510
Won't

482
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,630
Well done, sister.

483
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,080
Let's meet here more often

484
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,410
Please give your aunt a good ride.

485
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,210
OK

486
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,460
Mother

487
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,930
- What? - Do you want to contact the aunts?

488
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:15,930
What

489
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,880
The last place you worked

490
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,010
Aren't you close friends with the aunties who clean the building?

491
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,460
Sometimes he'll call me.

492
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,960
If you can, that's fine.

493
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,080
I want to see them too.

494
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,430
Then I'll contact you.

495
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,510
Mother

496
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:36,810
Um

497
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,880
Tell me if you have anything you want to do

498
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,430
If you want to eat something, just tell me

499
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,260
I want to do these things for you

500
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,360
What's delicious?

501
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,780
Go to the park in front

502
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,960
Taking a walk

503
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,610
Let's chat more

504
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,780
Let's just live like this

505
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,280
We do everything we want to do with a smile

506
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,560
good

507
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,060
It's great here.

508
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,860
-Yeah. -It's great.

509
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,160
- When did you come? - Spring

510
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,480
- At that time? - Yeah

511
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,230
How nice it would be to come when it blooms

512
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
- There. - Yeah.

513
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,560
- There are a lot of reeds there. - Really?

514
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,910
- So happy. - Are you happy?

515
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,030
I'm very happy to be with you

516
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,760
I am also very happy with my mother

517
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,730
OK

518
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,910
good

519
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,810
It's great that everyone is so healthy.

520
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,710
-Yeah. -That's right.

521
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,210
I miss you so much, sister.

522
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,080
Is Captain Jin also fond of finding faults recently?

523
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,680
-She shows off her grandson every day. -He's so big now.

524
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,160
-She did it on purpose. -She's so beautiful.

525
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,230
So cute

526
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,180
This is the degree of pain

527
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,560
From 1 to 10

528
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,530
Make an annotation

529
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,460
Please tell me how many hours apart

530
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,560
What level of pain will occur

531
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,780
No, it's always changing

532
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,230
When my heart is very determined

533
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,660
About 5

534
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,660
When it rains

535
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,680
Or when you're worried

536
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,630
There are 10

537
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,060
but

538
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,360
Recently

539
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,430
It's all in this state

540
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,830
You must be feeling very uncomfortable

541
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,860
But enduring like this is truly remarkable.

542
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,330
Thanks

543
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,980
Always changing

544
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,530
When my heart is very determined

545
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,610
About 5

546
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,710
What

547
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,010
Did you say anything?

548
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,760
Hey

549
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,960
Where is this...

550
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,390
She's so old.

551
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,870
Maybe I just suddenly forgot.

552
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,370
She has a bad cervical spine. I only care about this.

553
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,740
The earlier you discover

554
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,270
There are more ways to stop the deterioration

555
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,970
Let’s pay more attention.

556
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,370
good

557
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,140
Thanks to you, she has been sleeping well recently.

558
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,840
Your mother

559
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,120
Did you sleep longer?

560
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,140
Yes

561
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,670
The pain seems to have eased a lot

562
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,690
My body seems to have recovered a little

563
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,740
I can walk better than before

564
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,490
Hurry up, kids, we have to go over there.

565
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,670
sorry

566
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,020
Mother

567
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,890
Mother

568
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,820
Mother

569
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,770
In cognitive screening exams

570
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,490
Abnormal symptoms have occurred

571
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,570
Although imaging examinations are still needed

572
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,540
Looking for a clearer reason

573
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,570
But I'm sure there's cognitive impairment.

574
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,470
Suddenly I can't recognize anyone.

575
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,870
No matter what, it's Alzheimer's

576
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,690
It's going much faster than expected.

577
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,790
She had been taking various medications

578
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,420
There must be something that makes the condition worsen faster.

579
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,990
Are you okay?

580
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,890
oh

581
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,190
Zhixun

582
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,920
Zhixun

583
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,790
Help Auntie

584
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,240
Didn't you promise me then?

585
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,620
Help me euthanize

586
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,240
What did you say?

587
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,690
What euthanasia?

588
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,240
Please talk to the doctor here for me.

589
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,340
Let them kill me

590
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,190
It's not easy to adjust the proportions properly.

591
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,770
It's harder than I thought to let someone pass away without pain.

592
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,420
Is that why my brother is so obsessed with that woman?

593
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,840
Did you agree to euthanize the patient?

594
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,490
I don't

595
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,640
Did she ask you for help?

596
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,470
Yes

597
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,170
That night

598
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,340
Auntie has a wish

599
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,020
Let me

600
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,790
Perform euthanasia

601
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,270
What do you mean?

602
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,620
Dr. Cui from Maria Hospital

603
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,240
It's not about euthanasia.

604
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,570
Was he just arrested?

605
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,790
He knows how to do it, right?

606
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,690
that

607
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,790
I want to die like this

608
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,190
So please ask him for my help.

609
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:59,420
That's murder. It's a crime.

610
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,670
Just consider it as helping me

611
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,320
Please help me just this once, Ji-hoon.

612
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,720
OK

613
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,370
I am in so much pain

614
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,470
I don't want to live anymore

615
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,990
If I knew what my aunt thought,

616
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,170
What about my sister?

617
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,540
What should I do with my sister?

618
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,220
-Young-eun.. -For my sister

619
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,420
You have to cheer up too.

620
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,140
We Yingen

621
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,840
In debt

622
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,920
I thought that after I died, I would die too.

623
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,740
I want to die without telling Young-eun

624
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,870
Let her not feel guilty

625
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,740
I can't say this to my sister.

626
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,120
I will tell my sister

627
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,820
Don't over-treat

628
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,890
Please give up this idea.

629
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,540
I'll pretend I haven't heard of it.

630
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,120
Auntie wants euthanasia

631
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,870
But why didn't you tell me

632
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,820
I didn't mean to help her.

633
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,090
And I think after she came here

634
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,990
Maybe changed my mind

635
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,280
but

636
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,040
After the onset of dementia, I started saying this.

637
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,460
You will quickly lose your memory

638
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,520
Shouldn't

639
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,370
Do you want to euthanize her?

640
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,240
don’t worry

641
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,940
I definitely won't help her.

642
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,410
Please organize your respective responsibilities and send them to me.

643
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,150
good

644
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,660
What's wrong

645
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,640
Ouch, why are you looking at me like that?

646
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,090
nothing

647
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,800
I just like looking at you

648
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:04,740
I like it so much, I want to see more

649
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,650
Um

650
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,450
Mother

651
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,360
I will remember it

652
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,970
Remember how much my mother loves me

653
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,000
What a good person

654
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,740
Did mom really ask you to do this?

655
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,980
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you in advance.

656
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,550
Let's help her do it.

657
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,390
Don't you think they look like Lee Yoon Hee and Xiao Song?

658
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,460
That's what I thought when I first saw it.

659
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,290
If Lee Yoon Hee hadn't died, she would have continued to raise Xiao Song.

660
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,820
I should live like them.

661
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,440
You can't solve all the pain in the world.

662
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,230
They are mother and daughter

663
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:44,050
I've never done what I wanted to do in my life.

664
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,870
Always busy with work

665
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,720
I never used the money I earned well.

666
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,260
Mom got sick

667
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,880
My daughter can only take care of me

668
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,420
At least let her go last.

669
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,990
Be more comfortable

670
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,320
You suffered so much because of euthanasia.

671
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,210
So absolutely not

672
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,970
I've been thinking a lot during this time.

673
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,150
About what I did

674
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,390
and its weight

675
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,540
There must be

676
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,750
Patients requiring euthanasia

677
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,170
I will look for pain relief treatment again.

678
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:34,220
Euthanasia is not the only answer

679
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:35,440
I know

680
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,730
Young-eun will be alone soon, even for her.

681
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,080
Please think about it again.

682
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,080
Sending my mother away in pain

683
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,530
It might make her more miserable.

684
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,920
There is no way to confirm the patient's wishes now.

685
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,530
So absolutely no euthanasia.

686
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,760
But the pain...

687
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,430
This hospital is run to save lives.

688
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,640
so

689
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,640
If you want to say something like that, don't come here starting tomorrow.

690
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:47,980
-=Silence in the room=-

691
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,100
I'm going to the general hospital today.

692
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,580
Blood tests and MRIs

693
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,090
Even if I want to deny it

694
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,080
The results will be out today.

695
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:08,410
I couldn't raise the medical expenses in time.

696
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,840
So I missed several surgeries.

697
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,290
If you receive treatment promptly

698
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,610
It should be very different from the current situation

699
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,310
I know you tried your best

700
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,270
We have only suffered

701
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,160
Only felt the pain

702
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:41,780
Dr. Yu

703
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,740
Help us

704
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,790
That's right

705
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,910
I now

706
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,560
I'm asking you to perform euthanasia.

707
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,950
We don't do that kind of treatment.

708
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,140
besides

709
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,090
Patients whose will cannot be confirmed

710
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:21,070
Euthanasia is unacceptable anywhere.

711
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,040
So you have to live in that kind of pain.

712
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:32,190
I will look for pain relief treatment.

713
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:35,150
Dr. Yu

714
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,790
Please help my mother

715
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,920
I'm sincere

716
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,570
Please don't ignore my mother.

717
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,520
Dr. Yu

718
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,530
Help us

719
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,280
Please help us

720
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,280
How are you doing?

721
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,130
That's right

722
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:22,780
I'm going straight to the point.

723
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,060
The mixing ratio is harder than I thought.

724
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,540
Have you practiced?

725
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:35,730
No, Bafron can make people die painlessly.

726
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,960
This is all lies. This is all fake.

727
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:43,240
If the ratio is not right, it will be very painful when you die.

728
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,260
Who did you test it on?

729
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:48,190
Don't worry, I didn't use it on anyone.

730
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:52,520
So you just work with me.

731
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,190
I am different from my brother. I can really scale up.

732
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,080
Don't appear in front of me again

733
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,510
I will never do what you want

734
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,380
What a shame. I will definitely do it.

735
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,220
If you don't help me, there's nothing I can do.

736
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,430
The client will die in pain

737
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,190
That's right

738
00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:25,190
besides

739
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:27,510
This is a gift

740
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:33,370
I'll give you a chance, think about it carefully.

741
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,270
I have to go home quickly

742
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,380
My Yingen must be waiting for me

743
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,390
Go home

744
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,800
I have to go home quickly.

745
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:20,840
Yingen is scared when she is alone at home

746
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:25,580
-=Ward A=-

747
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,240
DOA

748
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,760
-=Emergency Ward=-

749
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,080
Died upon arrival

750
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,530
Yingen

751
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:18,460
-=University Hospital=-

752
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:27,040
-=Severely ill emergency patients=-

753
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:21,840
Dr. Yu

754
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,300
Are you feeling unwell?

755
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,520
Um, why didn't I see my Yingen?

756
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:33,560
You don't know where my Yingen is, right?

757
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:38,870
Sorry, I didn't see it.

758
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:47,060
No, my memory is sometimes confused.

759
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,140
but

760
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,020
But occasionally

761
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,810
I dream that my Yingen was hit by a car

762
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,470
My dream is too real

763
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,820
I wake up crying when I sleep

764
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,560
Is my Yingen okay?

765
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:16,450
She should be fine.

766
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,470
Because I can't see the children,

767
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,770
I feel very uneasy

768
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,040
Doctor, please help me find Ying'en.

769
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,470
Could it be

770
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,980
That's not a dream

771
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:45,660
no

772
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,080
Our Yingen

773
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,690
Was there an accident?

774
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,130
Are you injured?

775
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,000
Was it injured?

776
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,050
Isn't he in the hospital now?

777
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,570
Where

778
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,010
ah

779
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:01,680
sorry

780
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,270
Our Yingen

781
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:10,570
Is there something unexpected?

782
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,810
ah

783
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,160
what to do

784
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:16,930
what to do

785
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,640
What should I do? My daughter

786
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,850
Where is she

787
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,140
No

788
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,090
Not my child

789
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,560
Where is she

790
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,530
What should I do? It's so pitiful.

791
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,850
What should I do? My daughter

792
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,480
Oh, what should I do?

793
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,450
Let me go

794
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:37,530
I want to go too.

795
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,200
Please let me go with her.

796
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,330
Please send me to my daughter.

797
00:51:41,330 --> 00:51:43,990
Why am I still alive?

798
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:46,850
Just to see her.

799
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,140
I can't survive this.

800
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,530
Let me go

801
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:50,510
Please

802
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,990
Send me to my daughter.

803
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,900
Send me to my daughter.

804
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,210
I can't survive this.

805
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:04,480
When my memory briefly returned yesterday

806
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:09,090
She realized that Ying'en was no longer alive.

807
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,290
Although I lost my memory soon after

808
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,990
After losing her daughter, she no longer wanted to live.

809
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,200
She wanted me to arrange euthanasia for her.

810
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,300
My sister also asked me the same thing.

811
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:27,510
At that time I thought

812
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,670
Just a momentary emotion

813
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,130
But it seems not

814
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:35,720
I want to ask you

815
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,230
Take good care of my mother

816
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,870
you

817
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,210
Talk to that doctor.

818
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,350
Let Mom

819
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,150
peacefully

820
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,650
Leave

821
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:57,740
Because of my greed

822
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,600
Mom in pain

823
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,000
One received treatment without any effect

824
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,100
She will know nothing in the future

825
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,950
Memories will also be forgotten

826
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:17,450
I can't let her die in pain.

827
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:19,790
sister

828
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:21,820
Please

829
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,250
Please help my mother.

830
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,470
So far, for whatever reason

831
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:49,290
I thought I could never give up on life.

832
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,030
But now I don’t understand

833
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:55,590
only

834
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:58,220
I hope Auntie can

835
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,060
A little calmer

836
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,400
I'll come back after get off work.

837
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,230
At that time we looked at each other and talked

838
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,400
It seems like I've encountered some difficulties.

839
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,950
That grandma is really pitiful.

840
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:03,770
It seems like dementia

841
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,840
You didn't even know your own daughter was dead, right?

842
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,330
-Who are you? -Me?

843
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:13,370
I am my brother's sister

844
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,330
Gu Guangzhe

845
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,230
You are very familiar with my brother, right?

846
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:24,540
Come work with me again.

847
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,220
Before that, I want to see your strength.

848
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,160
So I have a suggestion for you

849
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:31,160
No, I won't agree to any suggestion.

850
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,410
that is

851
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:36,550
Help me kill my husband.

852
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,800
Is your husband seriously ill?

853
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,890
No, his problem is that he is too healthy.

854
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,830
Because of excess energy, I always do useless things

855
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,130
Does it look like Lee Yoon Hee and Komatsu?

856
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:07,450
Let me die

857
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,930
Mom is sick

858
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:10,190
My mom

859
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,420
It's always been hard

860
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,570
My daughter has been taking care of me.

861
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,350
She has been suffering

862
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,930
Don't ignore my mom.

863
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,950
Please help my mom.

864
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:23,040
I

865
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,040
The last journey of life

866
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,360
Can't

867
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:30,610
Is it up to me to decide?

868
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,530
At least the last journey of life

869
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,410
It's time to leave peacefully, isn't it?

870
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:35,810
I hope Auntie can

871
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,770
A little more peaceful

872
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:39,600
Do you need that more?

873
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,010
Able to properly arrange the last journey of life

874
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,600
Make people peaceful

875
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:49,210
What about the medical skills that left?

876
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,100
Please send me to my daughter.

877
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,460
Why am I still alive?

878
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:59,540
Just to see her.

879
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,810
I can't survive this.

880
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:03,130
Let me go

881
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,250
Definitely

882
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,650
Patients requiring euthanasia

883
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,750
So to kill healthy people

884
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,980
Do you want me to euthanize him?

885
00:57:43,690 --> 00:57:44,720
Is that not okay?

886
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,690
It seems you have never killed a healthy person.

887
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:14,090
-=Treatment Room=-

888
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:27,870
Yu Suzhen

889
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:43,970
Please help me

890
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:16,320
-=Thank you for watching Death Doctor Mary=-
