00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,989
This drama deals with the sensitive topic of euthanasia, which may cause discomfort to viewers. Furthermore, the characters, events, places, and groups depicted in the drama have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed under safe conditions.

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,630
-=3 months ago=-

3
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,339
-Get out of the way. -What are these two people doing?

4
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,340
Please move aside

5
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,720
There was a big accident.

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,900
Is this your first time seeing a car accident?

7
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,150
Detective Pan Zhixun

8
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,140
You haven't eaten yet?

9
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,680
Someone else is coming soon, let's eat together then

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Who is coming

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,600
You should return to the scene.

12
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,820
Let's have a drink. Isn't it time to get off work?

13
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,810
It tastes good.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,139
I ordered it in advance

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,140
Offal soup is okay, right?

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,180
I can't eat those disgusting things.

17
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,780
I'll just drink the soup.

18
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,560
By the way, let's say hello.

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,470
This is the detective

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
His name is Zhao Xianyu

21
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,039
Diagnosed with a brain tumor and brain cancer, only six months left

22
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,020
I got to know him because he was in and out of prison due to various minor accidents.

23
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,810
Like you, I grew up in an orphanage and was always lonely.

24
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,490
Although the growing environment is completely different

25
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,239
But this figure, height and age

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,280
Almost the same as you

27
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,310
So Ji-hoon

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,470
From now on, you will become Zhao Xianyu

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,460
Do something with me.

30
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,450
Why are you eating so fast?

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,650
-Are you okay? - It's like this again

32
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,330
You asked me to go undercover again.

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,769
That's why I was sent to the traffic department.

34
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,770
This time is different

35
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,770
You know Senator Bai, right?

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,230
Member of the multi-election committee, former prosecutor Baek

37
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,310
Councillor Bai's story behind the scenes is different this time.

38
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,459
Someone has died because of that.

39
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,650
Hey, Park Kyung-soo...

40
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,289
Park Kyung-soo was like that because he committed a crime and was arrested.

41
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,480
When do you want to tell him?

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,890
Zhixun

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,470
Trust me

44
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,229
You have to go back to the major crime squad.

45
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,340
How long will you stand on the roadside?

46
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,530
Hey, everyone is waiting for you.

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,860
Zhixun

48
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,010
Pan Zhixun

49
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,540
Our group is complete with you here

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,250
The main suspect, Yu Suzhen, is an emergency room doctor
- =Drug-related serial murder case=-

51
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,190
Euthanasia for patients with limited time under the guise of consultation

52
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,399
A psychopathic woman who thinks she is God

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,059
-=Suspect Yu Suzhen=-

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,750
You go to Yu Suzhen's emergency room

55
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,790
Just say you're going crazy with pain and ask her to kill you

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,819
That woman must also be seen through by the people around her.

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,620
There will be a sense of crisis

58
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,100
If you've taken narcotic painkillers, use this to detoxify

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,350
Arrange a place

60
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,439
Find an old house in a remote place where few people go.

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,769
-=Pan Zhixun=-

62
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,260
Don't be soft-hearted

63
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,970
No matter how you beautify that woman

64
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,510
She's also a murderer.

65
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,219
But the way she takes care of the patients

66
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,750
It's okay. It's okay.

67
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,690
I don't know. She must be sincere.

68
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,990
Although I know how terrible these numbers represent

69
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,450
But I still hope you're alive

70
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,089
Priest's bag

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,730
Where is the package

72
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,290
Here

73
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,680
He left this behind.

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
sorry

75
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,790
I carefully looked for a way

76
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,840
Although I don't believe in God

77
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,260
But all I can do for you is pray

78
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,550
It doesn't matter

79
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,780
I'll take you there

80
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,700
Take you where you want to go

81
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,520
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

82

-=Episode 3=-

83
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,710
Hey, you must take Yu Suzhen to the house we arranged

84
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,570
Got it?

85
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,310
Don't feel guilty

86
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,790
Think about it carefully

87
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,870
You're not lying at all.

88
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,720
You are an orphan too, you are lonely too

89
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,620
Just treat it as if you were talking about yourself

90
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,680
-=October 2024=-

91
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,390
-=Time to Face Death=-

92
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
You are here

93
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
Want to see it?

94
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
uncle

95
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,130
You are here

96
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,069
Did Xiuying run away from home again?

97
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,070
no

98
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,120
You gave me good advice last time.

99
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,410
Xiuying is living well at home

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,040
So why did you come to meet me today?

101
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,470
I heard you were looking for Sooyoung's mother

102
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,750
Just looking through social media...

103
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,900
How did you know?

104
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,320
Xiuying's mother told me

105
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,940
Hello

106
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,519
My child was examined in the emergency room here a few days ago.

107
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,890
A copy of the inspection results is required to be submitted to the insurance company

108
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,880
Please tell me your name

109
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,520
Luo Youmei was born in 2008

110
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,249
-=Luo Youmei has no results=-

111
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,159
There are no test results.

112
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,600
He was discharged from the hospital after the examination.

113
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,430
There was no inspection that day.

114
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
You need to go directly to the emergency room or examination room to confirm it.

115
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,970
OK

116
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,820
She married someone else a long time ago.

117
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,460
Now a professor in the United States

118
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,580
Going to school and taking care of the kids

119
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,850
She said that although she was sorry

120
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,350
But she can't come to see Sooyoung

121
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,270
I'm sorry I should have told you in advance.

122
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,080
You have nothing to apologize for.

123
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,750
You don't want Xiuying to know, right?

124
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,850
right

125
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,010
Although he didn't say

126
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,740
But in his imagination

127
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,630
The mother I have never met is very warm

128
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,370
Don't let him feel that he can't even get his mother's love

129
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,860
Just leave this world

130
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,450
OK

131
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,870
Because of contamination during the sampling process

132
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,940
Dr. Yu Suzhen requested that the sample be destroyed

133
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,410
Why didn't you come to pick me up?

134
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,460
I was busy going to the hospital

135
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,870
Aunt Caiyan's Hospital

136
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,450
What are you doing there suddenly?

137
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,760
I heard there was a rumor at school that you fainted after taking some strange medicine.

138
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,080
Who said such a ridiculous thing?

139
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,230
Did Caiyan say that?

140
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,550
If you don't want to say it, don't say it.

141
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,630
Anyway, I will ask Caiyan's aunt

142
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,040
Mom, I'm sorry.

143
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,610
I was really scared.

144
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,060
You know I have stage fright.

145
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,610
I really thought it was a tranquilizer.

146
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,179
Is that why you asked Jaeyeon's aunt to keep it a secret for you?

147
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,140
No, not like that.

148
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,209
I didn't buy any medicine.

149
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,080
So where did you get the medicine?

150
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,640
I found this by chance in Caiyan's warehouse.

151
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,450
I was also surprised and scared

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,340
I was wrong

153
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,180
Mr. Zhao Xianyu

154
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,220
It seems that I can no longer participate in clinical trials.

155
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,359
If he doesn't want to, there's nothing I can do.

156
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,580
I'm sorry you worked so hard.

157
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,130
Actually, I felt it too.

158
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,710
He also looked tired in my last memory.

159
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,280
Thank you for considering him.

160
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,540
You are here

161
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,570
Yesterday I went to the hospital to get the results of my beautiful examination.

162
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,260
You deleted all her medical records.

163
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,750
Is it to conceal the Bafron stored in your house?

164
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,740
right

165
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,970
There has to be such solid evidence

166
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,960
That way she definitely can't run away

167
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,610
yes

168
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,910
I'll check if there are any blind spots.

169
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,899
If it's not enough, add a few more.

170
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,470
If that woman brings medicine

171
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,990
You must first ask her about the whole process of euthanasia.

172
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,540
In case of an accident

173
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,109
We also need to record her admitting it herself

174
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,330
Please rest assured

175
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,260
The person in charge of this matter was also very good at inducing confessions.

176
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Although the suspect

177
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,790
He chose suicide because of a sense of betrayal

178
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,500
What time did the woman say she would come?

179
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,090
If you want to watch, I'll arrange the occasion.

180
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
Hello

181
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,680
Use your brain.

182
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,240
You should be having dinner with your family at that time

183
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,330
You're conducting an undercover investigation.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,020
If the director knew in advance

185
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,510
Won't there be problems later?

186
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,830
sorry

187
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,290
Contact me when it's over.

188
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,510
They said they caught the suspect.

189
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
OK

190
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,110
Ouch

191
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,490
You said you own Pavlon to euthanize stray animals.

192
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,130
Do you think I will believe it?

193
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,700
I asked around and heard it's a drug that's banned from import.

194
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,180
What to do then

195
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Do you want to call the police?

196
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,440
Find out how I got that drug.

197
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,540
How did Youmei take the medicine?

198
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,590
Even if it was a mistake, my child is because of you.

199
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,610
The whole medication thing makes me mad.

200
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,090
I can't just let it go like this.

201
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,300
I will do everything I can to make you pay the price

202
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,090
Although the medicine was secretly taken away by Youmei

203
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,360
But I apologize for not managing the medication properly.

204
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,500
Although I want you to pay the price now

205
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,720
But I wasn't stupid in the process.

206
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,810
The extent to which my children are harmed by going to and from the police station

207
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,940
Please use other methods to solve it

208
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,940
It's just a waste of effort

209
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,510
Sooyoung's father has his mother's contact information

210
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,300
-Thank you. -You mean don't tell Sooyoung, right?

211
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,830
- Just pretend you didn't find it.

212
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,570
It's not that I think Sooyoung is too pitiful.

213
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,460
So I want to actively help

214
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,390
How to help

215
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,190
Do you want to convince his mother?

216
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
No

217
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,220
I heard that Xiuying hasn't confessed to that girl yet

218
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
so what

219
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
today

220
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,429
I will make him confess successfully.

221
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,430
never mind

222
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,800
I'd rather not die with her.

223
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,410
Hello

224
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,209
If you don't tell others that you have a terminal illness, the news will spread all over the school.

225
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,790
Should she know too?

226
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,220
Then just confess to her directly.

227
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,519
If the confession fails

228
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,730
You don't need to worry about why.

229
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,880
Because death can cover everything

230
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,199
There is only one benefit to death

231
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,100
No one will curse a dead person.

232
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,190
If he curses, he's a jerk.

233
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,050
That won't work either.

234
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,069
I'll leave a bad impression on her.

235
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,240
Where is it rotten?

236
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,880
I'll help you dress up.

237
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,700
I even bought a men's cushion powder

238
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,520
I will make you an idol

239
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,170
Those are not problems

240
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,530
So what is the problem?

241
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,750
I have a smell

242
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,140
What

243
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,200
My grandma had this smell before she died

244
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,140
I think I smell bad.

245
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,560
I can't tell Huijing about my relationship

246
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,520
If this smell appears on a person

247
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is death not far away?

248
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,560
But using this method

249
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,420
Does it really remove the smell?

250
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,010
able

251
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,310
Hi Huijing

252
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,140
Huijing, it's you

253
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,360
Hi

254
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,989
I'm Zhao Xiuying, don't you remember me?

255
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,890
Nice to see you

256
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,600
You're really embarrassing.

257
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,650
Hey, hey, you first, you first

258
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,370
Please put some perfume on first.

259
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,699
Come Come

260
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,270
She won't be attending evening self-study today...

261
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
Dr. Yu

262
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,340
I heard that after the funeral

263
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,890
She found the people who had taken care of Cui before.

264
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,180
Thank them

265
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,859
Thanks

266
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,079
I gave gifts to other doctors.

267
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,640
But I thought I wouldn't see you today

268
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,280
So the gift was left in the car and not brought up.

269
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,369
It's not an expensive gift though.

270
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,530
But can you please accept it?

271
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,310
Can I thank you for taking care of my husband?

272
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,630
I feel a little embarrassed to go empty-handed

273
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,339
I'll go to the grocery store.

274
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,360
Give me 20,000 won

275
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,110
Need not

276
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Hello

277
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,450
I've bought him what he needs.

278
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,880
-I wish you a speedy recovery. -Hello

279
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,770
-=Jo Hyun-woo=-

280
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,660
Hey, call the nurse.

281
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,670
OK OK

282
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,550
-=Husband Detective=-

283
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,030
Didn't I tell you to contact me after this?

284
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Any questions?

285
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,290
Zhao Xianyu, who was hospitalized in the relief hospital, disappeared

286
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,090
Did he pass away peacefully?

287
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,890
I didn't know he was so desperate.

288
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm sorry I couldn't agree to his request.

289
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,240
I'm scared

290
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,070
The guilt I will feel in the future

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,250
Saying I love him

292
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,709
But I don't want to admit it

293
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,450
The only thing I can do for the one I love is to send him to death

294
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,920
I regret it

295
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,170
If I had agreed to his request at that time

296
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,910
Then when he was asleep

297
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,550
At least I can still hold his hand

298
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,850
This is aromatherapy

299
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,070
I also sent it to other doctors.

300
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Here

301
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,990
There is a brochure of the Serenity Foundation

302
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,090
Euthanasia related information Your business card

303
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,090
And I don't know about the phone.

304
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,940
I found this while sorting through my husband's stuff.

305
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,990
I don't know what to do with these things

306
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,490
don’t worry

307
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,910
From today on I will delete you from my memory

308
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,170
Thank you

309
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,000
Help my husband

310
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Thanks

311
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,609
Hey, aren't you dying? Why are you still in class?

312
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,789
Time is running out, why don't you go out and play?

313
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,560
You weren't supposed to come to class, so why are you here today?

314
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,670
I kind of regret it.

315
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,209
Want to learn as much as possible

316
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,230
Do you really have such thoughts?

317
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,440
- Before I die - Yeah.

318
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,290
classmates

319
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:28,940
-Hello, teacher. -Hello, teacher.

320
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,360
Hey, why didn't Huijing come?

321
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,490
She said this class overlaps with her math cram school.

322
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Not coming

323
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,170
Study hard and don't regret it

324
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,770
Hey, where are you going?

325
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,700
Welcome

326
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Hello

327
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,040
What to eat

328
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,870
I want to eat this

329
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Are you Xiuying?

330
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Hui Jing

331
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,820
You go up first

332
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,630
Why are you here?

333
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
The mathematics department I attend is in this building.

334
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
I see

335
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,390
I heard

336
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
How are you

337
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,330
have no idea

338
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,220
It feels quite painful

339
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,700
But I can't believe I'm going to die from all this pain

340
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,770
No sense of reality

341
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,100
Will you really die?

342
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,030
The doctor said I have two weeks left.

343
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,650
Zhao Xiuying Zhao...

344
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,970
Huijing that...

345
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
I…

346
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,660
I miss you very much

347
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,320
What

348
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,070
So I want to say

349
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,720
When I have time later

350
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,390
I don't have time now, so

351
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,460
Do you want to meet me later?

352
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,250
My mother will pick me up after class today

353
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,390
Yeah, right

354
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,470
Yeah, yeah, you have to go home.

355
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,140
Can we meet tomorrow?

356
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,220
I have extracurricular tutoring tomorrow so I can postpone it.

357
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,860
Can you meet me tomorrow?

358
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,850
Um

359
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,450
Okay, see you tomorrow.

360
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,490
good

361
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,700
Choi Kang-yoon's wife came to see me

362
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:15,040
What

363
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,580
Did she call the police?

364
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,780
No, she shouldn't have called the police.

365
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,760
I don't know why, but she seems to be helping me cover up the truth

366
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,400
Anyway, we have to be careful recently

367
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,880
And there's only one bottle of medicine left.

368
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,650
Why

369
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,780
Wasn't there one box left?

370
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,539
When a physical altercation occurs in a hospital

371
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,210
The cabinet and medicine fell over.

372
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,950
I can just go to Hyunwoo's house by myself.

373
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,190
Would it be too much of a stretch for you to go by yourself?

374
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,460
Although it will be a bit reluctant

375
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,410
But I want to send Hyunwoo off alone

376
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,290
Okay, you two probably need to do some final tidying up.

377
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,370
Be careful on the road

378
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:09,970
Anyway, I have to accompany Xiuying to meet my girlfriend

379
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,210
They have an appointment to meet tomorrow

380
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,829
No time left

381
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,150
It's a pity, but I'll give up.

382
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,910
Don't stop me

383
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,140
I have self-respect as an expert.

384
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,550
It got on my body

385
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,930
Got it

386
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Hui Jing

387
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,130
Let's go over there

388
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,830
Go that way

389
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,920
-=Dr. of All Things Plumbing, Electrical, and Pipes=-

390
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,020
How could I not know?

391
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,620
Do you know I like you?

392
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,749
When you were in elementary school

393
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,650
Help me eat all the broccoli and bell peppers in my school lunch

394
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,970
I forgot my indoor shoes, so you gave me yours.

395
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,820
Barefoot

396
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,250
How could I not know?

397
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,370
That was all when I was a kid.

398
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Damn

399
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,920
If I had time left

400
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,920
Will you like me too?

401
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
Instead of the current relationship

402
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,870
This

403
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,170
I don't know because we've never been together.

404
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,170
yes

405
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,820
There's no time left

406
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,720
I heard about you

407
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,520
I cried for a long time

408
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,750
Holding hands

409
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,870
Because I'm dying

410
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,070
Is that why you're nice to me?

411
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,000
Although there is also this reason

412
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,270
but

413
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,400
If it's not you who's dying

414
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,900
I wouldn't be so sad.

415
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
How are you

416
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,719
Are you okay?

417
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
Xiuying

418
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,870
what to do

419
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,199
- Xiuying-Who are you?

420
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,299
I'm Xiuying's doctor.

421
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,620
I was a little worried so I waited nearby

422
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,900
sorry

423
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,020
sorry

424
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,200
I'm really happy today

425
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm leaving first

426
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,049
Hello

427
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,170
No, I'll carry you.

428
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,750
No, brother

429
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,020
Huijing is looking at me

430
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,000
I just want to leave her looking handsome.

431
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,099
well

432
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,250
You catch me

433
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,770
Very handsome, very handsome

434
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,420
Xiuying

435
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,770
We must meet here again tomorrow

436
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,650
You will come, right?

437
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,400
You can go now

438
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,450
Let's go

439
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,950
Wow Sooyoung

440
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,520
I really envy your life.

441
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,149
Much better than me

442
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,619
Great confession

443
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,520
They all did a great job

444
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,420
Right

445
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,600
I'm doing fine today.

446
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,769
I'll give you some painkillers when you get home.

447
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,550
Have a good date with Huijing tomorrow

448
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,770
Brother
What

449
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,220
I just want

450
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,970
Let's go today

451
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Why

452
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,570
What I want to do

453
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,370
All done

454
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,720
Let me go today

455
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,350
At once...

456
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,560
Just in case

457
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,360
If something goes wrong

458
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,630
You just eat this

459
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,979
Although these values tell me

460
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,010
You will die

461
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,280
But I hope you survive

462
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,409
Dr. Yu

463
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:11,630
-=Maria Welfare Hospital=-

464
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:13,179
I received news from other priests in the hospital.

465
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,480
What news

466
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,560
Said Hyun Woo is in the hospital now

467
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:26,030
A body covered with newspaper was found at the subway station

468
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,530
that...

469
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,860
I've been praying that he's safe.

470
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,080
But they said Hyun Woo was dead

471
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:49,179
are you sure

472
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,080
Yes, the identity has been confirmed.

473
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,460
Who is she talking to?

474
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,759
But I can't go to the hospital now.

475
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,980
Dr. Yu, could you go there for me?

476
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,480
sorry

477
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,860
I have something to do now

478
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,180
Contact you again later

479
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,260
What happened?

480
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,080
I heard that I care about a patient

481
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,960
Died

482
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,710
It seems I'm a little nervous

483
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,560
I'm going to get a glass of water

484
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,810
What's going on?

485
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,460
Can the camera only capture this far?

486
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,680
- It seems there's no arrangement there. - Damn it.

487
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,370
-=Rosenspan 8 Acetaminophen=-

488
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,409
I remember this

489
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,480
He said he had a history of allergies.

490
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,079
Do not take acetaminophen

491
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,330
Let me prescribe him some ibuprofen.

492
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:49,490
-=Rosenspan 8 Acetaminophen=-

493
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,910
Come Come

494
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,830
Hyunwoo, you should drink too.

495
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,330
Wait until you relax before doing it

496
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,229
Did she add something to the water?

497
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:55,810
Did you add anything?

498
00:37:55,811 --> 00:37:57,129
I don't know, we didn't see it.

499
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,210
It's a blind spot.

500
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,260
What to start with now

501
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,800
Wait a mininute

502
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,400
I left something in the car.

503
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,750
Go out

504
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,100
-=Doctor of Everything=-

505
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,280
-=Dr. of All Things Plumbing, Electrical, and Pipes=-

506
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,050
- Damn it. - He ran away.

507
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,850
It's me. Are you okay?

508
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,000
Why are you shutting down?

509
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,030
Now

510
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,470
We have to send Xiuying away now

511
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,900
You bring the medicine.

512
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,850
sorry

513
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,140
No medicine now

514
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,040
Zhao Xianyu

515
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,900
hateful

516
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,300
That man is a policeman

517
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,470
What

518
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,200
Are you okay?

519
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,710
I'm fine

520
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,840
Damn

521
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,810
But what to do

522
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,529
I have to get my medicine now.

523
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,199
But Soo-young is the only one here

524
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,900
His father is on his way.

525
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,629
Xiuying wants to proceed now, right?

526
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,630
right

527
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,930
Severe vomiting

528
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,209
One careless move will lead to shock

529
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:57,540
It's too late now.

530
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,630
Then you take care of Xiuying

531
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,519
Tell me the contact information so I can get the medicine

532
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,410
But a few days ago, I couldn't contact the person I was trading with.

533
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,500
What about the others?

534
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,229
Doesn't anyone have medicine?

535
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,410
The representative should have

536
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,370
No, it's too dangerous for you to go.

537
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,709
I've always told you that if you're in danger

538
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,140
Push everything onto me

539
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:23,850
No, no, no

540
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,759
It will be difficult for you to deal with drug traffickers alone

541
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,910
I am a doctor

542
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,750
Isn't Xiuying in great pain now?

543
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,420
There's no time left. Tell me where to go.

544
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:17,500
Did you drop something again?

545
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,590
The number you dialed could not be connected...

546
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,650
Did you say you were Dr. Cui's friend?

547
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,549
I remember he took a box not long ago

548
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,030
Is it finished so soon?

549
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:59,530
Very urgent

550
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,750
I will give you enough money

551
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,850
You should give me the money.

552
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,590
Do you know how big a mistake you've made?

553
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,720
To make a deal, you have to keep your mouth shut, but...

554
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,520
You actually came here so rashly?

555
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:23,190
You ask me for something so easily.

556
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:25,969
If you're not careful, you'll end up in jail for life.

557
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,080
But you said it so lightly

558
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:31,170
sorry

559
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,830
The secret will never be leaked

560
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,040
If the secret is leaked, we will also be in big trouble.

561
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,270
I can give you everything you want

562
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,090
I want Baflon right now

563
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm going crazy if I can't contact you

564
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:57,530
Is everything ok?
Got the medicine

565
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,510
I'll tell you the details later. Is Xiuying okay?

566
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,200
Are you ready?

567
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,110
Um

568
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,980
Come and help me

569
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:43,870
sorry

570
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:46,940
I tried my best

571
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,900
But I couldn't find your mother.

572
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,260
Dad, I'm sorry.

573
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,880
Maybe your mother hates me.

574
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,690
So I hid very tightly

575
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
So that's it

576
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,090
dad

577
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,700
But I have something to ask of you.

578
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,270
good

579
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,660
You said I could promise you

580
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,510
Do you know Huijing?

581
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:18,390
Um

582
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,260
My friend since kindergarten

583
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,420
She will wait for me in the park tomorrow

584
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,490
Dad, please explain it to her.

585
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:30,530
Don't scare her.

586
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,290
Xiuying

587
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,770
Are you really not going to see her?

588
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,910
A smaller dose

589
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,040
Can hold on until tomorrow

590
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,440
If I go see her again tomorrow

591
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,620
Huijing will definitely fall in love with me

592
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,610
That would be very sorry for her.

593
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,430
That's right

594
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:03,730
Huijing will definitely fall in love with you

595
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,200
Dad, please explain it to her for me.

596
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,730
good

597
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:11,420
I will

598
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,870
Xiuying

599
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,100
sorry

600
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:24,430
Daddy couldn't give you a healthy body

601
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,000
There's nothing I can do.

602
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,310
Dad, please take care of your health

603
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,740
good

604
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:45,910
dad

605
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,150
I really love our Sooyoung

606
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,330
Teach you a lesson every day

607
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:54,960
Angry at you

608
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,380
but

609
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,190
I did it because I thought it was for your own good.

610
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,100
If it hurts you

611
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,970
I'm really sorry.

612
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:16,410
Really

613
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:17,930
Um

614
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:21,320
I thought Dad...

615
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,180
I feel ashamed

616
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,750
I really appreciate you

617
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:31,210
And you

618
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,690
A great grandson for grandma.

619
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,960
It's good for me too

620
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,020
You don't have a mother

621
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:42,390
But no dissatisfaction

622
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,100
It's very hard to endure

623
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,610
Dad knows everything

624
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
Thanks

625
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,260
dad

626
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,400
Xiuying

627
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,870
and Dad

628
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,580
Stay one more day

629
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,060
dad

630
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,420
dad

631
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,100
dad

632
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,060
Um

633
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,300
sorry

634
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:42,960
I don't want that

635
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,650
Since the diagnosis

636
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,930
I never

637
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,290
Be happy like today

638
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,050
I want to leave now

639
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,900
that

640
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,300
Don't want this cup.

641
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:32,400
The cups our family made together at the playground

642
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,160
I want to use the one with the family photo

643
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,010
Drink from that cup

644
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:53,870
Xiuying

645
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,030
Don't be afraid

646
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,880
Dad is here

647
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,680
It's fine

648
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,810
Because my dad is here

649
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,150
So don't be afraid of Sooyoung

650
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,150
My son

651
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,060
You won't be in pain anymore

652
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:20,650
It's fine

653
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,120
It's fine

654
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,130
It's fine

655
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:34,390
It's okay. It's okay.

656
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,510
It's fine

657
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,100
He's gone

658
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:55,620
You can cry now

659
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,870
Xiuying handed me the phone.

660
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,440
I think I should pass it on to you.

661
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,900
good

662
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,950
-=Collected Content=-

663
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,860
dad

664
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,300
I didn't want to say it

665
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,510
But I think I should say thank you.

666
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,260
Thank you for lying to me

667
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,980
Actually, I also know my mother's SNS

668
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,660
I also know her phone number

669
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,190
I found them all

670
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,340
I know you're afraid I'll be sad

671
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:56,200
So I didn't find it

672
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:03,200
I'm really sad.

673
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,790
For mom

674
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:09,460
Is it your younger brother?

675
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,020
Anyway

676
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,170
There are other children

677
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,410
There's nothing I can do.

678
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,410
I understand her

679
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,000
So dad shouldn't hate mom either.

680
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,480
Because I

681
00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:40,830
Have a good father

682
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,580
That's enough

683
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,190
Thank you, Dad.

684
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,180
Xiuying

685
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,980
Can't come?

686
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,270
Xiuying said

687
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,560
Sorry for not complying

688
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,690
The promise to meet here again today

689
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:11,370
He promised me that we would meet here again today.

690
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:15,910
yes

691
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,730
Suddenly it happened

692
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:25,440
Uncle apologizes to you on his behalf

693
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:29,200
besides

694
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,720
Thank you for being good friends with Sooyoung

695
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,670
Until the end

696
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,570
Left very good memories

697
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:41,360
Left behind beautiful memories

698
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,520
I really thank you very much

699
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,410
Xiuying

700
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,140
Is it painful?

701
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:51,820
Meeting you

702
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:54,880
What a beautiful day

703
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,750
As I was talking, I fell asleep smiling.

704
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,620
peacefully

705
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,950
Just like sleeping

706
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,990
Is Sooyoung really dead?

707
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,460
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

708
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,399
What you're doing now is crazy

709
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,959
How did you become like this?

710
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,740
Is it okay to deceive others as long as you achieve your goal?

711
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,390
They will openly target us in the future.

712
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,419
Euthanasia is euthanasia, right?

713
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,829
What you want

714
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,299
Be honest, Yu Suzhen

715
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,569
Do as I say

716
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,650
I will take responsibility. I can do it.

717
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:03,130
How many people are here? I'm asking you how many people are here.

718
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,610
You're killing people.

719
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,310
I must catch you
