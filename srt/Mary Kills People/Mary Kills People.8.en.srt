The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

3
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:37,820
Mother

4
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,370
Mom, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,630
Sorry, Mom

6
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,300
The patient was taken to the emergency room this morning

7
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,300
It seems to have stabilized a bit now.

8
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,600
thank you

9
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,330
Is it Ye-na?

10
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,330
Um

11
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,370
Where did you go yesterday

12
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,070
Go find mom

13
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,870
Is she doing well?

14
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,700
Same old thing

15
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
There's just a lot of weeds growing.

16
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,350
Messy

17
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,730
Why did our mother live such a miserable life after her death?

18
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,930
I miss my mom too.

19
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,600
Ye-na

20
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,630
I first

21
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,930
Can't you just stay with your mother?

22
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,400
Our mother

23
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,800
Haven't you been alone for too long?

24
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,900
Alone

25
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,130
I went to accompany her

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll do my best to serve you too.

27
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,700
You just stay here

28
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,010
Stay here for a long time

29
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,830
long time

30
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,270
Just come to us again.

31
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,270
Okay

32
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,150
sorry

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
I didn't know you were so sincere.

34
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,800
I didn't know you would work so hard.

35
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,470
Then do what you want.

36
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,900
Go to your mother

37
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,450
Treat her well for me

38
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,000
Got it?

39
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,170
I went to see Dr. Yu

40
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:14,300
Thank you

41
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,360
Received the commission

42
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,170
I don't have any medicine right now, so I can't accept the commission.

43
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,130
But the patient's condition is urgent.

44
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,800
Who is the client?

45
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,030
It's my brother

Although the body was found in the lake

49
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,900
But there's no water in the lungs.

50
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,670
It seems to have been processed after death

51
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,130
As you can see, the victim was shot.

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,650
The cause of death was excessive bleeding from a gunshot wound.

53
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,330
gunshot wound to the head

54
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,030
There are also traces of gunpowder and gas that can be observed.

55
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,570
It appears to have been shot at close range.

56
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,400
It is speculated that before he sank into the lake with his car

57
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,700
I've had cardiac arrest.

58
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,570
Did the autopsy determine the type of gun?

59
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:22,600
The gun looks

60
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,100
It's a homemade gun

61
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,100
All the things I like

62
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,270
I want to eat as soon as I feel better

63
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:46,470
But recently I can't touch it at all

64
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,600
I want to stuff it into my mouth

65
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:51,030
Flowing with gravy

66
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:53,170
chewing meat

67
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,330
If I had known this earlier

68
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,170
When you are healthy, you should eat more

69
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,480
What a pity

70
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,800
It's also the food I like.

71
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,570
Your food taste

72
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,600
Exactly the same as me.

73
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,270
but

74
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,000
How could you give me such a thankful offer?

75
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,230
I heard that the medicine is not only hard to get

76
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,430
It is also not easy to handle

77
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,900
You are my benefactor

78
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,800
Didn't you help me and my brother a lot?

79
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,470
I heard that your trip to Switzerland was ruined.

80
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,070
I'm really, really sad.

81
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,470
So I asked around.

82
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,200
I didn't expect to get the medicine like this.

83
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,470
Let's first confirm whether we can make people die painlessly.

84
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,300
Conditions later

85
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,130
How to confirm that?

86
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,430
Is it among your friends?

87
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,930
Is there anyone willing to be a guinea pig and die?

88
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,850
That's with my lawyer present.

89
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,230
Give me the medicine

90
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,600
After I die peacefully

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,500
What has been agreed upon will be handled by my lawyer.

92
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,900
Give it to your representative

93
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,900
How much amount do you want

94
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,670
Now in front of Representative Chen

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,170
Now on this occasion...

96
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,000
How much can you offer

97
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,150
Any amount is fine

98
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,770
You can take my money.

99
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,600
You can also want my building

100
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,300
Just pick it.

101
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,530
I'm going to die anyway.

102
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,100
What else is there to be reluctant about?

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,060
I just want

104
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,800
As long as I can die without pain

105
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,760
That's enough

106
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,430
-Is the practice going well?

107
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,400
Hold on

108
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,530
Dr. Yu

109
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,960
Thank you for coming

110
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,330
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
No medicine now

112
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,300
I'm not sure when it will be possible

113
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,250
Ah, it's okay.

114
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,330
Ye Na also agreed

115
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,330
Doctor, you also promised to do it

116
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Just wait a little longer and this pain will end

117
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,560
I feel much better when I think about it this way.

118
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,430
Until then, Mr. Gun-soo

119
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,600
If there's something you want to do, do it.

120
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,060
Then I...

121
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,000
While you're looking for medicine

122
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,800
Can I go on a trip with Ye-na?

123
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,230
Do you want to travel?

124
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,900
Um

125
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,380
I want to go to Gangwon-do to see the sea

126
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,250
It might be painful, is that okay?

127
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,960
Ye-na, you're a great nurse. You'll take good care of him.

128
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,360
Before going, go to Father Yang's hospital

129
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,930
I'll prepare what's needed.

130
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,010
yes

131
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,860

Or where you want to go, just say

138

Don't worry here

143
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,060
Let's go on a trip with my brother.

144
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,910
I'm sorry you're so busy and I have to leave alone.

145
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,100
I will work harder when I come back

146
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,700
You're doing very well now.

147

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,160
We'll see what happens here.

149
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,060

-Okay, thank you. -Thank you.

Ah, come with me to the medical equipment shopping street later.

152
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,660
The patient is running out of toilet pads and medicines

153
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,010
I forgot

154
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,000
At this moment, I was as happy as if I had seen the Lord.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,860
I have to go in and see what I need.

156
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,600
I will go well

157
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,000

- Be careful on the road. - I'm leaving.

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,310

Um

So you're going to wait here until your mother closes the stall?

179

Come

180
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,660
Can we take the blanket away?

Let's go

185
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
Is the child's mother no longer doing business?

186
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,650
I left her here and didn't take her away for a long time.

If you leave it here, you can either throw the cart away.

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,960
She still owes money.

189
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,030
A little secret

190
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,830
I'll pay for that.

191
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,700
Fifty thousand won a month, right?

192
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,680
100,000 won per month

193
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,410
The price has increased

194
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,420
It's increased a lot.

195
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,070
well

196
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,160
Please take care of the cart for a while.

197
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,530
-Okay. -Okay.

198
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,280
Xiaosong will play hide-and-seek with his uncle from now on.

199
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,710
-Okay? -Okay

200
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,670
Be careful with your head

201
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,950
Driver, please take her to the place I told you.

202
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,910
Okay, no problem.

203
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,150
Xiaosong, you go first.

204
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,290
You're such a torture, kid.

205
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,950
I really want to beat you up

206
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,050
Let's go

207
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,280
Why don't you come with that little one?

208
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,790
Wouldn't it be better to follow you wherever you go?

209
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,510
There is a patient who must see Yu Suzhen

210
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,550
She had promised me before

211
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,790
She'll do anything as long as she can get something.

212
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,240
I already gave her the stuff.

213
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,490
What's the name of that little guy?

214
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,830
Her...her name is Xiaosong

215
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,860
Well, call her Xiaosong or Mushroom?

216
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,150
Do you think her mother's death was easy?

217
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,340
Yu Suzhen is crazy and wants to choose her own patients

218
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,580
But that's ridiculous.

219
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,200
If she refuses my order again,

220
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,260
If she disobeys my orders again

221
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,830
I won't be able to do anything by then.

222
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,030
So if you want to save your friend

223
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,030
What you should do

224
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,860
Convince her to bring her here.

225
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, I...

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,280
No, no, wait a minute.

227
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,440
represent

228
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,940
Let me try it

229
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:25,870
You?

230
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,020
Who are you selling dog-skin plasters to?

231
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,660
-Are you a doctor? -I'm talking to the representative about something important.

232
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,310
You say it

233
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,400
yes

234
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,010
I was the first to talk about euthanasia.

235
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,720
After my medical license was revoked

236
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,930
When my hands are so shaky that I can't have plastic surgery

237
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,080
That's when I started, so

238
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,870
I can try it

239
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,400
Can you really

240
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,050
-Are you sure? -Yes.

241
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,290
But I need your help to keep me out of the sight of the police.

242
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,200
I can't be like Yu Suzhen

243
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,710
It can't be detected in the autopsy report.

244
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,160
But as long as you help stop the police

245
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,770
Knock knock knock Hello

246
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
You little rascal

247
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,560
Are you happy watching the sea?

248
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,700
Yeah, happy

249
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,700
Where do you want to go next?

250
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,160
What else do you want to do?

251
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,310
I have something special I want to do

252
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,680
What?

253
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,460
Let's go see Dad.

254
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,220
I miss him

255
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,940
Did you say you were coming to Gangwon Province just to see him?

256
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,840
Doesn't dad live in a nursing home nearby?

257
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,020
I know he was trying to avoid loan sharks.

258
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,060
I've lived here since last year.

259
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,140
We finally made it here.

260
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,050
Do you really have to see him?

261
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,780
I just want to reconcile all the things I feel guilty about.

262
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,350
Leave with peace of mind

263
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,540
I know you feel uncomfortable

264
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,080
Come with me

265
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,240
After all, this is the last time, okay?

266
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,440
From there to here

267
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,310
Over there Over there

268
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,840
Collect them all

269
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,010
That that

270
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,860
And that and this

271
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,030
Bring me your leather shoes

272
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,490
Pack up all the leather shoes on the right

273
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,700
Tom Brady

274
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,170
This is the doctor who's here to help you.

275
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,910
He used to be an excellent plastic surgeon.

276
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,580
Now the good Samaritan

277
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,360
A kind of kind killer

278
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,030
Your task is simple

279
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,970
It is to let our representative Chen rest in peace without pain

280
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,220
And he is also a patient who meets the criteria set by Dr. Yu and you.

281
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,770
Set a date as soon as the building transfer documents are ready

282
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,170
OK

283
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,660
I confirmed that the representative passed away peacefully without pain.

284
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,900
The file will be given to you

285
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,110
If you die in pain

286
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,860
Then the contract is void.

287
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,780
If he makes a sound of pain during the process

288
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,970
Or if there is a frown after death

289
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,160
There will definitely be no reward.

290
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,360
There's no way to guarantee your safety.

291
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,180
Don't worry, I won't tolerate it.

292
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,450
This kind of thing happens

293
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,050
Are you coming to my doorstep to scare my family?

294
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,780
Have you forgotten that I'm going to sue you for stalking?

295
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,850
We found Kim Si-geon's body.

296
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,470
The suspect is missing

297
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,740
So there are no more clues to find the criminal?

298
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,180
Do you hope so?

299
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,020
So this is why you came to see me

300
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,580
Because the clues are gone.

301
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,530
The guys who killed Jin Shijian

302
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,280
The next target might be you.

303
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:04,960
Can police say this to a strong suspect?

304
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,350
Do you want me to confess out of fear?

305
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,500
Children may also be in danger

306
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,830
And I'm not here to investigate.

307
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,760
Should we

308
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,980
Go home directly

309
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,080
Let's go to Gaocheng

310
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,040
To pay for nursing home medical expenses

311
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,690
I've seen him a few times.

312
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,600
I don't want to make you uncomfortable by taking you to see him.

313
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,230
That's why I object

314
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,650
Thanks

315
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,210
What are you doing?

316
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
Jin Shi saw that the owner of the car had already sneaked across the border.

317
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,240
Let's close the case.

318
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,020
Don't pretend to be trying too hard

319
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,280
Deliberately contacting Interpol to stir up trouble

320
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,030
I will close the case as soon as possible.

321
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,940
Where are my things?

322
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,500
I'll return it to you after the case is closed.

323
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,030
I'm a busy man and I don't have time to wait

324
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,420
Hello

325
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,920
Hurry and get my things.

326
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,870
Must get it by tonight

327
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,840
How much to take

328
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,120
The detective confirmed the scene.

329
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,540
If you want too much, it will be difficult.

330
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,570
Besides, a lot of them have already been taken out and disposed of in advance.

331
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,490
In order to shut up the brothers under his command, he spent a lot of money.

332
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,170
Very few left

333
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,000
You can use similar powder to impersonate

334
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,840
Put the real stuff on the top layer.

335
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,030
Anyway, the evidence analysis is complete.

336
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,560
Will not confirm again

337
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,710
If this problem can't be solved, then more than just layoffs will happen.

338
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,420
We all have to die

339
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,040
yes

340
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,900
Being led by a gang of criminals

341
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,870
We must find a way as soon as possible

342
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,680
If we continue like this, we will be in danger.

343
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,350
How are you doing?

344
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,690
Oh, you finally came.

345
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,900
How long have I been here? Why are you only coming to see me now?

346
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,450
Ye-na should have told you that I'm here.

347
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,600
I didn't tell him

348
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,360
He's sick and I don't want him to worry.

349
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:43,120
Really can do it! Really can do it!

350
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,180
Your brother says he's sick every day.

351
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,550
He is really sick.

352
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,530
Really very sick

353
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,020
What are you shouting about?

354
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,280
Stinky girl

355
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,760
Are you guys here to mess around with me?

356
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,220
How much money?

357
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,260
Because you don't solve it

358
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,720
I'm not sick, but I'm still trying to avoid lending money.

359
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,050
Living in captivity here

360
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,020
A guy who doesn't repent

361
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,230
Ye Na

362
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,410
It's okay. It's okay.

363
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,010
sorry

364
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,380
I'm not in good health and can't make money.

365
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,870
I am also receiving support from Ye-na

366
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,000
So I have no money for you

367
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,440
sorry

368
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,230
dad

369
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,320
What to do

370
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,260
I'm dying

371
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,130
Since you were little, the doctor told you that you wouldn't live long.

372
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,410
Haven't you lived till now?

373
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,860
Stop talking nonsense.

374
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,050
I'm really going to die

375
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:57,570
I probably won't make it through this month.

376
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,910
That's why I came to see you

377
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:06,960
dad

378
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,660
I

379
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,260
I don't hate my father

380
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,310
Of course it has to be this way

381
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,990
After your mother passed away

382
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,860
I raised you all by myself and endured so much hardship.

383
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,110
Thanks to me, you guys are grown up.

384
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,240
You can't be ungrateful

385
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,960
I feel so sorry for you, Dad.

386
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,760
What

387
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,710
I have a wish

388
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,790
It's my last wish before I die.

389
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,240
You must promise me

390
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,610
What is

391
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,460
Please give Ye Na

392
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,240
Apologize

393
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,410
What

394
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,440
You want me to apologize to this girl?

395
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,390
Yes

396
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,440
I don't hate you

397
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,010
You don't have to apologize to me.

398
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,740
But you must apologize to Ye-na

399
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,640
Our Ye-na will have to live on her own from now on.

400
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,240
She has to forgive her father.

401
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,010
Use this power to survive

402
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,210
Always harboring resentment towards someone

403
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,360
It's impossible to live well

404
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,010
so

405
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,110
For Ye-na

406
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,210
Even now

407
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,410
Please apologize

408
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,590
You two crazy people

409
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,840
It's been a while since you last visited me. It's okay if you come empty-handed.

410
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,410
What did you say?

411
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,090
- You bastards. - What's wrong?

412
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,490
Are you going to hit us again?

413
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,690
You stinky girl

414
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,990
Father

415
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,090
What to see

416
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,810
Sorry for yesterday

417
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,260
I suddenly felt like someone was following me

418
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,790
I sent Xiaosong over first.

419
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,090
Who is following you? Is it a representative?

420
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,090
No, it's my illusion.

421
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,960
But what happened? Where's Ye-na?

422
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,790
We have to help Ye-na brother

423
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,260
Ye Na also agreed

424
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,260
Yeah

425
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,710
It's a blessing for Gun-soo.

426
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,710
But the problem is that there is no Bafron

427
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,960
Can you get it?

428
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,310
Let me give it a try.

429
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,440
I feel like I should be able to get it

430
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,840
You won't

431
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,360
I need to ask Representative Gu for help.

432
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,110
We have to keep Gun-soo's matter a secret from CEO Gu.

433
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,590
If he knew, he would charge Gun-soo a huge fee.

434
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,390
Will make crazy demands again

435
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,410
When can you get the medicine?

436
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,390
Gun-soo is not in good condition

437
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,360
It should be done within a week or two.

438
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,940
Wait till the specific date comes out.

439
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,890
I'll contact you immediately

440
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,230
-=Number unknown=-

441
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,460
Suzhen, I have a call.

442
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,940
I'll contact you later

443
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:15,910
Um

444
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,560
-Hello -Quack

445
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,010
Representative Gu asked me to call you

446
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,390
This Saturday

447
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,990
Where should I go?

448
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,610
I will send you the address

449
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,310
You prepare well

450
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,990
Feel sorry

451
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,240
It makes you feel worse.

452
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,390
It doesn't matter

453
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,240
elder brother
Um

454
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,090
Last time the priest said

455
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,190
The people who truly love me are my family

456
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,360
Not related to blood

457
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,190
So,

458
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,910
The brother you really want to see

459
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,460
People gather together like family

460
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,660
Let's have a party

461
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,640
Your band can sing

462
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,760
You can also eat delicious food. It's great.

463
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,490
Do you want to have a funeral before you die?

464
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,840
Yes, the funeral was nice.

465
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,090
I see this kind of ceremony also exists overseas. Let's do it too.

466
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,410
I'll arrange it

467
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,490
Not bad, right?

468
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,390
Um

469
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,010
Don't worry about me

470
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,760
I will live a good life

471
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,390
Even if I don't get an apology from my father

472
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,840
I have such a great brother.

473
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,260
How can I not live a good life?

474
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,460
So don't worry about me

475
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,860
Yes, you will live well.

476
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,640
Um

477
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,990
- Let Ye-na hug us. - Forget it.

478
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,240
- That's too much. - So corny.

479
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,910
Do you plan to die on the day

480
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:39,010
Holding a funeral and concert?

481
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,510
Yes

482
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,940
I know that if there are too many people that day, it will cause a lot of inconvenience.

483
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,510
But I really want to do it for my brother.

484
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,810
He couldn't meet up with his friends often because of his illness.

485
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,690
I want him to meet everyone one last time and say goodbye.

486
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,790
Most of them are musicians

487
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:57,240
We can get together to sing and perform on stage

488
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,460
I think it's like a celebration

489
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,390
Ending after a happy play

490
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,910
Plenty of time

491
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,010
As long as you prepare well, it should be fine.

492
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,560
You and your friends enjoy

493
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,890
When the time comes to end, we will help you

494
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,160
I'll probably get the medicine that evening.

495
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,210
I'll bring the medicine by 7:00 on Saturday.

496
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,490
Thanks

497
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,740
Then I'll book a performance venue nearby

498
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,840
Prepare the food and stage

499
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,690
Let's have fun creating a real celebration

500
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,910
Well, because it's a funeral ceremony.

501
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,710
You can prepare spicy beef soup set

502
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,510
How's it? It's okay, right?

503
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,110
The spicy beef soup set meal feels very sad.

504
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,440
I'll prepare anything you want to eat.

505
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,010
Don't worry about the preparation

506
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,310
Gun-soo, just prepare for the performance.

507
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,190
Thanks

508
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:46,840
-=Notice=-

509
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,670
I don't want to cry today

510
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:54,700
I will do my best to let my brother leave happily.

511
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,150
good

512
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,370
Qihong took off his hat

513
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,770
Don't take it off

514
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,420
Bro, your friend is here.
Who is

515
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:11,720
Hello, Painter Cui

516
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,400
Come here, you

517
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,270
If it wasn't a funeral, you wouldn't have come, would you?

518
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,300
How can you say that?

519
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,550
Today we will have a band performance and have fun

520
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,920
Just enjoy it.

521
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,400
OK, so I'll take this in lieu of condolence money.

522
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,550
I drew a portrait of you

523
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,250
Exactly the same

524
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,470
You finally managed to describe my beauty

525
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,270
It's great to see you while you're still alive.

526
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,850
Yeah, really.

527
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,020
Is this Zhenshuo?

528
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,270
Are you Zhenshuo?

529
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:43,920
Hello, how long have we not seen each other?

530
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I brought my guitar too.

531
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,420
Are you going to sing for me?

532
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,820
Well, I'll sing you your favorite song.

533
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,320
Okay, we'll also perform.

534
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,050
Not just us, if you guys want to sing too

535
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,400
Come on stage and sing anytime.

536
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,620
I really need to listen to a few more songs today, you know?

537
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:58,000
marvelous

538
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,920
-Thank you. -See you later.
You guys can sit anywhere.

539
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,670
-Okay. -Go ahead.

540
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
It's nice to have a funeral before you die.

541
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,970
Before leaving

542
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,800
See the people you miss

543
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,520
Share delicious food together

544
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,100
Everyone will feel lucky to see you one last time.

545
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,270
yes

546
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:21,470
When I leave, there will be a funeral where everyone gathers together and cries.

547
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,970
I don't think it's good when I think about it

548
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
Come to you

549
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
The spicy beef soup you want

550
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,200
The man who ate spicy beef soup at his own funeral

551
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,720
It's just me.

552
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,950
- Eat slowly. - Okay.

553
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,470
- How's it? - It's salty.

554
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,770
Is it salty?

555
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,150
I feel like adding some more water

556
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,320
This is what I expected in the end

557
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,770
In pain

558
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,970
Lost in a state of consciousness due to painkillers

559
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,020
Then say goodbye to your loved ones

560
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,500
It's meaningless.

561
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,770
yes

562
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,300
Everyone has their own way of saying goodbye.

563
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,420
It's so tragic to die in the hospital.

564
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,470
But not yet

565
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,600
Too dangerous

566
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,570
Represents the madman

567
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,000
Maybe he'll be watching somewhere.

568
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,250
I see

569
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't want to be involved with that person.

570
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,920
Ye Na

571
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,970
Your father is here

572
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,620
How come you are here?

573
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,020
I have something to tell you

574
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,100
I heard that Gun-soo is dying.

575
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,950
He's leaving. It's over.

576
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,870
I as a father

577
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:55,970
I have to say this to you one last time.

578
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,070
At that time

580
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,450
My situation is also difficult

581
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,600
You have to be raised by someone.

582
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,120
Feeling very tired

583
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,690
No more words

584
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,510
sorry

585
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,720
You should apologize to Ye-na.

586
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,300
sorry

587
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,430
sorry

588
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,910
sorry

589
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,620
Thank you, Dad.

590
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:08,230
Thank you, Dad. Thank you.

591
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,390
Thank you, Dad.

592
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,570
sorry

593
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,290
Thank you, Dad.

594
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,310
Ouch

595
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,720
The money is quite thick

596
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,010
Wow, you are such a filial girl.

597
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,420
Thanks

598
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,810
You have to be careful

599
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:05,030
The loan shark should still be looking for you.

600
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,400
I'll figure it out myself.

601
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,600
but

602
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,980
Is Gun-soo really going to die?

603
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,190
right

604
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,570
Ah, this kid is so young.

605
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,030
Who does he look like? He's so weak.

606
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,990
Please go

607
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,980
that

608
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,800
Ye Na

609
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,740
Although I shouldn't say this after I've received your money...

610
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,560
sorry

611
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,500
You said it

612
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,430
What we should do

613
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,430
Let the one you love

614
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,840
Leave without worries

615
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,490
Untouchable Clouds

616
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,330
Inaudible

617
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,700
Trapped in darkness

618
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,970
Invisible

619
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:51,830
Can be felt but cannot be touched

620
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:58,260
I will set out to find you

621
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,970
By the broken moonlight

622
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:09,380
If you can illuminate me brightly

623
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:15,610
No matter when I will always

624
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,590
Light up the light for you

625
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,110
I'll go get the medicine.

626
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,570
- Be careful. - Okay.

627
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:42,210
I'm outside now...

628
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,870
Tell me the location, I'll go there now

629
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,420
Don't be nervous

630
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,420
I'll use this time to repay

631
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,530
Suzhen is in debt to Li Yunxi

632
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,450
And I have to leave as soon as this is over.

633
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,260
I left midway. Leaving for too long would arouse suspicion.

634
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,250
Starting from today, we must do it decisively.

635
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,380
Also, do you still remember?

636
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,690
If this person is in even the slightest bit of pain, you'll...

637
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,960
Don't make mistakes

638
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:00,150
-=3.Contract Party Personnel Information Chen Yingxiu=-

639
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:04,750
-=Registration Obligor: Chen Yingxiu Registration Rights Holder: Guguang Asset Operations=-

640
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,140
no

641
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:36,300
We personally confirmed it and brought it over.

642
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:42,830
-=Evidence Storage Room=-

643
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,160
How could it disappear?

644
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,080
I also thought it must be here, so I asked the Narcotics Bureau.

645
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,930
Among the seven kilograms of seized goods, there was no Pavlon from the beginning.

646
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,040
Why is there no Bafron?

647
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,010
What are you talking about? We clearly saw the Pavlon bottle with our own eyes.

648
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:47,030
And how could it be seven kilograms?

649
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,000
At first glance, it looks like a lot. How can it be seven kilograms?

650
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,960
Two people who were caught by customs not long ago

651
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,140
Hidden on the body is seven kilograms

652
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,220
But if the truck also carries seven kilograms,

653
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,550
That's outrageous.

654
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:03,680
Someone must have taken it from inside.

655
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,450
It must have been swapped in a blind spot.

656
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,340
Or it was taken away when the surveillance was closed.

657
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,400
I'm speechless.

658
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,710
No, the investigation wasn't even finished yet. They took it away early.

659
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,120
Is it too courageous or crazy?

660
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,500
A courageous madman.

661
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,590
I don't know who it is, but this needs to be monitored.

662
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,590
Should I report this to Captain An?

663
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,330
No

664
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,330
It's not clear who is involved in this matter.

665
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,470
Whatever was taken from here must have been sold on the market.

666
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,120
Find something through a drug dealer you know

667
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,900
Then we can pursue him in the opposite direction.

668
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,960
Even though I stuffed it into my mouth like crazy

669
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,090
But I still can't feel any taste

670
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,270
I don't know if it's because of the illness or the medicine.

671
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,190
Everything I eat tastes bitter

672
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,320
Have you said goodbye to your family?

673
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,900
Now this time

674
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,950
My wife must be arguing with my mother

675
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:50,140
Arguing over who gets more inheritance

676
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:53,660
I didn't even know I was going to die

677
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,360
No one will feel sad because of me

678
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,860
You can fight with confidence

679
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,650
Huh

680
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:34,970
The location of Yu Suzhen's vehicle has been found.

681
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,530
Detective Li has found the location of Yu Suzhen's vehicle 37A9781 that you requested. I'll send you the address: 9-11, Lao Liudong, Wancheng District, Basin City, Basin City Outer Ring Road.

682
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:35,720
Where

683
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,370
It is said that it is in the outer ring of Basin City

684
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,220
There are many villa hotels here.

685
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,340
Send me the location

686
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:42,970
good

687
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,860
Damn

688
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,910
I will contact his family immediately.

689
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,720
I'm leaving too.

690
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:26,940
Wait a moment

691
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,560
It's just the beginning. You just have to do what I say.

692
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,540
Don't do useless things

693
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:36,720
Choi Dae-hyun

694
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:39,650
Wake up, okay?

695
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,460
certainly

696
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:52,400
Organize

697
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,420
Oh, our representative Chen

698
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,450
Oh, you need to go peacefully.

699
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:04,440
It would be very heavy to carry all this.

700
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,660
Ah now

701
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,320
Please welcome today's protagonist

702
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,850
Also the lead singer of ROUNDERS

703
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,280
Our dear

704
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,750
Choi Gun-soo performs on stage

705
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,380
Ah, thank you all for waiting for me.

706
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:31,720
yes

707
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,400
Um, today

708
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,070
I really appreciate everyone staying with me.

709
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,940
The song I'm about to sing is

710
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,560
It's a song I really like.

711
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,890
As our last greeting

712
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:47,160
I think this song is very appropriate

713
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,060
I today

714
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,700
Because of everyone's company

715
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,470
Feel very happy

716
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,210
I hope everyone can be happy

717
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,130
Hope we

718
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,430
In the distant future

719
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,660
In a beautiful place

720
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,790
Reunion

721
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,500
I'll unplug this first.

722
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,260
It's okay. It's okay.

723
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,540
Oh, very good

724
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:02,140
No matter how hard I try to forget

725
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,800
Can't forget that face

726
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:17,250
No matter how hard you try to erase it

727
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:24,700
Can't erase that name

728
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:40,160
Sing with oxygen

729
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,500
Ye Na

730
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,440
Let's sing together

731
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:07,850
In the sad back of me turning around

732
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,830
I can still feel you sobbing

733
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:23,230
If I could meet you again in the distant future

734
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:29,360
I must say I loved you

735
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,600
Sometimes loneliness strikes

736
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,020
Sometimes regrets come

737
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:08,800
One day as time goes by

738
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,220
I can't help but cry alone

739
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,190
elder brother

740
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:25,160
Because I can't bear to leave

741
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:32,340
You sobbing in my arms

742
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,590
Treasure deep in my heart

743
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:44,960
The only thing left is what I've always wanted to tell you

744
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:51,720
That sentence

745
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,960
-Brother -Yeah

746
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:54,660
us

747
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,560
See you later

748
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,280
Later?

749
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,830
Later

750
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:01,770
after

751
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,460
After a long, long time

752
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:07,880
Got it?

753
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,360
See you then

754
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:12,180
Thank you

755
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:19,160
In the sad back of me turning around

756
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,860
I can still feel you sobbing

757
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:25,850
Someone once said

758
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,910
People are like

759
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,930
Prepare for winter

760
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,980
Prepare to die

761
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,610
Because you know winter will come.

762
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:42,930
What about me

763
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,220
I'm really happy to make this choice now.

764
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:56,320
I can still feel you sobbing

765
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:00,860
Thank you, brother

766
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,780
Thanks to you

767
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,960
I got an apology from my dad.

768
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,880
I will work harder and live a good life.

769
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:12,710
Ye Na

770
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,930
You have to live a good life

771
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,740
I'm so sleepy

772
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:49,860
Very sleepy

773
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,840
elder brother

774
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,160
elder brother

775
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:27,620
If I could meet you again in the distant future

776
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:42,290
I must say I loved you

777
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,330
This is the last record left by the patient.

778
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:53,740
Everyone can take pictures, just say whatever you want.

779
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:55,640
here we go

780
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,140
Choi Ye-na

781
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,030
ah

782
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
I'll do it myself

783
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,410
Why

784
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,910
Ah, I can relax a little by myself.

785
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:05,980
I'll be shy. Let's go.

786
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:07,940
Ah, I can't leave you alone.

787
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,860
Ah, let's go, hurry up

788
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,330
Let's go

789
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,150
Let's go

790
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,280
Go! Go!

791
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,760
- I'm going to throw it away. - I'm going to watch you record it here.

792
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,690
A little further

793
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,840
Choi Ye-na

794
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,720
Forehead

795
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,460
I really have to say it

796
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,300
I don't know what to say

797
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:49,450
Who are you

798
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,520
Same day as me

799
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,480
Born at the same time

800
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:55,940
Twins

801
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,980
Is that because of this?

802
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,400
Since childhood

803
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,040
Before you say

804
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,290
You already know what I'm thinking.

805
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:08,450
You know it now, right?

806
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,450
ah

807
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,340
Ye Na

808
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,780
My brother

809
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,700
I have been feeling unwell since childhood

810
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,660
I haven't done anything for you. I'm sorry.

811
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,130
Forgive me

812
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,770
Who are you

813
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,620
My World

814
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,300
Ye Na

815
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,480
As usual

816
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,710
You have to be strong

817
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:35,940
Live handsomely

818
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,540
I will be in heaven with my mother

819
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,770
Looking at your

820
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,600
ah

821
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,250
I love you

822
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,960
Thank you

823
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,600
My other half

824
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,040
Choi Ye-na

825
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:27,940
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

826
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,400
I want to give you a suggestion

827
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,100
I can give you more money this time.

828
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,360
Please let me die. Please.

829
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,570
Please free me from this pain

830
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:37,380
Why is that?

831
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,100
If you want to kill someone, kill me.

832
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,060
How could I kill you?

833
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,340
You are so good at using Baflon

834
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,990
Let me see the police

835
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,460
Do you know Chen Yingxiu?

836
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:48,320
Where were you when Chen Yingxiu died?

837
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,420
Choi Dae-hyun, you said that, right?

838
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,100
Because you deceived me

839
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,820
This is what happened because of misconduct
