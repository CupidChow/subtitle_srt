00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,990
The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,060
Nice weather

00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,170
how

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,650
Relax a little

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,240
Do you want to go somewhere with me to have some spicy river fish soup?

7
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,180
How about boiled chicken?

8
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,240
At least to this extent, they will believe that you are threatened.

9
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,620
Don't act pitiful

10
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,890
You're a doctor, you know this level of damage won't kill anyone.

11
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,720
You said you were completely panicked.

12
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,400
I can't remember anything about the driver.

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,400
Just say he's a man in his twenties

14
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
They will think it's one of Jin Shijian's men

15
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,750
All this

16
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,400
It was all done by Jin Shijian and his gang

17
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,170
Dr. Yu, listen carefully.

18
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,140
Hello

19
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,330
Listen carefully

20
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,010
Like a skilled actor

21
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,290
Just follow my instructions and play your role well.

00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,090
What's going on?

25
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:47,550
Yu Suzhen

26
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:51,980
Hello

27
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,280
How are you

28
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,430
I was threatened

29
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,850
I didn't do it voluntarily.

30
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
We will make a judgment after investigation

31
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,140
Ye Na Ye...

32
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,130
What? If you see it, please help.

33
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:09,750
Why do that?

34
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,910
It's okay. I can do it alone.

35
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,820
Dr. Yu

36
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,720
Kidnapped by a patient at Basin City Hospital

37
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,960
I came back injured

38
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,520
Kidnapping?

39
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,450
How serious the injury

40
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,010
The prisoner took the hostages and escaped from the hospital

41
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,800
The surveillance camera didn't capture it at all

42
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,140
Can this really be considered a coincidence?

43
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,680
No close-up footage

44
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,660
critical moment

45
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,230
Only move in blind spots where there are no cameras

46
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,760
Even the camera at the last exit is under maintenance

47
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,980
I am a hostage

48
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,010
How could Jin Shijian act like that?

49
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,780
I have no idea

50
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,100
Jin Shijian, who had only been hospitalized for a few days

51
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,850
The possibility of fully understanding the situation and taking action

52
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,600
How many do you think

53
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,080
Are you trying to say I planned all this?

54
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,450
Is that why you handcuffed the patient?

55
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,940
We apologize to you for this.

56
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,110
No, because of Kim Si-gum

57
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,380
It was so easy and almost no trace left.

58
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,490
Our officer Pan seems to have you

59
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,400
Mistakenly became Jin Shijian's accomplice

60
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,200
Didn't you see the footage from the ICU?

61
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,310
There should be a video of how I became a hostage.

62
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,010
Look, look, look

63
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:01,850
I've seen them all.

64
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,550
No matter what, just come back safely.

65
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,870
Medical scissors used as a murder weapon

66
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,120
How did Jin Shijian get it?

67
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,590
I have no idea

68
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,970
Where did you get the murder weapon? You police should go and find out.

69
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,370
and

70
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,290
The police are stationed in the hospital.

71
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,580
But the suspect who escaped could not be controlled

72
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,630
As a victim, I would like to ask you

73
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,850
The patient cannot sit for long periods of time while being questioned

74
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,740
Are you responsible if the condition worsens?

75
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,020
Excuse me, but the prisoner is on the run.

76
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,260
Let's just ask a few quick questions.

77
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,620
I told you, but you didn't understand.

78
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,060
The patient absolutely needs to be in a stable state now.

79
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,050
She is undergoing treatment under great stress.

80
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,590
Pressure?

81
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,680
It's the same now

82
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,650
Did you see her hands shaking like this?

83
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,800
The patient is shaking with fear, and you're still reminding her of the crime scene.

84
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
It's really violent behavior.

85
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,740
It's really shaking, huh?

86
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,630
Dr. Yu, you should lie down too.

87
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,100
Really

88
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,110
Let's go

89
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,270
We'll ask you later

90
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,390
Please receive treatment

91
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,370
Let's go

92
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,790
No, those people are really crazy.

93
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,160
They let the prisoners go themselves.

94
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,310
But they caught the injured person and investigated

95
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,490
Just an apology isn't enough.

96
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:43,600
but

97
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,880
I seem to have seen that young detective somewhere.

98
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,440
That's right

99
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,120
Didn't he come to our hospital's emergency room?

100
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,940
Then the patient disappeared

101
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,370
You did what happened to Yu Suzhen, didn't you?

102
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,220
Like a squirrel. Are you filming Indiana Jones?

103
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,310
Leave him alone

104
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,540
He looks like a weakling.

105
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:44,930
Asking you

106
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,140
It was you who did this to Jin Shijian, right?

107
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,470
Didn't you kidnap him in order to kill him?

108
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:05,270
Are you here to confirm if you don't listen to me and act arbitrarily?

109
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,480
What will it become?

110
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,150
You came at the right time

111
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,010
Take a look

112
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,770
You can come closer and take a look

113
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,660
You at that time

114
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,570
You should take the medicine yourself.

115
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,900
Do I have to report all these things?

116
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,550
this

117
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,790
It looks like a toy, but

118
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,060
This thing can kill anything, even people.

119
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,620
Jin Shijian was targeted by the police

120
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,630
Being caught

121
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,640
The cause of the incident

122
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,220
It's all because of you

123
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,000
Now even I'm dangerous.

124
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,640
But why should I endure it?

125
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,750
This guy

126
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,750
What I received

127
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,680
Mental and financial losses

128
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,180
What are you going to do?

129
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,860
If you want money

130
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,980
I can find a way to compensate you, but

131
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,800
If you dare to touch Yu Suzhen again

132
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,960
I won't sit still then.

133
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,770
Do you think I'm doing this for that little bit of money?

134
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,700
So what do you want?

135
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,900
Good question

136
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,050
What a good question

137
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,110
you

138
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,700
Why do you do this everywhere?

139
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,960
Representative

140
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,330
In the world

141
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,060
Many people don't want to die in pain.

142
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,150
Of course it's illegal now.

143
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,590
But over time

144
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,650
It may become a matter of choice

145
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,230
That might also become a human right.

146
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,920
As expected of a medical student, he's quite good at giving briefings.

147
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,060
Good excuse, makes sense.

148
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,630
But since it makes sense

149
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,630
It might develop into a big business.

150
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,080
Rich people are not

151
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,480
At least myself

152
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,130
Will pay a lot of money to choose euthanasia

153
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,270
This is a completely different ball game than dealing with an addict.

154
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,320
This is a serious business project

155
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,230
We never thought about it this way.

156
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,710
Come on, bring the champagne.

157
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,290
OK

158
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,530
Drink it

159
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,730
You are clean, what are you going to do next?

160
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,870
You took my medicine during this time and you never tried it once, right?

161
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,430
drink

162
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,710
Give me a drink

163
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,040
Done

164
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,390
Oh, so good.

165
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,430
Really obedient

166
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,890
You will be happy soon

167
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,120
You will feel happy after a long time

168
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,780
-When is the event? -No event

169
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,650
- Tomorrow? - Have you said anything?

170
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,460
OK, can we watch a movie, have dinner, or something?

171
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,220
- Am I talking too much in the ER? - Yeah

172
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,080
Hello, Father

173
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,160
It's an emergency. I can't contact Dr. Cui right now.

174
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,010
Has Yunxi's condition worsened?

175
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,020
Yes

176
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,960
Okay, I'll contact Dr. Cui again.

177
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,370
Bastard, how much medicine did you mix in?

178
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,760
-=Suzhen=-

179
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,950
Suzhen, I can't answer the phone now.

180
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,130
I'm afraid you'll be scared

181
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,200
Damn it! How can I be in such a good mood?

182
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,170
As time goes by

183
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,280
You will become more anxious and depressed

184
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,340
Self-esteem hits rock bottom

185
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,860
Where are you going?

186
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,120
If you leave without permission, I'll be scolded.

187
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:14,650
Team Leader

188
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,320
No, where are you going so late?

189
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,290
Do I have to report everything I go to?

190
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,470
I'm neither a criminal nor a suspect.

191
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,520
I'm worried about you.

192
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,280
You were just taken hostage.

193
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,620
And the hostage has not been arrested yet.

194
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,770
There was an emergency patient at the hospital where I volunteered.

195
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,340
But there are no medical staff now.

196
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,440
But you are also a patient.

197
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,770
Will you push yourself too hard?

198
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,490
The patient is waiting for me

199
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,510
so

200
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,390
You send her there.

201
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,440
I can still protect her. Go with her.

202
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,650
-=Maria Welfare Hospital=-

203
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,270
Patient, it's ok. Patient

204
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,540
Komatsu

205
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,330
Komatsu

206
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,950
Komatsu

207
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,880
You are here

208
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,810
Xiaosong, you can't stay here.

209
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,410
Thank you, Dr. Yu

210
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,970
It's okay. It's okay.

211
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,910
It's fine

212
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,240
It'll be fine soon.

213
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,860
Be patient a little longer

214
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,330
It's okay, Xiaosong. It's okay.

215
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,330
Lord

216
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,130
Please take care of those who cannot be near you

217
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,120
And the poor wandering soul

218
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,150
It's fine

219
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,240
Your name is Ban Zhixun instead of Xianyu, right?

220
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,930
I'm glad you're alive though

221
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,630
But I feel sorry and guilty about Hyun-woo's death

222
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,850
After all, I didn't recognize his face.

223
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,190
sorry

224
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,300
I heard the police are investigating.

225
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,020
So what is Dr. Yu's crime?

226
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,100
Answer me

227
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,400
If the police hide their identities and investigate a case

228
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,120
It shouldn't be a traffic violation, right?

229
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,700
What is it

230
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,920
What Yu Suzhen is doing now

231
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,790
No matter what my intention was

232
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,970
These are things that shouldn't be done

233
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,340
If you think it's dangerous

234
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,720
Please contact me

235
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,830
I don't understand what you are saying

236
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,960
Although I don't understand

237
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,960
Anyway, it's not Dr. Yu

238
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,840
She is a good person

239
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,240
Because I have known her for a long time, so I know

240
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,170
There must be some misunderstanding here.

241
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,130
The painkillers are no longer effective.

242
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,230
I calm down now because I'm tired.

243
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:09,620
Did the children see it?

244
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,380
If I lose consciousness due to the pain

245
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,420
My child sometimes cleans up my urine and feces at home

246
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,570
If this continues

247
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,280
When it comes to mom

248
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,890
The first thing that came to her mind was probably the smell.

249
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,380
The child is still young

250
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,720
Having my mother by my side brings me great comfort.

251
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,710
The child is already afraid of me

252
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,630
The adults comforted me and said

253
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,530
This is how I alienate my children from me before I die.

254
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,980
But I...

255
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,420
I don't want to die being hated by my children.

256
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,180
So

257
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,390
If I wait until I'm really about to die

258
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,770
Don't bother with me anymore.

259
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,770
If you could give me a ride, I'd be very grateful.

260
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,150
I am a doctor

261
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,990
I was diagnosed with stomach cancer

262
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:58,660
No money for treatment

263
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,200
But I have a child

264
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,350
So there's no way I can just die like this.

265
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,490
I tried my best to survive

266
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,710
Ask around

267
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,540
After hearing the word free

268
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,760
Companies developing new drugs

269
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,470
Received immunotherapy

270
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,720
That medicine

271
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,100
It has a worse effect on people at high risk of diabetes

272
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,800
Probably.

273
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,220
Have you told the pharmaceutical company?

274
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,220
They said I agreed to it.

275
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,830
They didn't do anything wrong

276
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,270
That's sorry.

277
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:59,030
Wait until I die

278
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,670
Can you help me

279
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,460
Send the child to a nursery?

280
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,870
The priest should know a good nursery.

281
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,360
Thanks

282
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,770
Thanks…

283
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,070
Dr. Yu

284
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,300
What's wrong

285
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,470
Are you injured?

286
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,870
Are you okay? Do you need help?

287
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,080
No need, I've already taken care of it.

288
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,940
Are you really okay?

289
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,880
sorry

290
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,060
I don't even know your situation.

291
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,820
Please come and help me

292
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,980
You must be feeling very uncomfortable.

293
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,990
Go home and rest

294
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,160
Why don't you ask me

295
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,000
What

296
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,090
Don't you already know that person is not Zhao Xianyu?

297
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,140
But the detective who was chasing me

298
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,660
You never lied to me

299
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,220
Of course, when I don't want to tell the truth

300
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,450
You will also keep silent

301
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,400
If you can be honest, I would also like to ask

302
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,230
What happened

303
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,890
Those people think I killed someone

304
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,750
Is it a medical malpractice or something?

305
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,560
If you want to hear the real answer

306
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,250
That's not an accident.

307
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:21,610
I'll tell you when I've sorted it out.

308
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,960
Lee Yoon-hee's time is running out

309
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,030
The next few days were the most painful time for her

310
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,270
I'll stay here tonight

311
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,370
Although Daxian likes to joke, he is very responsible.

312
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,990
It should come tomorrow

313
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,960
Hello

314
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,640
Hello

315
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,890
Hello, please open the window

316
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,210
What's going on?

317
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,590
There was a spasm.

318
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,390
Because of the severe pain, he entered a delirium

319
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:50,980
Delirium: A state of frequent severe hyperactivity, anxiety, and tremors

320
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,190
Please hold her down so she doesn't fall off the bed.

321
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,110
Are the symptoms of cramps so severe?

322
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,290
The painkillers are no longer effective.

323
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,240
Go away

324
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,110
I'll stay here anyway.

325
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,260
Detective, the kind of thing you're worried about

326
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,610
It can't be done in the short term, and I won't do it.

327
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,760
What will happen to this patient then?

328
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,560
If cramps persist

329
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,890
It would be hard for her to hold on.

330
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,710
-=Guangsou Team Fu Zhexiu=-

331
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,810
I'm a neighbor. Please open the door.

332
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,510
Why is it so noisy?

333
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,560
Who is it?

334
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,260
Excuse me

335
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,160
I didn't allow you to come in.

336
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,390
We are the police

337
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,110
Are you Choi Dae-hyun?

338
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,640
Yes

339
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,790
We understand you fell asleep on the road yesterday.

340
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,590
I started working again after many years

341
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:33,110
Tired and sleepy

342
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,790
No accidents happened

343
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,640
Will I be punished for drowsy driving?

344
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,240
That's not the case

345
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,210
But

346
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,910
We discovered you have a history of drug abuse.

347
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,510
To confirm, come with us to the institute.

348
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,790
No, am I being tortured?

349
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,340
I'll speak after the lawyer arrives.

350
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,190
I'm sorry to invite you to such a shabby place.

351
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,360
Have you met contestant Choi Kang-yoon?

352
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,060
Five days before his death

353
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,490
Yes

354
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,410
Why did you meet?

355
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,010
I provide him with consultation

356
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,690
Help him relieve his pain

357
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,390
Is providing intelligence also illegal?

358
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,660
No

359
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,310
Talking about illegality

360
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,710
It seems you are very sensitive to the law.

361
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,910
A drug reaction appeared immediately during the simple examination.

362
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,040
Right

363
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,660
This is just a simple check

364
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,940
So we're going to do a formal inspection.

365
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,710
It's already like this, why don't you speak up?

366
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,910
I'll talk after the lawyer arrives.

367
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,740
I can't contact your mother either.

368
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:54,060
He seems very disappointed with his son.

369
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,910
You continue

370
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,040
I won't say anything until the lawyer comes.

371
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,540
Lawyer Lawyer

372
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,160
Are you a parrot?

373
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,240
Give his mother another call.

374
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,960
She said her son was begging for help like a bird.

375
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,140
OK

376
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,990
Even with sedatives, the spasms wouldn't stop.

377
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,360
There's no other method available.

378
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,340
Dr. Yu, you have tried your best.

379
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,510
I'll take care of her until she dies.

380
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,340
You should take a rest.

381
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,560
The child is afraid of his mother and dares not approach her.

382
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:00,140
She saves money on insulin

383
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,110
To save money for the kids to buy an extra meal

384
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,540
Will the child remember the mother's kindness?

385
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,190
Do you remember saying

386
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,160
There's a reason for all the pain, is it all we can do?

387
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,040
Yes

388
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,960
Then those who cannot gain any understanding in pain

389
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,990
Is he a sinner?

390
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,110
this....

391
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,090
All I can say is

392
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,190
Life and death are the domain of God

393
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,140
I heard that God uses human hands to exert his power.

394
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,860
That's the way God uses

395
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,390
Although you are a doctor who saves lives

396
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,240
But that's arrogant.

397
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,510
You are shirking your responsibility.

398
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,640
Choosing a life of obedience is not an easy choice after all

399
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,990
For difficult-to-treat patients

400
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,560
What can I do for them as a doctor?

401
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,390
Only to alleviate their suffering

402
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,410
If the only way to relieve pain is death

403
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,560
So this kind of treatment is not allowed?

404
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,810
You said it, right?

405
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,910
I want to know why the police suspect me.

406
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,340
If the only treatment available to a patient left with only pain

407
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,910
If it is death

408
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,540
I want to give them that kind of treatment, Father.

409
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,560
Mary

410
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,490
I'm not Mary anymore.

411
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,260
Because I no longer believe in God

412
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,990
finally

413
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,740
The lawyer you've been looking for so hard

414
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,840
It's finally here

415
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,160
It seems your mother hasn't completely abandoned you.

416
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,090
She hired such a famous lawyer for you

417
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,190
You were once a famous plastic surgeon.

418
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,160
But after taking medicine and undergoing surgery

419
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,940
The famous singer's face...

420
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,740
After public opinion worsened, your medical license was revoked.

421
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:43,190
I refuse personal attention

422
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,410
Because it's so beautiful

423
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,660
I'm talking about the necklace

424
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,210
Isn't it my face?

425
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,040
You are also very beautiful

426
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,810
Although you should know

427
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,510
Most doctors after being punished

428
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,390
You can file a lawsuit and re-qualify after three years.

429
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,890
But you haven't stopped taking the medicine before?

430
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,010
There is no lawsuit to restore the qualification certificate.

431
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,640
I'm too busy.

432
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,490
The simple test showed positive

433
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,590
Where do you get the confidence to keep denying it?

434
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,910
Why are you looking at me like that?

435
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,560
terribly sorry

436
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,090
Have we met somewhere before?

437
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,890
You look familiar

438
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,460
Compared to those men who hit on me by saying I look like my mother

439
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,840
Your trick is pretty good.

440
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,910
Aunt Caiyan's friend

441
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,360
Jae-yeon's aunt Woo So-jeong

442
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,960
Are you Dr. Yu's friend?

443
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,760
Do you know Suzhen and Caiyan?

444
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,260
It seems you changed offices.

445
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,890
No

446
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,460
There's a reason for everything

447
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:12,690
Even if it's an emergency arrest for drug use

448
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,040
After 48 hours, it becomes an illegal arrest.

449
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,040
Don't you want to apply for a detention warrant?

450
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,810
Of course you have to apply.

451
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,260
What are you doing?

452
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,710
My client is not involved in drug trafficking.

453
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,910
The identity is also very clear

454
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,710
Why conduct the survey in this way?

455
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,940
Choi Dae-hyun is not a drug offender

456
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,140
But suspected of murder

457
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,010
Killing people?

458
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,860
You and I, the lawyer, can get along well.

459
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,690
Just tell you the truth

460
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,290
We think Choi Dae-hyun is a college classmate of his who is a doctor

461
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,390
An accomplice in a murder case

462
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,390
What are you doing?

463
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,290
If the person is detained for investigation,

464
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,040
At least tell me the details of the case accurately.

465
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,510
So I'm telling you now?

466
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,110
Please tell me everything

467
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,010
This is something I should know as a lawyer.

468
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,460
We believe

469
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,510
Dr. Yu Suzhen from Basin City Hospital

470
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,350
-=Suspects Yu Suzhen, Choi Daxian, and Choi Kangyun's attending physician=-

471
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,360
Involving murder under the guise of euthanasia

472
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,610
At the same time, we believe that Choi Dae-hyun is her accomplice.
-=Drug Serial Murder Case=-

473
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,340
Why are you hiding from me?

474
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,310
If you know everything, why are you still chatting with me?

475
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,460
Because there's one thing you have to do.

476
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,060
You go tell the dance teacher I'm on drugs

477
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,040
The fainting during the performance

478
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,790
It's not because of weight loss, and it's not because of nervousness

479
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,940
Why should I promise you

480
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,190
Because the teacher

481
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,260
Said I ruined the performance because of nervousness

482
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,360
She's worried about me playing the leading role.

483
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,190
So,

484
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,240
Why should my aunt be affected by you?

485
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,210
You took that medicine without permission.

486
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,460
They took it from our house without permission.

487
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,240
Who is your aunt if she keeps that kind of stuff at home?

488
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,640
Isn't she wrong?

489
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,540
She used it to euthanize animals.

490
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,290
You took the medicine without permission

491
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,540
The attitude is too upright.

492
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,460
Hello

493
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,540
That's what your aunt told me to say.

494
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,110
Although I did steal the medicine

495
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,110
But your aunt asked me to keep it a secret.

496
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,260
Think about it

497
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,490
The doctor examined

498
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,210
Don't you know why I fainted?

499
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,240
She knew it, but she still lied.

500
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
Do you understand?

501
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,990
I don't believe you

502
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:31,730
Huh

503
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,290
Dad comes home so late

504
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,000
Father

505
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,230
Father

506
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,010
Please save me from evil

507
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,020
Please also save me from temptation. Please...

508
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,820
Hello, I can't do it now.

509
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,420
I'm in church

510
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,540
I am Michael

511
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,940
I was baptized

512
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,760
What

513
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,570
Edible condoms...

514
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:55,870
What

515
00:40:56,910 --> 00:40:58,080
Do you have candied haws flavor?

516
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,690
Sorry, Tanghulu

517
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,480
Hello, I'll be there right after I finish praying.

518
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,150
Yeah, wait for me

519
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,380
Don't eat it, eh?

520
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,800
Father

521
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,220
Please save me from my wife.

522
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,670
Just don't let me be nailed to the cross.

523
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,580
I'll just taste it

524
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,270
Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva

525
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:42,970
Hello

526
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,630
As a lawyer, you should know better.

527
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,610
Keep confidentiality for the client

528
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,530
You absolutely cannot tell anyone around you.

529
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,090
About Aunt Caiyan

530
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,790
As a lawyer, I'm telling you

531
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,540
The police said if you can help them catch Yu Suzhen

532
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,370
It will reduce your sentence.

533
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:02,520
Of course, I didn't say this directly.

534
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,020
But he offered me a deal as a lawyer.

535
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,820
Do not contact Yu Suzhen without my permission.

536
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,160
Of course, I can't see her.

537
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,100
Say you're traveling and then cut off contact

538
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,950
Suzhen and I just participated in volunteer activities together.

539
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,560
And during that process, consultation was conducted...

540
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,700
You are suspected of involvement in a murder case

541
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:24,970
Really

542
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,910
I don't want my client to protect others.

543
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,750
Increase the penalty

544
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,350
If you want me, as a lawyer, to keep it secret

545
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,240
Then do it according to the method I proposed.

546
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,940
Otherwise I won't defend you.

547
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,210
but

548
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,000
I can't agree to the conditions the police said.

549
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,070
If I could help them capture Yu Suzhen,

550
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,860
Never say it again.

551
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,030
I don't need a lawyer who makes this kind of suggestion.

552
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,900
but

553
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,720
I will listen to your advice to keep our distance for now.

554
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,370
Don't you like me?

555
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,900
You just like me

556
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:24,840
But I ask you this

557
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,930
Don't you promise me?

558
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,610
I can't let my aunt suffer because of you

559
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,590
Hey, are you crazy?

560
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,870
Hello, Youmei, what are you doing?

561
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,750
Ah, what should I do?

562
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,470
Hey, what did I see?

563
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,120
No, how could you suddenly force...

564
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,560
Are you crazy?

565
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,720
No, it wasn't me.

566
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,670
Are you okay?

567
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,740
Are you crazy?

-=Dr. Yu Suzhen=-

569
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,110
Yes, Dr. Yu

570
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:24,570
You called because of Lee Yoon Hee, right?

571
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,560
I was just about to call you.

572
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,200
Lee Yoon Hee went to heaven not long ago

573
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:42,940
Is there anything I can help with?

574
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,740
Need not

575
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,480
It's okay. I'll work with the welfare staff here.

576
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,480
Deal with follow-up matters

577
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,100
I will send the child to a nursery run by a priest I know well.

578
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,050
Dr. Yu, thank you for your concern.

579
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,760
Don't think about anything else now

580
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,930
Have a good rest

581
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,600
good

582
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,410
I've checked the surveillance camera and there's no video captured.

583
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:25,270
I will look for other witnesses among the patients.

584
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,100
good

585
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:33,780
When did you disappear?

586
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,750
Is she out of school?

587
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:38,790
Bao is still in school. I thought she was in school.

588
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,720
But no

589
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,620
-=Emergency Room No Entry or Exit=-
Is there any place you can think of where Jaeyeon could go?

590
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,440
What happened?

591
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,340
What's going on?

592
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,670
The child is missing

593
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:02,930
Get on the bus

594
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:06,310
Get in the car

595
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,980
Do you really like women?

596
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,070
So you want to date me?

597
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,870
Do you really like women?

598
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,180

599
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:14,900
sorry

600
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,390
I didn't realize it was so late.

601
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,080
Thanks

602
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,820
Thank you today

You're welcome

604
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,500
Fortunately I found it

605
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,940
How did the patient who had severe convulsions do?

606
00:47:57,650 --> 00:47:58,900
Lee Yoon-hee

607
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,140
passed away

608
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,390
good

This is my real phone number.

If there is an emergency with your child

611
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,120
You can contact me

612
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,050
As a police officer, I can help you with these matters.

We have identified you as a criminal and are investigating.

616
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:56,180
You think so of me too

617
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,340
I will definitely arrest you

618
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:06,950
Then you will be punished according to the number of crimes you have committed.

619
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,060
You're destroying yourself in order to save others

620
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,060
What to do? I can already see the child's head.

621

Come on, work harder, work harder

Work harder. Take a deep breath. Take a deep breath.

Take a deep breath. Yes, that's right. Take a deep breath.

I wonder where she was sent.

639
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,430
I want to give her this

640
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,310
Where did she go?

641
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,480
The place I want to go seems

642
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,690
It hasn't been decided yet

Blue Dream

645
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,550
On a green hill

646
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,880
There are many goats

647
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,320
Playing on the grass

648
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,280
With a face as cheerful as the blue sky

649
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:49,540
In the raindrops

650
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,860
In the falling weather

651
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,570
They all frowned and looked miserable.

652
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,350
Go find mommy

653
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,340
Go find daddy

654
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:04,220

Beautifully illuminated

657
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,790
It seems I've waited too long.

658
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,270
Plop, plop, grunt, grunt

659
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,920
Staggering and grunting

660
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:20,850
Why did you lie to me?

661
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,860
You know very well that on a medical level

662
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,110
There is no other way

663
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:33,720
A life of obedience is also beautiful

664
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,540
You're so irresponsible, like back then

665
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,020
- Eat more. - Okay.

666
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:56,180
The song just now

667
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,140
Is the song sung just for mom to hear?

668
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:01,310
Because the nuns will listen

669
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:04,500
My mother likes my singing

670
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,470
I see

671
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,060
But Komatsu

672
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,390
I

673
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,470
Because I have no strength

674
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,920
I don't think I can save your mother.

675
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:34,720
sorry

676
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,610
I know too

677
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,530
I think my mom has gone to heaven.

678
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:46,590
Why do you think so?

679
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:48,960
It's what my mother said

680
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,320
When you are sick

681
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,490
Mom is not a real mom

682
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,920
No matter what she says, don't make me sad

683
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,340
What happens when mom is sick?

684
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,210
Will yell

685
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,260
Will curse

686
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,860
Get angry

687
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,520
My mother said

688
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,470
Just let me remember

689
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:16,840
What she said when she wasn't sick

690
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,000
So

691
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,670
Can I let Mom go now?

692
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,280
I need medicine

693
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,770
You crazy person

694
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,900
Dr. Yu

695
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,150
The person making the request

696
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,270
Not you, but me

697
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,720
Someone is suffering and needs medication.

698
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,680
Damn

699
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,460
You guys get out

700
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,050
Are you crazy?

701
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,640
When being chased by the police like this

702
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,790
You still have to do that

703
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:38,620
Is it because of a job that involves seeing blood every day?

704
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,340
So you're getting bolder?

705
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,790
Are you crazy?

706
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,080
Please

707
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,060
In this world

708
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,760
Many people don't want to die in pain.

709
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,160
Ah, yes, of course it's illegal now.

710
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,380
But as time goes by

711
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,630
This may be a matter of choice.

712
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:05,350
It may become a human right

713
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:09,440
Who is the patient?

714
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,910
This is an emergency. I'll explain later.

715
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:13,760

If you want to continue doing that

719
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,370
You need my permission

00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,240
You want to

721
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,770
When, where and who to kill

722
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,340
Do it right in front of me.

723
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,900
You want to kill

724
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,360

-=Wide Area Search Team Li Daojun has sent you the information you requested about Yu Suzhen. Please confirm.=-

726

Where is the person you wanted to kill?

729
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,680
I have to see it for myself.

730
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:21,210
That way I can decide whether to use my stuff or not

731
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:25,720
I make the decision, not you.

732
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,420
This is what Zhixun applied for.

733
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,020
The information about Yu Suzhen and Father Yang has been sent over.

734

Where is Ji-hoon?

735
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,880
I left immediately after confirmation.

Unable to contact

737
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:40,010
What is the information

738
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,080
Yu Suzhen and Father Yang

739
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,230
It seems like we've known each other since we were very young.

740
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,030
It started when Yu Suzhen was Yu Caiying

741
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,830
Who is Yu Caiying?

742
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,780
Yu Suzhen changed her name at the age of 18

743
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:52,430
Woo Chae-young changed to Woo Su-jeong

744
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,640
-Why? -My mother with cancer

745
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,160
Yu Suzhen died when she was 16 years old

746
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,590
Did you change your name because your mother passed away?

747
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:02,110
Yu Suzhen is a strong suspect in the murder of her mother

748
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,880
The conclusion is suicide

749
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,940
But it was initially suspected to be murder.

750
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:12,200
How did he die? It's suspected to be murder.

751
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,480
Where is Dr. Yu Suzhen?

752
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,610
What's up?

753
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,280
Doctor Yu is off work.

754
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:20,600
He fell into a lake near his home and died.

755
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,420
Drowned with hands tied behind the back

756
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,860
When did you find out your mother was missing?

757
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:37,280
I found out this morning

758
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,900
I knew she would jump into the lake.

759
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,440
So I jumped into the lake to save her

760
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,690
Finally failed

761
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,810
She committed suicide

762
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:52,800
Mom always wants to die

763
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:54,540
Then you didn't see her

764
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,530
When and how did you jump into the water?

765
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:58,860
yes

766
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,510
Weren't your hands tied behind your back when you were found?

767
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,710
How was it tied?

768
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,880
Did you help your mother tie it?

769
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,900
I wanted to save my mother.

770
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:41,690
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

771
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,040
Woo Chae-young, why did you change your name?

772
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,000
Wasn't it you, Yu Suzhen, who tied up your mother's hands?

773
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:49,850
Mother
Didn't I say that?

774
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,620
It's impossible to live in peace like this

775
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,980
Let's let the child die.

776
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,640
This place is hell

777
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,870
Is that the beginning?

778
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,190
You think everything that happens around me is my fault

779
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,290
Now you have to give up hope of being acquitted of the murder charge.

780
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,170
Please help me convince Yu Suzhen to confess everything.

781
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,670
Urgently arrest you as the suspect in the Lee Yun-hee murder case.
