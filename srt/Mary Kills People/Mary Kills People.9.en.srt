00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,990
The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,560
It was a much more comfortable death than I expected.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,740
Even I was tempted

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,140
Later Wait Later

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,680
You should also entrust Lawyer Park.

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,640
Don't talk about later

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,030
I want to give you a proposal now.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:34,460
This time I can offer a bigger amount than Representative Chen

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:38,930
What is the proposal?

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:48,710
represent

12
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,440
Represent that

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,190
The remaining Bafron

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,630
Did you take that away?

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,280
What did you say

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,990
Damn that...

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,190
That bastard quack seems to have taken away the Barflon.

18
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,420
What

19
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,130
What are you doing?

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,690
Damn

21
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,270
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

22
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,840
-=Episode 9=-

23
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,160
Yes, I understand.

24
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,190
This side

25
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,460
What did you do again?

26
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,490
Is it my fault that someone close to me died?

27
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,060
Who is this time

28
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,460
Ye-na's brother Gun-soo dies

29
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,930
He was diagnosed with a terminal illness

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,690
Collapsed during the performance

31
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,530
Is this another coincidence?

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,790
I'm afraid of being suspected like this.

33
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,730
I called an ambulance.

34
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,590
Even the behavior that makes me suspicious

35
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,990
It's my fault, right?

36
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,030
Safety first Safety first

37
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,660
What is this?

38
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,660
Choi Dae-hyun

39
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,990
You lied to me

40
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,760
It's like this because of messing around, isn't it?

41
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,490
How do you say you want to deal with it?

42
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,630
Let's stop here

43
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,430
Just here

44
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,660
It looks natural, like an accident.

45
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,660
If you do anything else, it will be exposed.

46
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,090
You just keep staying like this

47
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,290
Yu Suzhen and I will take action later

48
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,290
Looks good.

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,630
Wow, I'm here. I'm really excited.

50
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,860
Are you applying to date me?

51
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,790
You were the one who caused Daxian's accident, right?

52
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,290
Calm down

53
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,530
Why did you hit someone?

54
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,330
Why did you do that?

55
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,560
Daxian almost died because of you

56
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,790
Hello, Yu Suzhen

57
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,880
Aren't you afraid of me?

58
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,430
Kill me if you want

59
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,660
Daxian just did what I said, that's all.

60
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,630
Do you think you are so great?

61
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,990
Why are you so confident?

62
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,630
Think carefully

63
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,730
I was the first victim

64
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,860
You stole my things.

65
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,030
So if you want to kill me, kill me

66
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,630
It all started with me

67
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,760
I can't do anything to our Yu Suzhen.

68
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,660
How could I bear to kill you?

69
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,460
You are so skilled with Bafulong.

70
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,060
Hello, there is

71
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,960
Why do you care so much about those people?

72
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,430
Your useless friend Choi Dae-hyun

73
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,630
And that useless little nurse

74
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,020
Get rid of them

75
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,430
Just cooperate with me cleanly

76
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,790
I will take good care of you

77
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,070
I don't want to work with someone like you.

78
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,430
besides

79
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,020
If you dare to touch the people around me again

80
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,160
I'll take you to the police station immediately.

81
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,530
Oh, so cute

82
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,860
If you appear in front of me again

83
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,190
You and I will perish together.

84
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,890
Are you acting cute? Oh, that's scary.

85
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,620
Because something happened to Jianzhu suddenly

86
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,360
I couldn't clean up after the performance

87
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,760
Now processing

88
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,060
Why did Yu Suzhen and Choi Daxian come?

89
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,940
The doctor who came to the show

90
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,820
It seems that Ye Na invited her.

91
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,930
She has been helping check the status in the lounge

92
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,430
Take care of him

93
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,830
Thanks to her, Gun-soo was able to persevere in the performance to this extent.

94
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,160
No house

95
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,160
It's a really remote place

96
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,610
They must have found this kind of place on purpose.

97
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,360
We need to ensure surveillance video

98
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,760
Please cooperate.

99
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,710
OK, I understand.

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,690
What? Everyone gathered together.

101
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,960
Didn't Choi Gun-soo die of natural causes?

102
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,760
Even wedding banquets are not this lively.

103
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,160
I heard that before going to Switzerland for euthanasia

104
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,130
Some people also have parties with friends

105
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,980
Maybe that's the case.

106
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,190
But if Choi Gun-soo was euthanized

107
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,480
Where did Yu Suzhen get the Baflon?

108
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,760
Isn't Jin Shijian dead?

109
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,430
She must have prepared a lot of Bafron before that.

110
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,470
impossible

111
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,160
Every time something happens

112
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,030
We searched around Yu Suzhen

113
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,390
No Bafron found.

114
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,960
Under our surveillance

115
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,440
She couldn't possibly store it.

116
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,460
Before each action

117
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,530
She must have redone it.

118
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,190
If that's the case

119
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,430
Have you found a new supply channel for Bafron?

120
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,430
Go and confirm the location of those two people.

121
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,590
See where they went before the show

122
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,890
yes

123
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,390
I was quite excited before I died.

124
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,160
Very sad

125
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,120
I want to kill someone

126
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,920
But this isn't murder.

127
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,980
You also said

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,810
For those who suffer too much, death may be a better option.

129
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,160
Okay, then we

130
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,810
Do it well

131
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,530
What is this

132
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,360
I guess she's an insider.

133
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,190
If I ask for leave to go on a family trip to Gangwon Province

134
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,430
You have to take something with you.

135
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,790
I'm so embarrassed. Hurry up.

136
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:08,930
Really

137
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,490
I suddenly felt like someone was following me.

138
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,590
Who is following you?

139
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,430
Is it representative?

140
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,160
No, no, I made a mistake.

141
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,730
I'll do it.

142
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,680
Should be able to work

143
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,130
Yu Suzhen

144
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,010
sorry

145
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,260
That's obviously where you can get the medicine.

146
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,910
I made things difficult for you.

147
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,210
Need to get medicine

148
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,420
But because of us, the investigation became too strict

149
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,380
Couldn't find anyone else who could get Barfron.

150
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,690
If you can't get the medicine, then just say you can't get it.

151
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,660
There's no other way.

152
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,860
Ye-na and Gun-soo are waiting

153
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,990
I didn't know you were going to do something so dangerous.

154
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,040
Just do what you want to do comfortably

155
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,110
I'm really sorry for making you suffer like this.

156
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,960
It's really touching.

157
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,340
Even though it was something we all agreed on, I don't regret it.

158
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,960
But I think it's time to stop.

159
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,110
Too dangerous

160
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,720
I know

161
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,460
It's very dangerous at the moment. We have to be careful.

162
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,910
No, not temporarily

163
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,660
I think we should stop completely, Suzhen.

164
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,990
This time it's me

165
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,990
Next time it might be you or Ye-na

166
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,220
Don't think about anything else now

167
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,290
Focus on taking good care of your body first

168
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,130
I understand what you mean

169
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,330
We've gone too far

170
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,460
It's time to stop

171
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,640
Let's stop here

172
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,190
Now I

173
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,640
What I can do for you

174
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,160
Just wish you good night

175
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,590
Have a sweet dream

176
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,190
goodbye

177
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,970
Good night

178
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,790
Have a sweet dream

179
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,390
goodbye

180
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,640
What are you doing here?

181
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:12,760
Why don't you contact me when you come?

182
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,570
Aren't you very busy?

183
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,030
I'm waiting for you

184
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,820
oops

185
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,110
My brother looks good.

186
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,420
Looks like you've been doing well recently.

187
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,190
Doesn't it hurt now?

188
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,860
My brother doesn't feel any pain at all.

189
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,540
My brother

190
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,160
Thanks to you, I'm doing really well.

191
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,190
I can still see my mother

192
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,080
I am really happy

193
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,990
Really

194
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,790
You are happier now than when you were with me. I am a little sad.

195
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,690
Oh, why are you sad, girl?

196
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,890
Mom is doing well too, don't worry.

197
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,810
Ye Na

198
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,390
Are you happy?

199
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,990
Of course

200
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,580
I miss my mom too.

201
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,790
When the time comes, we will meet naturally.

202
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,370
Wait, it's still a long time.

203
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:25,980
Um

204
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,780
That's right

205
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,970
I prepared a new song.

206
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,200
You have to listen to it.

207
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,940
good

208
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,630
You know my guitar skills, right?

209
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,350
It's really bad

210
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,050
right

211
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,090
Play it for me

212
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,060
Okay

213
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:51,980
Even if you count countless stars one by one

214
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,160
I can no longer fathom your heart

215
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:07,120
Because your heart is broken into pieces

216
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,750
The coldness dissipates in the air

217
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:22,470
The one you loved so deeply in the past

218
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,850
What are my looks?

219
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,320
What I can do for you now

220
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:45,010
Only greetings of good night, sweet dreams and goodbye

221
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,310
Only goodnight

222
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,260
Sweet Dreams

223
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,590
Goodbye greetings

224
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,860
Dr. Yu

225
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,970
Leave the job of taking care of Dr. Dae-hyun to me.

226
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,880
I rushed here with my luggage as soon as I received the news

227
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,760
Thanks

228
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,140
I heard it was a hit-and-run.

229
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,670
The cause of the accident is still unknown?

230
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,730
I don't think the car accident was an accident

231
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,760
So what you mean is

232
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,210
Did someone deliberately bump into Dr. Cui?

233
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,210
What problems might have occurred during the purchase of medicine?

234
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,910
To buy medicine for my brother

235
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
Did you do something dangerous?

236
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,850
You stay here with Daxian for the time being.

237
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,110
This will be safer

238
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,080
I'll ask around for a place to stay later.

239
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,110
Don't worry, Dr. Cui.

240
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,450
I will take good care of him

241
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,780
Thanks

242
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,520
Emergency patient, please give way.

243
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,250
What's going on?

244
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,400
She seems to have taken sleeping pills

245
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,890
I thought I threw it all away

246
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,680
Did she take it regularly?

247
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,610
Yes, because of drug resistance

248
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,600
So she seems to have eaten a lot.

249
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:12,010
don’t worry

250
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,260
The patient seems to have regained consciousness

251
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,490
OK, thanks

252
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,320
I need to do a few more tests.

253
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,590
You don't have to worry about her anymore

254
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,350
If you feel uncomfortable, you can sit outside and wait.

255
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,320
OK

256
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,070
Let's do a basic blood test first.

257
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,270
-=Drug Serial Murder Case=-

258
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,340
The day Choi Gun-soo died

259
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,370
Choi Dae-hyun visited a building in Gangnam

260
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,350
But there's nothing suspicious in that building.

261
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,350
The most suspicious person is the landlord

262
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,900
Does the host have a drug record?

263
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,050
No, originally everyone in that building

264
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,120
It is this entrepreneur named Chen Yingxiu

265
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,990
But I just changed everyone a few days ago.

266
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,880
Because of debt, the entire building was used to pay off the debt.

267
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,030
Do you know anything about the operation of Guguang Assets?

268
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,110
Yes, they replied that they couldn't confirm.

269
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,420
And the former owner Chen Yingxiu is also dead

270
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,780
Can't confirm now

271
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,760
I heard he was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer.

272
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,950
He and Choi Gun-soo died on the same day

273
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,410
Wait a moment

274
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,070
That is, terminally ill patients

275
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,780
He died on the day Choi Dae-hyun went there.

276
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,750
Choi Dae-hyun didn't go to this building to buy medicine

277
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,450
Probably due to euthanasia.

278
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,400
That's right

279
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,310
I received the news that Choi Dae-hyun was in a car accident and hospitalized.

280
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,240
What

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,730
If my wife is okay now

282
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,240
Please help me

283
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,320
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

284
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,170
Please let me die

285
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,640
I don't understand what you are saying

286
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,080
Actually, he is my client.

287
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,300
You told me to be careful recently, but I didn't tell you

288
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,050
Park Tae-hyung has been diagnosed with a terminal illness due to malignant mesothelioma

289
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,840
Malignant mesothelioma: A tumor that develops in the mesothelial layer of the pleura, the lining of the chest, the peritoneum, or the pericardium that covers the heart.

290
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,990
You seem to be having trouble breathing

291
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,100
It turns out it was because of this disease

292
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,930
Malignant mesothelioma

293
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,990
This is the beginning

294
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,980
This disease alone is making me miserable.

295
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,310
At first I just thought there was a thief in the house

296
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,530
Late at night, a strange man

297
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,510
Standing in the hallway of our house

298
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,610
I was very shocked and scared

299
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,780
Just collapsed on the spot

300
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,190
Did I see a ghost?

301
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,700
Or am I crazy?

302
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,610
Later I learned that I had dementia

303
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,770
The name of the disease is also unfamiliar

304
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,750
Lewy body dementia

305
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,100
Lewy body dementia is different from Alzheimer's disease

306
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,900
Although the initial memory is not damaged

307
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,700
But vivid visual hallucinations and hallucinations can cause distress to patients.

308
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,080
Yes, that's right.

309
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,230
The feeling of seeing strangers at home every day

310
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,830
Makes me feel scared like a child

311
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,190
It seems that hallucinations scare you more than pain.

312
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,580
Doctor, I heard that for patients who cannot be cured

313
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,850
Some different treatments will be given

314
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,070
Please

315
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,830
Let me out of this pain

316
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,760
Get rid of it

317
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:54,600
Hello

318
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,060
Hello

319
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,770
Dr. Cui, are you okay?

320
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,670
Someone has been here all the time and just left.

321
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,230
Calm down first.

322
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,800
I walked down this corridor

323
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,470
I didn't see anyone running away from here.

324
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,860
No, no, I'm leaving here.

325
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,970
Dr. Cui, you can't move now.

326
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,290
You still need to continue treatment

327
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,620
Transfer me to Father Yang's hospital, okay?

328
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,010
I don't want to stay here anymore

329
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,580
The inspection has been completed

330
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,490
You can be discharged tomorrow morning.

331
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,590
Is your husband out?

332
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,460
He is in poor health

333
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,260
My nephew brought him home.

334
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,290
So you're staying here by yourself today?

335
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,750
I know what you're worried about.

336
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,580
But as long as my husband is alive

337
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,500
I won't seek death

338
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,270
Because I know how much it would hurt him.

339
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,570
I'll recommend another doctor for you.

340
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,460
Once you find the right doctor, things will get better.

341
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,520
I've seen almost every psychiatrist for my husband.

342
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,070
Life is really unpredictable

343
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,180
I have such a good husband.

344
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,340
But I can't be happy

345
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,690
So don't worry

346
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,730
As long as my husband is alive

347
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,680
I won't die

348
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,510
Are you waiting?

349
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,010
After your husband dies

350
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,090
Will you be free to make your choice then?

351
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,840
For terminally ill patients whose pain cannot be relieved

352
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,010
You can let them rest in eternal peace

353
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,980
My pain has never been alleviated by any method in my life

354
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,750
So can I also

355
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,450
I want to go with my husband.

356
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,990
After he leaves

357
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,270
I don't want to live anymore

358
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,600
I won't let healthy people die.

359
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,920
Am I healthy?

360
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,910
My heart is sick like this

361
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,410
Am I still a healthy person?

362
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,000
For patients like me

363
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,080
Have you ever considered

364
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,620
You said you live for your husband, right?

365
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,990
You don't want your husband to get hurt.

366
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,480
Then please hold on a little longer.

367
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,990
He's suffering enough now.

368
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,550
And there are not many days left

369
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:56,830
We cannot bring the sadness of losing a family member to such a person again.

370
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,130
I know this request is selfish and cruel.

371
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,280
terribly sorry

372
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,350
sorry

373
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,950
I shouldn't say these things.

374
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,250
Please don't take what I say to heart.

375
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,970
Please help my husband.

376
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,550
That person

377
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,000
The right to die with dignity

378
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,300
Please

379
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,470
How many times do I have to say it?

380
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,220
Ye Na's brother has been diagnosed with a terminal illness

381
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,620
We're just assisting him.

382
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,200
Make sure he finishes the show

383
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,550
You all helped so much.

384
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,200
Why did he die?

385
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,750
He obviously died of illness.

386
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,420
Do we still have to explain this to you?

387
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,970
Ye-na just lost her brother a few days ago

388
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,550
Then I'll change the question

389
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,800
Choi Gun-soo's performance

390
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,370
Why did you go to Gangnam?

391
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,850
I'm going to meet a friend.

392
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:20,870
Which friend

393
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,450
Could you please let us confirm?

394
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,300
He is from a foreign country.

395
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,850
He should have left the country by now.

396
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,450
What are you doubting?

397
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,550
We think Choi Dae-hyun, you go to Gangnam

398
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,100
To get the Bafron

399
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,800
Am I crazy?

400
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,600
I've been watched by you all.

401
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,070
Would you still do such a thing?

402
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,970
Someone died in that building.

403
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,070
Do you know Chen Yingxiu?

404
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,470
Unknown

405
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,520
Such a high-intensity investigation of patients

406
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,620
Is that a bit too much?

407
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,920
Dr. Daxian was involved in a hit-and-run accident

408
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,650
Please help chase the criminals first.

409
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,300
No, we said

410
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,320
Are you still under suspicion of the police?

411
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,220
Why are they still acting together?

412
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,820
Let us be more suspicious

413
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,320
We all work at Father Yang's hospital.

414
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,700
Naturally

415
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,320
It's natural...

416
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,720
Naturally what

417
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,950
Started dating

418
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,020
What

419
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,000
oh...

420
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,550
Choi Dae-hyun

421
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,970
Talk to me alone.

422
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,800
It's all because you lied to me

423
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,070
Doing these stupid things led to this.

424
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,720
Yu Suzhen and I will act together from now on

425
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,570
Why did the police come to see our Dr. Cui?

426
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,670
Did you really commit a crime?

427
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,550
sorry

428
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,700
Is this matter

429
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,050
Is it related to Dr. Yu Suzhen?

430
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,370
I'll ask you again

431
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,900
Dr. Cui, what are you doing?

432
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:57,000
Is it the same thing as what Dr. Yu does?

433
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,050
I thought you were a very honest person, Dr. Cui.

434
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,000
You disappointed me

435
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,850
Last time, the case was closed because of luck.

436
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,620
But that doesn't mean what you're doing is right.

437
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,750
You know that too.

438
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,570
Father, you are right.

439
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,070
I no longer think

440
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,120
This matter

441
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,670
It’s the right choice

442
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,500
This is where patients with nowhere else to go are housed.

443
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,970
It's not used to hide criminals.

444
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,020
God

445
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,550
Will forgive

446
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,370
Our sins, Father?

447
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,800
I should be forgiven.

448
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,900
As long as you truly repent

449
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,300
So I hope Dr. Choi Dae-hyun

450
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,300
Can stop Dr. Yu

451
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,300
Captain An said he was a friend of Councillor Bai

452
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,700
We are not allowed to enter the building operated by Guguang Asset

453
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,100
Isn't it Councillor Bai who is urging us?

454
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,150
Can we get some results from our search?

455
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,620
That is to say

456
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,970
It's really strange

457
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,670
Chen Yingxiu, Guguang Asset Operations

458
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,450
He gets angry when these things are mentioned.

459
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,870
Even if he is a friend of Councillor Bai

460
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,450
He is also a person related to the incident

461
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,750
No matter how you think about it, friends are just an excuse

462
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,950
Next time if you find important evidence

463
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,420
Don't go through Captain An

464
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,370
Report it directly to the MP.

465
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,920
good

466
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,020
But how to search for the operation of Guguang Assets?

467
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,600
The search here

468
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,720
I'll go by myself

469
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,600
What

470
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,420
If Captain An finds out later

471
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,670
Just say it's my personal behavior.

472
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
Forget it, kid.

473
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,470
I'll take this responsibility.

474
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,820
Have a cup of tea

475
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,250
I heard you're particularly curious about this office?

476
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,420
This is my private space

477
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,970
You are not allowed to watch it at will

478
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,220
But if you scan it, you will find

479
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,720
This is a very ordinary place

480
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,850
I have a few questions for you

481
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,020
When the former building owner Chen Yingxiu died

482
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,870
Where are you

483
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,300
When was that

484
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,320
November 23

485
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,470
This day

486
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,320
I met a model at a party not long ago.

487
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,950
Went for a drive and chatted

488
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,750
And kissed a few times

489
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,250
OK

490
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,500
Have you heard of Choi Dae-hyun?

491
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,700
I don't know

492
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,800
When did you move here?

493
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:59,620
Not long yet

494
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,450
Representing your home...

495
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,450
I told you, will you understand?

496
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,900
You know where you lived before?

497
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,970
Is Jin Shijian living there?

498
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,700
who is he

499
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,650
Do you know Councilman Baek Dong-hoon?

500
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,700
I'm not an employee of a credit bureau.

501
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,350
Why did you come to me to ask about this person and that person?

502
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,520
It's Councilman Baek Dong-hoon

503
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,470
He and I were in the same church, so we knew each other.

504
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,770
Last question

505
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,250
Where is An Taicheng?

506
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,800
Is An Taicheng successful?

507
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,600
-I don't know him. -Captain An

508
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,470
Don't you know him?

509
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,720
oh

510
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,850
Captain An

511
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,920
Councillor Bai said that one should get to know more people when doing business

512
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,350
He introduced him to me

513
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,320
So I met him.

514
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,000
Is there anything else you're curious about?

515
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,700
You should be busy

516
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,900
Please keep working.

517
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,150
If you have any questions, please contact me

518
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,800
Did I say no?

519
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,620
Do you want to drop this case?

520
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,870
sorry

521
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,620
Did you tell them to ignore my instructions?

522
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,420
No

523
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:30,070
Zhixun's desire is too much

524
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,170
Not Detective Pan.

525
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,250
We are not together

526
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:35,050
Detective Pan acted alone...

527
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,950
That's not the case either.

528
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,350
sorry

529
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,750
When Pan Zhixun comes back, let him come to my room

530
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,000
The police also came here yesterday

531
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,720
Although this may cause doubt

532
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
But they can't arrest you.

533
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,320
I did it wrong at the beginning

534
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,120
I shouldn't have started this.

535
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,250
No matter what good reasons you come up with

536
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,800
This is killing people

537
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,120
Seeing those patients who are suffering

538
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,970
Don't you agree with my idea?

539
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,550
Yeah, that's just a high-sounding excuse.

540
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,500
I just want to be like those illegal practitioners

541
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,920
Easy money, easy work

542
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,000
That's why I agreed to your request.

543
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:24,450
If I had known that I would be chased by the police like this

544
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,800
Become a criminal suspect

545
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,900
I won't do it

546
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,820
So what should I do?

547
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,050
If you want to continue doing this

548
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,550
Not only will you hurt yourself

549
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,150
It will also kill me and Ye-na.

550
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:47,770
So you promised me

551
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,620
Won't touch this again

552
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,870
For you, I can be more cautious.

553
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,250
But I can't promise you

554
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,020
If you give up so easily

555
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,770
I wouldn't have chosen to start in the first place.

556
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,200
Is your belief more important than me and Ye-na?

557
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,050
That's not what I meant.

558
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,450
If you want to continue

559
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,770
Don't come to me again

560
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,020
-Are you serious? -Yes

561
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,470
I am very serious

562
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,870
Being involved with you, living in fear

563
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,400
I don't want to live like this anymore

564
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,070
So if you insist on continuing

565
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,950
Let's not meet again.

566
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,820
Please deal with it quickly.

567
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:54,220
If my uncle dies, I will inherit the estate.

568
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,950
I heard this three years ago.

569
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,400
But compared to this

570
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,400
The police are watching.

571
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,220
Why are you so anxious to send your uncle away?

572
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,320
Is this correct?

573
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,550
I feel too anxious.

574
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,500
I don't have that much patience.

575
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,700
So I have something to tell you.

576
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,050
Park Tae-hyung's nephew contacted me

577
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,420
Park Tae-hyung is in really bad condition right now

578
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,050
I want to meet Dr. Yu in person.

579
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,670
Although I want to help, I still have some concerns.

580
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:41,020
Do you have any concerns?

581
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,800
As long as you can promise

582
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,650
Any help I can offer

583
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,350
For those who are not mentally prepared

584
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,950
I can't do that treatment.

585
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,100
For whatever reason

586
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,650
As long as you still have a fondness for life

587
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,900
This treatment will only kill people.

588
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,920
Park Tae-hyung is very worried about his death

589
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,800
Will become a lonely wife

590
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:13,100
I won't let my uncle worry and I will take good care of my aunt.

591
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,780
So you just believe me

592
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,090
Please help my uncle, he is in real pain.

593
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,110
Please

594
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,680
Park Tae-hyung's euthanasia

595
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,350
It's very suitable for Yu Suzhen to do it

596
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,360
But our previous method was difficult to convince Yu Suzhen.

597
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,330
So this time we're going to use a more common approach.

598
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,210
Implement the battle plan against Yu Suzhen

599
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,720
This is right

600
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,040
So I have to deceive her like a normal client.

601
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:51,030
No, Yu Suzhen is being chased by the police now.

602
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,290
Would you be willing to help my uncle?

603
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,440
You say this because you don't know her. You don't have to worry.

604
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:01,710
Yu Suzhen is a very soft-hearted doctor towards patients

605
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,620
And Park Tae-hyung's disease name is real.

606
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,390
His story is also very pitiful.

607
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,020
So Yu Suzhen will never refuse

608
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,450
I'll help you. Just trust me.

609
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,630
Not only is my uncle, I won't let you worry

610
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,500
Will prepare everything

611
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,370
Who told you to make trouble everywhere?

612
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,700
Whose instructions were you given?

613
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,200
Do you also know CEO Koo Kwang-chul?

614
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:41,470
What

615
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,690
Representative Gu Guangzhe said he greeted you.

616
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,980
I thought you guys were familiar with each other

617
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,000
Didn't you just say hello?

618
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:55,190
Just a greeting. What? Is it important?

619
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,770
As far as I know

620
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,610
There are many people in the financial sector

621
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,830
All the money was handed over to Representative Gu Guangzhe

622
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,870
He often parties with people who entrust him with their money

623
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,320
But the suspicious thing is

624
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,590
Most of the participants have drug convictions or are suspected of drug use.

625
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,350
Are you talking about some kind of hallucination party?

626
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,190
Just your guess

627
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,700
Are you just going to mess things up based on speculation?

628
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,960
If you agree, I will conduct a formal investigation.

629
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,270
Next time, I will report and then take action.

630
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,360
Don't make people look ridiculous.

631
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,280
knew

632
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,590
Thanks

633
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,510
You must be tired too

634
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,790
Because I worked hard. I'm sorry.

635
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,930
You're welcome

636
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,870
You also helped my brother.

637
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,350
Are we a team?

638
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,380
Of course we have to do it together.

639
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,200
Thanks

640
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,590
That Dr. Cui

641
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,380
The bag you gave me last time

642
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,470
It was taken away by Dr. Yu

643
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,610
Oops, Dr. Cui, sorry to disturb your rest.

644
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,430
But now a lot of medical supplies have arrived at the hospital

645
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,630
and the meat and rice eaten by the patient

646
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,720
A lot of donated items came

647
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,740
Really? It's a good thing.

648
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,600
Which group sent it?

649
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,360
It's not a group, it's an individual donation.

650
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,230
But the donor said

651
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,510
Tell him what medical facilities the hospital needs now

652
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,250
He will buy it immediately

653
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,450
So I want to ask you

654
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,540
So that's it

655
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,300
Is that a member of the church here?

656
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:07,970
right

657
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,740
Representative Gu Kwang-chul

658
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,500
My family members are all members of our church.

659
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,130
But this is the first time I donated to a hospital

660
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,400
Said it was recommended by an acquaintance

661
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,370
Wait, is his name Gu Kwang-chul?

662
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,690
Representative Gu Guangzhe

663
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,770
-I am from the seventh term. -Senior

664
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,630
I am a younger generation than you.

665
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,820
Wow, what a coincidence!

666
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,190
Wow, thank you.

667
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,340
Wow, what a coincidence!

668
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,590
I'm so lucky! Put that one over there!

669
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,910
- Kitchen - Good

670
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,880

671

673
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,550
Open your mouth

674
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,220
Don't insist anymore

675
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,550
Because you can't sort out the situation.

676
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,310
how

677
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,800
Do you want to be beaten again?

678
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,300
Do you still want to be beaten before eating, you arrogant ghost?

679
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,290
Open your mouth! Open your mouth!

680
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,560
Let you enjoy everything without missing anything

681
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,980
Why do you want to die?

682
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,440
Not knowing how to appreciate the blessings you have

683
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,380
So you're a psychopath.

684
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,680
Wife

685
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,560
Is this true?

686
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,840
No way

687
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:11,490
It's fine

688
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,180
I'm fine

689
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,670
today

690
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,250
Just go

691
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,250
Leave quietly...

692
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,690
There will be no change

693
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:43,830
Follow your promise

694
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,820
I will comply

695
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,220
The suicide note will not change

696
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:54,400
You just need to connect me with that doctor.

697
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,310
There will be no change

698
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,330
so

699
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:04,200
Please

700
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,640
Let's go

701
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,300
Aunt

702
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,860
You have to meet Dr. Yu with me.

703
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,600
I have something to convince her of.

704
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,940
knew

705
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:36,140
Anytime

706
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,190
Just make an appointment

707
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:45,020
So how about tomorrow?

708

710
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,230
There is indeed a functional relationship

711
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,460
I feel better after donating.

712
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:03,590
What brought you here?

713
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,340
The tall detective came to see me

714
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:10,730
You said that, right?

715
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,060
Why didn't you say it?

716
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,370
He's very good to you.

717
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:27,680
Anyway, I think it doesn't matter

718
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:35,970
Do you want to call the police?

719
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,480
Stop fighting

720
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,000
Without me

721
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,300
I don't know what he will do to you.

722
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,790
us

723
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,280
Let's leave together

724
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:04,190
My husband's condition has become very bad.

725
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,370
The hallucinations are severe now.

726
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,580
Keep your eyes closed all day

727
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,290
Can't see my face

728
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,970
All I see is fear

729
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,800
I told you too

730
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:27,350
My husband is really a great man.

731
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,230
He has the right to die with dignity.

732
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,920
If my husband died peacefully because of me

733
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,870
That for me

734
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,520
It is also the pain and pain that cannot be washed away

735
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,950
I understand your position.

736
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,380
But I can't decide now

737
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,990
The most realistic problem is

738
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:59,980
I don't have any medicine

739
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:09,640
Perhaps you are talking about Bafron?

740
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,280
I will find it

741
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,370
Actually, I

742
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:21,990
Previously defended dark web criminals

743
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:25,740
At that time, I didn't learn to buy medicine on purpose.

744
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,000
Even though I know it's illegal

745
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:31,090
But for my uncle, there's nothing I can do.

746
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:34,890
I will definitely buy it on that day

747
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,330
Help us

748
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,890
Help us

749
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:28,460
The tutor is coming. Are you ready?

750
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,180
The teacher said you are the child holding the door handle

751
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,890
You said you wanted to go out whenever you had the chance.

752
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,310
You really embarrass me.

753
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,240
Aren't you losing weight?

754
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,880
I practiced very hard and lost weight

755
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,450
Really

756
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,850
Is it to be longer?

757
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,240
If you dance ballet, it's best not to grow any longer.

758
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,230
Hello

759
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,430
no

760
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:25,620
When I received your call

761
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,430
I thought you were drinking

762
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,300
After coming here, I really had to change my mind.

763
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,100
I can

764
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,230
Wearing a bug

765
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:38,970
I will do as you tell me.

766
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,660
Just let me see the police.

767
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:43,800
No matter what you do, you can't protect Yu Suzhen

768
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,680
The guy who gave me the medicine

769
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,530
Now he's crazy and wants to kill me

770
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,100
Although I am ashamed

771
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,740
But I don't have the energy to protect Suzhen

772
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:06,310
I heard you took the bag back.

773
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,470
Even if you object, there is no way

774
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,430
Park Tae-hyung in this state

775
00:51:11,930 --> 00:51:14,470
More than anyone we've helped so far.

776
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,440
People who need our treatment more

777
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,170
I didn't ask you to meet me just to object.

778
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:21,230
I know it's useless for me to object

779
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,520
So since it's like this

780
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,230
I'll go too.

781
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:31,880
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

782
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,290
This isn't just your problem.

783
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,720
As long as you don't stop

784
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,240
We would be dangerous indeed.

785
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:43,060
If you're worried about that, that's okay.

786
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,860
You don't have to come. I can do it myself.

787
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,530
Well, not you

788
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:47,820
Because I'm uneasy

789
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:50,830
I'll go too.

790
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:52,770
Let's go together

791
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,550
Choi Dae-hyun said he would assist in the investigation

792
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,990
They will be wearing bugs and cameras.

793
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:10,310
Oh, why don't you clean it up?

794
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:11,850
Please take a seat

795
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,250
Choi Dae-hyun said

796
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,810
Will comply with all police requests

797
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,450
Now it's Officer Fu's turn to talk to me.

798
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,190
Yu Suzhen, the main culprit

799
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,590
Choi Dae-hyun's accomplice

800
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,210
Don't charge them with drug trafficking.

801
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,440
Yes, that's how it should be

802
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,800
But why did he suddenly change his mind?

803
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,560
It seems that he was threatened by the drug supplier.

804
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,770
It's exhausting both mentally and financially.

805
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,190
If you are threatened like this

806
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,020
Maybe I just want to accept the punishment and end it all.

807
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:43,770
Take this opportunity to kill the threatening criminal

808
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:45,230
Just catch them together.

809
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,290
But the target is not the threat criminal.

810
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,670
I don't know who it is.

811
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,310
It takes a long time to catch it.

812
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,390
As long as I help you catch Yu Suzhen

813
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,680
Isn't that enough?

814
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:57,290
We want to end it as soon as possible

815
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:58,930
Yes, that is

816
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,690
Then let's capture Yu Suzhen first.

817
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:04,430
The rest of us slowly

818
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:05,810
Catch him

819
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,590
-well

820
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,050
today

821
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,620
Doctor Yu will come

822
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,330
good

823
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,170
Words from the caregiver and aunt

824
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:26,540
I gave them this week off.

825
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:30,310
good

826
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:36,060
Thank you

827
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,220
Aunt's words

828
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,940
Don't worry about her

829
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,740
uncle

830
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,590
During this period

831
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,000
Thanks a lot

832
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,560
Also wearing stab-proof clothing

833
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:50,030
Why? Are you afraid that Yu Suzhen will know you

834
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,230
After betraying her

835
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,810
Will he swing a knife at you?

836
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,530
Suzhen is scary when she's angry, even scarier than an excited patient.

837
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:58,110
Don't worry too much

838
00:54:58,970 --> 00:54:59,780
ah

839
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:02,990
And you must abide by the agreement

840
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,880
Sentencing?

841
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,660
Don't worry about sentencing

842
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,050
If you break your promise

843
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:08,920
Your lawyer will kill me.

844
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:10,600
Get ready quickly

845
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,410
No matter what happens

846
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,810
I will definitely abide by the agreement

847
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:07,630
Are you mentally prepared?

848
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:10,120
Yes

849
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:14,370
Thanks

850
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:06,710
You are here

851
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,000
Waiting for you

852
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:39,830
Let me do it

853
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,630
Just stand next to me.

854
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,230
Have you got the medicine?

855
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:47,300
Uh-huh

856
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:48,870
Someone will bring it over. It should be here soon.

857
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,810
Why not answer

858
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:22,950
What's the phone number?

859
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,990
Ah, nothing.

860
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,250
Hello

861
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,360
What happened?

862
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:35,450
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

863
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,290
Didn't you say you would help us?

864
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,350
You actually tricked us

865
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,130
Doctor, we'll see each other again.

866
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,530
husband

867
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:44,220
Why did you stop?

868
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,130
Please hurry up

869
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:48,190
-You are Caiyan, right? -Don't touch the child

870
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,210
You'd better go over there right now

871
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:54,560
The situation is getting dangerous and out of control.

872
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,030
That drug dealer must be arrested.

873
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,200
A client appeared who wanted to pay more money.

874
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,230
If you mess around again, you're really dead this time.

875
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,210
Yu Suzhen is not immune
