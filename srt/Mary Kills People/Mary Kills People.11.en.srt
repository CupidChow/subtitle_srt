00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,990
The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,360
My sister, who I know very well, has performed in North Korea.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,640
I heard they call "cheers, drink it all"

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,130
This is how "a mouthful of dryness" is said

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,430
We also

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,660
One gulp

8
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,820
Don't you want to drink?

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,620
In short

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,020
When you do euthanasia

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,520
I really think it's handsome

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
Very sexy

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,760
Do you want me to show you?

14
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,920
Bring me the Bafron.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
I'll show you

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,060
This one?

17
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,860
Did you bring the stuff?

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,690
Where is Representative Gu Kwang-chul?

19
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,220
Today is your death anniversary

20
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,420
Hey, hit harder.

21
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,240
That's it

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Yu Suzhen

23
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,820
Hello

24
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,730
There's an antidote in the bag.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,590
Is this here? Wait...wait a minute.

26
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,720
Where exactly

27
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,860
Hey this

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,410
Hello

29
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,820
Is this your plan?

30
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,720
Hello, hello, wait, wait

31
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,460
What? An electronic anklet?

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,990
You are such a despicable guy.

33
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,920
Ouch

34
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,720
This is fulfilling your wish

35
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,720
Mr. Park Min-seong

36
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,390
You are hereby arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of Ms. Pei Meiying.

37
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,390
You can exercise your right to remain silent

38
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,870
You can also hire a lawyer

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,190
You've been fooled.

40
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,220
What's this

41
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,720
Don't move

42
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,130
arrest

43
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,940
Wake Up, Yu Suzhen

Please

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
Kill me

50
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,620
Are you serious?

51
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,810
Just now

52
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,730
You said that I should kill you

53
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,420
Just like when your husband first met me

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,820
Just like when you ask me for help

55
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,370
I felt a mix of emotions

56
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,570
Even though I say I want to die

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,580
But I still hesitate

58
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,220
You from me

59
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:32,090
Do you feel hesitation in your heart?

60
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,060
right

61
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,120
What kind of psychological changes have occurred?

62
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,270
In the ambulance on the way to the hospital

63
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
First responders

64
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,300
It's a miracle I didn't die

65
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,510
I said I survived because I hit a tree midway.

66
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,620
Being alive is a blessing

67
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,160
them

68
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,420
To my blurred consciousness

69
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,020
Keep saying live

70
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,260
To live strong

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,260
Listen to what they say

72
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,930
I thought of my husband

73
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,990
The doctor said

74
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,230
She will come today

75
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,080
There's one thing I want you to do while you're still alive.

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,120
Speak

77
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,930
What can I do for you?

78
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,370
At once...

79
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,190
Look at the sunshine when the weather is good

80
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,160
Listen to the sound of rain when it rains

81
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,620
that's all

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,520
Feel more subtle things

83
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:02,690
I hope

84
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,920
you can

85
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,560
Come to me later

86
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,620
People don't live to do great things.

87
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,260
you

88
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,620
that's all

89
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,570
Again...

90
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,210
Try to survive, okay?

91
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,020
This person

92
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,190
I really hope I survive.

93
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,890
I have this idea

94
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,090
I

95
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,420
What to do now?

96
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,520
With this thought in mind, I should live on.

97
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,780
Even though my body has collapsed

98
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,190
I don't know how long it can last

99
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,900
but

100
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,720
I should live, right?

101
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,190
certainly

102
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,070
Your husband will cheer you on, too.

103
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,560
Yena, where are you?

104
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,760
I have something urgent to ask you.

105
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,260
Daxian and I saw the news.

106
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,700
Is it true that Park Tae-hyung and his wife died?

107
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,420
Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive

108
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,890
But now the situation is very bad

109
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,860
There are still people who want to harm Ms. Pei Meiying

110
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,620
I hope you can come and take care of me, Ye-na.

111
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,720
OK, got it.

112
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
Where should I go?

113
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,040
Yu Suzhen, you have nowhere to escape.

114
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,710
Please give me some time

115
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,670
If you swear never to euthanize again

116
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,360
Words to help any patient

117
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,560
I will help you

118
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,620
Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive

119
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,650
Isn't that person already dead?

120
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,460
My name was mixed up with other patients when I was admitted to the hospital.

121
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,060
Now in the intensive care unit

122
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,560
If the news that Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive spreads

123
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,020
Someone might come and hurt her.

124
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,920
Please protect her

125
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,590
Who to guard against

126
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,580
tell me

127
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,620
If the news that Bae Mi-young is still alive spreads

128
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,270
Gu Kwang-chul and Park Min-seong are worried that the witness is still alive

129
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,990
Will hurt her

130
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,820
I want to save Ms. Bae Mi-young

131
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,880
Please help me

132
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,830
First, Ms. Pei Meiying

133
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,560
Park Min-seong may come to the hospital

134
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,200
The problem is Gu Kwang-chul

135
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,980
To stop him from escaping

136
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,410
He must be captured at the Bafron transaction site

137
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,250
I have a way to make Gu Kwang-chul believe me

138
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,860
Hand over Bafron

139
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,260
This is the video footage of the client personally agreeing to euthanasia.

140
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,390
If I offer to hand over this

141
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,200
Gu Guangzhe should believe that I want to cooperate with him

142
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,030
Is this video about you or Choi Dae-hyun?

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,050
Only the client's screen

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,460
That's enough

145
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,900
I need medicine

146
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,790
Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive

147
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,780
I'm going there now

148
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,290
Where is Pei Meiying now?

149
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,170
Wait a minute

150
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,130
See me first, then we'll talk about dealing with Pei Meiying.

151
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,120
Where should I go?

152
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
Nurse

153
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,060
What brings you to the hospital at this time?

154
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:30,930
sorry

155
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,990
Dr. Yu has something to ask of me

156
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,660
I probably can't do it alone.

157
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,700
Please help me

158
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,190
Doctor Yu?

159
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,730
right

160
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,710
Brother Zhixun

161
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,090
What? Ms. Pei Meiying is still alive?

162
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,080
Yeah, but

163
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,890
Park Min-seong or someone else will come and kill Ms. Bae Mi-young

164
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,890
You must protect Ms. Pei Meiying

165
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,690
Arrest that guy

166
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,160
Me? Me?

167
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,340
Am I the only one?

168
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:08,930
Um

169
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,360
Yu Suzhen has arrived

170
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,270
You can handle it yourself, aunt.

171
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,260
She's dying anyway.

172
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,740
You can always handle this yourself, right?

173
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,240
Hang up

174
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,770
It's cold outside

175
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,920
Cognac

176
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,520
Previously, in order to prove that the client agreed to euthanasia

177
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,950
I've been shooting videos

178
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,550
Safety first?

179
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:44,070
Very Yu Suzhen's style

180
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,130
Let me take a look

181
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,790
I am Choi Kang-yoon

182
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,290
End your life now

183
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,300
This is all my choice

184
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,030
Now this moment

185
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,050
I feel very happy and satisfied

186
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,890
But this could be your insurance.

187
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,390
On the contrary, it may become evidence of your crime

188
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,320
Maybe

189
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,400
All undisclosed euthanasia will be exposed

190
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,590
I don't know if this will hold up in court.

191
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,320
But the patients' families

192
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,400
I hope to understand the true heart of the deceased

193
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,270
Of course it's best not to use this

194
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,230
Such an important thing

195
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,920
Do you want to give it to me?

196
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,030
This means trusting you

197
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,860
From now on, these videos are yours to keep

198
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,750
But why do you

199
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,830
Suddenly changed your mind?

200
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,140
The situation is out of control

201
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,880
Becomes very dangerous

202
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,780
If Pei Meiying wakes up soon

203
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,850
If you confess the truth to the police

204
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,780
How big will things get in the end?

205
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,080
There's no way to predict

206
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,150
A lot has happened during this period of time

207
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,710
I'm so tired

208
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,000
So I need a partner to work with me

209
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,370
Where is Choi Dae-hyun?

210
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,490
He has surrendered to the police.

211
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,910
So I felt uneasy and couldn't continue working with him.

212
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,650
I need someone to help me get the medicine.

213
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,210
And protect me from the police

214
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,350
what you say

215
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,920
From my perspective, I welcome it.

216
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,190
Very good but

217
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,600
How strange! I'm a little overwhelmed.

218
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,600
Although I don't want to face the reality

219
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,470
But I think you can protect me.

220
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,200
Of course I don't

221
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,980
Brother, I can protect you.

222
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,350
The choice is yours

223
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,470
I don't intend to force you.

224
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,780
Yu Suzhen

225
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,680
finally

226
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,100
You are welcome to surrender to your brother.

227
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,000
Welcome to my world

228
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,310
Yu Suzhen

229
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,810
Hello

230
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,570
I have the antidote in my bag.

231
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,090
Are you...are you here? Wait for me.

232
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,930
Where

233
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,330
Where exactly

234
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,250
Is this it?

235
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,220
Hey, is this your plan?

236
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
So cute. So cute.

237
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,880
I really want to bite the back of your neck and chew it over and over again

238
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,080
Hello

239
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,160
You can't treat me like this

240
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,790
I promised to protect you.

241
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:06,790
Yu Suzhen

242
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,640
Yu Suzhen, get up

243
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,140
Yu Suzhen

244
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,910
Wake up, Yu Suzhen

245
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,920
Yu Suzhen

246
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,600
Are you okay?

247
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,430
Yu Suzhen

248
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,150
Wake up!

249
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,320
-= Basin City Police Department Wide Area Search Team =-

250
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,940
The serial numbers have been compared

251
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,090
We have confirmed

252
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,180
This is the Barfron extracted from the evidence storage.

253
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,770
What's this

254
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,980
Hey, isn't this how we package evidence?

255
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,590
There is also evidence number on it

256
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,500
-=Certificate No. 3=-

257
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,260
Do you have evidence that I was the one who took the evidence?

258
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,170
And then it flows to the outside world?

259
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,500
Deliberately covering up surveillance work

260
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,190
After this the drugs disappeared

261
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,750
It must be a coincidence.

262
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,420
It's not that time point.

263
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,720
It was only at that time that I discovered it was missing.

264
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,340
Come in

265
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,230
yes

266
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,940
You know him, right?

267
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,660
No, I don't know him.

268
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,840
He has confessed that the drugs he took were traded with you.

269
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,630
It's over

270
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,800
Now tell me about it

271
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,220
Under whose instructions was this done?

272
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,340
Brats

273
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,810
How dare you come in like this?

274
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,870
From Gu Kwang-chul's office

275
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,390
I found all the money I received from you during this period.

276
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,550
Already got the evidence

277
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,490
-=Arrest Warrant=-

278
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,090
-=Bansong Police Department Wide Area Investigation Team Captain An Taicheng=-

279
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,480
An Taicheng

280
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,530
Various luxury goods and car transactions

281
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,940
and a golf club

282
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,830
Finally found it

283
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,320
Gu Guangzhe and our Captain An

284
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,450
link

285
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,560
Just to show my identity.

286
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,560
The younger generations worked so hard to catch the criminals.

287
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,630
But the captain is accumulating connections, right?

288
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,420
I didn't know that Gu Kwang-chul was involved in the crime.

289
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,340
Stop talking

290
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,440
The drug squad leader has confessed.

291
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,910
I made a deal with Gu Guangzhe based on your instructions.

292
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,720
If you want to quibble, you can tell me when you are investigated.

293
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,020
I refuse to state

294
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,620
I'm speechless.

295
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,130
Mr. Park Min-seong

296
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,580
I personally arrested you as a criminal.

297
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,800
He was also the lawyer of Chen Yingxiu, who was killed by Gu Guangzhe with Bafulong.

298
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,420
Do you think denial can solve the problem?

299
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,500
I refuse to state

300
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,590
Let's talk it out in court.

301
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,380
Auntie, are you okay?

302
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,280
Why are the police guarding the ward door?

303
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,870
Didn't you suddenly faint while working?

304
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,170
I said that on purpose because I was afraid you would be scared

305
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,110
Actually, I have a problem.

306
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,630
After I finish treatment

307
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,600
May need to be investigated

308
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,060
What happened

309
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,010
There is a way to die called euthanasia

310
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:40,950
I believe that patients in pain need euthanasia.

311
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,840
So I've been doing this kind of thing.

312
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,760
And something happened during this process

313
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,780
Is it serious?

314
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,100
If I accept the investigation, I will probably be detained.

315
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,440
But that's my choice

316
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,580
Even if I have to accept punishment, I have no choice but to accept it.

317
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,470
But I'm worried about you and Cai Yun

318
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,050
Because of my belief

319
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,150
You might get judged by people.

320
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,870
You may also need care.

321
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,750
I will ask Father Yang for help

322
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,300
But you'll probably still be tired.

323
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,360
sorry

324
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,780
I always have a lot of secrets

325
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,960
And I don't explain it to you guys.

326
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,280
Do you have a lot of dissatisfaction?

327
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,350
This is the secret I can't tell you.

328
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,600
If you think that's the treatment the patient needs

329
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,500
I can understand

330
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,860
Because you are a good doctor

331
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,000
No matter what others say to you

332
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,360
I firmly believe you have no bad intentions in doing this.

333
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,250
Thank you

334
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,480
How much is this?

335
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,060
I watched other tapes

336
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,950
These are all shot

337
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,680
To prove that the client chose euthanasia of his own choice

338
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,440
I am Choi Kang-yoon

339
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,920
Plan to end one's life

340
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:38,410
Those videotapes are in Gu Kwang-chul's house

341
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,080
This means all cases during this period

342
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,500
All led by Gu Guangzhe

343
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,850
From the perspectives of Yu Suzhen and Choi Daxian

344
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,240
It's evidence of the crime

345
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,440
Although it may become evidence of the crime

346
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,330
But it is proved that the client did it voluntarily.

347
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,220
So it can also be seen as evidence of the legitimacy of euthanasia.

348
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,660
During the trial, it can also be a factor in reducing the sentence.

349
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,120
It's supposed to be a threat.

350
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,110
Gu Guangzhe wants to kill Yu Suzhen with Bafulong

351
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,960
And pointed a gun at her.

352
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,120
If you had gone to rescue Yu Suzhen later

353
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,640
She almost died.

354
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,110
Hey Daojun

355
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,300
Call the hospital to check if Yu Suzhen has recovered.

356
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,440
If possible, review it.

357
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:16,940
good

358
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,650
I saw a video of Congressman Bai's son.

359
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,220
When the investigation is almost done

360
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,950
Give it to Councillor Bai

361
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,660
Councilman Baek didn't even know that Gu Kwang-chul killed his own son

362
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,170
And help him cover the bottom

363
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,660
yes

364
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,750
It's his fault for protecting Gu Guangzhe.

365
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,600
yes

366
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,470
But from what Councillor Bai has entrusted us to do

367
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,090
He probably doesn't know anything.

368
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,550
After he knew the truth

369
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,340
That impact...

370
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,550
Team leader, it's time to interrogate Choi Dae-hyun.

371
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,550
I went

372
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,050
Since Jin Shijian's death

373
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,140
Gu Guangzhe led the euthanasia

374
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,070
You and Yu Suzhen were threatened by Gu Guangzhe

375
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,040
Euthanasia was performed, is that what you mean?

376
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,680
No, it was the drug dealer Gu Guangzhe who asked me to do it alone.

377
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,910
no

378
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,040
Not all of this

379
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,060
Did you do all this alone?

380
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,910
I owed a debt to Gu Kwang-chul when I was taking drugs

381
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,400
I was forced by him.

382
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,170
Euthanasia for patients

383
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,710
Here is the evidence that I did these things alone

384
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,690
The client's video in your hand

385
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,740
No one else appears except the client.

386
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,700
But in this recording

387
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,400
There is my voice and the voices of those present

388
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,400
And the original situation at that time

389
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,570
You can find out by confirming it.

390
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,420
Yu Suzhen has nothing to do with this matter

391
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,400
no

392
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,150
This is not a video, it's a recording.

393
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,510
Before euthanasia

394
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:16,410
Always ask the client to film a video with their consent

395
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,090
Is that right?

396
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,990
Yes, the client on that day, Chen Yingxiu, did not agree.

397
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,610
I secretly recorded it myself

398
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,410
My tongue is no longer working.

399
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,290
Everything I eat tastes bitter

400
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,040
Have you said goodbye to your family?

401
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,160
Around this time

402
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,590
Wife and mother

403
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,160
They should be arguing

404
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,810
Arguing over who took more of the inheritance

405
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,340
Yu Suzhen

406
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,740
Just asking me to surrender myself.

407
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,640
If she is guilty

408
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,710
Just didn't report me.

409
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,190
Choi Dae-hyun

410
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,940
You have helped Gu Kwang-chul too many times.

411
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,660
It is hard to see it as being threatened and forced to assist

412
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,790
Gu Kwang-chul has a gun

413
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,460
Probably an illegal gun

414
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,160
He once joked about shooting me

415
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,390
So I couldn't refuse his request.

416
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,160
no

417
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,510
If you admit that you did all this

418
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,840
The sentence could increase significantly

419
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,440
Please think rationally.

420
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,510
Take a break

421
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,690
Yeah, take a break.

422
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,060
Pan Zhixun, please help me

423
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,010
I will take all responsibility

424
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,860
Yu Suzhen will not agree

425
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,710
Yes, she definitely will.

426
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,840
But from a realistic perspective

427
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,960
Suzhen has nephews and nieces to take care of

428
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,040
I've already taken drugs.

429
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,190
It's hard to evade responsibility

430
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,110
Please let me take responsibility.

431
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,390
Since the day I met Gu Kwang-chul at the abandoned factory

432
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,260
I've already made this plan.

433
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,510
Please

434
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,110
Before going to the agency for investigation

435
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:25,740
Yu Suzhen, there is something you need to know

436
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,690
You say it

437
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,590
I'm ready

438
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,110
Choi Dae-hyun

439
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,290
Honestly, I did all this by myself.

440
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,060
no

441
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,190
The incident has become so big

442
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,160
Can't let him be responsible alone

443
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:50,760
He has already planned to use Chen Yingxiu's case

444
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,590
Even brought evidence that he worked alone

445
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,310
When I'm interviewed tomorrow

446
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,990
I will confess everything to make things right.

447
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,960
Park Min-seong died in prison today

448
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,760
It was said to be an accidental incident between prisoners.

449
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,590
We can't help but doubt

450
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,560
No matter what you think

451
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,760
There must be someone we missed.

452
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,210
In this case, if you, Yu Suzhen, were also detained,

453
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,610
Too dangerous

454
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,660
For children too

455
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,310
Even so, I cannot shirk my responsibility.

456
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,610
Wait until it's really safe

457
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,190
Confess and take responsibility.

458
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,540
Instead of now

459
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,310
Just think of it as assisting the investigation.

460
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,260
This is a choice for everyone.

461
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,910
You have a great friend

462
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,260
Choi Dae-hyun even brought evidence

463
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,810
Prove that you did all this yourself

464
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,810
Yu Suzhen, you are protecting Bae Mi-young

465
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,490
Contacted us, Detective Pan, for help

466
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,860
It also helped us arrest Gu Kwang-chul.

467
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,010
I admit

468
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,510
But you are still a suspect under great suspicion

469
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,610
I don't want to shirk responsibility

470
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,160
You know there's no evidence.

471
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,110
That's why it's so strong.

472
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,660
good

473
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,740
The investigation should be

474
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,660
Koo Kwang-chul, Ahn Tae-sung, Choi Dae-hyun

475
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:46,940
These three people are the main culprits to close the case.

476
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,690
But be careful

477
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,440
We will continue to follow you in the future

478
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,540
You come to finish it.

479
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,560
That's right

480
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,560
You've worked hard

481
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:28,410
Now regarding the Bafulong murder case that occurred in Basin City

482
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,410
Interim investigation report on a strong suspect

483
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,210
We have realized that the use of Pavlon

484
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,510
The severity of the new type of homicide

485
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,160
Search with full force from the start

486
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
As we investigate the smuggling of Bafron

487
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,140
Receive high remuneration

488
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,010
Suspect A, who committed murder under the guise of euthanasia, was on his way

489
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,560
After receiving a report from the scene, we rushed to a place in Jiangnan.

490
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,340
The police announced that they would receive a high price

491
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,440
Hand over the inside information to the deceased A

492
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,760
-='Received payment for providing search intelligence' Senior police officer arrested=-

493
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,510
Suspected of selling poison kept by the police as evidence

494
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,560
Senior police official An

495
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,440
-=Confirmed suspicion of poison leak, difficult to evade investigation=-

496
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,060
and Jin, the leader of the poison investigation team

497
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,860
Also arrested

498
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,890
What are you doing

499
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:34,060
I'm watching the sunlight coming in

500
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,890
Even in winter

501
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,010
The sun is warm too.

502
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,590
Thank you so much

503
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,610
Thanks to you, doctor, for stopping me at that time.

504
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,190
Today I can enjoy such beautiful sunshine

505
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,610
You made the right choice

506
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,290
Dr. Yu

507
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,790
Now in my life

508
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,890
The most painful and difficult time

509
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,310
But my will to live is the strongest

510
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,260
Very strange, right?

511
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,960
No

512
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,860
If you have this thought, then you should live.

513
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:33,360
Although the subsequent treatment will be painful

514
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,990
I really want to live

515
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,040
don’t worry

516
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,040
All medical staff will do their best.

517
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,940
Every day of life

518
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,810
They are all like gifts given to me by my husband

519
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,870
The social worker contacted me today.

520
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,920
According to regulations

521
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,940
We have to send Xiaosong to the nursery.

522
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,290
Yes

523
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,290
Gu Guangzhe

524
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,590
That devilish man is dead.

525
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,840
So is it all over now?

526
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,470
still

527
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,690
Today I met the person who chose to jump off the building

528
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,840
She's been longing for death all her life.

529
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,390
But in this most painful and difficult moment

530
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,590
She regained the desire to live.

531
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,270
The will to live

532
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:04,920
Maybe at some moment

533
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,070
Appear suddenly in some way

534
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:14,770
Do you regret what you have done so far?

535
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,070
Have the will to live

536
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,370
Although it is a very grateful and happy thing

537
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,920
I'm so confused

538
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,690
Did I do something wrong before?

539
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,790
This

540
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,990
You must think that for patients in pain

541
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,420
Death will be a rest

542
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,120
But no one knows the correct answer

543
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,420
But isn't there a saying like this?

544
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,270
Just like when humans are born

545
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,890
Just like trying my best to come out of my mother's belly

546
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,640
Even in the face of death, I will fight to the end

547
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,240
Yes

548
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,770
Which death is the right choice?

549
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,020
Should this be a matter of choice?

550
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,590
No one knows

551
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,390
We can only ask questions

552
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,470
Ask yourself again

553
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,170
This is what I think about Komatsu's situation.

554
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,140
Dr. Yu

555
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:41,470
I hope you give up the idea that you must make Xiaosong happy.

556
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,090
Don't feel that you have to be responsible for her.

557
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,420
There is unexpected warmth in this world

558
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,070
And Xiaosong is also a smart child

559
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,770
No matter what the environment

560
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,670
They will grow up healthily

561
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,640
certainly

562
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,070
We have to keep watching her and cheer for her.

563
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,620
The idea that I am responsible for everything

564
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,590
Is that too arrogant?

565
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,970
No

566
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,290
Worry about someone

567
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,620
The desire to care for others

568
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,220
We call it love

569
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,340
Maybe you think you're a cold person.

570
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,820
But I don't think so

571
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,970
You are warm and loving.

572
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,220
Yes

573
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,970
I resigned from the hospital today.

574
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,920
Please let me work in your hospital, Father.

575
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,520
Even if I can't be forgiven

576
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,290
Please let me work here

577
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,170
Komatsu

578
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,470
You have to live here from now on.

579
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,270
This is what the social worker asked for.

580
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,230
I'll be at the priest's hospital next door.

581
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,920
I go there to work every day

582
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,210
so

583
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,180
We can meet anytime

584
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,560
I will come to visit you often with my brothers and sisters.

585
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,070
good

586
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,200
No

587
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,630
I will come to see you every day

588
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,320
This is the last video your son left.

589
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,040
I think you should take a look

590
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,820
I am Baek Hyun-seung

591
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,840
It's time to end my life.

592
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:43,440
This whole process is my own choice

593
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,430
Now this moment

594
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,860
I feel very happy and satisfied

595
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,610
Can you say a little more?

596
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,580
If this video is made public

597
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,480
My family will probably see it too.

598
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,370
I want to tell my family

599
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,910
No matter how hard I try

600
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,020
It will all end like this in the end

601
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,790
So forget clinical trials

602
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,200
Other treatments

603
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,820
Maybe I should forget what the doctor told me about the last year.

604
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,190
dad

605
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,490
I know it's hard for you to accept

606
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,220
But this is really my own choice

607
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
You've done enough for me so far.

608
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,320
- Sorry, both of you.

609
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,190
I know they tried their best for me.

610
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,840
-I'm sorry you died alone. -I don't regret it.

611
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,390
So please accept this.

612
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,010
Please remember this

613
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,620
I really love you guys

614
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,710
Cai Yan

615
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:16,730
I heard the deadline for reporting campus violence has passed.

616
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,550
Even reporting myself cannot be canceled

617
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,230
What on earth are you thinking?

618
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,890
Victims of school violence cannot be allowed to

619
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,490
Stay in the same room with the perpetrator

620
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,990
You arranged this occasion to give Youmei a chance to explain, right?

621
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,550
You two had a good relationship.

622
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,000
Let's make peace

623
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,720
This is good for both of you.

624
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,900
Youmei seems to be taking strange medicine

625
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,040
Are you trying to spread some beautiful and strange rumors again?

626
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,490
I say this out of genuine concern.

627
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,920
This is the medicine Youmei is taking.

628
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,180
She told her friends that this was Conarubi, a concentrate-enhancing drug.

629
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,100
But this isn't the medicine.

630
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,650
Don't come here anymore.

631
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,000
It's not a good place

632
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:35,060
I feel ashamed of the uniform.

633
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,520
I wanted to come

634
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,050
I like you

635
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:51,540
How do I confess my love during a prison visit?

636
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,050
Really

637
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,100
How are you doing?

638
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,970
Well, I work at Dr. Yu and Father Yang's hospital.

639
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,500
Now a funeral director

640
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,040
Although the salary is at the level of part-time students

641
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,410
But I feel like I've never been so happy at work.

642
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,380
You look happy

643
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,160
Um

644
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,410
Why did you reject Dr. Yu's request for a visit?

645
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,200
She is worried about you

646
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,570
Suzhen has a strong sense of responsibility

647
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,410
If I accept it once, I will come to work here directly

648
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,600
That's not right.

649
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,650
The hospital, my nephew, and Xiaosong.

650
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,010
I don't want to be someone Suzhen needs to take care of.

651
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:40,860
Suzhen should live her own life

652
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,170
So I brought you the letter from Dr. Yu.

653
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,830
I heard you even returned the letter.

654
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,350
Don't do this again in the future

655
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,150
I really can't win, Yu Suzhen

656
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,510
I'll have someone pass it on to you. You must read it.

657
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,600
good

658
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,880
What are you doing

659
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,620
Where is my medicine?

660
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,390
Where are my diet pills?

661
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,180
That's not a diet pill.

662
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,400
That's a new drug.

663
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:27,680
Drugs?

664
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,540
I asked a detective I know.

665
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,220
Said it was a drug that was recently circulating among students

666
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:35,430
They say it's a drug to improve concentration or lose weight.

667
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,540
You'll never eat it again.

668
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,570
How can you throw it away

669
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:44,100
I can't get in touch with the guy who sold this. I'm going crazy.

670
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,890
How can you throw it away

671
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,180
Who is

672
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,530
Who sold you this medicine?

673
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:01,450
Are you losing weight?

674
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,390
Can't you hear me?

675
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,380
Are you losing weight?

676
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,150
What a happy thing it is to eat

677
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,210
Someone once said

678
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:15,570
People who like to eat

679
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,210
Be happy at least three times a day

680
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,320
How painful it must be for you to endure such a happy thing

681
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,470
I'm busy. I'm leaving now.

682
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,730
Wait a moment

683
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:32,740
Here, this is a diet pill.

684
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,430
It's a gift

685
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,870
Even if you eat everything you want

686
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:43,910
You will lose weight after eating it. Believe me.

687
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,300
come on

688
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:52,260
People in the community

689
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,930
I'll go look for it.

690
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,940
beautiful

691
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,060
Go study abroad

692
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,220
Anyway, because of school violence

693
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,570
It's also difficult for you to take the entrance exam

694
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,010
Go ahead

695
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,100
You can't do this

696
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,030
Sober and graceful

697
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:14,130
Okay

698
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,340
The luggage has been sent.

699
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,260
My husband will bring the kids to the airport.

700
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,240
I won't be back to Korea for a while.

701
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,720
Help me sell the house.

702
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,910
After selling it, just deposit the money into my account.

703
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,680
Wait a minute, Auntie

704
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,270
Wait a minute, Auntie

705
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:57,590
Wait a moment

706
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,240
So cute

707
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,150
The little one knows what is good.

708
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,400
Great Sage

709
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,800
I also went to Pei Meiying's ward today

710
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:32,450
Pei Meiying's most painful period in her life

711
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,250
The happiest smile

712
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:39,930
Great Sage

713
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,490
Desperate moments in life

714
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,870
At a moment no one expected

715
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,020
That person seems to have the will to live

716
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,620
Want to commit suicide

717
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,130
The moment I completely understood it all

718
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,840
I will continue to live for unexpected reasons

719
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,350
This is human

720
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:03,460
It's a miracle

721
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:07,010
Is that why life is so beautiful?

722
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,320
No other curious questions?

723
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,420
You must be very busy

724
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:40,430
Don't bother me anymore

725
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:47,300
-=3 years later=-

726
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,170
It's cold here. Is that okay?

727
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,130
Even if you stay still

728
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,460
You may also feel suffocated due to shortness of breath

729
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,040
in

730
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,920
Too boring

731
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,370
-=Gu Guangzhe=-

732
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,400
My release from prison coincided with my return to China.

733
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,780
Fate

734
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,290
I have something to show you.

735
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:20,370
The day Representative Gu died

736
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,810
It was the one the police failed to find in front of the building.

737
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:23,160
One of our cars

738
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:24,620
This is the black box video of that car

739
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,910
In the bag that Yu Suzhen was holding

740
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,710
There are videos of people who requested euthanasia, right?

741
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:43,990
Yes

742
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:47,640
The police said this was my brother's crime.

743
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,540
The main evidence is however

744
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:53,350
If this isn't my brother's stuff,

745
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,260
-=Gu Guangzhe=-

746
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,790
It's quite unfair.

747
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,310
this

748
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,150
Follow the instructions of the representative

749
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,680
This photo was used to threaten Yu Suzhen before.

750
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,310
But the original disappeared

751
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,990
It seems these people deceived my brother

752
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:19,730
I messed around

753
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:25,870
As we expected

754
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:27,660
Went abroad 3 years ago

755
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,560
Gu Guangzhe and his family returned to China

756
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,510
Sister Gu Hye-lin

757
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,280
She returned to China with her husband Kim Myung-seok and children.

758
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:37,710
The two disposed of all their property three years ago

759
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,910
Leaving like a fugitive

760
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,670
It can be speculated

761
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:43,430
They must have been with

762
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,430
The Bafron murder case is related

763
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,780
Yes, Gu Huilin has always been a full-time housewife

764
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,750
But Jin Mingshi actually

765
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,270
I did business with Gu Kwang-chul.

766
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,200
Yes, that's right.

767
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:56,730
Jin Mingshi is suspected of moving abroad

768
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,090
Continue to circulate drugs in the country

769
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,600
Once you return to China, send your children to domestic schools.

770
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,420
It seems that he plans to settle down in Korea again.

771
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,060
Looks like we're starting a business.

772
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:12,430
So this time the special investigation team was re-established

773
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,250
As far as I know, Captain An obstructed the investigation.

774
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,630
Even arrests were difficult.

775
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,350
This time, as the captain, I

776
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:21,580
We promise to fully support you

777
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:22,550
So you

778
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,310
To secure evidence of the two's crimes and arrest them

779
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,860
Be sure to find the

780
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:28,120
The Bafron murder case 3 years ago

781
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,470
Including

782
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:31,860
The last piece of the puzzle

783
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:32,760
-Yes -Yes

784
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,540
-=A Better Tomorrow, Enlightenment of Hope=-

785
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,560
doctor

786
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:00,560
Thanks a lot

787
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:02,520
Thanks

788
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,390
Ah, this is tofu biscuit

789
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:08,450
I will never come to this kind of place again after eating tofu

790
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,520
This is tofu too.

791
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:11,790
Eat quickly

792
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,370
Oh, thank you.

793
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,820
Ah, Dr. Yu, because there are many patients in the hospital

794
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,880
So I couldn't come

795
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:23,510
Let's go too.

796
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,330
The doctor is waiting for you

797
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,780
good

798
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,820
The elderly person living alone died

799
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,210
A patient with a short lifespan

800
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,590
But it looks peaceful.

801
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,750
A patient with a short lifespan?

802
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:41,610
yes

803
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,220
Check the surrounding surveillance.

804
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,190
Yes

805
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,370
-=Maria Welfare Hospital=-

806
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,510

807
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,150
-=Dean Yu Suzhen=-

808
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,220
haven't seen you for a long time

809
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,540
Do you work here?

810
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,420
We greeted each other for the first time today

811
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,630
Ah, right?

812
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,260
We just met once.

813
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,550
Because other people talk about you

814
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,080
I thought we knew each other well.

815
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:18,720
Hello

816
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,080
My name is Gu Huilin

817
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,030
I am Yu Suzhen

818
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,070
How did you get here?

819
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,430
I'm here to donate

820
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,590
There are people I want to see

821
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,820
Gu Guangzhe

822
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:46,150
You know my brother, right?

823
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,010
You clearly did the euthanasia business together.

824
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,370
You pretend not to know me

825
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,420
Euthanasia

826
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,670
I don't know what you're talking about

827
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:07,560
That day

828
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,030
You were targeting my brother from the beginning, right?

829
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:15,390
So I will bring

830
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,070
He left with a bag full of evidence, right?

831
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:20,300
You seem to have misunderstood me.

832
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,890
That has nothing to do with me.

833
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,510
My brother is dead.

834
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:27,290
What are you going to take?

835
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,410
To compensate for the harm I suffered

836
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:30,090
Something I don't know at all

837
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,470
What compensation should be made?

838
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,890
You took something precious from me.

839
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,540
Just grant me one wish.

840
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,880
What I did with my brother

841
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,010
Start doing this with me from now on.

842
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,430
I don't do business

843
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:31,470
The hospital here alone keeps me busy enough.

844
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,480
There's nothing we can do.

845
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,890
Just look forward to it.

846
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,260
Looking forward to what I will do in the future

847
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,870
goodbye

-=Death Doctor Mary=-

849
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:34,290
Mom, that's why I need to get treatment.

852
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:39,030
Get me some bottles of Pavlon.

853
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,760
Who did you conduct the experiment on?

854
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,750
Doctor, can't we just take the path I designate for our final destination?

855
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,510
Please help me

856
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:49,870
Auntie wants euthanasia

857
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:52,150
She's the same type as Lee Yoon Hee, right?

858
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,870
At least the last journey should be peaceful.

859
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:55,770
oops

860
00:59:55,770 --> 00:59:58,910
There are definitely patients who need euthanasia.
