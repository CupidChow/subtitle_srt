00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:21,480
I, Choi Kang Yoon, am going to end my life now.

3
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:25,030
This whole process is my choice.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,030
I feel very happy and content at this moment.

6
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,880
If you're not mentally prepared

7
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,760
It doesn't have to be today

8
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,760
We can delay

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,830
-Or stop altogether -No

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Before the pain returns

11
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,730
I want to go now

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,180
This is champagne mixed with Pavulon

13
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,680
It's really simple

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,780
How long does it take?

15
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,630
Usually...

16
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,310
It's over in an instant

17
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,229
He's gone

18
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,060
Hurry up and leave

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,509
Even though you insisted on coming, it's really too dangerous here

20
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:23,578
Family often visits and there are many surveillance cameras nearby

21
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:26,479
Choi Kang Yoon said he felt most at ease here

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,079
It's euthanasia

23
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,130
You need to feel at peace inside, right?

24
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,680
Honey, I'm back

25
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,829
The melon you wanted is out of stock

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,560
I went to a place a bit far away

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,260
Honey, are you sleeping?

28
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,009
Didn't you say you'd be gone for more than two hours?

29
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,329
What's going on? He said she went to a very far place

30
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,629
Clean up quickly, don't leave anything behind

31
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,159
Okay, hold on

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,910
Where's the money envelope?

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,580
Thank you

34
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,460
Sorry

35
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,760
Seems like there's an issue

36
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,810
- What are you doing? - Save him!

37
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,779
It might take some time

38
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,110
But because of Bafron, he'll end up dying eventually

39
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,760
Just proceed directly

40
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,330
Sorry

43
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,410
He came back to life even though he was about to die

44
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,028
This is the first time I've seen something like this

45
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,629
Could there be a problem with Bafron?

46
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,260
It's all from the same place

47
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,409
The issue seems to be not Bafron, but the previous medication

48
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,210
You didn't misapply the basic drugs, did you?

49
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,730
No

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,430
Everything was under control until he drank Bafron champagne

51
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,110
His body temperature dropped enough, no issues there

52
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,330
We need to check if there's a problem with Bafron

53
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,780
There really was no pulse

54
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,079
This is the pulse

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,609
Even if it's faint, movement means he's still alive

56
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,859
Even without my license, I know that much

57
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,909
There was truly no pulse earlier

58
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,310
He's an athlete, right?

59
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,909
Is it because of his large build that the dosage wasn't enough?

60
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,359
That's why I said we should use injections

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,229
You know injecting into a vein is the safest option.

62
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,230
No way.

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,030
You agreed too.

64
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,379
The final decision should be made by the patient.

65
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,780
And if injection marks are left, we could be in danger.

66
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,329
The likelihood of an autopsy also increases.

67
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,430
It's not...

68
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,229
I know that too.

69
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,810
Next time, the location must be safer.

70
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,209
Even if the client says so, we can't follow every instruction.

71
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,760
Today was overly dangerous.

72
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,810
It's so cold, feels like I'm catching a cold.

73
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
Where are you going?

74
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:42,530
Jaeyeon.

75
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,580
If you haven't had dinner yet, want to eat together?

76
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,530
Did you go to the seminar with Auntie?

77
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,330
No, I was just driving her because I was worried she'd be tired.

78
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,960
Even if you're trying so hard,

79
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,060
Auntie won't suddenly take an interest in you.

80
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Wow.

81
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Jaeyeon, you're really cruel.

82
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,059
Jaeyeon, in my entire life,

83
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,560
I've never failed in confessing to a woman.

84
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,210
Do you know the secret?

85
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,810
I only confess to women who look like they'd accept.

86
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,459
So don't worry.

87
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,080
Honestly, I just didn't want to eat alone, that's why I'm here.

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,430
What are you doing?

89
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,430
Hey, Kim Chaeyoon.

90
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,830
We'll eat later, he says he'll cook for you.

91
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,460
It's okay, kids eat dirt sometimes, it's normal.

92
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,110
I'll remove the needle for you.

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,380
But sir,

94
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,879
you can't just leave when you start feeling better like last time.

95
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,030
If it won't cure me, I don't want to spend more money.

96
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,359
Take this off, please.

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,010
We still need to check blood pressure and albumin levels.

She'll take care of you. You met her last time, right?

101
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,359
Well, last time it hurt because of me.

102
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I'll do it.

103
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,309

104
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,310
Alright.

105
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,830
Doctor Yu,

106
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,530
no matter how busy, you should still visit a beauty salon.

107
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,660

Hello.

110
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,830
Are you looking for me?

111
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,680
-Hi -Hi

112
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,480
You go over there.

113
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,529
That's about enough.

114
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,560
-Enough is enough -Exactly

115
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,779
It's not my health that's the problem, it's the money. I need to cut back.

116
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,280
If you lack money, leave your funds with my company.

117
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,859
I'll help you gather some purchase money with stocks.

118
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,310
My medication costs are too high.

119
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,809
But how is your company's representative doing?

120
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,929
The stock market hasn't been doing well lately.

121
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,859
I played because I was bored.

122
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,080
I'm not doing it for money.

123
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,309
The problem is those people who lose money and cry about it.

124
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,710
Those people.

125
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,360
Isn't this what it's for? Just use this to comfort them.

126
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,710
Like this.

127
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,030
Alright.

128
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,780
Is there any today?

129
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,060
What?

130
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,230
Is there any today?

131
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,460
It's like a dog's nose now.

132
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,010
Did you come knowing there'd be goods?

133
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,210
Hello.

134
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,659
You've become prettier.

135
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,780
You look even prettier.

136
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,380
I need more Bavlon.

137
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,230
Are you in a relationship?

138
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,080
Didn't you say you've been taking all the Bavlon yourself lately?

139
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,810
You don't seem like that type at all, you look healthy.

140
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,210
That's because you...

141
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,210
Because you watered down the meds, boss.

142
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,630
I trusted you wouldn't trick me, that's why I traded.

143
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,579
You sold me cheap fakes, and now you're blaming me?

144
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,760
Yes, I diluted them.

145
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,760
I just wanted to make sure you weren't reselling the meds.

146
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,480
You're the one using them, right?

147
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,979
Did you give me those meds because you were suspicious of me?

148
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,379
You know I hate this kind of stuff.

149
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,009
I know, all too well.

150
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,360
But I never intended to make money selling meds.

151
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,630
I won't infringe on your interests.

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,030
Give me the proper medicine.

153
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,530
What's going on again? Oh, seriously.

154
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,580
Seriously.

155
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,730
I'll have someone put it in the trunk.

156
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,660
I'll give you the regular medicine.

157
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,180
Won't charge you either.

158
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Do you want to try one dose?

159
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,880
You want to check, don't you?

160
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,930
I trust you.

161
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,860
Give me the proper medicine.

162
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,810
Just someone performing illegal surgeries.

163
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,080
The head nurse seems to be watching me.

164
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,880
Could it be someone reported something?

165
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,910
She monitors everyone.

166
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,929
Reports employees' personal matters to the higher-ups.

167
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,810
She thinks that's her skill.

168
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,930
Could the police be starting an investigation?

169
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,459
Even though everyone is severely ill,

170
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,009
if they die outside, the police will be notified first.

171
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,580
Even if that's the case, you don't need to worry.

172
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,760
If there's an investigation, it begins with me.

173
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,930
I'll be more careful.

174
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,080
Who's next?

175
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,160
Thirty years old, Zhao Hyun-woo.

176
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,410
He has a brain tumor and can't undergo surgery.

177
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,620
He's had both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, neither has worked.

178
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:02,320
-=Chemotherapy [化疗]: anti-cancer chemical therapy

He can only live for a maximum of four months.

179
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,430
I placed Zhao Hyun-woo's medical records in your cabinet.

180
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,609
You're too young. Have you discussed it with your family?

181
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,760
He said he doesn't have a family.

182
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,959
He grew up in an orphanage.

183
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,759
Worked hard to stabilize his life early.

184
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,330
So he doesn't have anyone he's particularly close to.

185
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,929
It's quite sad, though.

186
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:20,730
But probably no one will oppose in the meantime.

187
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
What's wrong?

188
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,410
Are you concerned about the fact he has no family?

189
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,880
I'm wondering if the lack of family makes it easier to give up.

190
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,310
Check his medical records.

191
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,580
Once you see his pain, you'll change your mind.

192
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,330
Okay, I'll take a look. Also,

193
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,830
-This is your share. -Thanks.

194
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,359
Thanks to you, I can repay my debts earlier.

195
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,310
Though I still have student loans.

196
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,159
By the way, Lee Eun-young contacted me.

197
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,009
Remember she came for a consultation before?

198
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,995
Eighty years old, renal failure, wanted to stop dialysis.

199
00:15:02,996 --> 00:15:06,250
-=Renal failure: A condition resulting from diminished kidney function
causing waste build-up in the blood.=-

200
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:09,330
I remember. She wanted to end her suffering after her husband died a few years ago.

201
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,330
Two months ago, she was diagnosed with terminal cancer and was given three months to live.

202
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,460
She says she's completely prepared now.

203
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,680
This is the last plum juice.

204
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,709
I was ill this year and couldn't make any.

205
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,630
Oh, such a precious thing.

206
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,460
Don't feel burdened.

207
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,059
I originally made it for guests.

208
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,010
I won't be having guests at my house anymore.

209
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,360
Do you really feel most comfortable at home?

210
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,160
As the final place

211
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,130
My husband's hobby

212
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,580
Is taking photos of the family

213
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,560
Your family seems to love the beach

214
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,480
The photo backgrounds are all at the beach

215
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,430
All at the same beach

216
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,020
There's a beach not far from our home

217
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,849
The kids keep asking to go out and play

218
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,640
But we don't have any money

219
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,200
Whenever that happens, my husband takes us to that beach

220
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:30,580
That beach in the photos

221
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,970
Holds all of my happy memories

222
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,010
That's why I love the sea

223
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,730
No, since you love that sea

224
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,830
Then you should leave from there

225
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,160
That said

226
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,940
But there might be people watching

227
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,270
You don't have to worry about that

228
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,860
Come on, tell me what you really want

229
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,090
What you truly desire, anything is fine

230
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,220
I definitely want to live my regular life before leaving

231
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,109
Living as usual

232
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,950
Naturally

233
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,609
You want it naturally, then

234
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,859
You can do that

235
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,250
Oh, you swim every morning, right?

236
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,790
You can go for a swim

237
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,609
And then

238
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:27,490
Go leave from there

239
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,200
I'll take care of the preparations for you

240
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,560
Is it okay?

241
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,610
Of course.

242
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,450
Beach

243
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Very dangerous
No, it won't be.

244
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,040
No surveillance at the beach, only businesses have it.

245
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,900
Should be able to find a blind spot.

246
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,689
Anyway, she went swimming early, very early.

247
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,690
There'll definitely be nobody around then.

248
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,060
You look great today.

249
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,150
Is your leg feeling better?

250
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,160
Yes, much better.

251
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,440
That's great.

252
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,390
My grandson's coming, I'll head off today.

253
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm leaving first.

254
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,290
See you next Friday.

255
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,190
Take care.

256
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,320
Take care of yourself.

257
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,240
Got it.

258
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,240
I'm off, bye-bye.

259
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,530
Did you enjoy swimming?

260
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,870
Yeah, I also said my last goodbyes to friends.

261
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,650
I am very happy.

262
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,240
I'm a fortunate person.

263
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:30,190
How many can decide their life's final moment?

264
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,690
Thank you for coming.

265
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
You're welcome.

266
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,779
Our Dr. Yu is an excellent doctor.

267
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,890
But his social skills are lacking.

268
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,860
How should I put it?

269
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,410
Communication skills.

270
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,800
Lacking awareness

271
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,930
So there was a bit of a mix-up with the venue

272
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,090
Even though it's a bit late, finding such a perfect place

273
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,890
I'm happy for you

274
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,560
Poor social skills, can't you hear?

275
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,590
You heard that, didn't you?

276
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,980
Are you mentally prepared?

277
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,770
When you reach my age

278
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
You won't fear death anymore

279
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,560
Compared to here

280
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:15,290
I know more people there

281
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,300
I think many people I love

282
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,740
Make a place a paradise

283
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,140
She's not breathing

284
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,459
It's not because I can't find a pulse

285
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,120
That I didn't become a licensed doctor

286
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,180
She might've met her husband by now

287
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,070
Hurry, get up

288
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,870
Someone will be here soon

289
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,419
Don't worry, even if they see

290
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,650
They'll think it's a sudden heart attack at the beach...

291
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,300
Here, over here

292
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,940
Codfish clear soup

293
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,620
Speaking of codfish clear soup

294
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,110
Is it clear soup?

295
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,755
Codfish clear soup is clear soup, right?

296
00:23:30,756 --> 00:23:32,075
-=Diagnosis=-

297
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,360
But if you call it clear soup, it doesn't sound appetizing, does it?

298
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,479
Let's go taste it and check the flavor

299
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,410
Have you checked the Buflon used for Jiang Run?

300
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,430
Uh, about that...

301
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,430
It was confirmed, there's something unusual.

302
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:46,050
The seal is slightly open.

303
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,909
But this won't happen again.

304
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:48,910
I've taken care of it.

305
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,450
Are you sure?

306
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Who sold it to him?

307
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,120
You don't need to know. Knowing would just make things more dangerous.

308
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,459
I've dealt with it. It won't happen again.

309
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,620
He won't dare mess around anymore.

310
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,160
No, didn't you just confirm it?

311
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
There's no problem with the medication.

312
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,739
Let's change positions. I'll drive.

313
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,869
I just said...

314
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,490
To be safe, we should eat before leaving.

315
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,840
Only if there's a change in schedule would that happen.

316
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,160
That's what happens.

317
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,590
Get out quickly, I'm meeting someone.

318
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
That's possible.

319
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,420
-=Victim, Baek Hyun-seung=-

320
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,670
Captain.

321
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,000
Representative Baek is here.

322
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,869
He said he's here to get an update on the investigation.

323
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,300
Back when he was a prosecutor, he was known to be a mad dog.

324
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,250
Now that his son is dead, he'll definitely be more crazed.

325
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,330
You've arrived.

326
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,700
You have the suspects, why isn't the case closed?

327
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,390
We need concrete evidence.

328
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,020
My Hyun-seung...

329
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,630
Could have lived another year.

330
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,260
We've been looking into clinical trials and other treatments.

331
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,140
I know you surely can't bear it.

332
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,100
But catching them in the act is the best way.

333
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,800
My child

334
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,890
left so suddenly without a word.

335
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,430
That's murder.

336
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,310
I promise you

337
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,470
I will definitely catch the killer and bring them to justice.

338
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:38,600
Injecting Pavulon into patients to help them pass away

339
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,659
That's psychopathic.

340
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,760
They're maniacs.

341
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,960
Give me more time.

342
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,890
I'll gather solid evidence from the euthanasia site.

343
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,000
I will... I will definitely catch him.

344
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,700
We'll conclude the investigation this month.

345
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,500
Otherwise, don't expect to continue working.

346
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:01,890
Do you understand?

347
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,430
Yes.

348
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,740
-=Victim: Baek Hyun-sung=-

349
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Are you okay?

350
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,909
You mean you ordered takeout

351
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,260
and asked them to deliver it to this bench we’re sitting on?

352
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,839
Yeah, he said he was working

353
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,700
so I ordered takeout and asked for delivery here.

354
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,890
What's going on?

355
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,890
He doesn’t have family.

356
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,700
No wonder you’re so concerned.

357
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,010
After all, without family it's easier to give up.

358
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,819

360
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,200
But I feel like he won't give up easily.

361
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,840
Everything here meets your standards.

362
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,810
Over three doctors said it's untreatable.

363
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,170
An unbearable state of physical disability.

364
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,490
Pain that can't be controlled with medication.

365
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,719
Someone who might be dying is still delivering food.

366
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Seriously.

367
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,960
Are you Mr. Zhao Hyun-woo?

368
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Yes.

369
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,470
You're Dr. Woo.

370
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,380
This is what you ordered.

371
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,970
Thank you.

372
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,040
I looked at your medical records.

373
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,060
You must be feeling terrible.

374
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,380
How did Ina introduce us to you?

375
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,970
She said I could seek your advice.

376
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,730
And that you offer different suggestions from others.

377
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,250
Through situations like this, we understand what patients truly want.

378
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,220
And find ways to help them.

379
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,880
Switzerland can help me, and I heard you can too.

380
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,940
It's not entirely free; we do charge.

381
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:40,210
Of course, it's much cheaper than Switzerland.

382
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,740
The fee Ina mentioned.

383
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,979
I can afford it.

384
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,960
That's why I'm working so hard.

385
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,230
If it's just for money, you better not work.

386
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,880
I saw your MRI of the brain.

387
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,800
No painkiller will be effective on you from now on.

388
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,160
Working is very dangerous for you.

389
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,110
I need to pass this interview today.

390
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,960
You will only help me, right?

391
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,350
I heard you don't help unconditionally.

392
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,270
I still need to review your medical records.

393
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,839
You don't need to worry about approved matters.

394
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,820
Looking at your information,

395
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:18,380
you already fully meet the conditions…

396
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,690
We'll carefully review it and discuss further.

397
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,570
Regardless of the outcome,

398
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
please inform me.

399
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,530
I'm used to being rejected.

400
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:38,810
I'll be leaving then.

401
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,579
I was going to treat you to what you just ordered.

402
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,730
But you've already paid in advance.

403
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,090
Here's something for you.

404
00:30:55,091 --> 00:30:56,240
No need, thanks.

405
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:57,549
-=Thank you for being born=-
It's not something very expensive.

406
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,770
This was originally a delivery I was going to send.

407
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,200
But I rushed and damaged it on the way.

408
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,490
But the taste is definitely unchanged.

409
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,380
Thank you for meeting me today.

410
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
Thank you.

411
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,869
A person who wants to die actually delivered a cake that says

412
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,579
"Thank you for being born."

413
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,050
Quite ironic.

414
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,970
-=Thank you for being born=-

415
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,160
Did you see the report on the death of football player Choi Kang-ryeol?

416
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,230
Have you?

417
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,410
You mentioned that among current terminally ill patients, some die earlier than expected

418
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,239
and sometimes outside the hospital.

419
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,260
Let me report to you promptly.

420
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,470
As a result, a report about this player was published

421
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,340

What are you looking for?

00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,550
What are you doing in our house?

427
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,270
I want to go to school with you

428
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,260
I also want to tell you something

429
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
that

430
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,940
Thank you for saying it's yours.

431
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
ah

432
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,720
After all, I said I would keep it for you.

433
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
But you

434
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,720
Why did you agree to my request?

435
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,330
Actually, we're not very familiar with each other.

436
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,530
What about you?

437
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,630
Why please give it to me?

438
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,370
Obviously not very familiar

439
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
That's because

440
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,870
I always feel that you will agree to my request

441
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,840
My sixth sense told me

442
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:09,250
Come to my house after class.

443
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,770
If you are busy today, tomorrow is fine.

444
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,550
How about we have a pajama party?

445
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Haven't you played it?

446
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,460
I invited friends to my house to play a few times

447
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,469
It's fun to play with makeup all night

448
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,199
How about it

449
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,350
Why do you want to play with me?

450
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,760
I just think staying up all night playing with you would be fun.

451
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,260
I'll think about it.

452
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
Okay.

453
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,630
But what are you looking for?

454
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,670
I'll help you find it.

455
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,670
My brother's flippers. He has a swimming class.

456
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,480
Why are these pills here?

457
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,840
Does your aunt do drugs?

458
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,500
No, my aunt doesn't.

459
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,750
She's a doctor.

460
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:50,280
My mom says even some doctors do drugs.

461
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,390
She has defended such people before.

462
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,180
Because their job often involves handling medication.

463
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,010
Babylon.

464
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,460
Put it in and look for the flippers.

465
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
We're going to be late.

466
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,210
Got it, I'll put it in.

467
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,710
But I'm really curious about what your aunt is like.

468
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,820
Huh?

469
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,310
Found them.

470
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,830
Your brother's flippers.

471
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,180
-=Arts High School=-

472
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,359
Announcing our school's admission results this year.

473
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,030
-=Arts High School Admission Results Briefing=-

474
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,990
Starting with independent enrollment.

475
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,530
Please bring up the screen.

476
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,630
Student A Internal Review, Level 1, 2.

477
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,360
Take a photo even if it's not necessary.

478
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,160
Other moms might say you're arrogant because Taeyeon is a good student.

479
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,640
I'm Eumi's mom.

480
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,680
We live next door. You didn't know, right?

481
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,280
Oh, hi. I'm Aunt Caiyan.

482
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,290
It's normal not to know.

483
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,919
Youmei is majoring in dance, and Caiyan is in fine arts.

484
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,110
They weren't very close before.

485
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,360
Suddenly, they've become close these past few days.

486
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,660
About 35% is through selective admission...

487
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,740
That father must be curious about Caiyan's aunt.

488
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,870
Who is she?

489
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,280
Their daughter is Caiyan's competitor.

490
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,879
Caiyan's internal audit is clearly 1.1.

491
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,360
That father's daughter is 1.3.

492
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,350
So he must be very curious about Caiyan's aunt.

493
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,619
He's the chairman of the school's violence prevention committee.

494
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,820
Very dedicated to his child's education.

495
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,329
Heard he's a police officer, but doesn't seem very busy.

496
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,880
He attends every school event.

497
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,910
The condom came from Caiyan's locker.

498
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,270
This one's mine.

499
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,750
What?

500
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,030
Ah.

501
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,720
Caiyan and I mix our clothes.

502
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,110
Aunt Caiyan.

503
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,540
It fell out of Caiyan's school uniform.

504
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,430
But.

505
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,149
Do they check kids' personal belongings now too?

506
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,150
No.

507
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,800
It was discovered accidentally during locker replacement.

508
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,780
But.

509
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:47,320
Now a condom fell from the child's clothes.

510
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,920
Is this really the question you're curious about?

511
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:51,930
Just...

512
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:56,550
If having a boyfriend means there's a possibility of pregnancy,

513
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,720
I think being prepared ahead of time is the smarter choice.

514
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Okay.

515
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,810
Even if you're right,

516
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,390
there's no way the school could allow such possibilities.

517
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,440
Not bringing it to school is the right thing, don't you think?

518
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,610
If Ji-yeon doesn't intend to do such things at school.

519
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,350
Exactly.

520
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:26,440
Explain it to her clearly so she doesn't bring it to school again.

521
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,860
-=Thank you for your birth=-

522
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,179
I'm full.

523
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,900
-Sa-yun -Did you talk to the teacher?

524
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,820
Yes.

525
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,520
The homeroom teacher showed it to you.

526
00:39:58,410 --> 00:39:59,410
That one.

527
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,090
It's not mine.

528
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,900
Even if it were yours, it's okay.

529
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,690
I believe it's right to have it on hand just in case.

530
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,410
I'm sincere.

531
00:40:10,411 --> 00:40:11,490
I truly don't

532
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,340
need such things.

533
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,920
Liking someone is not a bad thing.

534
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm full.

535
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,640
Wow, this one.

536
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,720
I wore this during the World Cup. Wow.

538
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,620
Um, hello.

539
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,630
We're from the regional investigation team of Bunseong Police Station.

540
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,980
You're Choi Kang-yoon's wife, right?

541
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,960
Your husband was treated at Bunseong General Hospital, correct?

542
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,070
But he ended up living in a villa after being discharged.

543
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,080
Did you have any conflict with the hospital?

544
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,860
No.

545
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,620
We got along well with everyone at the hospital.

546
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,010
They were very kind, saying they were his fans, and took great care of him.

547
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:55,050
He came home because

548
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,450
after confirming that his condition had worsened and couldn't be treated further,

549
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,079
he said he wanted to spend the remaining time with his family.

550
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,089
That's why he came home.

551
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,090
However,

552
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:09,530
the hospital believed he could live for at least another six months, potentially a year.

553
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,840
Isn't his sudden death strange to you?

554
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,730
If you knew how much he suffered,

555
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,840
you wouldn't say such things.

556
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,710
The funeral is today, right?

557
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,040
Delay the transfer to the family tomb.

558
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,969
Your husband made great efforts regarding euthanasia.

559
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,790
We checked his mailing records for obtaining drugs.

560
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,050
Especially with Buflron.

561
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:50,019
He was determined to find something for a painless death.

562
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,500
This famous drug.

563
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,700
Are you aware?

564
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,710
Yes.

565
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:59,520
I accidentally found out by seeing his emails.

566
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,330
He tried.

567
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,510
But it seems he failed.

568
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,539
If an autopsy is conducted,

569
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,230
we suspect Buflron's components could be detected.

570
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:11,479
Then there will be a formal investigation.

571
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,759
If the major media find out about this,

572
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,750
they might suspect you, thinking you'll get a huge insurance payout.

573
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,169
Oh, I know.

574
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,170
I know you won't. You have a clear conscience.

575
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,440
Let's conduct an autopsy.

576
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,350
Before the media starts spreading such rumors,

577
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,109
we need to verify where your husband got the Buffron from.

578
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,360
It sounds like

579
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,509
you're threatening me to do as you say.

580
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:37,790
Oh, it's not a threat at all.

581
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,090
It's a request for your cooperation in the investigation.

582
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,100
You know who it is, right?

583
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,740
We've agreed to the autopsy.

584
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,040
The hearse just turned around.

585
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,990
Here.

586
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,760
Your children are with me.

587
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:11,710
Come over.

588
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,370
Auntie's here.
Okay.

589
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,390
You and Taeyoon should eat first.

590
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,710
Here, what would you like?

591
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,420
For you.

592
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,079
Thank you for taking care of the kids.

593
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,280
It's all takeout.

594
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,300
If you haven't eaten, join us. I ordered a lot.

595
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,670
Ah, okay.

596
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,669
Today Yumi wants to sleep at my house with Taeyoon.

597
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,310
You haven't agreed, right?

598
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,700
Ah...

599
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,700
Hello, can we sleep together at your place today?

600
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,740
I'm counting on you.

601
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,440
I'm under a lot of pressure with my performance preparation at school.

602
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,990
I want to chat all night with Chae-yeon about other classmates to relieve stress.

603
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:21,340
Please take care of my Chae-yeon.

604
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,880
Don't worry.

605
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:32,090
Did you hear what my mom just said?

606
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,640
Isn't it funny?

607
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:37,400
She said it's not dangerous without adult males.

608
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:41,710
She seems to think it's completely safe with just girls.

609
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,330
Right?

610
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,640
So naive.

611
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,760
Acts like she knows everything.

612
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,100
But actually knows nothing.

613
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,850
Right?

614
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,470
Yeah.

615
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,790
Your eyes are really beautiful.

616
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,030
-=Test Result Report Patient Name Jo Hyun-woo=-

617
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,960
Whatever the results are, please tell me.

618
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,500
I'm very familiar with rejection.

619
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,490
-=Delivery Guy=-

620
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,809
It's a motorcycle accident patient.

621
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,220
The injuries aren't very serious, but he's shouting in pain.

622
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,359
He keeps insisting on going home and refuses treatment.

623
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,810
So we couldn't take his vital signs.

624
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,540
Don't move.

625
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,100
Calm down.

626
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:56,570
Jo Hyun-woo.

627
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,260
Oxygen mask.

628
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,525
It's terminal brain cancer.

629
00:48:00,526 --> 00:48:04,090
-=Terminal Cancer Brain Tumor=-

630
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,280
Is this a patient you know?

631
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,300
It's a patient I met at the priest hospital when volunteering.

632
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,860
There seems to be a mistake with the anesthetic painkiller.

633
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:09,170
I'll handle this here. You all go out.

634
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,499
The last time the painkiller was taken was hours ago.

635
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,760
It's useless.

636
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,579
No medication is working.

637
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,139
Morphine, Tachin, Oxycodone.

638
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,140
What is it?
You need to tell me the type and time of intake.

639
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:30,810
Only then can I help you.

640
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:32,340
Aren't you aware of my condition?

641
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,220
I just take them randomly whenever I think of it.

642
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,190
To calm him down,
please assist with Ativan.

644

Okay, got it.

645
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,090
Didn't I tell you not to ride a motorcycle?

646
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:56,019
Has the pain become more severe?

647
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,410
The symptoms seem more frequent lately.

648
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:01,010
The glioblastoma is progressing rapidly.

649
00:49:01,011 --> 00:49:06,060
-=Glioblastoma: A type of glioma and the most common and severe tumor originating in the brain=-

650
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,420
Just a single tumor can become dangerous.

651
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,860
Just let me go.

652
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,140
Painkillers are useless anyway.

653
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:16,979
You'll end up fainting if this continues.

654
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,400
I'll prescribe you different painkillers.

655
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,569
I don't need painkillers anymore.

656
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,440
There are plenty of painkillers at home too.

657
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,880
Speak quickly.

658
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,220
What medication have you taken?

659
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,619
Contact the state general hospital.

660
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,419
Confirm what painkillers were given to the patient Zhao Xianyu

661
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,219
I think I've been to that hospital before

662
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,220
Okay

663
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,129
Where did the patient Zhao Xianyu go?

664
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,130
What?

665
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,470
Nurse Liu, where did the patient Zhao Xianyu go?

666
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,800
Ah

667
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,760
Slept after getting a morphine shot

668
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,900
Zhao Xianyu

669
00:51:19,790 --> 00:51:20,790
Are you okay?

670
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,810
Please help me

671
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,040
I don't want to continue anymore

672
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,300
I don't want to

673
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,059
I really don't want to keep working

674
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,060
It's too dangerous

675
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,650
Because of the medical bills

676
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:59,850
Spent all the money saved during this time

677
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,370
Because when you're alive, no matter what

678
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,670
You still need money

679
00:52:04,671 --> 00:52:06,060
So don't continue

680
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:10,730
I will seek counseling

681
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:14,930
Thank you

682
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,970
Friends we've met before will contact you

683
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,640
You can tell them

684
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:23,110
Where you want to be, how you want to leave

00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,440
That's all

686
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:26,710
So before that

687
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,360
Go do what you truly want to do

Only adding to the pain of untreatable patients

725
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,780
Can this be called treatment?

726
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,540
Who is this pain for?

727
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,860
I'm afraid I can no longer tell patients now

728
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:56,140
To keep holding on

729
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,090
Alright

730
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:02,250
If you believe it's your sin

731
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,579
But God's forgiveness erases sins

732
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,580
Before that, though

733
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,250
Self-reflection

734
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,470
And the determination to not sin again is crucial

735
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,250
The sacrament of confession is for making that resolution

736
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,970
I'm not here for confession

737
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,470
Right now

738
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:31,120
I don't want to be someone who avoids patients' pain

739
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,250
What does that mean?

740
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:37,640
You don't want to avoid it

741
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,810
What choice will you make then?

742
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,080
I'm leaving this faith now

743
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,320
Maria

744
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,350
I'm no longer Maria now

745
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:31,190
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

746
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:32,200
If you knew your medicine was used

747
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:33,779
In such a dangerous place

748
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,269
You definitely wouldn't let it go

749
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,209
Who exactly is using it?

750
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,859
Why do something like this?

751
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:42,739
I believe people should have the right to choose life or death.

752
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,359
We will let people spend their last moments where they most want to be.

753
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,960
Spend their final time.

754
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,739
But why do you suddenly want to give up everything so easily?

755
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:52,339
Once I wanted to live.

756
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:53,340
But not now.

757
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,000
It's a car accident patient.

758
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:56,299
A motorcycle delivery worker.

759
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,380
Arrived at the hospital in a state of death.
