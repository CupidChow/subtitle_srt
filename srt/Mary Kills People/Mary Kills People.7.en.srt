The subject of euthanasia in this drama is sensitive and may cause emotional discomfort. All references to euthanasia in the drama are purely fictional and have no connection to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed in a safe environment.

Mina

4
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,060
Mina, are you okay?

5
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,330
Are you okay? Are you okay?

6
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,990
What are you doing?

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,690
I want to end this.

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,830
But always fail

9
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,660
What are you doing?

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,210
You were obviously at home, why didn't you show up for dinner?

11
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,190
Isn't this for euthanasia?

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,530
You're not thinking of committing suicide, are you?

13
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,930
-No, it's not suicide. -What is it?

14
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,560
Do you want to kill someone?

15
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,330
I want to kill someone

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,030
But not murder.

17
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,590
Didn't you say

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,610
For those who are in too much pain, death may be a better option.

19
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,930
Too dangerous

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,790
Let me take you to the hospital.

21
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,260
It's hell

22
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,690
I don't want to live at all

23
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,010
Every minute and every second is so painful

24
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,230
Please help me

25
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,290
You said you lived in this neighborhood as a child, right?

26
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,030
Yes

27
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,290
At that time

28
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,990
Even when our family was the poorest

29
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,980
But it is also the happiest

30
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,030
Thank you, brother.

31
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,430
Go out and see if there's anyone in the alley.

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,930
It shouldn't be too long

33
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,560
Goodbye

-=Death Doctor Mary=-

35
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,180

Mina

38
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,140
I killed him.

39
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,360
So you move aside. I don't need a lawyer.

40
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,060
Be more awake

41
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,830
Yu Suzhen is now arrested because of Lee Yunxi's death.

42
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,510
Even if you admit your ex-girlfriend's problem, nothing will change.

43
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,170
I started it. I've said it several times.

44
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,630
From the beginning, I was the one who brought the medicine.

45
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,780
I'm going to say that I ordered everything.

46
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,860
If you want to turn yourself in, just make the call yourself.

47
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,950
- What... - Even though you don't want to tell any family members

48
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,450
But your sister is getting married at the end of this month

49
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,260
Your parents gave me a huge sum of money to defend you.

50
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,900
Not because I believe you're not taking drugs.

51
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,580
It's to prevent you from being arrested before your sister gets married.

52
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,810
Although I don't want to see you again

53
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,880
But if you are still my brother, try to live a quiet life.

54
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,860
This is what your sister wanted me to convey to you.

55
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,130
You can go back now

56
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,130
Why did you let me go suddenly?

57
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,230
Because someone appeared who claimed to have killed Ms. Lee Yun-hee

58
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,160
Is that Father Yang?

59
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,360
How was he killed?

60
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,150
Used medicine

61
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,530
What medicine was used?

62
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,110
I'm not sure about that, it's just...

63
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,790
I used all kinds of medicines in the hospital

64
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,960
Usually used by doctors in emergencies

65
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
I did just that.

66
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,860
I don't even know what medicine it is.

67
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,160
Just say you are a criminal?

68
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,700
Because I was too panicked.

69
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,230
Lee Yoon Hee is in so much pain

70
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,190
In a hurry, I just...

71
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,610
priest

72
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,530
Please wake up

73
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,010
I am the one who committed the crime

74
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,330
right

75
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,730
I killed him.

76
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,210
According to the investigation principles, since someone has surrendered,

77
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,590
We will take release measures first

78
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,690
Not a priest

79
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,030
So you're going to admit that you killed Ms. Lee Yoon-hee?

80
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,160
Father Yang did not kill anyone

81
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,660
If you don't admit that you killed him

82
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,330
Just go back first

83
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,390
You know the priest didn't kill anyone.

84
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,310
You feel you are not guilty anyway.

85
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,630
Yu Suzhen

86
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,940
Insist that what you do is not a sin

87
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,030
So what can you do yourself?

88
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,160
You didn't think about it because of your wrong belief

89
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,450
Will it hurt the people around you?

90
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,890
I'll be here until the autopsy results come back.

91
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,780
Are you sure about the autopsy results?

92
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,290
Won't Bafron appear?

93
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,260
Is it out?

94
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:45,270
Although multiple drugs were detected, their concentrations were not directly associated with the cause of death.

95
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,180
Damn

96
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,280
Please go back

97
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,690
The priest will be released soon anyway.

98
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,030
Thanks a lot

99
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,130
Yu Suzhen, you now

100
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,210
Missed the last chance to stop

101
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,990
I don't plan to stop

102
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,930
Ah, have you seen Xiaosong?

103
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,260
So the child is not here?

104
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,830
I probably didn't eat lunch either.

105
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,090
I'll look for it again

106
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,170
Ah, okay

107
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:33,540
Why are you here?

108
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,660
Aren't you hungry?

109
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,590
Are you scared?

110
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,190
My sister has a brother

111
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,890
The twin brother who was born 5 minutes earlier

112
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,890
We often hide here when we encounter scary things.

113
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,830
But my brother told me

114
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,290
When I'm scared, it's better to hide in a place like this

115
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,890
Go out and play with friends

116
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,690
It's better to be less afraid.

117
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,030
How about it

118
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,780
Do you want to go out with your sister?

119
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,010
careful

120
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,460
Under the Black Sun

121
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,890
staggering

122
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,860
I am gradually melting

123
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,290
Although ridiculed

124
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,360
Also need to help

125
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,430
The fallen body stood up

126
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,460
Go find you and embark on a journey

Dr. Yu

131
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,310
Did you know Ye Na has a twin brother?

132
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,330
He often stayed in our hospital when he was a child.

133
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,930
You should recognize it when you see its face.

134
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,360
Yeah, I think I've seen it too.

135
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,160
But what's wrong

136
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,010
That person was taken to the emergency room and is now hospitalized.

137
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,190
Say I want to see you

138
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,660
Ye-na's brother?

139
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,360
He seems unaware that Ye-na resigned

140
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,280
I seem to want to ask this

141
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,760
Doctor, you and Ye-na are doing volunteer work together.

142
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,260
We have some friendship, right?

143
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,080
I didn't know Ye Na resigned.

144
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,740
This matter

145
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,900
It's best to let Ye Na tell you in person

146
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:17,880
OK

147
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,750
But today has nothing to do with Ye-na

148
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
I have something to tell you

149
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,640
You should go through Ye Na

150
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,240
Did you know I have cystic fibrosis?

151
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,160
Cystic Fibrosis: A hereditary systemic disease that primarily causes widespread dysfunction of the exocrine glands.

152
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:33,960
Um

153
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,310
You probably know there are many complications.

154
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,700
Then I'll be frank.

155
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,140
I had a checkup because I was in severe pain recently.

156
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,410
The doctor said I have three months left.

157
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,810
Doesn't Ye-na know?

158
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,470
right

159
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,740
I know what Ye-na and you are doing

160
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,220
Once when she was taking care of a patient

161
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,740
Didn't take the 2G phone away

162
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,310
But I don't mean to blame you at all

163
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,920
Although it sounds like a quibble

164
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,070
We only treat

165
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,040
Patients whose pain cannot be controlled by analgesics

166
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,750
Deep distress

167
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,610
I know your principles very well.

168
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,100
So from the moment I decided to meet you

169
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,420
I've been preparing.

170
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,930
I know what information is needed

171
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,890
Please treat me

172
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,920
Do that treatment too.

174
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,610
Hello

175
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,030
-Hello. -You're here.

176
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,950
Are you okay?
I'm fine

177
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,760
Are you worried about me?

178
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:09,470
No

179
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,670
You look okay. That's great.

180
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,700
Really? Thank you.

181
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,460
You received a lot of donations.

182
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,580
I received a lot this time

183
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,380
We need to sort it out.

184
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,660
Give these to those in need

185
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,460
yes

186
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,520
By the way, where is Xiaosong?

187
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,120
Xiaosong, do you want to eat this?

188
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,090
Wow what is this

189
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,500
Don't move

190
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,740
-Will it be uncomfortable to carry me on your back? -I told you not to move.

191
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,590
This is my mother's

192
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,920
Komatsu

193
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,820
sorry

194
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,100
I won't do it without Ye-na's consent.

195
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,120
Ye-na is raising money for my lung transplant.

196
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,190
But I won't do it just because I know him.

197
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,580
Isn't this reverse discrimination?

198
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,150
Ye-na and I started this together.

199
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,620
She only performs that treatment on patients who agree.

200
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,970
You should convince Ye Na first.

201
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,140
-Dr. Yu -I know you grew up without parents

202
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,440
I grew up with Ye-na

203
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,020
The Ye-na I know

204
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,760
I want nothing more than to take care of you.

205
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,570
If she knew this was your decision alone

206
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,740
She'll be shocked.

207
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,730
For your choice

208
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,040
Ye-na needs to know

209
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,850
But you know she won't accept it.

210
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,670
sorry

211
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,290
Choi Gun-soo

212
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:06,790
Jianzhu

213
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,200
Received a report from an insider tonight

214
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,960
There are goods entering the country under the name of Jin Shijian

215
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,260
Jin Shijian should show up

216
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,620
Must catch him

217
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,800
Don't worry about it

218
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,890
Since the program about Kim Si-kyung's arrest was broadcast

219
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,150
There have been many prank calls reported in his name.

220
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,670
In fact, I missed out several times because of this reason.

221
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,330
But this time the report is very specific.

222
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,600
I think I still need to confirm.

223
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,700
The Narcotics Bureau has confirmed

224
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,640
If such a large amount of drugs arrives

225
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,200
There should be rumors from some bigwigs, but there is none.

226
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,130
The guy who tried to stowaway but failed

227
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,440
He also calls himself Jin Shijian.

228
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,060
Since he is a big shot and is on the news

229
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,110
That guy wants to use Jin Shijian's name

230
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,420
There is no guarantee that Baflon will arrive.

231
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,270
Let the Narcotics Department handle the matter regarding Bafron.

232
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,660
You should track down Jin Shijian's missing car.

233
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,350
Don't you still have the vehicle's movement route?

234
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,780
yes

235
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,760
If you really want to confirm

236
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,110
Your group can go and confirm it.

237
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,540
If there is a suspicious situation

238
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,730
You can invite support at will.

239
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,150
Thanks

240
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,620
-=Detective Fu Zhexiu=-

241
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,120
Hey, Detective Husband

242
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,210
This is the last chance

243
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,530
Please persuade Choi Dae-hyun

244
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,260
So we can capture Yu Suzhen on the spot

245
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,220
good

246
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,840
Youmei, Mom has to go out for a while

247
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:23,110
The porridge is here. Remember to eat it.

248
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,090
Choi Dae-hyun, where are you?

249
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,340
Now Ye-na doesn't know about her brother's condition.

250
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,130
right

251
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,490
She is so good to her brother.

252
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,480
But she hasn't come yet

253
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,600
Maybe she doesn't even know her brother is in the hospital here.

254
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,500
Do you want me to contact Ye-na?

255
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,380
Looks like he needs a guardian.

256
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,710
I'll go find her after get off work.

257
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,640
That's better

258
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,800
If I tell her about her brother's condition

259
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,770
She should be more receptive.

260
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,940
No matter how I explain it, it will be hard for her to accept it.

261
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,040
Xiaosong: Do you like this dress?

262
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,540
Thank you for buying me clothes

263
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,250
I'll buy you more fitting clothes later.

264
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,780
Here, drink it.

265
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,620
Are you crazy?

266
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,360
How can you bring your children?

267
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,860
She is Lee Yoon-hee's daughter

268
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,540
She has some separation anxiety because of the shock.

269
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,500
So I had to bring her here.

270
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,900
I think you're the one with separation anxiety.

271
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,950
Right

272
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,470
The unmarried...

273
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,720
Can't adopt a child? Is it still not possible now?

274
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,070
Even if they are married, they will not give it to drug offenders.

275
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,690
Opportunities to adopt a child are not available in any country.

276
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,420
If you want to take care of her

277
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,860
You should know that you can't be arrested by the police.

278
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,990
The police said they'll give you one more chance.

279
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,910
If you're willing to help, you can get away with it.

280
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,020
Forget it. This matter has already been decided.

281
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,170
Think about it carefully

282
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,110
I think compared to Yu Suzhen

283
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,870
This child seems to need you more now

284
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,050
You are here

285
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,560
Just in case, I didn't tell you.

286
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,370
The ward where patient Lee Yun-hee stayed that day has been tidied up.

287
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,030
All the items she used were disinfected and discarded.

288
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,650
Because I think it would be strange if the location of the mobile O2 was changed

289
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,230
Portable O2: Portable oxygen cylinder

290
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,810
So I dealt with it all.

291
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,360
Thanks

292
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:07,850
Ye Na

293
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,710
Um

294
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,040
Your brother is in our hospital now because he fainted.

295
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,350
Is it serious?

296
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,930
Why don't you call me if you feel bad?

297
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,340
Was he taken to the hospital alone?

298
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,280
You know there are a lot of complications with cystic fibrosis, right?

299
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,250
Um

300
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,070
Not just the lungs

301
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,120
Even pancreatic function will gradually decline

302
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,510
Are there any complications with the pancreas?

303
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,410
Or has it turned into cancer?

304
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,500
No wonder I felt he was deliberately ignoring my calls recently.

305
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,560
Maybe it's because you can't tell me this.

306
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,880
Ye Na

307
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,000
Um

308
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,140
Jianzhu

309
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:15,610
Know what we are doing

310
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,040
besides

311
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,100
He wants us to do it to him.

312
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,720
The treatment we are currently doing

313
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:29,780
Can't

314
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,680
Can't

315
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,070
I know you're shocked.

316
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,040
But the person who is suffering the most right now is Jianzhu

317
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,380
You won't promise him, right?

318
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,460
No

319
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,950
I told him I wouldn't do it without your consent.

320
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,540
What are you talking about? You definitely can't agree with it.

321
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,450
Even if it's for my own good

322
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,890
You have to tell him too

323
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,580
You will find a way to save him.

324
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,640
sorry

325
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,540
I know you're feeling bad.

326
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,290
But you'd better communicate with Jianzhu

327
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,730
He is the most miserable person right now.

328
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,560
sorry

329
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,160
Because of me, you are tired

330
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,900
I have something to tell you

331
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,970
I'll take care of Li Yunxi's daughter for the time being.

332
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,720
Compared to a hospital or a church

333
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,730
The child might be more comfortable living in my house.

334
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,540
Dr. Yu

335
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,560
You don't have to come to our hospital anymore.

336
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,980
You behaved in a misleading way

337
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,680
And it caused a lot of trouble to the surrounding area

338
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,130
I mean you did something you shouldn't have done.

339
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,220
I don't want the patients in our hospital and the nuns

340
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,360
They suffered embarrassment because of you

341
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,240
So don't come to this hospital anymore.

342
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,350
Got it?

343
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,070
in addition

344
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,890
You must never do anything that causes misunderstanding again.

345
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,530
What if that wasn't a misunderstanding?

346
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,830
Don't do

347
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,360
Okay

348
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,110
Dr. Yu

349
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,770
You can't get involved in this kind of thing anymore.

350
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,180
If the police said

351
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,730
I really did it.

352
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,960
I think it's your mistake

353
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:02,640
right

354
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,560
If you escape from reality, will you feel comfortable?

355
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,610
Death is God's domain

356
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,970
People cannot interfere

357
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,370
Father, you also said many last prayers.

358
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:18,670
It should be clear

359
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,570
Before death

360
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,270
How many patients have experienced torture?

361
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,490
Because of fear of others' blame

362
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,740
Can you easily ignore such pain?

363
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,820
We pretend not to know

364
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,540
Do those who experience pain disappear?

365
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,790
This is committing a sin

366
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,140
I'll tell you again

367
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,490
If this happens again

368
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,870
I will report you.

369
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,120
I will testify

370
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,790
so

371
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,540
Please don't do it again

372
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,940
You are still as irresponsible as you were then.

373
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,920
The first person my mother turns to for help

374
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,320
It's you, Father

375
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,740
You ignored her request then, didn't you?

376
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,440
Until I was young, I wanted to help my mother

377
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,290
What are you doing there?

378
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,140
Eh? What?

379
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,040
What did you say

380
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,240
I was scared to death

381
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,940
I asked you what you were doing there.

382
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,170
Oh Oh

383
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,840
I'm drinking water

384
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,390
Too thirsty

385
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,540
What are you doing

386
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,440
Ouch

387
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,670
What are you doing?

388
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,890
Why are you drinking so fast?

389
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,120
come on

390
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,790
The information has come again. The time and place have changed.

391
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,990
The report is very specific

392
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,520
Even the informant knew that in Jin Shijian's car

393
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,450
-=Incheon Port 3-A was expected to conduct drug trafficking at 10:10 PM on November 18th. At the Royal Elite construction site in Seojin-dong, Bunseong City, drug trafficking was expected to occur at 9:30 PM on November 18th. The police officer's lost drugs found in Kim Si-mi's car were also the work of them.

394
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,690
Police found drugs they lost

395
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,220
But the drug squad

396
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:28,140
I think this information itself is false

397
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,620
They asked us to dig some more.

398
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,470
The disappearance of Jin Shijian

399
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,790
No, I heard they are crazy about the performance.

400
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,040
Why do you say such strange things?

401
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,740
The current situation is very strange

402
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,040
Jin Shijian takes the drugs lost by the police

403
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,790
This is also very strange

404
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,770
Is there an undercover thief?

405
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,870
If the drug squad doesn't go

406
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Let's go

407
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,570
The drug squad has determined it's fake.

408
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,120
The bureau will not provide additional personnel

409
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,520
It's too dangerous for us to go alone

410
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,540
Go to the scene first and call for support if needed.

411
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,090
Let's go by ourselves

412
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,740
Information leaks may also occur within the police force

413
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,540
Let's pretend we're leaving get off work early.

414
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,640
Meet again later

415
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,190
no

416
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,890
Let's do it

417
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,440
no

418
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,690
Let's do it

419
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,290
I told you no, where are you going?

420
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,420
Brother, where do you go every day?

421
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,840
Let's do it

422
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,990
Get off at Komatsu. Be careful.

423
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,570
-Hey. -Okay.

424
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,370
Xiaosong, you got something stuck here.

425
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,090
- Where? - It's beautiful.

426
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:34,540
Wow, Xiaosong has become prettier.

427
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,140
We went to the department store

428
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,470
I was just waiting for you.

429
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,970
I plan to take Xiaosong away

430
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,020
Now?

431
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,720
- So fast? - Yeah

432
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,470
It's better to go to our house than stay here.

433
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,090
Ah, yes.

434
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,120
And Jae-yeon is here, so this is more suitable

435
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,670
Komatsu

436
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,970
Uncle will pick you up tomorrow

437
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,390
You stay at your aunt's house.

438
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,470
Can I take Xiaosong out tomorrow?

439
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,040
Xiaosong will be bored at home after the children go to school.

440
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,290
Okay, I'll tell Auntie.

441
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,640
Where did Ye-na go?

442
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,120
Ye-na brother entrusted me with a task

443
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,690
Does Ye-na know?

444
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,670
Um

445
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,320
She is in pain now

446
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,220
Why didn't you tell me

447
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,840
Complications occurred

448
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,270
sorry

449
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,920
What's there to apologize for?

450
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,740
Why do you apologize for everything?

451
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,270
I feel even more guilty if I didn't find it.

452
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,020
I'll go and find out starting tomorrow.

453
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,790
If we search, we may find new treatments.

454
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,040
Can I stop treatment?

455
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,220
sorry

456
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,270
I really now

457
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,640
I don't want to continue

458
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,590
Why

459
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,790
Why

460
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,020
Why do you say such depressing words?

461
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,840
Don't you remember your childhood?

462
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,470
The hospital said you won't live past 10.

463
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,270
But you're still alive

464
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,220
Ask again

465
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,940
Maybe a miracle will happen.

466
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,090
It's a miracle that I'm still alive

467
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,020
It's the miracle you created

468
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,370
But

469
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,470
I hate miracles now.

470
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,720
I want to be peaceful

471
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,240
Why do you think so?

472
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,770
You are a very strong person

473
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,340
Haven't you persevered through treatments more painful than this?

474
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,990
Why do you suddenly give up?

475
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,940
Is it because you are too tired?

476
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,420
Ye-na, please

477
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,270
Don't let me continue treatment.

478
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,940
You're going too far.

479
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,070
How did I survive to this day?

480
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,840
You and I to Mom...

481
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,620
We were born from our mother's womb on the same day.

482
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,890
How did we survive together till today?

483
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,320
How could you do this to me?

484
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,990
How can you say this to me so easily?

485
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,640
What am I to you?

486
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,370
Sorry, Ye-na

487
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,120
- That's not the case. - Never mind.

488
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,320
Don't say that again.

489
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,830
-=Lee Yoon Hee=-

490
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,440
There is no photo of my mother.

491
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,570
Next time you come

492
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,670
Xiaosong, please draw your mother's face.

493
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,290
Mom is no longer in pain here and can rest well.

494
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,570
So

495
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,320
You can come here when you miss your mother.

496
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,890
Is this Mom's room from now on?

497
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,770
Yes

498
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,020
Will I live here in the future?

499
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,320
oh...

500
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,970
This is a place where people like my mother take a break.

501
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,940
But Komatsu is more interested in rest

502
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,320
Have to play and learn

503
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,190
There's a lot to do

504
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,370
so

505
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,020
Come with me to our house.

506
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,270
Auntie, is this your home?

507
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,890
Um

508
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,920
I just want to go back to my home

509
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,570
We have an older sister and an older brother in our family.

510
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,990
-Sister? -Yeah

511
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,140
A very smart and kind sister

512
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Besides, my brother and you, Xiaosong, are similar in age.

513
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,140
It must be fun to play together

514
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,320
To my older sister and older brother, I am their aunt.

515
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:43,750
But for Komatsu

516
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,120
I'll be your mother

517
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,590
I made an agreement with your mother.

518
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,970
I will take good care of you

519
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,340
Dear mother, let me comb your hair

520
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,090
Okay, what hairstyle do you want?

521
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,890
Are you reluctant to leave because you're worried about your children?

522
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,870
I made a promise with you

523
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,390
I will take good care of the children

524
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,120
You can go without worry

525
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,590
So don't worry

526
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,820
Come to our house

527
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,440
I received a call from a social worker.

528
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,190
Yes, I received the call too.

529
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,490
Yu Suzhen, are you planning to live with your child?

530
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,570
Yes

531
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,540
Even if it's temporary, you still have to meet the guardian requirements.

532
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,920
Problems may arise

533
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,170
I know

534
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,020
but

535
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,720
For the children

536
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,870
During this time, I think I should take care of her.

537
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,720
Help take care of children

538
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,640
Will it ease your guilt?

539
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,170
Even though you want to help them

540
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,190
But the child grew up and knew about this.

541
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,620
Do you think she won't blame you?

542
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,490
I don't care

543
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,220
I don't expect her not to blame me.

544
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,520
Just for now

545
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:52,170
Our home is the safest place for children

546
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,590
The social worker will contact you in a while.

547
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,820
You can't live with her forever.

548
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,940
There will be difficulties, but we will always find a way.

549
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,370
Just a few hours ago

550
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,440
You are still a suspect in Lee Yoon-hee's death

551
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,670
You can think I'm trying to avoid suspicion.

552
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,690
Only then did such behavior

553
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,940
But today

554
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,640
Please let me take the child home.

555
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,790
Please

556
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,470
-Hey -Brother

557
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,720
I have arrived

558
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,970
When will you come

559
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:46,440
-=Lee Yoon Hee, My Mom=-

560
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,470
Hello, Huilin, it's me.

561
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,770
The representative who played golf with us last time

562
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,090
Patients with advanced gastric cancer

563
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,570
Representative Chen Yingxiu

564
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,070
Did that person go to Switzerland?

565
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,420
Didn't go

566
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
His condition suddenly worsened and he was unable to make the trip.

567
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,920
There was no possibility of this from the beginning

568
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,690
Dragging my sick body to Switzerland for examination and waiting for the results

569
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,340
But why am I suddenly curious about Chen's status?

570
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,370
Ah, that

571
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,530
I think we can use Barfron to help him.

572
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:20,740
What

573
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,060
Didn't you say before that Bafron was hell?

574
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,190
Isn't it hell?

575
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,830
I found a way to perfectly control Barfron.

576
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,650
A powerful person

577
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,520
A doctor

578
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,380
Aunt

579
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,560
I'll take Xiaosong to my room to sleep.

580
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,050
You often have to go to work at night anyway

581
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,360
There is Komatsu

582
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,570
Cai Yun won't let me play with him

583
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:56,550
So I will be more comfortable

584
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,980
You've always been a great help to me.

585
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,870
Thanks

586
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,230
You guys hide for a while

587
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,920
- What are you doing? - Just playing hide and seek.

588
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,190
I told you to open the door, bitch

589
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,870
Before mom opens the door for you

590
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,870
You absolutely cannot come out, got it?

591
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,230
I told you to open the door

592
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,740
Open the door, bitch

593
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,390
Hello

594
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,290
Why don't you open the door for me?

595
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,900
Open the door for me

596
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,250
Hello

597
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,500
Open the door

598
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,700
You damn bitch

599
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,870
- What are you doing? - Bear with it.

600
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,870
Didn't we play enough today?

601
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,170
Isn't it enough?

602
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,000
- Do you want to die today? - Gun-soo's dad

603
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,520
- Do you want to die? - Stop fighting. Stop fighting.

604
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,490
Do you want to die?

605
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,600
Do you want to die?

606
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,410
Help!

607
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,810
Hello

608
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,410
Dad is here

609
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,460
Jianzhu

610
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,960
come over

611
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,330
Open the door

612
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,790
Why don't you open the door?

613
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,800
- You guys, I'm going to kill you all today. - You hide for a while.

614
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,790
Open the door quickly

615
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,660
- Gun-soo, Ye-na, just treat it as a game of hide-and-seek

616
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,980
You must not come out before your brother opens the door for you

617
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,960
- You guys, - Got it.

618
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,350
I'm going to kill you all today.

619
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,430
Open the door, brat!

620
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,750
These guys are just brats.

621
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,580
What are you glaring at, you little brat?

622
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,890
Hey, brat

623
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,450
Hey, brat

624
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,640
You little bastard, I'm your dad.

625
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,120
- You little bastard. - What should I do?

626
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,540
-Dad, stop hitting me. -I'm going to kill you today.

627
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,560
Brat

628
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,390
How dare you stare at me, you little brat?

629
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,680
elder brother

630
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,020
It's okay

631
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,340
-It's okay. It's okay. -Brother

632
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,800
sorry

633
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,790
I wonder how I'm going to live without you.

634
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,800
So I got angry first

635
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,430
You did a great job

636
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,840
Do whatever you want, just live on.

637
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,810
There's nothing I want to do

638
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,100
I said I would live happily with you forever

639
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,580
That's my wish

640
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,570
Hello

641
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,970
I will only make you suffer. What good is a brother like me?

642
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,570
Of course

643
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,960
After all, you are my brother.

644
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,060
Of course

645
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,250
sorry

646
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:23,010
I'm sorry, brother.

647
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:33,440
you

648
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,880
Do you really not want to continue?

649
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:43,310
Is it true?

650
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,000
Very urgent

651
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,730
It's really urgent

652
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,310
I really want to do that

653
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,330
Coming, coming, coming

654
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,300
Is it him?

655
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,050
What's with the yellow hair?

656
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:55,450
Are you doing well?
Um

657
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,040
By the way, the second one is a son, right?

658
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,840
It's my daughter

659
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,790
I thought it was my son when I saw the photo

660
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,190
Is this it?

661
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,430
Damn

662
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,840
Opened Opened Opened

663
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,450
Hey, hey, hey, it's drugs, right?

664
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,950
What are you doing?

665
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:30,840
What is this?

666
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,500
-Have you ordered a midnight snack? -No

667
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,390
Is this a midnight snack?

668
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:39,430
What?

669
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,430
Hey, yellow hair

670
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,550
Wow

671
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:43,970
one two three

672
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:45,430
Just three people?
Um

673
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:48,190
Hello, arrest team

674
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:50,350
Arrest Team

675
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,820
Damn

676
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:59,420
Want to call for backup?

677
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:00,540
Didn't you just call?

678
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,310
No, you didn't say anything, so I...

679
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,590
Damn

680
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,170

681
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:08,210
Are you scared?

682
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,650
The helicopter arrived a little late.

683
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,720
Wow, so many

684
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,410
-What? -Hey, come on.

It hurts, you little bastard

687
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,980
Be gentle

688
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,780
Hey, take it away. Take it away.

689
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,570
Damn it hurts, it hurts, you little brat

Run, walk, walk

00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:04,680
It hurts, little bastard. It hurts a lot.

694
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,050
Blocked

695
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,010
Something is flying over here. What is it?

696
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,780
Hello, hello, what are you doing?

697

Get off, brat!

702
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:43,720
What are you doing?

703
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:44,630
rush out

704
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,240
I was scared to death. Damn it.

705
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,780
You crazy person

706
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,580
Damn

707
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,200
Brother Cheol-soo

709
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,300
Hey, you little bastard

Damn

711
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,660
That's why I asked you to apply for support.

712
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:29,970
It's different from the movie.

713
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:31,540
Damn, can it be the same?

714
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:32,860
Damn

715
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:51,240
Get in the car

716
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,420
Damn

717
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:57,360
Hey, little bastards!

718
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,360
Damn, should have used it earlier.

719
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,300
-Hello. -Hello.

720
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:09,940
Hello, are you okay?

721
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,550
Why are there so many people?

722
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,130
Hello, hurry up. Which way is it?

723
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,650
Hello, there's a normal vehicle ahead. Sorry.

724
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,870
sorry

725
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,120
Brother, over there, over there, in front, in front

726
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,080
The cop guy is really

727
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,110
Parking brat

728
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:47,300
I told you to stop.

729
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,720
Bro, I bumped into you.

730
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:52,120
-Stop him, stop him, stop him, stop him, stop him -I told you to stop, Campanula

731
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,990
If it were you, could you park the car?

732
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,410
Block him

733
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,140
Brat, block him, block him

734
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,790
- I told you to stop. - In front. In front.

735
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:08,800
What are you doing?

736
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,890
Re-posted it

737
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,420
Follow me, boy.

738
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:15,550
Step on the gas. Step on the gas.

739
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,230
Go to hell. Go to hell.

740
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,420
Brother is in front

741
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:42,930
Oh, damn!

742
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,460
Damn

743
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,100
Although no one caught up

744
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,770
But I got the medicine

745
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,430
Maybe we can find some clues.

746
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,780
There's no news from anywhere in the drug world.

747
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,750
They showed up

748
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,520
No, there are so many drugs in Korea.

749
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,370
Is this a deliberately fake survey?

750
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,100
this

751
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,280
Need to confirm again

752
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,640
It sounds like this indeed

753
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:39,600
-Hello -Detective Pan

754
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,860
2123 vehicles on National Highway 1034

755
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,290
Caught by surveillance camera

756
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,550
Hello, Ji-hoon

757
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,420
-=Emergency Room/CT=-

758
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,980
Received the commission

759
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:16,620
I don't have any medicine right now, so I can't accept the commission.

760
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,280
But the patient is anxious

761
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,500
The patient is a 27-year-old male born in 1998.

762
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:32,090
He has male fibrosis.

763
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:34,900
Because of complications, time is running out.

764
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,210
The patient has been suffering because his family opposes euthanasia.

765
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,890
Now I have convinced my family and commissioned

766
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:51,330
Who is the client?

767
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,530
It's my brother

768
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,580
Finally, it was captured by surveillance

769
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,960
-=Surveillance filming=-

770
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,120
The 27NA2123 vehicle

771
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,910
The last time I was photographed was on this road

772
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:15,630
Start from this intersection

773
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,520
No longer captured by surveillance.

774
00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:21,000
Have you found anything new since then?

775
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,410
Um, about 80 kilometers away from here

776
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:25,400
From there, there is monitoring

777
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,500
But after that, the roads on both sides

778
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,060
No 2123 cars have been photographed

779
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:33,850
Here

780
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,310
There is a big lake here

781
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:37,440
Then let's go over here and take a look.

782
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,500
The car disappeared within a radius of 100 kilometers.

783
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,840
It can only go in that direction.

784
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:43,940
yes

785
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,800
Please send divers here.

786
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,600
I'll text you the location.

787
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:30,000
Are you mentally prepared?

788
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,850
My brother is very urgent

789
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,820
And you

790
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,060
Because I know this time

791
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,620
It's really hard for me.

792
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,440
So I promised to do it for him.

793
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,010
Am I doing it right?

794
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:13,950
I know how hard it is for you

795
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,490
Maybe you'll keep thinking about this question.

796
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,300
Is this my true heart?

797
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,500
Did I do the right thing then?

798
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,570
Jianzhu

799
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:36,970
Since I got sick

800
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:40,600
Maybe I never had a good night's sleep.

801
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:50,600
Ye Na

802
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,760
When I was a child

803
00:55:56,550 --> 00:55:59,230
Do you know what choice my mother made?

804
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:17,780
My mother has wanted to die all her life.

805
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,580
When she finally got what she wanted

806
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,330
Although I was very sad, I also blamed her

807
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:35,110
She never considered us who were left in this world.

808
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,090
But it's not like that

809
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,660
My mother prepared in advance

810
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,240
For the daughter left behind

811
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,580
I only knew it then

812
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,790
Maybe my mom

813
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,160
It's hard

814
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,980
Until I grew up

815
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:19,450
-=Mom, I'm sorry, I love you=-

816
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,730
Mom, I'm sorry.

817
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:21,940
I love you

818
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:29,830
That's when I felt so sorry for her.

819
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,040
Because I let the sick worry about me

820
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,880
Jianzhu was able to endure such a difficult treatment process

821
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,240
Maybe because I'm worried about you being left alone

822
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,800
What we can do

823
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,380
When the one we love leaves

824
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,300
Don't let them worry about us

825
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:08,660
Only that one

826
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,200
good

827
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,380
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

828
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,130
I have to help Ye-na's brother.

829
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,370
Ye Na also agreed

830
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,050
Do you have to meet that person?

831
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:33,740
You stinky girl

832
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,300
Do you want to have a funeral before you die?

833
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,530
Good. The funeral was nice.

834
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,820
-How much can you give? -How much can you give?

835
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:44,770
I'm almost dead, why am I still so reluctant?

836
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,280
It really starts from now on

837
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,970
Do as I say

838
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:50,980
It's like becoming a kind killer.

839
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,160
The location of Yu Suzhen's vehicle has been confirmed

840
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:56,140
What did you do again?
