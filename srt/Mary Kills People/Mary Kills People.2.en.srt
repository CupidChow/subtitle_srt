00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,990
-=This show deals with the sensitive topic of euthanasia, which may cause discomfort for some viewers. Additionally, the characters,
events, places, and groups depicted are purely fictional and bear no relation to reality. The child actors and animals were filmed under safe conditions.=-

2
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,290
From now on

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,919
the three of us will do this together

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,440
Yeah, that's right

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,270
Ena, nice to meet you

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,820
Nice to meet you, yeah

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,540
Nice to meet you

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,439
Yes, we welcome any group as long as it's all-female

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Welcome

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,570
Before starting this work, let me clarify the standards for you all

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,870
First

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,220
the client must have opinions from three or more doctors

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,420
diagnosed as untreatable

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,940
Then,

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,670
they must be in a state of unbearable physical disability

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,219
Lastly,

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,520
the pain must be beyond the control of any medication

18
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,180
These are the standards

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,870
Got it?

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,920
Yes

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,369
Okay, understood

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,439
As the only male here, I made a special preparation

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
Here

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,170
Alright

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,970
Okay

26
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,538
In the future

27
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:18,139
we will mix Buffalone into this and provide it to the client

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,140
Here

29
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:26,890
Of course, we haven't added it yet, no worries

30
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,370
Alright

31
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,789
We

32
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,470
Let's do our best together

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,420
-=Dr. Death Mary=-

34
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,030
-=Episode 2=-

35
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,329
-=No Unauthorized Access=-

36
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,189
She was fine before the performance

37
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,970
But suddenly when she got on stage...

38
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,670
Maybe it was due to nerves

39
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,540
Let me check your eyes

40
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,640
Is there a problem

41
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,170
Let's do an examination. Please wait outside

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,840
We'll inform you once it's done

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Okay

44
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,440
Dilated pupils

45
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:17,180
-=Mydriasis: An abnormal
expansion of the pupils due to illness, medication,
or injury=-

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,870
We'll have to wait for the test results to be sure, but it looks like an overdose of sedatives

47
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,490
Are you awake? You're in a hospital

48
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,940
Do you remember fainting during the performance?

49
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,290
Did you take any medication beforehand?

50
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,740
I'll handle this

51
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Alright

52
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,290
Yume

53
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,120
I know you did it due to anxiety, but you can't just take medicine recklessly

54
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,290
Can you tell me what you took?

55
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,520
The test result will reveal it anyway

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,270
Just tell me

57
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,790
Is my mom here too?

58
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,169
She's probably in the waiting room outside. Should I call her?

59
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,740
Don't tell my mom

60
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I thought

61
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,140
It's medicine that helps calm emotions.

62
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,820
What kind of medicine?

63
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,820
Buflon.

64
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,270
Found it in your home warehouse.

65
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,370
Picked it up accidentally.

66
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,389
Does Caiyan know too?

67
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,890
She saw the medicine with me.

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,940
Although she doesn't know I took it.

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,370
I actually have stage fright.

70
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,640
Please don't tell my mom. If she finds out,

71
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,240
she'll send me to a foreign boarding school.

72
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,040
This must be told.

73
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,840
The test results will be out, can't lie.

74
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,620
Patient's symptoms must be confidential.

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,570
Aren't you a doctor?

76
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,569
You really sound like a lawyer.

77
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,570
Although I'm not clear on what the medicine is,

78
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,490
if my mom finds out, she definitely won't let it go.

79
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,240
My mom is a very capable lawyer.

80
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,470
You know what capable means, right?

81
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,220
You, me, Caiyan,

82
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,520
we'll all have headaches.

83
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,199
-=Seoul Police Department Special Investigation Team=-

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,169
-=Suspects Woo Sojeong, Choi Dahyeon, Choi Ye-na=-
Woo Sojeong and Choi Dahyeon were college classmates.

85
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,670
How did Choi Ye-na get involved with them?

86
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,425
It's Choi Ye-na's mother passed away in a traffic accident when she was young.

87
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:08,680
-=Drug Serial Murder Case=-

88
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,590
Lived with her alcoholic father and twin brother.

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,315
Brother Choi Gyeonsu has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.

90
00:06:15,316 --> 00:06:23,316
-=Cystic Fibrosis [Cystic Fibrosis]:
A hereditary systemic disease primarily causing extensive dysfunction of exocrine glands=-

91
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,919
The father was extremely abusive.

92
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,419
- So the siblings were basically dependent on each other. - Where did Choi Yongjun go?

93
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,420
Who are you?

94
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,990
Where did Choi Yongjun go?

95
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,119
- I'm asking who you are. - Daring to get sick.

96
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,519
You can't get sick without money.

97
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,639
Let's talk outside. Go out and talk.

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Move aside.

99
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,270
What are you doing?

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,920
Who is Choi Yongjun?

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,740
Don't come near me. I'll really kill you.

102
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,020
Move aside.

103
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,039
Her father left home seven years ago and completely lost contact.

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Move aside.

105
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,320
Later, her brother Choi Kyungsoo was repeatedly hospitalized.

106
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,339
Choi Ena served as his caregiver.

107
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,490
She practically lived in the hospital.

108
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,490
During that time, she developed a close relationship with Woo Sojeong.

109
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,539
Now she has graduated from university.

110
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,840
She works as a nurse at Bunseong Hospital.

111
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,540
She's in a lot of debt from high-interest loans because of her brother's medical bills.

112
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:14,980
-=Choi Ena=-

113
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,350
-=Inmate colleague Kim Sigyeon=-
Bavlon's supplier Kim Sigyeon

114
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,840
Brother, it's time to eat.

115
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,819
After Choi Daehyun started using drugs,

116
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,739
he was imprisoned for a medical incident.

117
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,090
He was in the same cell.

118
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,139
At the time, he was just a small-time offender.

119
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:32,270
Later, he controlled the distribution network in Cambodia and became a big shot.

120
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,939
- Thanks. - Mmm.

121
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,640
He must have someone backing him up.

122
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,090
I don't know who's protecting him.

123
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,620
The special investigation team has been chasing him for years, but they haven't caught a trace.

124
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Does Jin Suchan know that the drugs he provided are being used for euthanasia?

125
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,289
Not sure.

126
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,969
But considering Jin Suchan's level, the volume of Bafloon is too small.

127
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,940
He might not notice.

128
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,670
Besides, he usually has his subordinates handle the trades.

129
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,540
However, once we start investigating,

130
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,990
The pressure will increase, it's just a matter of time before he notices.

131
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,640
If he knows his drugs are being used for such dangerous things,

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
He won't spare Yu Sojeong.

133
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,320
We need to catch her before Jin Suchan makes a move.

134
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
Yes.

135
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,619
Considering the method of euthanasia,

136
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,639
Someone like Choi Daehyun, who's had medical incidents,

137
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,739
-=Choi Daehyun, Choi Yena=-

138
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,470
Or the inexperienced nurse Choi Yena, they're probably just assisting.

139
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,039
The key is Yu Sojeong.

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,589
She's not in it for the money, she's driven by a fanatical belief.

141
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,239
-=Yu Sojeong=-

142
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,840
First, check if Choi Daehyun is involved with drugs again.

143
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,390
That might lead to problems later...

144
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,789
Do you think our current investigation methods are legally sound?

145
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
By the way,

146
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,320
What's the autopsy result for athlete Choi Kangyoon?

147
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,040
It's coming out soon.

148
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,040
So athlete Choi Kangyoon's wife is currently in the investigation room.

149
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,170
Get the materials ready.

150
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,570
If we want to catch Yu Sojeong.

151
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,570
That woman's cooperation is crucial

152
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,120
-= Suspects: Yoo Soo-jin, Choi Da-hyeon, Choi Yena =-

153
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,320
Name is Jo Soo-young, a boy

154
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,590
In late-stage colon cancer, still in high school

155
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,170
You'll see in the file, he's already been diagnosed with little time left

156
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,820
Where are your parents?

157
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,620
Did the family agree to our consultation?

158
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,540
It was the child who initially brought it up

159
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,040
Mother went missing after the divorce

160
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,090
Father was easier to convince than expected

161
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,630
He mentioned there's about half a month left

162
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,840
Time is pressing

163
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,070
As soon as I heard about this

164
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,770
I thought of my uncle

165
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,570
Though I've never met him

166
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,070
But my grandma always says

167
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,870
When I just started high school

168
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,370
My uncle died of colon cancer in less than half a month

169
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,190
So we must pay attention to health

170
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,240
I got so tired of hearing it

171
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,420
And that lousy gene ended up being passed down to me

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,170
So you had already considered

173
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,270
If you were to get sick, you'd undergo this kind of consultation?

174
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,239
Who would think about such a bizarre thing in advance?

175
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,340
Especially when I'm so young

176
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,470
The doctor said

177
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,420
Half a month left

178
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,820
It's not time to settle matters

179
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,420
But a warning that during this time

180
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,270
I will experience things like before

181
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,690
A completely different level of pain

182
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,240
So I want to die quickly

183
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,020
I'm already unwilling to face death

184
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,370
I don't want to suffer like that anymore

185
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,420
You know Yu So-jin from Fenseong General Hospital, right?

186
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,340
Yes, she's an emergency department doctor

187
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,920
I first went to that hospital through the ER

188
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,640
That's probably when I met her

189
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,289
But what's her connection to my husband's death?

190
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,370
Did you ever see any private communication between your husband and Yu So-jin?

191
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,039
Any notes or text messages between them?

192
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,969
Or did your husband ever have a flip phone you hadn't seen before?

193
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,470
If you find anything suspicious

194
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,420
You can apply for a warrant to investigate

195
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,340
I'm sorry if this makes you uncomfortable

196
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,440
Are you suspecting I'm hiding something?

197
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,440
I'll be frank

198
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,640
At the moment, we're not suspecting you

199
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,670
We

200
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,390
are focusing our attention on Yu So-jin

201
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,040
because she's been involved in similar incidents before

202
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
I don't know

203
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,190
how close my husband was with that woman

204
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,370
What kind of relationship they had

205
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,370
I see

206
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,890
But unfortunately

207
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,720
if we can't find enough evidence to implicate Yu So-jin

208
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
then

209
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,890
you might also be considered a suspect

210
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
So please try to remember anything you can

211
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,170
Hmm, has it been done?

212
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Okay.

213
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,070
The autopsy results are out.

214
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,980
I'll go confirm the results.

215
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,230
The patient seems unaware of what it means to be dying.

216
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,990
His father looks devastated with guilt.

217
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,730
But he already promised Zhao Xianyu, right?

218
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,460
Yes, but he might prioritize Xiuying.

219
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,030
Yeah, Xiuying hasn't even had time to worry.

220
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,790
It's unbelievable such a thing happens at a young age.

221
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,260
By the way, if you have time, check with Xiuying's mom.

222
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,219
Based on the information from her dad,

223
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,140
there might be clues.

224
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,850
Isn't finding people online your specialty?

225
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,590
I'm great at that kind of thing.

226
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,940
Though time is a bit tight,

227
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,950
I can give it a try.

228
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,790
Oh, there's also Bavlon.

229
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,590
Father Yang has been moved to the hospital.

230
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,900
Keeping him at home is dangerous with children around.

231
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,980
Well done, given what happened.

232
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,030
We need to be careful.

233
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,890
Is it hidden in the cabinet?

234
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,879
Yeah, it's locked and password-secured.

235
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,020
I'll manage it temporarily.

236
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,140
That's excellent.

237
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,270
Yeah, well done.

238
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,360
Cause of death confirmed as asphyxiation.

239
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,630
But it's a fact Bavlon was found on the body, right?

240
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,820
Yes, the deceased did take it.

241
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,220
But it's not a lethal dose

242
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,310
So, does this mean

243
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,580
The investigation into Choi Kang-yoon's death can't proceed, right?

244
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,920
Yes, this time is different

245
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,380
If it was Woo Soo-jin's doing

246
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,860
She would have precisely measured the dose

247
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,070
Asphyxiation could also be intentional murder

248
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,229
Just suspect the victim's wife and start investigating

249
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,330
We confirmed the dashcam of Mr. Choi's wife

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,980
She found the body after returning home from grocery shopping

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,500
And then immediately called the police

252
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,840
Considering the timeline, it's impossible

253
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,780
Could it be that the wife killed her husband beforehand

254
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,420
Then went grocery shopping?

255
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,100
We found out that while the wife was at the supermarket

256
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,480
Mr. Choi had a phone call with his daughter in Seoul

257
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,610
Okay, Ji-woo

258
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,400
Go to kindergarten and have a good time

259
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,410
Listen to your grandma

260
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Live well

261
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,810
While the wife was in the supermarket

262
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,830
Mr. Choi was certainly alive

263
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,250
You'll see once you watch it

264
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,339
The forensic team believes multiple organ failure

265
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,680
-=Multiple organ failure: refers to the condition where multiple organs function poorly or lose function=-

266
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,540
Causing breathing difficulties was the main cause of death

267
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,260
Unfortunately, in this case of Mr. Choi's death

268
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:43,110
It's very hard to link it to Woo Soo-jin

269
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Release the person

270
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,799
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

271
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,150
I was wrong. Sorry.

272
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,630
Sorry.

273
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,040
Who are you acting cute for?

274
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,020
Are you crazy?

275
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,830
Because the items sent to Japan were seized by the police.

276
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,710
So there's no choice but to accept.

277
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,419
Tell your guys under you.

278
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,470
We need to assess what those items are.

279
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,098
Just because the police give them to us.

280
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,780
Doesn't mean we should act like beggars and take them.

281
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,369
We shouldn't accept everything without discernment.

282
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,800
Okay, sorry.

283
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,339
If you know it's wrong, why do things you'll regret?

284
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,400
You are a representative, after all.

285
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,180
Manage your subordinates properly.

286
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,190
Bang

287
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,789
Bang bang bang

288
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,079
What are you doing? Seriously, what?

289
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,270
What are you looking at?

290
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,410
What are you staring at?

291
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,080
How did you handle it with Dr. Choi?

292
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,440
He insisted he saw the seal broken and diluted with water.

293
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,520
So I gave him a new bottle.

294
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,780
Judging by how that guy knew the item's condition,

295
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,200
It shouldn't end so simply.

296
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,230
Feels like he let it go himself.

297
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,370
Look at this kid.

298
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,640
Who is he helping to let go?

299
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,320
He's doing illegal surgeries, what could happen?

300
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
You fool.

301
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,970
Surgical Pavulon

302
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,699
When there’s so much cheap propofol readily available

303
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
At least Dr. Choi pays for his meds on time

304
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,700
And he doesn’t haggle over prices

305
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
From now on

306
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,910
Don’t deal with him anymore

307
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,180
How strong is your connection

308
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,440
To care for a cellmate like this?

309
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,400
What’s your relationship?

310
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,130
If he contacts you again, firmly refuse

311
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,520
Absolutely do not sell my stuff to him

312
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Do you understand?

313
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,520
Thank you

314
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,100
Dr. Yoo, you’re here

315
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,810
What are you doing here?

316
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,840
Wait for me

317
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Hello

318
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,270
Didn't you ask me to think about what I really want to do?

319
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,220
I’ve thought it over carefully

320
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,500
I want to organize my surroundings

321
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:27,000
And I won’t need these things soon

322
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,220
I want to share them with those who need them

323
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,860
It won’t happen immediately

324
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,970
Plus, my friend needs to find a suitable place for you

325
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,430
We also need to adjust the schedule with other patients

326
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,850
It might take some time

327
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Okay

328
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,970
Just agreeing is enough

329
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,360
For me to keep going

330
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,950
As long as it’s not too late

331
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,710
Thank you

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
-Follow me -Okay

333
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,730
He couldn't breathe because the tube was blocked

334
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,310
I've performed a tracheotomy

335
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,580
If you suction here, breathing will be smoother

336
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,890
-Suction: To draw out mucus or blood to aid patient's breathing.-

337
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,330
Finally relieved

338
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,850
Sir, you're okay now

339
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,620
Thank you, Dr. Yu

340
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,160
Without a resident doctor

341
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,710
This kind of thing happens often

342
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,249
The nuns were so flustered

343
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,709
Today wasn't even the day for volunteer work

344
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,360
But I just called you anyway

345
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,100
I was coming over to bring you something

346
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,070
Please accept it, it's a donation

347
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,040
You're doing it again

348
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,380
I'll accept it gratefully

349
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,830
I'm doing this for my own peace of mind

350
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,480
It's my personal reason, so don't feel burdened

351
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,920
Really? Then I'll just nod my head like this from now on

352
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,950
Thanks

353
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
I'm off tomorrow

354
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,749
Since I'm here, I'll check on other patients too

355
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,970
Great, that would be perfect

356
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,950
But what should I do

357
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,000
A guest is here downstairs to see me

358
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,730
Don't worry, I'll figure it out myself

359
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
I should have helped you

360
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,770
But I haven't seen this friend in a long time either

361
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,300
He lives in the nursery where I used to work

362
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,720
It's been a long time since he visited me

363
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,630
I'm very happy

364
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,300
He's gotten more handsome

365
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,750
Tall and good-looking

366
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,230
Is the person you're talking about Hyun Woo?

367
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,630
Yes, it's Hyun Woo

368
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,450
How do you know Hyun Woo?

369
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,550
He previously came to our hospital for treatment

370
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Really?

371
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,030
That's quite a coincidence

372
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,860
I'll be on my way then

373
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
But

374
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,370
Is Hyun Woo sick?

375
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,390
Just a minor illness

376
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,770
You should hurry down, he's waiting for you

377
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Okay

378
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,830
Thank you

379
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,230
-=Lee Ji-young, hello. I'm contacting you to confirm if you're the Lee Ji-young I know
Do you know Zhao Soo-young from the class of 2000?=-

380
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,430
My eyes hurt so much

381
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,950
Why is Soo-young's mom's name so common?

382
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,130
There are so many people named Lee Ji-young

383
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,760
How am I supposed to find Soo-young's mom?

384
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,290
Why are you sitting here?

385
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,330
Does it hurt a lot?

386
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,500
No, it doesn't hurt now

387
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,400
When I was walking down, my vision suddenly blurred

388
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,770
This happens a lot lately

389
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,690
It's because the tumor is pressing on the optic nerve

390
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,700
I heard the doctor say so

391
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,350
My vision will keep getting worse

392
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,350
You go ahead

393
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,950
I need a little more time to recover

394
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
I'll go down with you

395
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,250
I know you don't like relying on others

396
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,340
I'm quite similar to you

397
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,480
Come down with me

398
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,840
Why do you

399
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,770
do this kind of thing

400
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,490
Helping people who are near death

401
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,470
I believe people should have the right

402
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,570
to choose between life and death

403
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,140
Choosing death is not a crime

404
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,370
We help them spend their last moments

405
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,570
where they want to be

406
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,220
If you remember your happiest place

407
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,720
get in touch with me

408
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,570
I will

409
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,120
Wow this this

410
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,319
-Bang bang bang bang -Don't do that

411
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,489
-No no -Okay okay

412
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,490
Don't open it

413
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,490
But your father bought you such an expensive motorcycle?

414
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,240
-Then your father... -Ah

415
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,720
-Sorry sorry -No way

416
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,570
Seems like your father has deep regrets towards you

417
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,620
You guys should have a good talk and reconcile

418
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,620
Hey

419
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,770
This is my memorial picture

420
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,790
Even though I was the one who suggested taking it first

421
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,939
But who would want to wear a school uniform for a memorial photo?

422
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,540
Yeah, your school's uniform is indeed quite ugly.

423
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,189
Some kids might transfer because they don't want to wear that uniform.

424
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,190
Right?

425
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,719
If that's the case,

426
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,390
might as well use the student ID photo as the memorial picture.

427
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,370
My father, well,

428
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,439
he insists on making decisions about everything.

429
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,089
Why didn't you say anything when you were taking the photo?

430
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,490
Wanted to wear something else for the photo.

431
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,119
Once, I secretly rode a motorcycle

432
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,070
and broke my leg, ending up in the hospital.

433
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,040
When my father arrived at the hospital,

434
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,520
Yeah, your father really went overboard, didn't he?

435
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,319
He beat me up many times for riding motorcycles before.

436
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,870
Now that I'm dying,

437
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,319
he suddenly bought me such an expensive motorcycle.

438
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,889
But you really like that bike,

439
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,270
that's why you took it out, right?

440
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,889
That motorcycle has always been my dream.

441
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,270
That's why I accepted it.

442
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,220
I really wanted to ride.

443
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,590
But after getting sick, even riding a motorcycle isn't fun anymore.

444
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,040
So I got angrier.

445
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,790
Why buy it for me only now?

446
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,590
Anyway, I can't ride it now.

447
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,820
So did you suddenly start thinking about suicide?

448
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,519
Without discussing it with your father?

449
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,270
Didn't your father say to follow my wishes?

450
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,669
But you should at least inform him, right?

451
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,869
You just left like that. How hurt he must be.

452
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,019
Can't you just let me

453
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,719
go peacefully?

454
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,790
Mister, do you have a good relationship with your father?

455
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,840
Just agree with him.

456
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:05,539
I won't force you to reconcile with your father.

457
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,219
But don't you have any regrets?

458
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,840
Nothing weighing on your mind

459
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,520
or things to settle?

460
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,190
Is it really okay to leave like this?

461
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,919
Though dying without ever dating a girl

462
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,840
is a bit regrettable.

463
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:18,970
Wait, hold on.

464
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,570
You have no experience at all?

465
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,340
Like kissing or...

466
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,039
So, up till now,

467
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,140
you've only used your mouth for eating and talking, never anything else?

468
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,069
Though I do have someone I'd like to date.

469
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,470
- Aren't people your age different? - Hey, hey.

470
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,739
Can't let him go.

471
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,519
He can't die. He said he's a virgin.

472
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,569
How can we just send off a child like this?

473
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,069
I absolutely won't allow it.

474
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,870
His resentment is too deep.

475
00:29:44,871 --> 00:29:47,069
He'll appear in my dreams the next day after death.

476
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,490
So what can we do?

477
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,719
I don't even have time to confess anymore.

478
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,020
How is there no time?

479
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,440
As long as you express your feelings, you and that person now

480
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,570
can do anything except marriage.

481
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,090
-That's not possible -Why not

482
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,070
Women...

483
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,720
All have a maternal instinct

484
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
She...

485
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,239
She was my college classmate

486
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,339
She also stuck with me because of her maternal instinct

487
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,220
Almost...

488
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,169
-Like a mother to me -Mother

489
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,170
Just like my mom

490
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,819
Hey, what are you planning to do

491
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,020
This matter should be left to the experts

492
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
You go ahead

493
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,420
Go where

494
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:29,819
Call that person right now

495
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,589
Just tell them your current situation without embellishing

496
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,940
Then say you like her

497
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,920
And you want to see her before you die

498
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,020
Will she really come out

499
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,190
Don't doubt it

500
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,669
Afterwards, if you feel some curiosity as a man

501
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:44,969
Contact me immediately

502
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,670
Whether you need medicine or advice, I can help you

503
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,620
Can't you come with me directly

504
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,889
-Really? -Yeah

505
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,890
Let's go

506
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,720
-=Zhao Xianyuan, I want to go somewhere with you, doctor=-
I want to go somewhere with you, doctor

507
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
Before becoming an independent adult

508
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,920
I lived at this care home

509
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,220
While living here

510
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,090
Were you happy?

511
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,740
The first time I moved out of here

512
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,120
I moved into a dormitory

513
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,520
At night, I lay down hoping to fall asleep

514
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,290
But it was too quiet all around

515
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,890
It felt strange

516
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,070
I was left all alone

517
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,290
When I lived in the foster home

518
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,790
I wasn't lonely at all

519
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,290
I started having such thoughts

520
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,920
You remind me to think of the happiest place

521
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,220
I can't come up with an answer

522
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,669
But as a child

523
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:32,940
I lived nearby with my parents

524
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,739
It's about to be redeveloped

525
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,090
There are many vacant houses

526
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,470
I think I could rent one for a month

527
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,470
Do you want to hold it there?

528
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,689
Hey, hey, you should've mentioned it earlier

529
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,920
She might have evening classes

530
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,070
Didn't I already say it?

531
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,190
Hye-jung is different from me

532
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,870
She's excellent at studying and drawing

533
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:07,070
Unlike me, she has many things she wishes to do

534
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,420
But it's not so easily achievable

535
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:14,019
Perhaps when you argued with her before

536
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,920
Did you make a big mistake?

537
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,740
Well, not really

538
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,040
We've been friends since childhood

539
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,190
She told me not to hang out with those people

540
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,690
That's where the conflict began

541
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,089
She did the right thing.

542
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,939
No, you should just confess directly.

543
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,289
She definitely doesn't know I like her.

544
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,789
She must be speechless.

545
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,219
Suddenly confessing right before dying.

546
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,440
Aren't you going to try before deciding to die...

547
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,820
And leave?

548
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,190
Aren't you?

549
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,239
I'm well experienced in unrequited love, so I understand.

550
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,940
Soo-young, Soo-young.

551
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,219
Confessing is all about timing.

552
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,519
Timing is really important for confessing.

553
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,490
Uncle, you like that doctor lady, don't you?

554
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,670
I missed the chance to confess.

555
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,870
Ugh, seriously, why do I tell you everything?

556
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,889
When does the evening class end?

557
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,289
I'm so sick of it, it's driving me crazy.

558
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,720
Honestly.

559
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,139
Talking about death in front of a dying person.

560
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,039
Sorry, sorry.

561
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,340
I was too reckless, sorry.

562
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,988
She came out.

563
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,090
It's Hye-jing.

564
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,989
Where?

565
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,289
Who is it, who is it?

566
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,190
Over there, there.

567
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,690
The person pushing the wheelchair.

568
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:35,690
What?

569
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
Hey.

570
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:40,120
You.

571
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,370
You've got a great eye.

572
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:49,969
Since elementary school, Hye-jin has been pushing that friend's wheelchair.

573
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,969
Pretty cool, right?

574
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,139
I totally agree.

575
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,190
Hey.

576
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,719
It's not that you lack ability.

577
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,340
You just have high standards.

578
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,420
If that's the reason,

579
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:05,240
I fully understand why you've been single since birth.

580
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,819
So kind-hearted.

581
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,090
Where is she going?

582
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,570
Hey.

583
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,540
She just left.

584
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,739
Hey, hey, Soo-young.

585
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,140
We need to stop her.

586
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Soo-young.

587
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,540
- Soo-young, Soo-young - Wait.

588
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,820
- Hey - Wait.

589
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,670
Don't you miss your mom?

590
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,090
You won't find her.

591
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,790
She hates dad so much, she's just hiding.

592
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,240
Do you want me to help look?

593
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,870
Forget it.

594
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,790
I separated when I was very young, I don't remember her.

595
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:25,230
This is the only place open at this hour.

596
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,429
I don't mind,

597
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,460
but Dr. Woo, you...

598
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,930
Come, please enjoy.

599
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,310
If it's not enough, just call me.

600
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Okay.

601
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,410
It's great, and the food is delicious.

602
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
That's good.

603
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,460
This is the first time I've seen you smile.

604
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,430
Ah...

605
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,680
It's almost over when you least expect it.

606
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,330
I feel a lot more at ease now.

607
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,159
If your headache gets worse, let me know anytime.

608
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,260
Don't just endure it.

609
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,730
Okay.

610
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,080
I'm reviewing the information.

611
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,210
From new drugs to clinical trials.

612
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,830
You've tried everything there is.

613
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,440
You've worked so hard to keep living.

614
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,650
Why suddenly consider euthanasia?

615
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,070
Because I've tried everything.

616
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:36,700
Even though I've tried, nothing has changed.

617
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
It's precisely because I've done it all.

618
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,190
That I can let go.

619
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,990
Thank you.

620
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,800
Eat quickly.

621
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,569
Take a careful look.

622
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,029
There should be meaningful clinical trial results, right?

623
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,050
Give up.

624
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,620
You've seen all the data and done everything you could.

625
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,630
Besides, didn't you agree to help Zhao Hyun-woo?

626
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,070
Giving up shouldn't be his personal choice.

627
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,350
It's because there's no other way.

628
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,960
Isn't it you who shouldn't give up?

629
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,200
I know you feel sorry for Zhao Hyun-woo, so you're really concerned.

630
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,660
Just see him off.

631
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,060
His will to survive is stronger than anyone else's.

632
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,020
It's not the first time you misunderstood a patient's intentions.

633
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,180
-=Brain Tumor=-

634
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,049
Yes, Jo Hyun-woo.

635
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,109
He underwent chemotherapy and clinical trials with us.

636
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,030
You know the process.

637
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,239
It didn't slow the progression.

638
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,360
The last treatment was three months ago, right?

639
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,379
Wasn't there any new therapy to try during this period?

640
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,700
Even one that's still in research.

641
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,959
-=Name: Jo Hyun-woo=-

642
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,170
Stay for a month first.

643
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,220
Let me know if you want to continue staying.

644
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,170
You'll realize it's great after a while.

645
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,900
That's fine, right?

646
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
Yeah.

647
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,289
-It's really delicious. -Yeah.

648
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:47,739
Did you take leave yesterday because of this?

649
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,650
Oh, yes.

650
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,870
This food has the perfect temperature.

651
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,859
I cooked it at home to ensure you can eat before leaving work.

652
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,060
Timed it perfectly to bring it from home.

653
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,660
Oh, by the way.

654
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,319
These sweet potatoes were bought for me from Gangwon-do by Dr. Woo.

655
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,270
-Ah, thank you. -Thanks for the treat.

656
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,010
Oh, it really reminds me of my childhood.

657
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,149
After eating the steamed sweet potatoes from grandma.

658
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,700
If barley rice was cooked that night, we'd mix it together.

659
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,750
Oh, by the way.

660
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,159
It's almost lunchtime.

661
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,989
Let's go have barley rice together.

662
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,939
-Sure -Okay

663
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,309
I'll treat.

664
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,120
-Let's all go together -Alright

665
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,050
I...

666
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,629
Don't tell me you're going to say you won't join us.

667
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,880
I have some urgent personal matters to handle.

668
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,809
I steamed so many sweet potatoes, my arm's about to break.

669
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,430
Are you really going to do this?

670
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,639
I want you to become the head of emergency medicine.

671
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,640
I want to be the head nurse.

672
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,179
If you don't cooperate like this,

673
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,690
we'll really be like pigs during the monsoon season.

674
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,260
Pigs during the monsoon season?

675
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,810
Didn't you watch the weather news?

676
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,569
Swept away by the monsoon waters.

677
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:56,650
Not knowing where we'll drift, always flowing downstream like pigs.

678
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,829
Pigs and dogs are different, short legs.

679
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,099
So they're not good at swimming.

680
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,770
They can only go with the flow downstream.

681
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,230
Simply put,

682
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,300
if this continues, you and I

683
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,290
will not only fail to get promoted but will be marginalized by the hospital.

684
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,519
It's almost time for the personnel changes.

685
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,870
Please, help me for a few hours.

686
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,410
Okay?

687
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,639
Hmm. Did you find the paper I asked for?

688
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,530
There's no paper, but there's a clinical trial.

689
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,380
It's a study being conducted in the United States seeking volunteers.

690
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,720
I think it seems quite feasible.

691
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,010
Really?

692
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,119
What experiment? When will it start?

693
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,019
Because of security issues, I can't send emails.

694
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,370
If you drop by, I can show you the information sent from over there.

695
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,720
Got it. I'm heading to the research institute now.

696
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,460
What?

697
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,109
Sorry, I have an urgent matter. Take your time eating.

698
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,800
Sorry.

699
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:51,409
-No, Dr. Yu -Dr. Yu

700
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,410
No...

701
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:01,690
Hmm
Where are you now?

702
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,890
I just signed the contract for the house.

703
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,000
Let me come over and find you.

704
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,680
Where are we going now?

705
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,400
The person in charge of the clinical trial you applied for is someone I know.

706
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:26,870
Sorry.

707
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:29,880
I also got a call suddenly, so I didn't have time to tell you.

708
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:33,280
America is recruiting new clinical trial volunteers.

709
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,829
Treatment expenses are free.

710
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,240
I can cover your stay expenses in America.

711
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,939
So let's go listen together.

712
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,129
Do you want me to go through it again?

713
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,820
This time it's feasible.

714
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,119
The first trial yielded meaningful results...

715
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,730
But it couldn't eliminate the tumor and only harmed my body.

716
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,400
The tumor is the only thing unscathed in my entire body.

717
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
I know.

718
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,109
But all the efforts so far haven't gone to waste, have they?

719
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:55,690
-Let's try one last time... -Stop talking.

720
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,590
Stop talking.

721
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,789
You know very well how much I'm suffering.

722
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,840
How can you suggest that so easily?

723
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,740
I guess I misjudged you.

724
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,110
- Stop the car - It's not...

725
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,620
I know you're hurting, but please reconsider.

726
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,640
You're just like the other doctors.

727
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,389
Saying you understand.

728
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,090
But you don't really care how much pain
or discomfort the patients are in.

729
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,030
I'll sort out my life myself.

730
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,570
Let's end the consultation here.

731
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,890
You did all those clinical trials just to survive.

732
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,789
Why suddenly give up everything now?

733
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,320
I used to really want to live.

734
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,590
But not anymore.

735
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,040
I bought some porridge.

736
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,320
Get up and eat a little.

737
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,060
I'm very sleepy.

738
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,220
I'll eat later.

739
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,639
-=Emergency Room=-

740
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,370
The call you made is not being answered.

741
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,245
Dr. Yoo, it's a patient from a traffic accident.

742
00:46:50,246 --> 00:46:51,929
-=Traffic Accident=-

743
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,269
Another delivery motorcycle.

744
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,330
Was already dead on arrival.

745
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:55,959
-=Dead on Arrival=-
Performed CPR for half an hour just in case.

746
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,260
-=CPR=-
But there was no change.

747
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,670
Patient Kim Hyun-joon.

748
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:34,490
Died at 20:32.

749
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,450
When Jo Hyun-woo entered the emergency room,

750
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,890
the guardian listed was the delivery company's boss.

751
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,310
-=Delicious Food from the Republic of Korea - The Delivery Brothers=-

752
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,469
He just called to say he's quitting.

753
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,610
I have the address he filled out when he started working.

754
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,910
Not sure if he still lives there.

755
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:06,730
Oh, he disappeared without a word.

756
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,530
I'll keep the room reserved for now.

757
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,820
Is there anything you need?

758
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,920
Come in.

759
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:54,710
-=Allergic Reaction=-

760
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,980
Ah, I remember this person.

761
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,110
He came because of a sudden fever.

762
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,210
But he had an allergic reaction.

763
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:03,660
So he can't take antipyretic analgesics
- =Antipyretic Analgesics=-

764
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,190
He needs anti-inflammatory analgesics
- =Anti-inflammatory Analgesics=-

765
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,100
Few customers give such detailed information, so I remember.

766
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,800
You mean the person delivering on a motorcycle, right?

767
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:15,980
Yes.

768
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:18,240
That person just bought painkillers here.

769
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:46,760
What did you eat?

770
00:49:46,761 --> 00:49:48,559
Today? Not much of anything since I have no appetite.

771
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,930
Come on, you should eat something even without an appetite.

772
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,930
Oh, hello!

773
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,559
Do you have something to keep bangs in place?

774
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,709
Something to prevent them from falling?

775
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:00,710
Bangs?

776
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,190
Let me check. Ah,

777
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,510
This one is the best seller.

778
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,999
Oh, it's really nice.

779
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,130
Is it a gift for your girlfriend?

780
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,620
Oh, it's nice.

781
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:14,710
Come on again

782
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,600
Even if you're uncomfortable, bear with it

783
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,670
If you can't close your eyes

784
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,940
It could lead to vision problems

785
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
In that case

786
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,580
After regaining consciousness

787
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,359
It won't cause vision loss

788
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,070
You'll be able to see comfortably

789
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,400
Okay, good night

790
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,900
See you tomorrow

791
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,620
Dr. Yu

792
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,190
Do you know how Hyun-Woo has been lately?

793
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,140
How he's been doing?

794
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:10,820
Do you know he's sick?

795
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,240
It's not a terminal illness, right?

796
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:23,240
It's a brain tumor

797
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,820
The situation isn't good

798
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:33,360
Being young, I thought he'd be okay

799
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:39,730
Do you know where Hyun-Woo lives?

800
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,130
I can't reach him now either

801
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:45,730
Please help me find out

802
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,240
Living alone is dangerous for him

803
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:51,210
Okay, understood

804
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,540
Help me calculate the overdue rent

805
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,180
Throw away what's inside

806
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:06,959
Ah, but really

807
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,370
A few days late and there would have been big trouble

808
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,869
It's obvious he's the one living here

809
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,640
Owing debts and running from collectors

810
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,160
Someone also came looking for him not long ago

811
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,290
Exceptionally beautiful

812
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,159
A woman who's both beautiful and elegant

813
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,740
How did she find a place like this

814
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,010
Excuse me

815
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,640
Is it this woman

816
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,830
Yes, that's right, it's her

817
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,080
Look, isn't she beautiful

818
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,350
Her face is indeed very beautiful

819
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,459
That's enough

820
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,460
Let go of me

821
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,590
Here, here, no

822
00:52:50,591 --> 00:52:52,289
-Move aside -There's nobody here

823
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,260
Hey, I'm talking to you

824
00:52:53,261 --> 00:52:54,289
Don't do that, sir

825
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,689
This area is only for long-term patients, hurry up and leave

826
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:57,189
Get out of my way

827
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:59,690
-Take them all down -Leave now

828
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,939
You can't come in here

829
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,940
Please leave

830
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:07,939
Where is that woman, where

831
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,860
Ah, really

832
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:10,770
-You can't do this -Where did you hide her

833
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,270
Ah, really

834
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:14,830
You can't do this

835
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:17,310
Where is that woman

836
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:22,899
Ah, so she's here

837
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,989
Come over

838
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:25,969
-Ah, let go of me -Come over

839
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:30,150
-Honey, I'm sorry -Get over here

840
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,640
You're finished

841
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,880
Doctor, mind your own business

842
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,330
Get away from me

843
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,230
Dr. Yu, get out

844
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,880
Get out, hurry up

845
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,520
- Get out - Let go of me

846
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:53,490
Hey

847
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:54,630
Let's go down together

848
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,630
Hey, hey

849
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,010
Let's all die today

850
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,870
A fight to the death

851
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,200
Let's all die

852
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,490
Let's all die today

853
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:05,000
You're dead today

854
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,860
Let go of me
What the hell

855
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:10,360
Doctor, step aside

856
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,869
Honey, I was wrong

857
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:18,179
- Let's all die - Honey

858
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,560
I was wrong

859
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,790
- Come out - What are you doing

860
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,229
It's my wife, can't I hit her?

861
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,929
- Quiet down, quiet down - Seriously

862
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,289
Let's talk at the station

863
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:40,490
- Quiet down - Got it

864
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,050
- Father, go to the police station - Okay, I will go, alright

865
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:45,990
I'll head over first, yeah

866
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,170
Return to your rooms, it's okay

867
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,200
Are you working again?

868
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,350
Yes

869
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,020
Because I need to earn money

870
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,630
I went to the place where you used to live

871
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:19,330
I moved.

872
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,889
Because I'm spending more time lying down.

873
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:23,840
So I felt it wasn't necessary to live in Seoul.

874
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,880
But I still wanted to come and see this place.

875
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:33,680
I'm sorry about last time.

876
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,520
I decided to start treatment again without your consent.

877
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,730
That was my fault.

878
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:42,840
No, it was me.

879
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,080
Being too sensitive.

880
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,860
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped at you.

881
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:50,470
Thank you for today.

882
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,550
But

883
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,440
Don't interfere in such dangerous things again.

884
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,730
Will I have a next time?

885
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:04,970
With this kind of thing,

886
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,430
people like me should step in.

887
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Because your hair looked uncomfortable.

888
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:23,680
It's not anything expensive.

889
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,180
It's just...

890
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,540
I saw it on my way delivering, so I bought this.

891
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:30,630
Take it.

892
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:32,650
Thank you.

893
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:43,960
Do you want

894
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:50,410
to end like this?

895
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:53,700
I still

896
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:56,520
don't meet your standards, do I?

897
00:56:57,950 --> 00:56:59,810
No.

898
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,190
You perfectly meet the consultation standards.

899
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:08,720
After diagnosis by more than three doctors.

900
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,899
Diagnosed by more than three doctors

901
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,130
Declared untreatable

902
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:17,560
And enduring unbearable

903
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:20,260
physical and mental agony

904
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,550
Pain that medication can't alleviate

905
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,100
But why the hesitation

906
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,490
Why hesitate

907
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:34,780
These data

908
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,360
say you will die

909
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,700
but I hope you live

910
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,760
I know very well these data reveal

911
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,880
terrifying truths

912
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,570
Yet, I still hope you live on

913
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:19,580
Uh

914
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:20,590
Hey, Hyun-woo

915
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,679
Hey, Cho Hyun-woo

916
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,820
Ah, sorry

917
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
Cho Hyun-woo

918
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,320
-=Doctor of Death Mary=-

919
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,459
Choi Kang-yoon's wife came to see me

920
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:44,950
What

921
00:59:44,951 --> 00:59:47,900
Be careful for a while, there's only one dose left

922
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,699
If she brings the medicine over

923
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,440
Ask first about the euthanasia procedure

924
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,269
Hyun-woo, who was hospitalised in hospice care, is missing

925
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,589
I just want to die today

926
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,040
Urgently need Bavron

927
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:03,509
I want to personally see Hyun-woo off

928
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,289
Right, you two need to say your final goodbyes

929
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,770
I'll make sure you get to the place you want to be

930
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,450
What should we do first?
