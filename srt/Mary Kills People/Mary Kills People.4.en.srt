2
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,770
Thank you for taking care of Soo-young in her final journey.

3
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,120
I was just doing what was right.

4
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,440
Was there really nothing going on between you and Representative Koo?

5
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,470
It was all my fault.

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,690
I trusted that man too much.

7
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,520
Never mind, as long as you came back safe.

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
Take it off.

9
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,440
Since we're making a deal,

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,940
we should build trust first, right?

11
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,340
Isn't that correct?

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,490
Just take off your shirt; keep the bra on.

13
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,570
Fine, if you're unwilling.

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,420
This time, it's not a blank.

15
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,070
Don't you need Bavlun?

16
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,340
Are you really going to walk away like this?

17
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,390
Come on, take it off.

18
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
What's going on?

19
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,590
Why is it so clean?

20
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,170
You really don't do drugs, huh?

21
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,670
Satisfied now?

22
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,320
How could I be satisfied?

23
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,270
Take a commemorative photo.

24
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,140
Say cheese.

25
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,370
You two have my stuff

26
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,439
and are messing around with it.

27
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,220
I'll give you a chance to explain later.

28
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Look forward to it.

Are you sure?

32
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,440
Hyun-woo, have a drink too.

33
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,870
Relax first before you talk.

34
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,340
What you’re doing now

35
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,940
Stop it, that's crazy.

36
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,590
What’s happened to you?

37
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,820
Does it not matter if you lie to achieve your goals?

38
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,990
Come clean and stop now.

39
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,520
I never thought helping patients with consulting could become a crime.

40
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,520
What you’re doing now is murder.

41
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,469
How long do you think you can keep hiding?

42
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,540
As long as people like you are investigating me, I can keep evading.

43
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,340
I will definitely catch you.

44
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,370
You’ll never catch me.

45
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,390
Because I haven't committed any crime.

46
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,839
There are dissatisfied patients protesting about their treatment.

47
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,290
Their attitude is quite intense.

48
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,920
Please handle it quickly.

49
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,590
Okay.

50
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,720
Stop.

51
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Bro.

52
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,090
Oh dear.

53
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,590
You’re still the same.

54
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,140
Hey, Joo Soo-young.

55
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,520
Did you arrive safely?

56
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,240
Did you meet Grandma?

57
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,670
Hey, I miss you so much.

58
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,790
Bro, why did you drink so much?

59
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,890
I drank too much because I miss you a lot.

60
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,440
Stop making excuses.

61
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:47,940
What excuse

62
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,170
Me

63
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,340
I really, really miss you...

64
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420

65
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320

66
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,769
Get up, wake up, found a job

67
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,770
What the heck

68
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,470
Pavlon supplier Kim Shi-kyun

69
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,840
Tried smuggling at Incheon yesterday, captured by our unit

70
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,589
He was carrying a passport with Kim Shi-kyun's name

71
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,640
Could be an impersonator

72
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,290
Trying to pose as a big shot in that circle

73
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,120
Did you check the fingerprints?

74
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,420
Can't, fingerprints can't be confirmed

75
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,640
He destroyed them to hide his identity

76
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,275
Also, by eye inspection

77
00:07:31,276 --> 00:07:33,060
-=Confirmation Document Kim Shi-kyun=-
Age and appearance are very similar

78
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,920
Just like Kim Shi-kyun, he has a Virgin Mary tattoo on his right arm

79
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,519
The drug quantity he attempted to smuggle is enormous

80
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,440
Then no doubt it's him

81
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,170
He should be taken away by the special investigation team

82
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,190
Damn it

83
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,720
We need some time to interrogate him too

84
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,570
To uncover the connection between Choi Dae-hyun and Woo Soo-jung

85
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,870
That person is not Kim Shi-kyun

86
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,470
-What -Why How do you know? It's not examined yet

87
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,089
Kim Shi-kyun lost his front teeth and premolars due to drug use

88
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,330
-=Medical Record=-

89
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,290
But that person tried to bite his tongue to commit suicide, right?

90
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,090
That's because...

91
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,139
Hey, he's so rich, maybe he got false teeth recently.

92
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,320
If that were the case, the teeth would have fallen out when his mouth was blocked.

93
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
It's not this person.

94
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,220
No, I prepared really hard. Where are you going?

95
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,990
I didn't expect Jo Hyun-Woo to be a cop because the medical records were very clear.

96
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,240
Because those records indeed belonged to Jo Hyun-Woo's patient.

97
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,120
He mentioned Baek Hyun-Seung when he contacted, saying he was introduced by him.

98
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,370
The son of that councilor?

99
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,789
Turns out he's the link.

100
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,040
That means he's aware of me too.

101
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,490
If the police come to investigate,

102
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,920
just say you've given him consultations.

103
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
I prepared for such a situation by taking hospice care education and got certified for it.

104
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,220
The police have already caught up.

105
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,820
Destroy all the documents.

106
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,070
We'll stop operations temporarily, and also

107
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,570
go volunteer at the hospital I mentioned before.

108
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,870
Alright.

109
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,070
Go seize and search the Bon City Hospital.

110
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,269
Still haven't found evidence related to Choi Gang-Yun.

111
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,870
Get a search warrant using other charges.

112
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,520
Last month, in the case involving the representative of the construction company due to propofol dosage,

113
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,790
Doctors at Bon City Hospital said the records were lost.

114
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,870
Go in under the pretext of violating medical law.

115
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,420
Claim it's illegal medication use.

116
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,440
Evidence related to Choi Gang-Yun,

117
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,670
go inside and find it for me.

118
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,120
This group of idiots.

119
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,470
Do-Kun.

120
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,440
If you're so sleepy, just go rest in the duty room for a while.

121
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,870
Even if I'm exhausted, I won't take a nap.

122
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
At night, as soon as I switch beds,

123
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,990
I strangely can't sleep.

124
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,389
I'm as sensitive as your looks.

125
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,560
-=[Breaking News] International drug lord Kim captured=-
Seriously.

126
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,540
The media thought it was Kim Shi-jin, causing a stir.

127
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,069
The police urgently arrested him at Incheon Port.

128
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:05,020
The man in his forties, Kim Shi-jin, is known as one of Southeast Asia's top three drug lords.

129
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,419
Kim controlled Cambodia's drug factories

130
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,445
and dominated the domestic distribution network.

131
00:11:09,446 --> 00:11:11,430
-=After mastering the distribution network, became drug king K...=-

132
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:12,670
Swiftly became a bigshot in the drug world.

133
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,820
The police indicated that Kim used multiple aliases

134
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,019
and frequently changed residences domestically
- =Aliases, frequent address changes...investigation chaos=-

135
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,440
The investigation faced numerous challenges.

136
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,939
But the police received a decisive tip-off that Kim planned to flee overseas.

137
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,989
He was urgently captured at Incheon Port.

138
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,019
Slept soundly.

139
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,469
Kim was preparing to smuggle himself into China.

140
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,119
Despite Kim's refusal to confess and exercising the right to remain silent, said the police,

141
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,270
Understandably, he hadn't slept for three days.

142
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,620
-Let him lie down to sleep -Let's step outside.

143
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,259
How would a bigshot like Kim Shi-jin

144
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,420
keep dealing with a doctor like Choi Da-hyun?

145
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,420
Even if they're prison mates, it makes sense?

146
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,740
Because Kim Shi-jin often went to jail for drugs.

147
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,240
No family visited him.

148
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,340
No one gave him pocket money.

149
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,340
But I heard during that time Choi Da-hyun

150
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,240
was especially kind to him.

151
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,490
Being wealthy, he was generous to those around him.

152
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,240
That's how he won people over.

153
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,840
After his release from prison, he received a lot of financial help from Choi Da-hyun.

154
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,969
So when Kim Si-jin became a drug dealer,

155
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,090
he was repaying a favor.

156
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,990
He thought he was bringing him drugs for his own enjoyment.

157
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:30,090
Choi Da-hyun likely doesn't know that Kim Si-jin has become such a powerful drug lord.

158
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,420
If he knew, he wouldn't have made deals with him.

159
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,970
Because the chase would be much stricter.

160
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,319
The suspect earlier was caught

161
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,470
with a large amount of drugs while preparing to escape, right?

162
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,090
He assumed an identity for drug collection purposes.

163
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,790
Let's check the purchasing list for Bavlon.

164
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,270
That should lead us to Kim Si-jin, right?

165
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,190
You didn't purchase from the real Kim Si-jin, what will you do?

166
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,240
Bavlon isn't particularly popular.

167
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,840
Among the buyers,

168
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,470
there's bound to be someone who's dealt with Kim Si-jin before.

169
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,709
If we carefully investigate the drug distribution personnel,

170
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,250
can we find other buyers?

171
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,460
Hello?

172
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,090
Deploy immediately.

173
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,230
Go to Bonseong Hospital.

174
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,010
The search and seizure warrant has been issued.

175
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,490
-It hurts a lot. -Be gentle, please.

176
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
It hurts so much.

177
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,060

178
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780

Do you need something?

179
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,430
You can't just enter the emergency room.

180
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,650
We're from the Investigation Team.

181
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,960
Due to violations of drug regulations, conducting a search and seizure

182
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,110
If you refuse

183
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,150
You might be charged with obstruction of justice and arrested

184
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,430
Let's begin

185
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,620
You can't just come in here

186
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,660
Wait until our hospital gets a lawyer before starting

187
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,340
Sure, go ahead

188
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,300
- Make the call - Okay

189
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,150
We are currently treating a patient here

190
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,300
Please be gentle, don't disrupt the treatment

191
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,860
Alright

192
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,910
Let's begin

193
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,120
Because that detective was right in front of us and missed it

194
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,440
He will definitely target us openly

195
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,400
What we are doing will be paused for a while

196
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,520
If there are any problematic drugs, throw them away

197
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Understood

198
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,200
By the way, can we be together?

199
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,490
It's undeniable that we often meet

200
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,020
Even if we're careful, evidence might still appear

201
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,079
We need to come up with a reason for frequent meetings

202
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Let's just start dating

203
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,040
No, I mean...

204
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,910
Let's pretend we're... dating

205
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,680
Love so deeply it's hard to part, missing each other

206
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,090
That's why we're always together

207
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,500
This way, there's no room for suspicion

208
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,209
We're at Father Yang's hospital

209
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,720
Reunited while doing volunteering activities

210
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,260
We've invited a resident doctor

211
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,450
His name is Dr. Choi Dae-hyun

212
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,210
Dr. Choi, may I ask what your baptismal name is?

213
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,179
He's not a believer

214
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,379
Then what is your specialty?

215
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,170
Emergency or internal medicine would be preferable

216
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,530
Plastic surgery

217
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,980
And I... I'm currently without a medical license

218
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,860
If you don't have a medical license

219
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,730
- Being a resident doctor might not be appropriate - Well

220
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,399
It won't be a problem in the future, right?

221
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
No, it won't

222
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,760
It won't be a problem

223
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,060
He's not a resident doctor

224
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,890
But a resident teacher

225
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,330
Caring for patients one by one while residing at the hospital

226
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,340
Exactly

227
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,700
A former doctor turned resident volunteer

228
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,000
That's good enough, isn't it?

229
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,540
I just don't have a medical license

230
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,320
I'm very good at caring for patients

231
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,899
But if he's wearing a lab coat

232
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,170
Saying he's just a volunteer seems a bit...

233
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,800
A bit inappropriate, right?

234
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,730
Take off the lab coat

235
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,460
Take it off

236
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,770
I only wore it because I felt a bit cold

237
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,390
Anyway, let's give him a round of applause to welcome him

238
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,070
It will be hard for us to contact each other in the future

239
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,069
If there's anything we need to share

240
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,660
We'll exchange messages volunteering at the priest's hospital

241
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,400
Alright

242
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,710
Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere else?

243
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,370
My shoulder and arm are both sore

244
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,380
Shoulder

245
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:45,910
Does it ache here?

246
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,930
Ow, you brat

247
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,630
I hurt too

248
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
-Are you okay? -It hurts a lot
I’m not okay

249
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,770
Besides, you'll see someone at the hospital

250
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,510
Nurse Choi Yi-na, who connects us with the patients

251
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,210
If evidence of drug trafficking is found

252
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,300
We'll say it's because of the patient violating drug control laws

253
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:08,930
After all, we have to deny the euthanasia issue

254
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,140
Yu-jung is asleep

255
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,630
-Honey -Hmm

256
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,199
No matter what others say

257
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,350
I think you're cute, I like you

258
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,390
Right?

259
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,719
Cuteness has no outlet

260
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,550
But only I can know your cuteness

261
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,500
Yeah

262
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,200
Why have you been so busy lately? Who have you been seeing?

263
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,030
Who else could it be?

264
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,810
Just my friends

265
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,300
Try meeting my brother more often

266
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:08,229
It's a family business after all, you're working too hard alone

267
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,860
You have to make an effort too, don't you?

268
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Right

269
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,270
But

270
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:18,410
When your brother was assembling the gun, he pointed the muzzle at me

271
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,430
So I don't dare to approach him...

272
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,500
He aimed at you, but he didn't shoot.

273
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,780
That's true.

274
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,080
Just think of it as him being friendly to you.

275
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,280
If he fired...

276
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,790
After all, it is a gun.

277
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,850
Stop hanging out with your troublemaking friends.

278
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,110
Spend more time with my brother.

279
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
Can you do that?

280
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,650
Yeah, alright.

281
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,990
ABGA: Arterial blood gas analysis, PH level: acidity
BST: blood sugar test

282
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,980
The PH value of ABGA is 7.1.

283
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,620
BST is over 500.

284
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,720
You can't treat diabetic ketoacidosis patients?

285
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:12,430
D.K.A: Diabetic ketoacidosis, an acute complication of diabetes,
caused by insufficient insulin secretion Gastric cancer: stomach cancer

286
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,730
What's the issue?

287
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,660
The issue is that he's in stage 4 stomach cancer.

288
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,800
But the patient refuses all other treatments.

289
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,860
Didn't I already get insulin?

290
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,180
I'll pay for this.

291
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,090
Stop stalling and let me go home.

292
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,850
For this patient...

293
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,220
You came to the hospital due to consciousness loss.

294
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,080
Diabetes might not be the core issue.

295
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,390
You need further exams.

296
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't have money.

297
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,230
You won't check me for free.

298
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,640
In your current state, passing out right after leaving the hospital...

299
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,610
Is not surprising.

300
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,780
I'm in the late stage of stomach cancer.

301
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,120
Even with treatment, he will die sooner or later.

302
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,859
You and I both know this, but why should I

303
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,110
It's a waste of money

304
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,430
I've already taken insulin.

305
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
I will pay this money

306
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,209
The inspection fee is not as much as you think

307
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,440
You have enough money now.

308
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,610
This money is all my assets

309
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,320
I want to leave this money to my children

310
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,079
Anyway, I have a terminal illness

311
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,610
And it can't be cured

312
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,790
Don't make me spend money

313
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,500
Prepare a voluntary discharge application

314
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:00,920
DAMA: Application for Voluntary Discharge

315
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,760
OK

316
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,530
Let's go

317
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Ms. Lee Yun-hee

318
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,950
Next time if you feel unwell again

319
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,730
You can go here to check it out

320
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,400
This is a hospital run by a priest
- =Maria Welfare Hospital=-

321
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,680
So it's free

322
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,670
Although I can't provide you with any great treatment

323
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:42,530
But it can help you in an emergency.

324
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,360
You must be in pain.

325
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,710
Children will also be affected by seeing you in pain

326
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,790
Enduring it is not a solution

327
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
Even for the children

328
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,580
Check it out before you get shocked.

329
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,510
Is it really free?

330
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,750
real

331
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,250
No fees will be charged under any circumstances

332
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,630
You can go without worry

333
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,360
Do you think helping others this way

334
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,710
will reduce your guilt?

335
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,720
It's okay

336
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,720
After all, you think I'm someone without guilt

337
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,740
Hmm

338
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,300
Has the Bafaloon for Dr. Choi arrived?

339
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,150
You've worked hard enough

340
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,410
There's not much left, just give it to him

341
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,849
Give whatever amount he asks for

342
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,910
Only a fool wouldn't sell it to him

343
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,950
Just give it

344
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
It's a pity

345
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,800
Kim Si-jin's biggest advantage is having no opinions of his own

346
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,220
I called him again

347
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,450
Don't accept anything from the police

348
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,470
And don't give the Bafaloon to Dr. Choi

349
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,130
That guy is something else

350
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,529
Is he mimicking me

351
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,660
or acting

352
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,560
or does he really think this business is his own?

353
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
What to do?

354
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,000
It's been a tough time

355
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,730
Alright

356
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,820
The investigation results for Kim Si-jin's identity theft are out

357
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,180
The drug purchase channels have also been investigated

358
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,670
All those connected to him have been arrested

359
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
The drugs

360
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,610
Has it been confirmed where the Bafaloon was bought from?

361
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,390
Almost finished confirming

362
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,630
But no connection with Jin Shijian

363
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,570
Seems like pretending to collect a large amount of drugs

364
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,730
Except for what the authorities have confirmed

365
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,790
Is there any overlooked part in the testimonies

366
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,610
Such as excluded evidence due to lack of conclusiveness

367
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,200
There is one

368
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,480
Go ahead

369
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,800
A drug courier said the drugs came from there

370
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,700
There's something unnoticed

371
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,380
Most expensive penthouse in Gangnam

372
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,740
A longtime drug courier gave a testimony

373
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,670
But didn't agree due to privacy concerns

374
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:28,180
Also said they want a search warrant for a confiscation

375
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,760
So we couldn't get the footage from the disaster prevention room

376
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,540
It's a headache if we find nothing

377
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,550
So it was ignored

378
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,240
Anyway, the suspect has already been found

379
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,350
I put some effort into my appearance

380
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
Really pretty

381
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,100
Thank you

382
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Thank you

383
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,760
You're so busy, yet you found time to come

384
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,620
I came during my lunch break

385
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,049
There's still someone who hasn't arrived

386
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,490
Okay, got it

387
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,890
Anyone else coming?

388
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,030
Yes

389
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:01,840
She just arrived

390
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
Here

391
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,460
Hello

392
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,750
I invited Sayan's aunt to come along too

393
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,139
After all, Sayan is a student leader at school

394
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,320
Isn't it strange if the student's parents don't attend the committee meeting?

395
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,860
-Hello -Hello

396
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,730
Who ordered the black bean sauce noodles?

397
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,430
The police

398
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,610
Hey

399
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,329
Does being a cop make you so great?

400
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,359
Why did you ride off on my e-bike?

401
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,260
Hey, you

402
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,060
Why didn't you give me a ride? Seriously

403
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,910
Hey

404
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,980
Why did you stop delivering drugs?

405
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,029
I already said it's because of burnout

406
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,429
You, talking about burnout

407
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,560
Give a proper excuse

408
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,109
Someone earning billions every month from drug deliveries

409
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,210
Suddenly starts delivering black bean sauce noodles with a metal box?

410
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,929
Why were you kicked out?

411
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,909
Who was kicked out?

412
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:58,910
Take your hand out of your pocket

413
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,510
I quit on my own

414
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,329
Every drug courier got caught

415
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,979
Who knows what might happen if I continued?

416
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,230
Your territory

417
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,960
Includes this penthouse too, right?

418
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,680
What happened there?

419
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,859
Nothing happened, no

420
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,159
Just rumors

421
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,110
-I'm going to deliver food now -You jerk

422
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,980
There was a delivery person who worked for a long time

423
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,429
That person went to the penthouse once

424
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,030
And said one sentence

425
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,810
Only that person was arrested

426
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,759
So who would dare to get involved there

427
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,010
-Only the delivery person was taken away -Which means

428
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,430
You have been there

429
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:51,830
Oh...

430
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,380
Is Yu-mei feeling better?

431
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,609
I saw her faint at the performance venue that day

432
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,810
I was really startled

433
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,010
She ate normally for a few days and is much better now

434
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,109
I heard Aunt Caiyan

435
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:13,810
Treated Yu-mei in the emergency room

436
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,930
What was her exact condition at that time?

437
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,559
Everyone is aware, right?

438
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,959
The reason was excessive dieting

439
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,510
Did she undergo all the tests?

440
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
No

441
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,760
There was no need for any tests

442
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,379
You seem to be suspicious if she accidentally ingested something

443
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,109
If she took drugs

444
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:36,260
Her pupils would definitely enlarge or shrink abnormally

445
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,459
But Yu-mei had no such symptoms at all

446
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,080
She recovered immediately when she got to the emergency room

447
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,009
Instead of doing unnecessary tests, wasting effort

448
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,779
I think letting her eat more is better

449
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,360
So we just sent her home

450
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,830
Because of dieting

451
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,010
She's practically malnourished.

452
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,609
Oh my gosh.

453
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:55,329
There's still malnutrition in this day and age?

454
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,609
Exactly.

455
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,430
I had no idea she wasn't even eating the school meals.

456
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:17,259
If you can earn a billion,

457
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,379
what's the point of working for us and those diligent cleaners?

458
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,179
And what's the meaning of work anyway?

459
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,260
-I can't even make 400 a month -That

460
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,080
-What's wrong with Jihoon? -What?

461
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,380
Which room did you visit?

462
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,459
I'm asking which room you came to.

463
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,180
Hey, hey, hey.

464
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,809
-Who are you? -Stop the car.

465
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,260
-Hurry, pull him down -Stop the car.

466
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,710
Stop the car.

467
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,680
-Hey -What's going on?

468
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,960
What are you doing, Jihoon?

469
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,910
What's wrong? Are you okay?

470
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,330
Someone seemed to leave here in a hurry today.

471
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,479
The police are tracking very closely.

472
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
I've decided to change my residence.

473
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,410
Isn't that a bit too hasty?

474
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,480
There's hardly anywhere to eat or stay here.

475
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,180
You'll know once you get inside.

476
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,310
Ah, here you go.

477
00:31:02,311 --> 00:31:04,560
Wow, this is really expensive.

478
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,180
Alright, alright.

479
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,259
Thank you.

480
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,030
I can't believe we can drink such good wine.

481
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,609
I've been too busy since I arrived, so we haven't had a proper meal together.

482
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,480
So I prepared some old-aged wine.

483
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,309
Thank you so much.

484
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,730
I'm already very grateful that you're willing to volunteer.

485
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,080
-Thank you for your hard work. -Okay.

486
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,230
This taste really is a blessing.

487
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,159
I'll savor this bottle slowly, sparingly.

488
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,359
No, Father.

489
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,260
You don't have to be so frugal with it.

490
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:45,480
I'll bring you more frequently.

491
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,760
No, no.

492
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,780
Actually, I have to leave early tomorrow morning.

493
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,679
Why stop enjoying this blessing?

494
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,410
Where are you going?

495
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,680
Well...

496
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,879
When I worked at the orphanage before,

497
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,660
I was in charge of a child.

498
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,680
Not long ago, he came here for volunteer work.

499
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,360
But suddenly,

500
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,480
he passed away.

501
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,560
So tomorrow,

502
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,980
I plan to attend his farewell.

503
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,410
Are you talking about Zhao Xianyu?

504
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,180
How does Doctor Choi know Xianyu?

505
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,710
Ah, because of Sujeong...

506
00:32:28,711 --> 00:32:31,460
Because of Dr. Woo, I've met him a few times.

507
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,310
Ah, I see.

508
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,980
What happened?

509
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,310
Mom.

510
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,680
Hello.

511
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,560
How could this happen

512
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:50,080
- Uncle -Yes

513
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,830
Please save my mom

514
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,480
- Is she your mother? -Yes
- =Maria Welfare Hospital, Goyang District, Gowan City=-

515
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,230
A patient brought by Dr. Woo

516
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,609
Got it. Don't worry about your mom, she's fine.

517
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,710
I understand

518
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,859
I'll go call the nurse

519
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Alright

520
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,779
It's okay, it's okay

521
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,260
Are you alright?

522
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,060
- Hello -Dr. Woo

523
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,110
A patient named Kim Jae-hoon was just brought in

524
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,080
But we probably need to contact the police first

525
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,930
Why do we need to contact the police?

526
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,180
He's a gunshot wound patient

527
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,260
It hurts

528
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,580
It really hurts

529
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,480
So painful

530
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,330
My heart hurts so much

531
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,380
- My heart hurts too much -I was scared by the news

532
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,060
I thought it was the arrest of Boss Kim who gave us poison
- =Poison King K, eventually found to be an impersonator...=-

533
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,236
Even with blurring, they still look similar
- =Police, "Similar appearance and tattoos to Poison King K" investigation faces difficulties=-

534
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,010
Even the Virgin Mary tattoo is the same

535
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,580
My heart

536
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,510
My heart hurts too much

537
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,630
My heart really hurts

538
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,880
No abnormalities in the heart

539
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,209
It's a psychological illusion from the shock after the accident

540
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,329
Please take a deep breath

541
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,579
We need to check if there's any damage to the bones.

542
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,230
Go get the portable X-ray machine.
Okay, got it.

543
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:22,969
Portable X-ray machine: A mobile X-ray penetrating device.
Then inject 5mg of painkiller and send to the examination room.

544
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,980
Examination room: Here, blood, urine, stool, [[BR]] body fluids and tissues can be tested to aid in disease diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and management.

545
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,679
We're from Bonsung Police Station.

546
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,900
After mom receives the injection

547
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,180
She will get better.

548
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,899
Your name is Komatsu, right?

549
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,050
Yes.

550
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,280
It's a lovely name.

551
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,080
Thank you.

552
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,680
We're here.

553
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,880
Come.

554
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,400
This is my mom’s stroller.

555
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,299
Oh, it's your mom's?

556
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,300
Yes.

557
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,249
Let me help, uncle.

558
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,250
Alright.

559
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,929
What should we do first?

560
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,180
Let me see.

561
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,700
Okay.

562
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,250
Uncle, you can push it.

563
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,379
Where do we need to push this?

564
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,880
To the parking lot of that building.

565
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,999
It's 50,000 Korean Won per month.

566
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,880
The uncle there will help keep an eye on it.

567
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,330
Really?

568
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Let's go.

569
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,049
I know you're working, but please step aside.

570
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,399
That patient has a gunshot wound.

571
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,949
He can't escape in his condition, please let us through.

572
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,049
We need to conduct an investigation, when can we take him?

573
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,449
I don't know yet.

574
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,300
We need to do a check-up now, please leave.

575
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,850
Come with me for a moment.

576
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,280
-=Medical Report=-

577
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,030
I'll ask you one more time.

578
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,100
What is your name?

579
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,749
Didn't I say it's Kim Jae-hoon?

580
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,149
Patient Kim Jae-hoon, due to a traffic accident,

581
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,280
underwent extensive surgery for a fractured right arm.

582
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,179
Using someone else's identity for hospital treatment is illegal.

583
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,730
The police will know soon.

584
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,080
They will soon know who you are.

585
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,410
Who are you?

586
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Hey.

587
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,229
Do your examination.

588
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,270
The examination is done.

589
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,570
No remaining bullet fragments or bone injuries.

590
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,850
If the police take me now, I'll die.

591
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,400
I need to stay here a bit longer.

592
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,060
Even though the side wound is a penetration wound,

593
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,290
you can be discharged tomorrow.

594
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,610
Patient, please lie on your side, it's time for the injection.

595
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,930
Will it hurt?

596
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,959
Yes, but not as much as a gunshot wound.

597
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,100
Stop whining without reason.

598
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,430
Come on, pull down your pants.

599
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,750
Pain will prevent you from going into shock.

600
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,240
To experts,

601
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,870
failure means going crazy.

602
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,240
Don't go crazy here.

603
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,430
Don't go crazy here.

604
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,920
And don't whine over nothing.

605
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
What are you doing?

606
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,630
Dr. Yoo
Hello.

607
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,070
They say a friend urgently needs to see you.

608
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,550
-A friend? -Yes.

609
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,950
Hello
Yoo Soo-jin.

610
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,610
Who is this?

611
00:39:59,611 --> 00:40:00,710
Who else could it be?

612
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,360
Pavalong.

613
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,300
Think of it now?

614
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,870
How did you know to call this number?

615
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,910
Jin Si-kyun is with you, right?

616
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,830
The gunshot victim is Jin Si-kyun.

617
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,780
Did you do this to him?

618
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,839
Did you purposely send him to me?

619
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,319
Not on purpose.

620
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,449
Anyway, it happened at the place I recommended.

621
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,790
So you could say I caused it.

622
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,339
But he didn't die, he made it to you.

623
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,880
It's giving me a headache.

624
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,750
This is a hospital.

625
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,400
The police will soon know he's Jin Si-kyun.

626
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
That's right.

627
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,000
The police have already searched Jin Si-kyun's place.

628
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,210
What did you do with Jin Si-kyun's belongings...

629
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Doing those strange things

630
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,110
They all know

631
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,310
Always treat casually and buy some time

632
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,650
I'll think about it

633
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,770
No matter what, take him out

634
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,410
If I'm caught

635
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,609
I'll give you up to the police too

636
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,759
Oh, are you threatening me?

637
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,780
Looks like you haven't figured out the situation at all

638
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,129
If you can't figure it out

639
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,039
Look again at how Jin Shi-jian is lying there

640
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Also

641
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,910
Don't be cocky, Yu Su-jin

642
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,280
Do as I say

643
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,640
I'll contact you again

644
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,260
Captain Ahn obtained permission here through Representative Bai

645
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,730
Today's homeowner for the cleaning company is Kim Jae-hoon

646
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,049
Hey, not sure if it's a coincidence

647
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,550
Currently shot and in the hospital

648
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:56,000
Next, zoom in here

649
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,110
Kim Jae-hoon is a stolen name

650
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
It's definitely Jin Shi-jian

651
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Hey, Ji-hoon

652
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,089
You can't enter here without permission

653
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,889
This is the emergency room, a crowded place

654
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,530
A criminal has come in

655
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,610
Executing officia

656
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,540
This person is Jin Shijian

657
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Jin Shijian

658
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,200
is a drug trafficker urgently sought by the special headquarters

659
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,670
The wide search team is going to take over this case now.

660
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,630
It's alright.

661
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,330
Hang in there a bit longer...

662
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,309
Can he be transferred to a regular ward?

663
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,889
Police and reporters

664
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,880
There are too many people, it's hard to treat.

665
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:50,100
Also, it's difficult for me to care for gunshot patients.

666
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,359
I don't know what crisis might arise.

667
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,860
So he can't be sent to a general ward.

668
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,879
-=Police=-

669
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,220
-=Critical Care Room=-

670
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,189
From here, general personnel entry is prohibited.

671
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,480
Let's wait until visiting hours to conduct the investigation.

672
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,029
How did you end up like this?

673
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,760
Is it okay with you to deceive others as long as you achieve your goal?

674
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,010
I'll definitely arrest you.

675
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,230
You absolutely cannot arrest me.

676
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:32,880
Because I didn't commit any crime.

677
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,030
You won't catch me.

678
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,440
It's over now.

679
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,560
Brother.

680
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Stop it, please.

681
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:03,970
Brother.

682
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,980
Have you ever truly treated me as a brother, even once?

683
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:12,009
You must be thrilled thinking about catching the criminal.

684
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,620
Evidence has been secured.

685
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,120
You have nowhere to escape.

686
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,589
Yes, I trusted you so much, handed everything over to you.

687
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,650
Of course, evidence has been secured.

688
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,920
I will be arrested and sentenced like this.

689
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,880
What are you going to do?

690
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,850
Isn't it a crime to deceive others?

691
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,220
Watch closely.

692
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:40,550
This is the price of your crime.

693
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:43,460
Hey, Park Kyung-soo.

694
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:44,910
Just wait.

695
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:47,990
Brother.

696
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,299
Police have arrested those producing drugs overseas,

697
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,009
and controlling the distribution network in South Korea,

698
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,509
the godfather of the drug world, Kim Si-chang.

699
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,839
Mr. Kim was shot during a drug deal.

700
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,619
He entered the emergency room under someone else's name.

701
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,660
-=Police discovered suspicious circumstances at the hospital..=-

702
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,829
However, during the on-site search for other cases,

703
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:54,080
Detective B, belonging to the metropolitan investigation team,

704
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,369
realized he was the major drug trafficker the special department was seeking, and arrested him.

705
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,390
Hmm.

706
00:46:59,080 --> 00:46:59,730
Strange things were found in Kim Si-chang's car.

707
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,430
Evidence of drugs lost last month at Incheon Port

708
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,829
mostly appeared in his car.

709
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:09,130
How much?

710
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,339
Methcathinone, ketamine, liquid marijuana injectors,

711
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,280
everything that was lost has been found.

712
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,310
That indicates

713
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:19,750
someone inside sold the evidence to Kim Si-chang.

714
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,210
Exactly.

715
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,210
During this period, all the missing drug evidence

716
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:28,059
seems to have been distributed externally through Kim Si-chang.

717
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,420
There must be someone inside the police with connections to Kim Si-chang.

718
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,400
There must be someone in the police connected to Jin Shi Jian.

719
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,030
How's the investigation going?

720
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,959
We handed over Kim Shi-jian's phone to the digital forensics team.

721
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,930
We need to wait for the results to make sense of it.

722
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,339
The person involved is definitely an active-duty officer.

723
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,399
Don't act rashly until we have clear evidence.

724
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Got it?

725
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,880
Okay, understood.

726
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Who is it?

727
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,390
Who else could it be? Your wife?

728
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,120
Me?

729
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,600
The one who bought you this car.

730
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,409
Prepared for a day like today.

731
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,610
I even registered my fingerprint.

732
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,519
You should already know.

733
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,449
The one who made the deal with you was Kim Shi-jian.

734
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,160
So I'll get right to the point.

735
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,539
I want to bail Kim Shi-jian out.

736
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,540
You need to help me.

737
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,470
The hospital is full of police.

738
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,969
He'll be transferred to another hospital tomorrow, increasing the police presence.

739
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,390
Don't be ridiculous.

740
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,720
Cover up all investigations related to Kim Shi-jian.

741
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:09,890
Oh, come on.

742
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,919
What? Can't you do it?

743
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,110
It's too big. It can't be covered up.

744
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:16,330
Fine.

745
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,390
Then continue the investigation. You dig deeper.

746
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,910
Dig deep with a sense of mission, happily.

747
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,940
But what happens when digging deeper leads to yourself?

748
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,610
What? Chickened out?

749
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,090
Don't be afraid

750
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,150
Hey

751
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:04,110
Your remarkable friend

752
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:06,239
When he started buying Paracetamol all the time

753
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,849
I knew something was off

754
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,009
What kind of lunatic

755
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,540
Buys sedatives at parties

756
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,670
And specifically Paracetamol

757
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:18,849
Because it's also pretty good as a sleeping pill

758
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:20,590
Don't talk nonsense

759
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,010
Euthanasia

760
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,400
It's just euthanasia, right?

761
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,060
I'm a very perceptive businessman

762
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:32,580
In my line of work

763
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,059
People like you who are hard to control

764
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,860
And cause trouble

765
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:37,649
I can't tolerate at all

766
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:38,650
Absolutely

767
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,360
What do you want?

768
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:44,940
Trying to hike up drug prices?

769
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,960
If you made a mistake

770
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,360
Just admit it properly

771
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:53,030
Huh?

772
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,639
Without my permission

773
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,110
You used my stuff without authorization

774
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:04,019
How you'll pay for this

775
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,060
We'll discuss when you bring Jin Shijian to meet me

776
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,350
There are cops in every corner of the hospital

777
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:13,889
It's completely impossible to get Jin Shijian out of there

778
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:16,459
And once she's out of the military hospital tomorrow

779
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:18,260
We might change hospitals.

780
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:19,890
Hello?

781
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,890
Yu So Jin, you

782
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:23,759
Stop saying "no" in front of me.

783
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,880
Also, you must get Kim Shi-jin out.

784
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,090
And

785
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,229
Am I not worried about your nephews?

786
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,730
Don't touch the kids.

787
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,009
If you dare touch them, I won't just sit by.

788
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,380
I'm not afraid of anything now.

789
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,540
Are you threatening me now?

790
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,760
If I get caught, do you think you'll be okay?

791
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:50,709
You don't want me to go crazy.

792
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,829
Tell everything to the police,

793
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,089
leading to your downfall.

794
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,180
You don't want it to end up like this, do you?

795
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:56,620
Kim Shi-jin, get yourself out.

796
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,960
Stop bothering me and those around me.

797
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,150
Ouch.

798
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,360
Hey, Yu So Jin.

799
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,510
Are you sure you won't regret this?

800
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,880
Completely insane.

801
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,700
This lantern chili is so delicious.

802
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,149
Lost 2 kilograms last month from heartache.

803
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,700
Looks like I'm gaining weight again.

804
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,040
Others might think you're eating different food from mine.

805
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,490
Is it not tasty?

806
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,079
Why do I think everything tastes so good?

807
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,760
Not a growing kid.

808
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,079
Went to training camps and similar places when I was young.

809
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,839
Even food that others find tasteless

810
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,480
I find delicious

811
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:20,850
Try this, it's really tasty

812
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,030
Hey, get out of the way

813
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:35,830
Move quickly

814
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,339
Hurry up and get a bed, call for help

815
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,340
Ah, yes

816
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,700
Over here

817
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,450
Bang

818
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,550
It hurts, it hurts

819
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,540
Doctor Yu

820
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,419
Just pretend you don't know and walk away

821
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,740
Stay out of it

822
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,929
The cafeteria fire and the hospital repairs

823
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:29,970
Did you arrange them?

824
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,809
Didn't you tell me to handle it?

825
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,339
This is my style

826
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,389
What are you trying to do?

827
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,839
There are too many police

828
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,539
The hospital has many patients too

829
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,410
Aren't they all like flies?

830
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,650
What do you do if you want to get rid of flies?

831
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,859
An accident needs to happen

832
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,020
Are you crazy?

833
00:54:46,510 --> 00:54:47,609
Stop immediately

834
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:50,540
Girls are all smitten with their crazy big brother

835
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:51,889
What, don't you like it?

836
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,100
Don't you like me?

837
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,220
There will be another explosion soon

838
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
Don't brag
I'll do it

839
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:02,289
I'll do it, you don't have to do anything.

840
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,659
What you can do

841
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:04,660
Now I say I'm going to do it

842
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:06,319
I will be responsible

843
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,390
I can do it

844
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:14,880
Okay, I'll give you 5 minutes.

845
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,190
Looking forward to your performance

846
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,380
Park your car in front of the funeral home and wait for me

847
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,410
I will personally take Jin Shijian there.

848
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,160
-=Regulated Area=-

849
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:02,020
You are here

850
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,260
I'll be your hostage, let's get out.

851
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,480
Get out of here, you bastard.

852
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,049
Get lost

853
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:17,630
Otherwise I'll kill you all.

854
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,450
-=Emergency Center=-

855
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,039
Hello

856
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,510
Come in and take a look quickly

857
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,469
- What happened? - Criminal in the intensive care unit

858
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,520
He took the medical staff hostage and escaped.

859
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,350
Hey, get out of here!

860
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,190
Get out of the way

861
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:59,509
Get lost

862
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,420
Jin Shijian threw away the knife

863
00:58:00,421 --> 00:58:01,519
Throw it away

864
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,520
Turn around

865
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,060
Jin Shijian threw away the knife

866
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,230
Don't come over here

867
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,039
- She's going to die. - Get out of the way.

868
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,829
- She'll die. - Back off.

869
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:13,220
-Drop the knife. -Stay away, you guys.

870
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,960
Get out of the way

871
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,760
Hey, hey, hey, block them.

872
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:35,110
Get in the car quickly

873
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:36,830
Get in the car

874
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,560
-=Death Doctor Mary=-

875
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,989
You said it was kidnapping

876
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,160
How serious the injury

877
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,320
Yu Suzhen, are you okay?

878
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,050
You have been identified as a criminal and are under investigation.

879
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,040
I would be very grateful if you could kill me

880
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,310
Are you crazy?

881
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,159
When being pursued by the police

882
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,469
I want to do that again.

883
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:01,580
Over time, this may become a human right.

884
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,290
This is a completely new business project, right?

885
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,150
Drink
