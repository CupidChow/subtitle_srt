1
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,500
So you're here alone?

2
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,260
Then can I spend a night here?

3
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,136
Chill, Ming.

4
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:02,387
It just made me think.

5
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:03,224
Think about what?

6
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:04,266
That you have someone else.

7
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,553
I didn't see you at the dorm.

8
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:06,682
You didn't answer any of my calls.

9
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,467
He's with me.

10
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:11,385
He asked me to go with him.

11
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:13,385
Don't do it next time.

12
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:22,678
Tarntatch, do you know that Uni's Moon?

13
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:25,098
He stares so intensely.

14
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:28,018
A little but we're not that close.

15
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:30,777
Lom and I are a couple.

16
00:02:30,777 --> 00:02:34,777
We like each other.

17
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:40,029
Tatch.

18
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:43,160
Tatch, how long are you gonna avoid me?

19
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,160
We haven't cleared things up.

20
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,504
We have.

21
00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:55,879
I don't have any feelings for you, Marn.

22
00:02:56,385 --> 00:03:00,385
That's not true. You just don't know what you feel.

23
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,268
Marn, the thing is...

24
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,978
Lom and I are a couple.

25
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,978
We like each other.

26
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:20,732
That's not true. You're joking, right?

27
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,602
Huh?

28
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,559
Lom.

29
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:42,689
You like Tatch?

30
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:56,982
You like him even though that day
you were there for me.

31
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:05,275
You took me out for a meal.

32
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:14,446
And you listened to every story I told you about Tatch?

33
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,810
Well, I didn't...

34
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:25,566
Lom, how could you be such a jerk?

35
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,646
Marn.

36
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:28,605
Don't talk to Lom like that.

37
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:30,555
Why, Tatch?

38
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:34,555
He really is a jerk.

39
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:38,581
But not only Lom, who is a jerk...

40
00:04:38,915 --> 00:04:42,915
you, Tatch, is also a jerk.

41
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:47,081
Marn, calm down.

42
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:53,000
I've never liked you, Marn.

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've liked guys all my life.

44
00:04:57,954 --> 00:05:01,954
And when you dumped Parak to talk to me,...

45
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:06,287
that made everyone in the school hate me.

46
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:08,656
That makes you a jerk too.

47
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:12,656
Oh, so you're telling me that you're not wrong at all?

48
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,479
I am, for not clearing things up with you, Marn.

49
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,483
That I don't like girls.

50
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:24,483
But you can't talk to Lom like that.

51
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:32,561
Mmm. I get it now.

52
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:37,653
Then you should enjoy your love.

53
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:45,653
Because a jerk deserves to be with a jerk.

54
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,445
This happens so many times already.

55
00:06:10,445 --> 00:06:13,067
Everytime Marnfah came to me,

56
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:16,477
it always ended up like this.

57
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:20,477
But this time, she won't come back anymore.

58
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:27,110
At least, if Marnfah had listened to you,

59
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,110
she would've known what the reason was.

60
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:43,893
You have a football practice, right?

61
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:46,941
I wanna go watch it.

62
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:51,941
Don't, you need to go practice
answering questions with the seniors.

63
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:55,017
Alright, I know that.

64
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,579
I don't like these shoes.

65
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:41,364
Can I throw them away?

66
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:43,247
Those are expensive.

67
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:46,743
I'll return them.

68
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:50,338
How? His feet are way bigger than yours.

69
00:07:50,338 --> 00:07:54,012
Just throw them away.

70
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,466
We could give them to the charity.

71
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,468
There's no problem with the shoes.

72
00:07:57,468 --> 00:07:59,468
At least, they could still be useful.

73
00:08:01,973 --> 00:08:02,973
Alright.

74
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,695
Can I ask you something?

75
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,527
What if I don't win...

76
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:20,489
and the whole faculty scolds me,

77
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:24,404
will the world come to an end?

78
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:26,953
Aren't you overthinking about that?

79
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:30,073
What are you worried about?

80
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:31,612
I just wanna win

81
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,620
because I wanna see you smile.

82
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,785
Don't push yourself too hard.

83
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:40,037
Just do you best, that's all.

84
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:42,661
I understand your cousin's feelings now.

85
00:08:44,042 --> 00:08:46,543
How much pressure do I have to carry?

86
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,166
Well, how about this?

87
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:52,166
Just do your best and be yourself.

88
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:54,605
And don't mind the rest.

89
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:55,605
Okay?

90
00:08:59,928 --> 00:09:00,680
Let's go!

91
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
Let's get some sleep!

92
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:31,522
Are you really gonna sleep?

93
00:11:48,057 --> 00:12:05,057
"Louknam is calling..."

94
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:11,356
Hello.

95
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,984
Something happened, Lom!

96
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,902
What happened?

97
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:21,066
We've been played.
Tarntatch needs to be ready before 9 a.m.

98
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:28,732
They just informed me that all the Moons contestants
need to do an activity with the dean.

99
00:12:28,732 --> 00:12:30,606
Darn!

100
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:32,388
At 9 a.m.?

101
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:33,383
I'll handle it.

102
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:36,797
Okay, hurry up and get to the faculty. I'm waiting.

103
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,001
Got it.

104
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:44,001
Tatch, Tatch, wake up!

105
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,801
Something's up.

106
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,799
You need to be at the faculty by 9 a.m.

107
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,094
Huh?

108
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:53,094
What?

109
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:58,641
Get up!

110
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:00,641
You need to be there before 9 a.m.

111
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:09,313
Then when will I see you today?

112
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:12,313
This afternoon. I'll be at the booth all day.

113
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:16,400
So I wouldn't get to spend my morning with you.

114
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,824
C'mon, you need to go take a shower.

115
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:23,193
It's late now.

116
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,193
Go!

117
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:28,824
Shower!

118
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,369
Hurry up!

119
00:14:03,998 --> 00:14:05,533
Hey!

120
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:06,832
Could you shave for me?

121
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,073
Huh?

122
00:14:09,073 --> 00:14:11,614
Please shave for me.

123
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:13,614
You want me to shave for you?

124
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,663
Is this the booth of Faculty of Agriculture?

125
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:07,663
Yes, it is.

126
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:15,691
What's up, Lom?

127
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:20,691
Oh, isn't this Tarntatch's imaginary pair on Instagram?

128
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:23,157
Don't you remember?

129
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:27,157
Oh, you're Lomnaw, right?

130
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,744
You look better than on Instagram.

131
00:16:29,744 --> 00:16:33,744
So you're Parak, Panon's twin brother?

132
00:16:33,913 --> 00:16:34,913
Mmm.

133
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:39,875
Are you here to see Tatch?

134
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:40,791
In what way?

135
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,668
Just coming by

136
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,545
to say...I miss him.

137
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,337
Hey, if you're gonna talk that way,

138
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:47,956
you need to ask his boyfriend first..

139
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:50,833
His boyfriend?

140
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:53,373
There, there. As I thought.

141
00:16:53,373 --> 00:16:55,247
Panon fooled me.

142
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:58,622
Huh? What about? I don't know what you're talking about.

143
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:00,750
I think we'll come back later.

144
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,754
By then, everything will be cleared up already.

145
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:03,879
Er...

146
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,509
Can I ask you something?

147
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:07,021
Yes?

148
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,980
Are you still mad at Tatch?

149
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,980
I guess you could say, I've stopped being a fool.

150
00:17:39,837 --> 00:17:41,837
Can I talk to you?

151
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:47,130
Guys, please take care of this for me.

152
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,130
Why, what's up?

153
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:54,881
What's there to talk about?

154
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,957
About you, actually.

155
00:17:56,957 --> 00:17:58,409
But can we go somewhere else?

156
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:02,322
So we can have a long talk.

157
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:04,200
Is there any good place to eat around here?

158
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,031
A place that sells beer too.

159
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:08,290
Yeah, there is.

160
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,541
Take me there.

161
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,218
Of course.

162
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:13,218
Then I'll see you this evening.

163
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Come on. I'll help you pack.

164
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Are you tired?

165
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:33,772
So how do you know Lom?

166
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,234
I briefly saw his Instagram.

167
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:38,234
We just had a first talk at the booth.

168
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:45,098
He's kinda cute.

169
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,348
I understand now why Non likes him.

170
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:49,310
You're bugging me now, Rak.

171
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:52,152
Just kidding.

172
00:18:52,152 --> 00:18:56,066
No matter how much he likes him,
he'll get heart-broken someday.

173
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:58,740
So why did you come here?

174
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,407
Can't I come to see my friend?

175
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:03,743
That's bold of you to say.

176
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,532
You're such...

177
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:08,161
I don't know if love blinded you.

178
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:10,387
No.

179
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:17,423
You only listened to what Panon expressed
and what Marnfah said.

180
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:21,008
But you never listened to me.

181
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:25,008
Never believed me that this friend wouldn't hurt you.

182
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:30,353
You really make me feel guilty.

183
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:32,148
Why don't you just stab me?

184
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:33,573
I'd love to.

185
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,540
Hey, Tatch?!

186
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Your friend's just...

187
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,703
I already have someone.

188
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:46,369
If I go to jail, how would that person live?

189
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:48,364
Is that right?

190
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:50,364
Darn! Were you joking?

191
00:19:52,413 --> 00:19:54,879
Your joke is good.

192
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:57,547
Of course.

193
00:19:57,547 --> 00:20:01,547
But it's unbelievable.
I thought you like girls all this time.

194
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,340
I think I've never flirted a girl for you to see.

195
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:09,937
But many girls like you.

196
00:20:09,937 --> 00:20:12,651
I can't help with that 'cause I'm super hot.

197
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:15,187
Your jokes are always good.

198
00:20:15,187 --> 00:20:16,981
So, where's your bottle?

199
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,147
Let's clink the glasses.

200
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:20,524
Cheers.

201
00:20:29,741 --> 00:20:30,741
Really?

202
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:40,000
Can you do one thing for me?

203
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,083
What's it?

204
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:45,083
Can you not stop being my friend?

205
00:20:47,324 --> 00:20:49,324
What a drama?

206
00:20:53,661 --> 00:20:55,415
Who would do that?

207
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:56,746
Is that right, guys?

208
00:20:56,746 --> 00:20:58,952
Absolutely.

209
00:20:58,952 --> 00:21:00,818
Darn, how did you get here?

210
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:04,518
Rak texted me that he found you.

211
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:06,140
He told us to come here.

212
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,048
Actually, we came to see you since the afternoon,

213
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:11,884
but your boyfriend said you're free in the evening.

214
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:13,884
So we went back to our uni first.

215
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:19,888
Darn, I feel like I haven't met you for a long time.

216
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:23,945
I'm being sentimental.

217
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:25,911
No, no, no. Don't cry.

218
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:29,542
If you cry, you have to finish your drink.

219
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,583
But first, you have to order.

220
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,741
Excuse me...

221
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:35,366
I'll order it for you.

222
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:39,366
Alright, thank you.

223
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:40,864
So, how are you?

224
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:43,490
Same old, same old. Still don't get what I study.

225
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,119
Same here. So confused.

226
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,119
Me too.

227
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:19,454
"I'm sitting outside." "It's sentimental. I don't want your friends
to see my tears." "Just spend time with your friends. "

228
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,726
Why are you sitting alone?

229
00:22:59,726 --> 00:23:03,069
I want you guys to reminisce.

230
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:04,647
You can join us.

231
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,605
Everyone's okay with that.

232
00:23:06,605 --> 00:23:10,605
Man, you guys are heavy drinkers.

233
00:23:11,226 --> 00:23:12,694
Come on, you won't get drunk.

234
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:14,603
It's only 2 crates.

235
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:16,772
2 crates!

236
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:20,772
Tarntatch can drink a lot.

237
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:22,817
That's true.

238
00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:26,817
Anyway, why did you make up with Tatch?

239
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:30,735
You two were mad at each other before.

240
00:23:30,735 --> 00:23:34,735
I heard that Non was about to
attack Tatch in front of the clinic.

241
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:39,068
I thought it was kinda strange.

242
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:42,439
And things between Marnfah and I ended long time ago.

243
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:46,439
I don't know why he picked a fight with Tatch.

244
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:49,645
So I started to follow Tatch's Instagram again.

245
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:52,700
I saw he's dating you.

246
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,700
And I checked Marnfah's timeline.

247
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:59,291
And it got suspicious.

248
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:03,291
Because Tatch didn't do anything with Marnfah.

249
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,210
I was...like a worthless person.

250
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:21,167
I blindly kept chasing the person who didn't love me.

251
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:25,709
It isn't just not loving my friends, it's not loving myself as well.

252
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,804
But you came to realization.

253
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:37,804
After I started to love myself, I had to solve the matter
about Tatch, which was still bothering me.

254
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,169
What are you doing?

255
00:24:54,169 --> 00:24:57,542
I'm consoling your friend.

256
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:00,381
What's wrong? Why do you need to console him?

257
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:04,014
I told your boyfriend about the time
when I was in the hospital.

258
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:06,014
Ah, the time you almost committed suicide?

259
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:10,059
Yeah.

260
00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:13,103
I understand.

261
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:18,525
But talking alone with boyfriend, isn't it too much?

262
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:22,327
You're so jealous.

263
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:23,739
Of course.

264
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:28,739
Tatch, keep this boyfriend of yours.

265
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,828
I'll go drink beer with the guys.

266
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,534
Hurry up and join us.

267
00:25:39,534 --> 00:25:40,534
Okay.

268
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,922
Are you not joining your friends?

269
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:50,179
I am. But only with you.

270
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:54,179
Recently, I just texted you to spend time with your friends.

271
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,136
My friends are your friends, aren't they?

272
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:00,137
That's right, but...

273
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:03,136
You got too sentimental?

274
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,343
Yeah, I did.

275
00:26:05,343 --> 00:26:09,343
Love and friendship are very heartwarming.

276
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:18,495
Parak is so right.

277
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,495
I have to keep you.

278
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,660
I'm a rare stuff, right?

279
00:26:33,869 --> 00:26:34,869
Teaser.

280
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:49,206
Do I look great?

281
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:52,504
I'll wear this in the competition tomorrow.

282
00:26:52,504 --> 00:26:55,669
Are you having a football match
or fitting for a model shoot?

283
00:26:55,669 --> 00:26:57,669
You haven't seen the good part yet.

284
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:01,087
Here.

285
00:27:03,629 --> 00:27:05,208
What about it?

286
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,956
What's about 17?

287
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:08,956
It's your birthday.

288
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:13,664
Speechless, aren't you?

289
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,837
Are you that happy?

290
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:24,538
Extremely.

291
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:26,947
But I'm just a substitute.

292
00:27:26,947 --> 00:27:29,194
I don't know if I'd get to play.

293
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,737
I don't care about that.

294
00:27:30,737 --> 00:27:32,737
I only care about the number on your shirt.

295
00:27:43,449 --> 00:27:47,449
It's said if you have sex before the competition,
you'll look better.

296
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:51,243
Who said that?

297
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:53,788
I did.

298
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:55,663
You're such a...

299
00:27:55,663 --> 00:27:58,621
I'll do it gently.

300
00:27:58,621 --> 00:27:59,786
Please.

301
00:27:59,786 --> 00:28:00,786
Please, dear.

302
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:32,412
Panon.

303
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,662
Here, I'll answer it.

304
00:28:36,662 --> 00:28:39,913
Hey, wait!

305
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:41,913
What the heck do you want?

306
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:46,292
Man, you're so cool.

307
00:28:56,787 --> 00:28:57,835
Hello.

308
00:28:57,835 --> 00:29:00,332
What's your business?

309
00:29:00,332 --> 00:29:01,038
Huh?!

310
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:02,706
What are you talking about?

311
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:05,500
Can you speak human language?

312
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,375
What are you babbling about?

313
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:10,006
Lom, come see me down here!

314
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:12,635
Lomnaw!

315
00:29:12,635 --> 00:29:15,173
Lom!

316
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:17,806
Lomnaw!

317
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:20,222
Lom, come see me down here!

318
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:22,514
Lom!

319
00:29:22,514 --> 00:29:25,343
Lomnaw!

320
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:28,221
Lom!

321
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:29,885
Lomnaw!

322
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:31,922
Lom!

323
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:36,922
I...Tatch...Tatch, he...

324
00:29:41,298 --> 00:29:43,710
What the heck is wrong with him?

325
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,173
I think he's drunk.

326
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:48,384
He dares come to the dorm?

327
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:52,133
Does he think I'm gonna let it be that easily?

328
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:53,593
Stay here. I'll go down.

329
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:56,593
Tatch, don't. I'll go.

330
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,590
Are you crazy?

331
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,300
I'll clear things up with him.

332
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,013
If you're concerned, you can come with me.

333
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,009
It won't settle.

334
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:14,009
Not to you. But to me, it will.

335
00:30:15,472 --> 00:30:17,846
How do you know?

336
00:30:17,846 --> 00:30:20,734
Because I already have a boyfriend.

337
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,111
Then I'll watch from around the elevator.

338
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,411
Answer my call, Lom.

339
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:49,459
Lom, you come to see me.

340
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,625
What do you want?

341
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:54,336
I just...

342
00:30:54,336 --> 00:30:58,336
I just want to try to change your mind.

343
00:30:58,384 --> 00:31:01,590
One last time.

344
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,044
Tatch is a jerk, you know.

345
00:31:05,044 --> 00:31:08,543
He's the cause why Rak hates me.

346
00:31:08,543 --> 00:31:11,619
I think you made that up.

347
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:15,250
Rak is your brother.

348
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,250
He knows you well.

349
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:23,589
If he's to hate you, it won't involve Tatch.

350
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,260
That's not true.

351
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,465
Tatch is a liar.

352
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:31,465
I think you should go home and carefully think about it.

353
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:33,466
I've thought this through.

354
00:31:36,302 --> 00:31:40,302
Judging from how you look, you haven't thought at all.

355
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:43,638
That's my business.

356
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:45,810
What about you, Lom?

357
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:48,140
What do you say?

358
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,020
I've come to see you here, and you still like Tatch?

359
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
I don't like him.

360
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:58,734
Are you serious?

361
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:00,520
I am.

362
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,348
I don't like him.

363
00:32:02,348 --> 00:32:05,561
But I love him.

364
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:09,518
Tatch and I are a couple.

365
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:13,518
So stop bothering me.

366
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:17,018
My boyfriend doesn't like it.

367
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,400
Darn, he's such a stealer.

368
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,641
Huh?

369
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:23,725
What did he steal?

370
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:25,725
I met you before him.

371
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:34,142
You know what, you're such a loser.

372
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,666
Lom.

373
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,372
I don't have anything else to talk to you.

374
00:32:45,372 --> 00:32:47,924
Just go back.

375
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,553
And just stop...

376
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:54,553
messing with people's minds.

377
00:32:54,638 --> 00:32:57,722
Be reasonable.

378
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:01,060
Don't judge anything by your hatred.

379
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,060
Somehow, your life may be better.

380
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,196
Lom.

381
00:33:06,196 --> 00:33:08,190
Lomnaw!

382
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,735
Lom!

383
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:12,358
Come back to me!

384
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:13,358
Lom!

385
00:33:14,397 --> 00:33:15,397
Lom!

386
00:33:18,855 --> 00:33:22,525
You're so cool.

387
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:23,938
How was it cool?

388
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,568
I'm so upset.

389
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:28,442
That jerk didn't listen to anything.

390
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:30,442
The things you said hit him pretty hard.

391
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:34,683
If he'd only listened,...

392
00:33:37,103 --> 00:33:39,601
Now it's your turn.

393
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:43,153
Find sometime to clear things up with him.

394
00:33:43,153 --> 00:33:46,153
I've been thinking about what to do.

395
00:33:47,196 --> 00:33:50,697
Let's go to the room.

396
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,529
Wanna continue?

397
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:56,071
To hell with continue. I'm upset.

398
00:33:56,071 --> 00:33:58,071
Alright, alright.

399
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,071
Let's wait after the contest, deal?

400
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,332
"What are you doing?"

401
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:54,559
"Putting on make-up."

402
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,559
"Almost ready for fitting."

403
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,599
"Wanna see what you wear."

404
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:43,380
"I'll practice answering the question."

405
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,380
"Alright. Do your best."
"You've got this."

406
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:52,923
Alright, Tarntatch, next is the question from the judges.

407
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:58,561
Say, if you were the university ambassador,
what would you do for the university?

408
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,894
Prepare your answer, okay?

409
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:02,768
Alright.

410
00:36:02,768 --> 00:36:04,855
So, mainly, the question is about this, right?

411
00:36:04,855 --> 00:36:06,264
That's right.

412
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,011
The first pair, come forward.

413
00:36:09,011 --> 00:36:11,931
Walk, greet.

414
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:14,310
Beautifully.

415
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,764
Back to your post.

416
00:36:16,764 --> 00:36:17,764
Next.

417
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:43,563
1 hour before the Ambassador Contest

418
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:46,437
Oh! The rehearsal is finished?

419
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,691
Already.

420
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:50,113
I'll be right back.

421
00:36:50,113 --> 00:36:52,816
I'll take care of your make-up but I need restroom first.

422
00:36:52,816 --> 00:36:53,816
Alright.

423
00:37:06,636 --> 00:37:08,090
"We won the football match."

424
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,464
"Darn, that's great."

425
00:37:09,464 --> 00:37:10,922
"Let's celebrate."

426
00:37:10,922 --> 00:37:12,591
"Hey, hey, easy, easy."

427
00:37:12,591 --> 00:37:14,295
"Wait for the result of the Ambassador."

428
00:37:14,295 --> 00:37:15,916
"We're counting on you, Tarntatch."

429
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,497
"Right, Tatch, the football team is counting on you."

430
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:18,918
"Just wait and see."

431
00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:20,540
"How's Lom?"

432
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,289
"Darn, they're flirting in the group chat."

433
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:24,289
"Woooo."

434
00:37:26,157 --> 00:37:28,534
Tarntatch!

435
00:37:28,534 --> 00:37:30,906
Have you heard? We won the football tournament.

436
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:32,236
I have.

437
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:35,159
The group chat keeps ringing.

438
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,663
So happy about that.

439
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:40,663
Do you know how Lomnaw is?

440
00:37:41,788 --> 00:37:43,376
Lomnaw...?

441
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:52,543
As far as I know, Lomnaw twisted his ankle during the match.

442
00:37:52,543 --> 00:37:54,419
Now he's in the infirmary.

443
00:37:54,419 --> 00:37:55,591
No need to worry.

444
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:59,591
But he might not be able to see the contest.

445
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:14,549
I'll check on Lomnaw quickly.

446
00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:17,045
Hey, hey, wait, wait.

447
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,256
The contest starts in 1 hour.

448
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,259
I'll be quick.

449
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:25,504
If it still bothers me, I can't focus on the contest.

450
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,377
Okay, okay.

451
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:29,754
Alright, I'll let you go. But...

452
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:31,930
Promise me.

453
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:35,930
You have to come back for a stand-by
half an hour before, okay?

454
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,981
Okay.

455
00:38:37,981 --> 00:38:40,980
Thank you so much.

456
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,817
You're okay, but I'm not.

457
00:38:43,817 --> 00:38:45,526
What's going on today?

458
00:38:45,526 --> 00:38:47,526
It's so messy. My hair is messy too.

459
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,400
Hello, Am, where are you?

460
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,320
I'm at the canteen. What are you calling for?

461
00:39:00,793 --> 00:39:02,793
I'm worried about Lom. Are you with him?

462
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,420
I said I am at the canteen. Lom is still sleeping.
Don't worry.

463
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:09,330
No one is with Lom?

464
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:12,020
No. He fell asleep right after taking the medicine.

465
00:39:12,214 --> 00:39:13,070
Which room is Lom in?

466
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,650
At the pharmacy. Wait.
Are you going to look for him?

467
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,920
The contest starts in an hour, Tat.

468
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:30,559
"Panon is calling."

469
00:39:32,055 --> 00:39:35,064
You saw the pic I sent you, right?

470
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:37,183
Non, what do you want?

471
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:40,691
Whoa, whoa, take it easy, man.

472
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:42,691
You want your boyfriend back, right?

473
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,754
Am! Listen to me.

474
00:39:57,754 --> 00:39:59,875
Panon took Lomnaw.

475
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,332
He sent me a pic.

476
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,293
Huh!

477
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:03,293
What the heck?

478
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:08,199
It's me, it's me, it's me.

479
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:11,687
Tatch!

480
00:40:11,687 --> 00:40:13,148
Return Lomnaw to me!

481
00:40:13,148 --> 00:40:14,230
So what you want?

482
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,681
Wanna have a brawl?

483
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:16,769
Take it easy.

484
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:17,428
Tatch!

485
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:18,128
Help Tatch.
