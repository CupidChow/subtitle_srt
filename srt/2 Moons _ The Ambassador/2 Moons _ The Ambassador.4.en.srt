1
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:59,019
What the hell is wrong with you?
If you don't tell me, I'll call Panon.

2
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,164
Hey, don't.

3
00:02:00,164 --> 00:02:02,296
If you wanna know anything, just ask me.

4
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,392
Can I really ask you?

5
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,854
Then why did you ignore me?

6
00:02:04,854 --> 00:02:07,952
I ignored you because I was scared.

7
00:02:07,952 --> 00:02:09,213
Scared? You? Scared?

8
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,559
Well, I was...

9
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:12,997
scared that you believed Panon rather than me,

10
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:13,997
I'd feel terrible.

11
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,646
Wow.

12
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:23,646
It's so unbelievably huge.

13
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:37,023
"A little bummed so I'll drain
the desserts in the whole mall"

14
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,111
Hey!

15
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,579
Hey there, hello!

16
00:02:41,844 --> 00:02:43,391
Oh, and where's Phu?

17
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:44,767
He went with a girl.

18
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,819
He ditched us.

19
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,545
Well, he's like that.

20
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:49,372
Don't mind him.

21
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:53,176
So what the hell is wrong with you, Mr. Lom?

22
00:02:53,176 --> 00:02:56,894
Because Tarntatch went with Manfah, right?

23
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:59,449
Mmm.

24
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:03,449
I've never thought
that Lom would like Manfah this much.

25
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:06,144
I thought he just admired her.

26
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,318
Unlike how other girls are crazy about Pha.

27
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:13,318
I'm not so sure if I really like her or not.

28
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,831
Hey, when did you start having this thought?

29
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:21,098
I think...

30
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:23,689
since he met Tarntatch.

31
00:03:23,689 --> 00:03:27,689
Wait, what does that suppose to mean?

32
00:03:29,537 --> 00:03:31,920
A very handsome man is all over you.

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,095
He looks at you.

34
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:37,561
If it were you, wouldn't your heart shake, Toon?

35
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:41,117
Well, that's something to think about.

36
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:44,544
And what about you, Lom?

37
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:47,968
I don't know.

38
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,323
Hey.

39
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:56,323
Someone's copied your caption.

40
00:03:59,712 --> 00:04:02,112
"I'm bummed but I can't drain the desserts
in the whole mall. Scared of getting fat!"

41
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:08,374
Hey, if there's anything, you can tell us.

42
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,247
I don't want you to make a wrong decision.

43
00:04:10,247 --> 00:04:13,048
What are you guys up to?

44
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:16,228
I don't know. I just think that...

45
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:22,271
if this time, you make a wrong decision,
you'll get awfully hurt.

46
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:23,658
Think carefully.

47
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:27,658
If you like Manfah, why would you
be interested in who's new in your life?

48
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:33,959
Hey! That means he likes the new one in his life.

49
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,396
Huh?

50
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,199
Huh, my ass.

51
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,452
Here, let me show you something.

52
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:42,095
What are you doing?

53
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:43,890
Instagram's story...

54
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,484
Pick up your ice-cream dish.

55
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,208
And make an extraordinary pose.

56
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,832
And why do I have to do it?

57
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,847
Just co-operate with me.

58
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:55,441
Just do it, you'll know it eventually.

59
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:56,787
Do it nicely.

60
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:58,600
Yeah, just like that.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,271
Then, it's done!

62
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:02,359
If Tatch is really interested in you,

63
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,788
he'll reply to me very quickly, you trust me?

64
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:09,788
And recently, he's been talking to us about you.

65
00:05:11,716 --> 00:05:15,716
And what does that have to do
with the confusion in my heart?

66
00:05:17,104 --> 00:05:20,829
That will make you decide better, buddy.

67
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:23,667
So you'll stop being interested in
the one who's not into you.

68
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:27,667
And start being interested in
the one who's into you.

69
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,690
There, he replied.

70
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,030
Tarntatchtatchtatch: So jealous.

71
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,115
Tarntatchtatchtatch: Wanna be there too.

72
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,115
Take a look.

73
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,713
I think...you don't have to think so much anymore.

74
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:47,267
Choose Tatch.

75
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,267
We're rooting for you, really.

76
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,100
"Today, I'm with Mr. Happiness."

77
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:13,646
What's wrong?

78
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:15,646
You smiled for less than one minute.

79
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:19,413
Hey, Lom.

80
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,264
Hello, Man.

81
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,817
Tatch, are you free?

82
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:23,619
Have you eaten?

83
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm about to go to the class.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh, dear, too bad.

85
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,812
Mmm, actually, I could join you.

86
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,874
The faculty's cafeteria is just right over there.

87
00:06:32,874 --> 00:06:35,295
I can make it.

88
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:37,295
I'm off, COMPETITOR.

89
00:06:46,476 --> 00:06:47,976
What's wrong with me?

90
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,568
Let's go find something to do.

91
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,118
It's on me.

92
00:06:56,752 --> 00:07:00,752
Hey, if you say so, we won't stop you.

93
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:02,725
What should we do?

94
00:07:02,725 --> 00:07:05,653
It's such a rare occasion that Lom treats us.

95
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,285
Whatever, I'm up for anything.

96
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:11,668
Just say it, I'll make it happen.

97
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:13,552
Karaoke.

98
00:07:13,552 --> 00:07:17,552
Okay, are you ready?

99
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:39,114
Is it like what we thought it'd be?

100
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,119
No, I don't think he'd be like this too.

101
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:12,967
Lom, let's go home. It's 9 p.m. now.

102
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:15,640
What's the rush?

103
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,319
I'm feeling the mood now.

104
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:22,319
Mood, my ass.
You've been feeling it since 4 hours ago.

105
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,660
I think he's not gonna go.
What should we do now?

106
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,144
Mmm...

107
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:33,144
I think we must do the 'thing'.

108
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:51,248
Er...I need to pee. I'll go to the restroom.

109
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:54,560
Me too, I'm going too.

110
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
We'll be right back, Lom.

111
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,120
You posted Instagram stories
like you two were a couple.

112
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,068
Darn.

113
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:50,204
Yeah, we asked him to come.

114
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:51,551
We knew you wanted to stay.

115
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:55,391
So I asked him here to keep you company.

116
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:57,450
You can sing all you want.

117
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,171
He told me he could be here till 3 a.m.

118
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,300
We'll head back now.

119
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,275
We are too tired.

120
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:03,323
Mmm.

121
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:05,045
Is your car key with you?

122
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,602
Yeah, it's with me.

123
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:07,939
See ya, buddy.

124
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:08,663
Hey!

125
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:09,883
Chill, man.

126
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:11,130
You can't ditch me like this.

127
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,003
Bye-bye.

128
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:12,894
See you.

129
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:13,894
Take care of him.

130
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:31,459
So you're not singing anymore?

131
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:35,430
The mood's ruined.

132
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,734
Why don't you look at me when I talk to you?

133
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:42,297
Because you're not handsome enough.

134
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:45,603
I'm sorry that I'm not as handsome as your Pha.

135
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,603
Yeah, it's good that you know it.

136
00:11:50,937 --> 00:11:53,458
Are you mad at me?

137
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,458
No.

138
00:11:57,938 --> 00:11:59,938
Is it about me going out with Manfah?

139
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:09,373
If it's gonna make you feel better,
I'll tell you that...

140
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:12,096
Manfah and I aren't a thing.

141
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:15,096
She's just a girl that I'm close to the most.

142
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:19,113
She and I can never be something else.

143
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,002
Because I don't like her that way.

144
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:26,558
You still have a chance to hit on her,
if you want to.

145
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:29,480
Happy now?

146
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
You're calmer now, aren't you?

147
00:14:48,313 --> 00:14:50,313
I know that I'm handsome. You keep staring.

148
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:55,707
What? Who's staring?

149
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:59,548
I'm looking at the scenery along the road.

150
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:01,524
What's there to look at?

151
00:15:01,524 --> 00:15:03,405
There are many parked cars.

152
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:05,405
And over there, it's just restaurants.

153
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:10,753
My eyes, I can look wherever I want.

154
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:13,140
And one more thing...

155
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,392
I was looking for the famous restaurants
I haven't been to yet.

156
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:21,979
So I could invite Toon and Tong to go with me.

157
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:25,979
Oh, so it is.

158
00:15:28,689 --> 00:15:32,244
Next time, can you invite me too?

159
00:15:32,244 --> 00:15:33,244
What's wrong with you?

160
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:44,056
Manfah: Tatch, are you home yet?

161
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:47,226
A girl said hi to you.

162
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,695
Do you want to reply for me?

163
00:15:49,695 --> 00:15:53,003
Darn, what? It's none of my business.

164
00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:57,003
Okay, it's my business to not reply to her, right?

165
00:16:09,963 --> 00:16:10,720
Why did you answer?

166
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,523
Tatch, are you home yet?

167
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:13,571
Talk to her.

168
00:16:13,571 --> 00:16:16,917
Tatch, are you home yet?

169
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:19,807
Tatch, can you hear me?

170
00:16:19,807 --> 00:16:24,404
I'd like to talk about the stuff
that you said before we parted today.

171
00:16:24,404 --> 00:16:26,293
Can it not be like that, Tatch?

172
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:30,053
Weren't we happy today?

173
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:31,053
Answer her.

174
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,319
I have nothing to say.

175
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,446
I thought that you might have some feelings for me already.

176
00:16:44,446 --> 00:16:46,666
I've never had feelings for you, Man.

177
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:50,015
Then, why would you go out with me?

178
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:52,061
Everyone at the uni saw it.

179
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:53,110
Why, Tatch?

180
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,037
If you don't like me,
why would you go out with me?

181
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:58,174
Why would you go have a meal with me?

182
00:16:58,174 --> 00:17:00,555
Because you're my friend.

183
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:03,773
When you asked me, I had to go.

184
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,155
How can a friend leave a friend to eat alone?

185
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:07,289
Can it not be like that, Tatch?

186
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:09,058
I don't want to be just friends.

187
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,079
It's impossible.

188
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,212
When will you be able to put up with that?

189
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,307
Well, because I like you very much, Tatch.

190
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,353
I don't wanna let you go.

191
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:22,353
You knew I broke up with Parak
because I liked you so much.

192
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,402
I think we shouldn't talk anymore.

193
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:29,375
I'm sorry for today.

194
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,375
It won't happen again.

195
00:17:42,678 --> 00:17:45,149
It's not your fault.

196
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,246
And I'm sorry.

197
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:49,246
That I broke the heart of a girl that you like.

198
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:53,179
Stop looking so sad.

199
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:57,333
Shall we find something to eat?

200
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,333
Huh?

201
00:17:59,432 --> 00:18:01,583
Are you sleepwalking?

202
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:03,583
Let me take a look at you.

203
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,029
I'm not sleepwalking.

204
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,674
It might make you feel better.

205
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:10,677
Including me.

206
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:13,222
Who eats when stressed out at night?

207
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:14,446
You'll get fat.

208
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:16,037
I do!

209
00:18:16,037 --> 00:18:17,919
What are you gonna eat?

210
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,919
Mmm. Anything simple and not crowded.

211
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:24,903
Why not crowded?

212
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,903
I don't want to be seen.

213
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,622
I saw that you rolled your eyes.

214
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:36,096
What? You didn't see it clearly.

215
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:37,096
I was smiling.

216
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:46,911
Yeah, let's go find something to eat.

217
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,507
Yeah, you wanna eat the morning noodles?

218
00:18:49,507 --> 00:18:50,854
It's near the uni entrance.

219
00:18:50,854 --> 00:18:52,905
There's one.

220
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,337
Okay.

221
00:18:54,337 --> 00:18:57,337
Hurry up, the rain's here.

222
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:33,918
Hello.

223
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,337
The usual for me.

224
00:19:35,337 --> 00:19:36,311
The usual.

225
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:37,323
Me too.

226
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:38,546
Okay.

227
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:41,679
Go have a seat.

228
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,863
Oh, you're here alone, Yo?

229
00:19:43,863 --> 00:19:47,000
Hey, Kit and Beam, hello.

230
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, and where is Pha?

231
00:19:51,877 --> 00:19:54,846
You're still mad at each other?

232
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:59,846
Don't tell Pha, but I just wanna
read a comic here alone quietly.

233
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:01,820
We won't tell him.

234
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,707
We'll let him go nuts like that.

235
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:05,707
So satisfying.

236
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,847
You're so satisfied with something
that you shouldn't be.

237
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:13,024
Are you a psycho?
I don't know how Ming can be with you.

238
00:20:13,024 --> 00:20:15,408
You can be with a cruel dog like Fourth.

239
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:18,091
That's true as Kit said, Beam.

240
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,673
Don't laugh, Yo.

241
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:21,970
How about you?
When are you gonna make up with my friend?

242
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,720
It's been days since our trip.

243
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,771
My friend can't focus on his studies now.

244
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,781
Whoa, guys, I can't focus with my studies too.

245
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:32,798
When I'm about to study,
Pha with those girls crosses my mind.

246
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,893
That's why I ended up here at the noodles place.

247
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:37,490
Well, why did you give Pha's number to those girls?

248
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,171
When he got you back, you got mad at him.

249
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:41,313
I'm not mad at him.

250
00:20:41,313 --> 00:20:44,323
Here they are.

251
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,588
Thank you.

252
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,974
Here are your noodles.

253
00:20:48,276 --> 00:20:51,247
This one, I add on some extras.

254
00:20:51,247 --> 00:20:51,965
Thank you.

255
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:53,649
Extra noodles.

256
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:56,786
And this, rice vermicelli.

257
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:59,255
Just be careful.

258
00:20:59,255 --> 00:21:00,301
Rice stick noodles.

259
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:00,982
Thank you.

260
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:01,658
Please take this back.

261
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,424
Thank you.

262
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:08,061
Now that we've got our noodles,
let's stop talking about Pha.

263
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,061
I don't wanna ruin my appetite.

264
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:19,524
Hello.

265
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,612
Hello.

266
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:23,239
Hey, that's Lom.

267
00:21:24,246 --> 00:21:29,246
Darn, aside from Pha, I've never
seen someone looking that good before.

268
00:21:31,505 --> 00:21:33,644
Hello, Yo, Kit, and Beam.

269
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:34,699
Hello, Lom.

270
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,708
Is this your friend?

271
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:40,509
Wow, he's so handsome.

272
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:43,509
You look cute too.

273
00:21:46,229 --> 00:21:48,113
Well, I like him already.

274
00:21:48,113 --> 00:21:51,999
Aim high from the start. I love him.

275
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:53,760
Are you here alone, Yo?

276
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,517
You're not good with Pha yet?

277
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:58,066
Huh? Wait, how do you know that?

278
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,066
Pha told me.

279
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:04,866
Lom, you're like a bad timing.

280
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:09,269
Er...and have you got the table?

281
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:12,860
You wanna join us?

282
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,776
If Pha was here, do you think this handsome guy
would be able to stand here and look at Yo like this?

283
00:22:17,776 --> 00:22:20,372
I think that someone would drop down on the floor.

284
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,372
Oh, can you stop talking about Pha?

285
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:27,767
We'll get another table, it's fine.

286
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,277
Your table is small.

287
00:22:29,277 --> 00:22:30,835
So it won't get too crowded.

288
00:22:30,835 --> 00:22:33,835
Okay, okay, but if you'd like to join,
you're always welcome.

289
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:52,060
Are you gonna eat the noodles or Yo?

290
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,741
You keep staring at him.

291
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:54,741
You know them?

292
00:22:58,035 --> 00:23:01,284
That's Beam. And that's Kit.

293
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:02,794
My cousin's friends.

294
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,869
And the one that you keep staring,...

295
00:23:06,674 --> 00:23:10,674
that's Yo, my cousin's boyfriend.

296
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:12,918
That's Pha's boyfriend?

297
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:15,918
Yeah, that's right.
Everyone in the uni knows about this.

298
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:21,992
So what would you like, cutie?

299
00:23:21,992 --> 00:23:23,911
And what would you like, handsome?

300
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:27,174
Mmm, I'm handsome too.

301
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:30,350
Rice stick noodles with braised beef, extra.

302
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,151
We only have pork here.

303
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:33,294
Then pork is fine.

304
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:35,308
Stick noodles and pork, it is.

305
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:36,193
I'll take the same as this cutie.

306
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:40,193
Mmm, of course, wait a minute, alright?

307
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:44,375
Alright, continue.

308
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:48,375
So your cousin and that guy...named Yo, right?

309
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,098
Who made the first move?

310
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,567
Why would you stick your nose in other people's business?

311
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,567
I...just wanna know.

312
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:02,007
They've liked each other since high school.

313
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,221
But they just got together when they got into uni.

314
00:24:04,221 --> 00:24:07,221
Darn, just like from a novel.

315
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,205
Scoot over.

316
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,799
There's so much space, why would you sit by me?

317
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,769
You can see girls clearer from this point.

318
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,605
Where are the girls?

319
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:31,605
There's none.

320
00:24:35,151 --> 00:24:36,414
Why are you smiling?

321
00:24:36,414 --> 00:24:37,414
Nothing.

322
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,380
Sweetie, this is your third one.
Why are you eating so much today?

323
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:54,853
It seems like you're really into Yo.

324
00:24:54,853 --> 00:24:56,569
He's attractive.

325
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:59,569
He looks simple
but I don't know why he's so charming.

326
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:07,008
Did you mean me?

327
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:07,799
Here.

328
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,589
Rice vermicelli.

329
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:12,725
Stick noodles.

330
00:25:12,725 --> 00:25:15,905
When you said simple, did you mean my lips?

331
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:18,667
Today, I feel like my lips are very pale.
I'm not so confident.

332
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,090
I'll go have a touch up.

333
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,090
You're already pretty.

334
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:43,991
Lomnawwwww: Who lost his boyfriend?

335
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:46,788
Pa_Phana: Huh? Yo's at the noodles place?

336
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:48,885
"I've been looking for him all day."

337
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:52,885
Lomnawwwww: Chill, I just sent you the pic.
Don't fight.

338
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:58,004
Pa_Phana: Keep an eye on him for me.
I'll be there in no time.

339
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:02,004
"The place is at the uni entrance, right?"

340
00:26:06,888 --> 00:26:07,570
"Lom."

341
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,206
"Answer me."

342
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:09,423
"Now!"

343
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:17,721
Lomnawwwww: Yes.

344
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:25,224
Hey, let's head home.

345
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:26,747
What?

346
00:26:26,747 --> 00:26:28,249
You haven't eaten a thing.

347
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:31,249
Hurry up and eat before the noodles get soggy.

348
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:52,115
Can you season it for me too?

349
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,290
Right, about Manfah, I'm sorry.

350
00:27:10,427 --> 00:27:14,182
I shouldn't have answered your phone.

351
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:15,351
Nevermind.

352
00:27:15,351 --> 00:27:20,323
If you didn't answer, would you know
that there's nothing between me and her?

353
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:24,323
So you'd stop being mad at me
for getting myself involved with the girl you like.

354
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:32,220
It's not like that.

355
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:34,849
The thing is...

356
00:27:42,866 --> 00:27:44,631
Yeah, it's finished.

357
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:46,896
Ma'am, can I have a check, please?

358
00:27:46,896 --> 00:27:51,905
250 Baht, dear. Can you walk to me?
I'm washing the dishes.

359
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:53,539
Or you can leave it on the table.

360
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,539
Alright. 250.

361
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:01,143
I'm gonna get going now, Kit and Beam.

362
00:28:01,143 --> 00:28:02,143
This meal's on me.

363
00:28:06,366 --> 00:28:07,366
Bye-bye.

364
00:28:20,127 --> 00:28:21,127
Yo.

365
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:27,599
This is very late.

366
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,320
Why didn't you tell me that you're out?

367
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Kit and Beam, did you tell Pha that I was here?

368
00:28:37,207 --> 00:28:38,893
Yo.

369
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:41,229
Let's talk nicely.

370
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:43,031
What's there to talk about?

371
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,497
Why don't you talk to that girl named Ging?

372
00:28:45,497 --> 00:28:46,629
Yo.

373
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:48,384
I've already said sorry.

374
00:28:48,384 --> 00:28:50,301
I'm sorry that I got involved with them.

375
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:52,017
I was just being sarcastic to you.

376
00:28:52,017 --> 00:28:54,278
But you haven't ended it.

377
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:56,278
I still see that you are still talking.

378
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,375
Yo is quite brutal today.

379
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,799
Take a look.

380
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,980
See? I barely reply.

381
00:29:12,615 --> 00:29:15,615
Yo, wait up, Yo.

382
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:20,671
And why did you let me read those messages?

383
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:23,106
I just wanted to let you know
that I got no interest in her.

384
00:29:23,106 --> 00:29:26,106
She sent me messages but I didn't reply.

385
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,538
Ah, here.

386
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:32,092
BLOCK.

387
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,902
You didn't have to do that
if you didn't want to.

388
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:40,902
I can do anything
if it makes you stop being mad at me.

389
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,215
Or if you're still not happy,

390
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,674
why don't I just unblock her...

391
00:29:46,064 --> 00:29:48,986
and take a pic of me smooching you
and send it to her?

392
00:29:48,986 --> 00:29:50,788
C'mon, let's do that now.

393
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:51,873
What?

394
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,041
No, I'm going home.

395
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:01,546
No, let's clear things up.

396
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,079
Yo.

397
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:09,591
I'm sorry for making you mad at me.

398
00:30:12,072 --> 00:30:13,072
Mmm.

399
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:16,876
You can be mad at me all you want,

400
00:30:16,876 --> 00:30:19,040
or get angry with me all you need,

401
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:22,566
you can be silly all you want.

402
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:24,747
But can I ask for one thing?

403
00:30:26,046 --> 00:30:28,893
Reply to my messages and answer my calls.

404
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:31,364
Tell me when you go out or do something.

405
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:34,364
I'm worried, you know, Yo.

406
00:30:37,725 --> 00:30:41,725
Then, sleep with me tonight.

407
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:44,906
I haven't been able to concentrate
on my studies for days now.

408
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,661
Really, Pha?

409
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:49,700
If I come over, you won't study anyway.

410
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,144
What will you be doing, Pha?

411
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,144
Yeah, what is it gonna be?

412
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,024
Well, the same thing Ming and Fourth do to you both.

413
00:31:01,446 --> 00:31:02,446
Are you done?

414
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,086
It's on me.

415
00:31:12,552 --> 00:31:15,857
Take it as a celebration of me and Yo
making up with each other.

416
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:18,371
That's the way it's gotta be.

417
00:31:18,371 --> 00:31:20,083
Let's go, Yo. Let's head back.

418
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,962
No, I'm gonna go see Ming.

419
00:31:21,962 --> 00:31:23,961
C'mon, let's go.

420
00:31:23,961 --> 00:31:25,961
Don't be so stubborn, hurry up!

421
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:33,213
Thank you, Lom.

422
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:34,556
It's on me.

423
00:31:34,556 --> 00:31:35,556
Lom!

424
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,652
I'm sorry, Yo.

425
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:41,588
I didn't mean to.

426
00:31:41,588 --> 00:31:43,588
Yo, c'mon, let's go.

427
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I think we won't get to study at Pha's tonight.

428
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:53,779
Come on, Fourth is waiting for you, isn't he?

429
00:31:53,779 --> 00:32:03,179
"M.I.N.G: Kit, it's late.
You should come back now. I miss you."

430
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,339
Ming is waiting for you too.

431
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:07,766
You look happy now.

432
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:11,766
What? My family just transfered me the money.

433
00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:14,188
C'mon, let's go.

434
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:26,119
This is Pha's treat.

435
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:28,215
We're off, you!

436
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,435
We're off, handsome!

437
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:31,069
Don't stare at Yo again.

438
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:32,069
My friend gets jealous.

439
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:38,339
What are you laughing at?

440
00:32:38,339 --> 00:32:41,339
I know, you don't have to tease me.

441
00:32:42,598 --> 00:32:45,598
It's nothing. It's just that
I won't see a beautiful thing.

442
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:48,863
So are you still not done?

443
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:51,207
He's my cousin's boyfriend.

444
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:53,302
Why are you being so fussy?

445
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:57,702
I mean, you sit next to me,
and I don't get to see a beautiful thing.

446
00:33:03,028 --> 00:33:04,744
If you sit next to me,
it's difficult to look at.

447
00:33:05,005 --> 00:33:06,005
Do you know that?

448
00:33:08,265 --> 00:33:11,440
You mean Yo, I know.

449
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,833
Why would I be interested in the one who's taken.

450
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,770
I just wanted to get on your nerves.

451
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,770
What for?

452
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:22,837
Are you not mad at all?

453
00:33:22,837 --> 00:33:25,252
Why would I be mad?

454
00:33:25,252 --> 00:33:26,252
Really?

455
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:39,297
Eat up and shut up.

456
00:33:49,222 --> 00:33:50,222
C'mon.

457
00:33:54,382 --> 00:33:55,382
That's good.

458
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,850
Good boy.

459
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:05,387
There.

460
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:50,142
"One nung: Have you seen it, guys? Our teacher wants us
in his class tomorrow. My Saturday, darn it!"

461
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:51,642
"KengGood: I think it's good. We'll gain more knowledge."

462
00:34:51,642 --> 00:34:53,527
"Tatataa.: Then can you go alone?
And then give us the lecture you take."

463
00:34:53,527 --> 00:34:55,580
"KengGood: I can't take lectures for you guys all the time.
Or else, you'll have a hard time in the future."

464
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:01,080
"One nung: Now, you got lectured by Keng
before our teacher! Haha."

465
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:26,969
What?

466
00:35:26,969 --> 00:35:29,969
I just woke up and I look this handsome.

467
00:35:52,468 --> 00:35:55,601
"Tarntatchtatchtatch: Why did you have to squint your eyes?"

468
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:59,601
Hey, why is he up so early?

469
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:12,056
"It's my character."

470
00:36:12,056 --> 00:36:19,071
"Tarntatchtatchtatch: Then I'll be dead."

471
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:21,790
Calm down, calm down.

472
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:25,011
My heart is gonna stop.

473
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:27,011
Calm down.

474
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:43,206
"Do I have to save your life?"

475
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:44,706
"Tarntatchtatchtatch: No, just hurry up,
get dressed and get to class."

476
00:36:58,255 --> 00:37:01,255
Tatch, what spell have you casted on me?

477
00:37:54,908 --> 00:37:55,908
Okay.

478
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:06,786
What a mess.

479
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:18,965
Car stealer!

480
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:26,428
Darn, you can also dress up nicely?

481
00:38:27,902 --> 00:38:31,902
If Tatch sees you like this, he'll die.

482
00:38:37,821 --> 00:38:39,418
Are you mad at me?

483
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:43,418
I was the one who brought you two together.

484
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,557
Did you ask me if I wanted that?

485
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:00,035
Man, Man, what's wrong?

486
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:03,081
I fought with Tatch.

487
00:39:03,081 --> 00:39:05,382
Lom, help me.

488
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:08,145
Are you alright?

489
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,400
Lom isn't answering his phone.

490
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,746
You guys, stay here, I'll go look for him.

491
00:39:11,746 --> 00:39:13,588
Lom, are you close to Tatch?

00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:17,014
Recently, I feel like Tatch has changed.

493
00:39:17,014 --> 00:39:20,146
Do you happen to know why, Lom?

494
00:39:20,146 --> 00:39:23,238
He looked so troubled when you disappeared.

495
00:39:23,238 --> 00:39:24,831
Really?

496
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:25,464
Yeah.

497
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,098
Mmm.

498
00:39:26,098 --> 00:39:28,649
Manfah told me something.

499
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:30,829
So, do you like girls or guys?

500
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:31,804
Answer me.

501
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:34,804
So I'd know whether I should continue or stop it here.
