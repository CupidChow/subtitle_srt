1
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,162
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:58,790
But I really gotta do it this time.

3
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,474
And did you have to give them
your number and your Line ID?

4
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:05,474
Are you gonna talk behind my back
and then continue at the camp discreetly?

5
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:07,504
I think I'm good enough.

6
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:12,504
If you make my cousin sad,
I know where to find you.

7
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:15,315
I don't wanna take advantage of the drunk.

8
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,869
From all this, Pha's keeping an eye on me already.

9
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:20,141
Pha won't know.

10
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:20,841
Huh?

11
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:29,844
Are you alright?

12
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:30,998
You're red.

13
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,071
Well, about last night.

14
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:53,544
This couple is so sweet.

15
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:57,037
What did you say?

16
00:02:57,037 --> 00:02:58,399
What did you say about me?

17
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,399
Nothing.

18
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,791
Let's go.

19
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:15,969
"Panon: Today, I'll set up a booth at your uni."

20
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:19,969
"Will I see you?"

21
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:35,263
"You read but you didn't reply. What's that about?"

22
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:50,156
Lom, I won't be able to see you
at your soccer practice this afternoon.

23
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:52,205
I need to go to the clinic.

24
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,924
Oh, really?

25
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:54,924
Make yourself look astonishing!

26
00:03:56,772 --> 00:04:00,415
And tomorrow,
will you really be there with me at my photoshoot?

27
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:04,391
Of course, I will.
I'm your assistant.

28
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,612
That's good.

29
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:09,612
Then, I'll text you after I'm done
with the beauty clinic.

30
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:10,876
Alright.

31
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,430
Are you off tomorrow?

32
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,024
I'm working at the ward tomorrow, so no.

33
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:28,117
Really?

34
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,207
But tomorrow is Loy Kratong day.

35
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:33,301
I was gonna ask you to come float the kratongs
with me at the back of the uni.

36
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:35,191
My teacher put me on a standby at the ward.

37
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,998
In case there are accidents on Loy Kratong day.

38
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:41,251
But there couldn't really be
severe accidents on Loy Kratong day.

39
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:45,573
It's the preparation,
so we're ready to face this after graduation.

40
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,573
Okay.

41
00:04:51,144 --> 00:04:53,488
Are you gonna be okay being on your own?

42
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:55,042
What choice do I have?

43
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,679
Pha and Yo aren't available too.

44
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,679
So what more could I do?

45
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,785
Who is this guy?

46
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:07,288
He liked all your pics.

47
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:10,142
Oh, a friend from high school.

48
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:11,142
Oh?

49
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,667
He studies abroad.

50
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:17,308
And he used to be on a cover of a magazine.

51
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:19,441
Why is his last name so familiar?

52
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:22,616
Oh, it's the name of the old family.

53
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,156
Why? You like him?

54
00:05:24,156 --> 00:05:24,955
Are you crazy?

55
00:05:24,955 --> 00:05:29,438
I just wanted to know if you had
any other friends than Pha and Beam.

56
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:32,438
His name is Kung.
There's nothing to worry about.

57
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:38,326
I'm just a poor engineer.
How could I beat a guy with such a profile?

58
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,279
Well, he commented on all of your pics.
Does he like you?

59
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,877
We're just friends.

60
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,763
I used to help him hit on a girl.

61
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,116
And what if he hits on you?

62
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,713
You're so imaginative.

63
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,713
It's just an assumption.

64
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,670
So you really can't go tomorrow?

65
00:06:02,806 --> 00:06:03,806
I can't.

66
00:06:04,182 --> 00:06:05,182
Okay.

67
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:30,848
Hello.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,166
Darn, Kit, I'm back in Thailand, you know.

69
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,166
When I commented on your pic,
why didn't you reply?

70
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,907
Man, lower your voice.
My ear hurts.

71
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:43,347
How are Pha and Beam doing?

72
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:45,690
Are you all still together?

73
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,745
Pha went with his boyfriend.
Also did Beam.

74
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:52,206
Hmm, so they're not single doctors, huh?

75
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:53,808
I'm in front of your room now.

76
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:54,808
What?

77
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,393
What the hell are you doing here?
It's late.

78
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,245
Well, I miss you, my friend.

79
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,707
I don't miss you at all.

80
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:14,707
Hmm, don't act so tough.

81
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:20,218
So you're here alone?

82
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:24,218
That's good.
So I can do anything to you, right?

83
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:29,945
I'm just kidding, man.

84
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:32,534
Then can I spend a night here?

85
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,343
You got a house.
Why did you come see me here?

86
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:37,073
Well, I miss you.

87
00:07:37,073 --> 00:07:40,073
I miss you all the time
wherever I go in this world.

88
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,830
You're being weird.

89
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:46,226
And have you heard?

90
00:07:46,226 --> 00:07:47,945
I'm single now.

91
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,709
Really?

92
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:53,244
What about you?
You got anyone?

93
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:54,743
I do.

94
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:56,415
Who is it?

95
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,921
Why don't I know about this?

96
00:07:59,921 --> 00:08:01,650
C'mon, let me see.

97
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,650
Is she pretty?

98
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:07,211
Where?

99
00:08:08,094 --> 00:08:10,094
On the screen.

100
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,270
Hey!

101
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:17,749
Since when were you into guys?

102
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,771
How long have you been together?

103
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:20,771
Many years already.

104
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:30,665
Kit, if you liked guys,
why didn't you tell me?

105
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,650
How could you let me be
the only one looking at you?

106
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,280
That makes me sad, you know.

107
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,000
Darn, what is this?

108
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,215
Wait.

109
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:45,215
Let's talk about this first.

110
00:08:47,714 --> 00:08:49,714
I don't think you want to talk with me.

111
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,889
If you knew, you would be shocked.

112
00:08:54,489 --> 00:08:56,489
What is it? Tell me.

113
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:03,061
Do you really wanna know?

114
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,582
Kit.

115
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:14,964
I like you.

116
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,100
No.

117
00:09:17,912 --> 00:09:19,912
I liked you.

118
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:25,549
When we were in high school,
we were close.

119
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:30,351
And I just tried to spend time with you.

120
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:35,872
And the reason I didn't tell you then...

121
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:38,135
was because I was afraid that
you might get uncomfortable.

122
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:40,135
And you might get away from me.

123
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:50,312
So now I'm a little mad that suddenly,
you like guys now.

124
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:52,836
I don't know.

125
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:55,143
I feel like...

126
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:57,004
I got here first.

127
00:09:57,004 --> 00:09:58,504
But it's too late.

128
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,591
If I'd known, I would've hit on you then.

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,516
Well...

130
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:10,516
I loved you.

131
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,286
Nevermind.

132
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:19,035
I can find a new one.

133
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,799
It's my fault I didn't tell you.

134
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,799
That I didn't do anything to let you know.

135
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:27,141
Come and drink with me tonight.

136
00:10:27,984 --> 00:10:30,537
And tomorrow, go float kratongs with me.

137
00:10:30,537 --> 00:10:31,842
Huh?

138
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:32,435
Wait, tomorrow, I gotta...

139
00:10:32,435 --> 00:10:33,990
Shut up.

140
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,080
You hurt me so you need to pay for it.

141
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,663
Go out tonight and drink with me.

142
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:39,663
Now.

143
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:47,408
I'm at the ward.

144
00:10:47,408 --> 00:10:48,296
Just go to sleep.

145
00:10:48,296 --> 00:10:50,518
I'll see you soon.

146
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:51,827
I'll see you tomorrow.

147
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:53,484
Head back soon after you finish your work.

148
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:54,484
Okay.

149
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,300
I'll take two.

150
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,373
So, troublemaker?

151
00:11:09,373 --> 00:11:10,591
Kit.

152
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,775
Girls at your uni are so awesome.

153
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:16,772
Don't you dare get any of them here.

154
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:18,653
These are all my juniors.

155
00:11:18,653 --> 00:11:20,295
Shut up.

156
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:24,295
You broke my heart and you still
wouldn't let me do what I wanted?

157
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,577
Not answering?

158
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:40,714
No.

159
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:42,307
Where are you?

160
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:43,807
By the pond.

161
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:49,634
You said you were at the ward.

162
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:51,227
Why did you have to lie?

163
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:53,739
And who the hell is this?

164
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:57,620
Is it that guy with the weird last name?

165
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,720
Yeah, but...

166
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,000
And why did you have to lie?

167
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,145
Hey, could you please calm down?

168
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:04,145
No, I cannot.

169
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,294
What's going on here?

170
00:12:09,294 --> 00:12:10,816
Why are you looking at me?

171
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,197
Ming.

172
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,252
Calm down, Ming.

173
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:15,597
I cannot be calm anymore.

174
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:16,853
It just made me think.

175
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:17,683
Think about what?

176
00:12:17,683 --> 00:12:18,691
That you have someone else.

177
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:20,117
Someone else?
No, I don't.

178
00:12:20,117 --> 00:12:21,296
And what would you have me think?

179
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:22,814
I didn't see you at the dorm.

180
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,237
You didn't answer any of my calls.

181
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:26,461
You went over to see me?

182
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,139
Yeah.

183
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,180
He's with me.

184
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
You want a piece of me?

185
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:31,448
You want a piece of me?

186
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,871
Well, do you want to do this?

187
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,070
It's just like what you heard.

188
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:40,868
So what now?

189
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:44,168
Kung, stop it.
He's pissed off now.

190
00:12:50,263 --> 00:12:52,316
Are you having fun?

191
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:56,316
So jealous like that,
he must really love you.

192
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,420
Hurry up and go after him.

193
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,100
I'll go look for girls alone.

194
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,316
Hey, don't ditch me.

195
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,570
If you keep being with me like this,

196
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,094
your boyfriend will shoot my guts off.

197
00:13:10,094 --> 00:13:11,094
Off you go.

198
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,270
See ya later.

199
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,252
What? Kung!

200
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,896
He's not my lover.

201
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,896
He just tried to provoke you.

202
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:42,000
Seriously, I'm not mad at anything except...

203
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,181
lying.

204
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,537
I was afraid that you might misunderstand.

205
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:47,889
I already have.

206
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:50,276
I know that you have.

207
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:52,657
Now, you can understand it correctly.

208
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,172
There's really nothing.

209
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:58,384
He asked me to go with him.

210
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:01,256
I'm sorry for not telling.

211
00:14:01,256 --> 00:14:02,256
Okay.

212
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:05,119
Don't do it again next time.

213
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:06,709
Be honest if anything comes up.

214
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:08,431
Don't lie.

215
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,482
I really don't like that.

216
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:11,482
Alright.

217
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,623
I've already talked to Kung.

218
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:18,678
He said there's nothing.

219
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:20,570
It's my fault.

220
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,070
I was overly jealous.

221
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,251
It's good that you know that.

222
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:30,506
But can you not see him again?

223
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:32,311
He said that he used to like you.

224
00:14:32,311 --> 00:14:34,816
That doesn't mean that he's quit liking you.

225
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:36,816
Hey, but he's my friend.

226
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,237
Can I ask you not to?

227
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:43,878
Alright.

228
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:46,878
But if we have a reunion, I'd like to go.

229
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:53,686
Alright. I'll let you do that.

230
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:03,733
What's wrong?

231
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:08,296
I have to hold you tightly.

232
00:15:08,296 --> 00:15:11,098
Or you would be naughty running off
to another guy again.

233
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:12,098
You!

234
00:15:56,193 --> 00:15:57,193
What? Tatch!

235
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:04,147
Am, I don't know what's wrong with Tatch.

236
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:06,740
He wouldn't let me go to his room in all of a sudden.

237
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,626
Huh? And you're asking me?

238
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,090
And how could I know?

239
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,398
I'm here at the soccer practice with you.

240
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:17,398
What is it?
Can't you not be together for just a moment?

241
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:21,696
Alright, alright, how about this?

242
00:16:21,696 --> 00:16:24,797
Why don't you head back with me?

243
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:28,115
So you can knock on his door.

244
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,785
Is that a good idea?

245
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:32,285
Yeah, that sounds interesting.

246
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:37,084
Alright, then, hurry up and pack your things.
Then we can go.

247
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
Take this, will ya?

248
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,503
Hurry up.

249
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:47,593
Tatch!

250
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:50,018
Tatch!

251
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:52,994
Tatch!

252
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:55,374
What's up?

253
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:55,887
Why didn't you let me...

254
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:56,943
Ouch.

255
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,034
Hey, Tatch!

256
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:01,034
What did you do?

257
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:03,787
Whom did you get into a fight with?

258
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:04,553
It's Panon.

259
00:17:04,553 --> 00:17:07,442
He ambushed me before I went to the clinic.

260
00:17:07,442 --> 00:17:09,461
I shouldn't have let you go alone.

261
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,310
Forget it.

262
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,810
How could you forget it?
You were punched.

263
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:15,951
I'll take care of him.

264
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,838
I said, forget it.

265
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:19,838
Am, you don't need to do anything.

266
00:17:21,678 --> 00:17:23,678
He is in the worse shape that I am now.

267
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:30,936
Alright, gotcha. But next time,
if you get into a fight, you need to call us.

268
00:17:31,295 --> 00:17:33,930
We're always here for you.

269
00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:36,029
Mmm. Thanks a lot.

270
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:38,397
I'm off.

271
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:40,165
See ya.

272
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,227
Why do you always make me worry?

273
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:17,037
That bonehead Panon, how could he do this?

274
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:21,412
Mmm, I think he'll leave me alone.

275
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,169
I'm freakin' mad. I wanna hit him.

276
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:37,343
You're so sweet.

277
00:18:38,148 --> 00:18:40,148
Well, you can't take care of yourself.

278
00:18:48,564 --> 00:18:50,064
Let me see your face.

279
00:18:55,806 --> 00:18:57,806
Are you gonna put the balm on my face?

280
00:18:59,162 --> 00:19:00,662
No, I'll put it in your eyes.

281
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,130
So are you really gonna kill me?

282
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,518
I was just teasing you.

283
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,066
From now on, we're gonna stick to each other.

284
00:19:18,999 --> 00:19:19,999
Alright.

285
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:23,429
If you get hurt, I'll get hurt too.

286
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,429
Got that?

287
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Where are you going?

288
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:36,565
I'm gonna get changed.

289
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Tonight, I'm gonna spend a night here with you.

290
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,214
Oh, that means, I won't get to sleep all night.

291
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:49,231
Do you want me to stay or leave?

292
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:51,776
Stay, please.

293
00:21:19,489 --> 00:21:23,489
Don't. I want you to rest.

294
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:54,832
Wow, look at that, I'm Gordon Ramsay.

295
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:00,766
Wow.

296
00:26:01,243 --> 00:26:02,243
This smells so good.

297
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:03,849
But is it edible?

298
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:08,024
Are you gonna eat it or not?

299
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,024
Of course.

300
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,611
How could you be so sweet?

301
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,133
Well, I'm your assistant.

302
00:26:18,383 --> 00:26:19,383
Please.

303
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:41,958
Hmm. This is so good.

304
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,801
Why don't you eat it?

305
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:46,258
I wanna watch you eat first.

306
00:26:46,258 --> 00:26:47,258
Alright.

307
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:56,857
Right, Louknam told me that
you got a photoshoot this afternoon.

308
00:26:56,857 --> 00:26:59,660
Therefore, you need to wear makeup.

309
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,138
No need to.
I'm already good-looking.

310
00:27:03,138 --> 00:27:06,138
I don't want anyone to say that
I don't take care of you well.

311
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:10,943
Here we go again.

312
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,882
I've told you this before, right?

313
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:18,012
If anyone says something bad about you,

314
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,012
I will resign immediately.

315
00:27:21,396 --> 00:27:23,396
I just wanna do my job well.

316
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:27,706
Can I ask you something?

317
00:27:27,706 --> 00:27:29,706
Why does everyone take this contest seriously?

318
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:37,705
I'm not so sure,
but I think it started with Pha.

319
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:38,705
Oh?

320
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:46,090
Pha was the one who increased
the standard of this uni's Star and Moon contest.

321
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,182
So many people get more and more interested each year...

322
00:27:48,182 --> 00:27:50,525
in who's gonna be the new Star and Moon.

323
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:54,164
It's so awful that I placed the second from the bottom.

324
00:27:54,164 --> 00:27:55,954
I saw the video of your contest.

325
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:58,381
You didn't do anything wrong,

326
00:27:58,381 --> 00:28:00,976
Every faculty sent their diamond guys in.

327
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:04,113
So they gained more attention from the judges.

328
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:07,621
You can just say that I'm not handsome enough, Tatch.

329
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,621
No, it's not like that.

330
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,997
Lom, you take a look at this.

331
00:28:15,997 --> 00:28:17,997
Which finger can you see the most clearly?

332
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,467
So, this one.

333
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:29,059
The other fingers are smooth,
not bruised, not scarred, most perfect.

334
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:35,367
But the one the you chose has its cons.
Also, it's the one with the scar.

335
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:39,462
I like the one who stands out like my ring finger.

336
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,808
Not perfect, scarred, but significant on his own.

337
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,581
He's cute and caring.

338
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:54,059
And he complains a lot and overthinks.

339
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:55,559
Also, his legs are short.

340
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,153
You almost got me.

341
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:00,961
But where do short legs coming from?

342
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:02,140
You're a bully!

343
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,064
Other people may not see you but that's not me.

344
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:09,064
I always see you clearly,
no matter where you are.

345
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,284
Okay, I'm very shy now.

346
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:17,461
But I gotta have my face taken care of first.

347
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:18,848
That's enough.

348
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,848
I'm gonna go get you some more water.

349
00:29:25,157 --> 00:29:28,695
"Panon: Lom, so you really don't believe me?"

350
00:29:28,695 --> 00:29:31,695
"Tatch is really a bad person."

351
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:36,877
Are you alright?

352
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:51,183
What are you doing?

353
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:53,809
I'm gonna post Instagram story of us.

354
00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:56,650
So everyone will see that you're with me now.

355
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,698
Wait, look at me now.

356
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:00,698
What's wrong?
You're cute. Come here.

357
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:07,598
Hey, no.

358
00:30:08,316 --> 00:30:09,121
C'mon.

359
00:30:09,121 --> 00:30:10,256
No, no, no, no, no.

360
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:11,803
C'mon.

361
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:12,803
Just a bit.

362
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:23,287
C'mon, take a good shot.

363
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,287
I'm doing it now.

364
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:45,803
I don't understand why
all these silver accessories match you so well.

365
00:31:05,186 --> 00:31:06,186
Thank you.

366
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,667
Tarntatch, do you know that uni's Moon?

367
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:15,906
He stares at you really intensely.

368
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:19,407
A little bit but we're not close.

369
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:24,407
If it were out of ten,
I would rate you both a minus.

370
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,926
What? What? And who?

371
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:29,926
It's nothing.

372
00:31:31,376 --> 00:31:32,376
You're being weird.

373
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,309
I know there's something.

374
00:31:35,069 --> 00:31:35,701
Louknam.

375
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:36,214
Huh?

376
00:31:36,214 --> 00:31:40,214
I just think that the makeup artist
highlighted my nose bridge too much.

377
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,033
Could you please tell him for me?

378
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:44,580
C'mon, let me take a look at you first.

379
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,381
Oh, that's really high.
Almost like a rhino horn.

380
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:50,310
Excuse me.
Take a look at this.

381
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,514
It's pretty to me.

382
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:52,514
This is not good at all!

383
00:31:56,882 --> 00:32:00,640
If someone knows that
you and Panon got into a fight,

384
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,856
I think you might be cut off from the contest.

385
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:06,356
That's right.
Why doesn't Panon act normally?

386
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
At least, while we're working.

387
00:32:16,165 --> 00:32:18,226
XXU, are you ready?

388
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:25,226
Yes, we're always ready.
Look how gorgeous they are.

389
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:28,432
Tatch, you got this!

390
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Mmm.

391
00:32:31,511 --> 00:32:33,894
Let's go.

392
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:35,570
We're ready.

393
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,331
Let me take a look at your face,
your hair, your skin...

394
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:42,798
That's it. We got it.
We deserve it, our faculty!

395
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:43,798
Ready?

396
00:32:52,552 --> 00:32:55,052
Could you please move behind her a bit?

397
00:33:06,473 --> 00:33:08,935
I'll add more props, okay?

398
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:09,445
Alright.

399
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,445
Move the chair in.

400
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Why are you so close to Tarntatch?

401
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,799
We're seeing each other.

402
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,143
He's a bad person.
He stole my brother's girlfriend.

403
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:23,161
Excuse me.

404
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:24,509
Excuse me!

405
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:25,972
Excuse me, let's continue.

406
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,944
Okay.

407
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,353
So are you guys having a problem?

408
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:35,353
Mmm.

409
00:34:36,851 --> 00:34:41,003
Don't tell me that those bruises
are from the fight with him...

410
00:34:41,003 --> 00:34:42,003
Yeah.

411
00:34:42,808 --> 00:34:44,907
Are you guys fighting for Lom?

412
00:34:44,907 --> 00:34:46,407
Something like that.

413
00:34:47,623 --> 00:34:49,714
Dang! Lom's so hot.

414
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,940
But I don't think you should worry.

415
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,029
From what I see, Lom's not into him at all.

416
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:57,535
I'll help you keep watch, okay?

417
00:34:57,535 --> 00:34:58,535
Thank you.

418
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Not a problem.

419
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:21,501
It's good that you still got some time for a break.

420
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,454
We'll continue later in the late afternoon.

421
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,454
Mmm, it's good.

422
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,657
Are you seeing anyone from Fine Arts?

423
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:33,131
You come here often.

424
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,631
What? I know every good, tasty place all around uni.

425
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,015
Well, that's so you.

426
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:46,833
So...what did you and Panon talk about?

427
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,833
Panon asked me why we were so close to each other.

428
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:53,275
And what did you say?

429
00:35:53,275 --> 00:35:55,868
I...told him...

430
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:57,868
that we were seeing each other.

431
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:05,547
And what did he say?

432
00:36:05,547 --> 00:36:07,218
The same thing.

433
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:09,913
He tried to convince everyone to hate you.

434
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:13,913
And said that you liked to steal other people's girlfriends.

435
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,764
But...

436
00:36:18,764 --> 00:36:21,151
I don't think he really hates you for real.

437
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:24,151
I think he envies you.

438
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:27,481
Envy? Me?

439
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:29,872
Whoa!

440
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,270
Do you have around three months for me to tell you why?

441
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:39,161
I'm serious.
My life is not something to be dreamt of.

442
00:36:40,423 --> 00:36:43,923
If he envies me,
did he have to punch me like that?

443
00:36:44,892 --> 00:36:46,362
Well, it's possible.

444
00:36:46,362 --> 00:36:50,362
When he envies you,
he convinces other people to hate you.

445
00:36:51,928 --> 00:36:55,928
And when he can do that,
it means his mission is completed.

446
00:36:56,527 --> 00:37:00,027
But I don't think you should mind a guy like that.

447
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,392
I don't want to mind him at all.

448
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:05,690
But he started it first.

449
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,190
And one more thing,
you should quit being near Panon.

450
00:37:10,959 --> 00:37:13,048
I won't be anywhere near him.

451
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:18,048
When you looked at me earlier,
I could feel the rage coming out from your innner thought.

452
00:37:18,731 --> 00:37:20,365
Well, I'm jealous.

453
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,365
Especially, when you're with Panon.

454
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:29,751
Does that mean if I'm not with Panon,
you won't be jealous at all?

455
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,760
Well, I will be jealous anyway.

456
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,039
Tatch.

457
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:50,272
Tatch, how long are you gonna avoid me?

458
00:37:50,272 --> 00:37:52,272
We haven't cleared things up.

459
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
We have.

460
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:01,245
I don't have any feelings for you, Man.

461
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:06,467
That's not true.
You just don't know what you feel.

462
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,360
Man, the thing is...

463
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,788
Lom and I are a couple.

464
00:38:13,788 --> 00:38:15,788
We like each other.

465
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:27,518
That's not true.
You're joking, right?

466
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:29,621
Huh?

467
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:41,672
Lom.

468
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:48,807
You like Tatch?

469
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:03,700
You like him even though
that day you were there for me.

470
00:39:07,987 --> 00:39:11,987
You took me out for a meal.

471
00:39:17,033 --> 00:39:21,033
And you listened to every story
I told you about Tatch?

472
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:26,879
Well, I didn't...

473
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,715
Is this the booth of Faculty of Agriculture?

474
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,057
Yes, it is.

475
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, you're Lomnaw, right?

476
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,746
You look better than on Instagram.

477
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:47,539
Are you here to see Tatch?

478
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:48,855
In what way?

479
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:50,535
Just coming by

480
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:52,035
to say...I miss him.

481
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:56,628
So stop bothering me.

482
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,936
My boyfriend doesn't like it.

483
00:39:59,944 --> 00:40:00,944
Lom...
