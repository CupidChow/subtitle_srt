1
00:01:55,552 --> 00:01:57,936
I have something to ask you.

2
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:00,352
Can you not say the word real Moon and fake Moon?

3
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:01,528
It sounds weird.

4
00:02:01,528 --> 00:02:02,787
Then what would you like me to call it?

5
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:05,130
Moon number one and Moon number two.

6
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:09,296
That's right.

7
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,391
It's like they planned to be here.

8
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,735
Hey, Yo.

9
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:16,709
Pha didn't call them here, right?

10
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,339
I don't think so.

11
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:22,181
But if he did, this won't end well.

12
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:23,237
And who's this?

13
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,748
Lomnaw's friend.

14
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:28,748
And who are you?

15
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:36,132
Who did something to me?

16
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:39,350
Guys, take a look, my followers got bigger.

17
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,769
It has skyrocketed.

18
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:42,938
I know!

19
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,283
Take a look at this.

20
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,947
Tatch posted a pic of you
when you weren't noticing.

21
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,506
Tatch!

22
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,848
You posted a pic of me on your Instagram story?

23
00:03:00,443 --> 00:03:02,318
So?

24
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:05,455
Then more and more people would follow me.

25
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,504
Isn't that a good thing?

26
00:03:07,504 --> 00:03:09,970
You should be glad that I helped you.

27
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,446
You helped a competitor?

28
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:15,208
You're so not sincere.

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,680
I can upload anything I want to.

30
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:24,058
Alright, so you're gonna play it this way?

31
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,279
Well, this is my Instagram.

32
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,599
Lomnawwwww: Lonely Boy @Tarntatchtatchtatch
Please go follow him.

33
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:28,805
cha.yeyencha: What's between you two?
I saw you playing around. So cute.

34
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:38,916
Tarntatchtatchtatch: So what do you think?

35
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,846
You!

36
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,363
What?

37
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:49,711
How could reply a comment like that?

38
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:51,928
How would other people think?

39
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,475
Didn't you start it first? You posted a pic of me.

40
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:58,272
Well, you posted a story of me first.

41
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:01,279
I just posted it. I didn't think of anything.

42
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,920
I...

43
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,929
But you made a big deal out of it.

44
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,184
Then I'll delete the pic.

45
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,184
Chicken...

46
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:15,031
Just a few comments and you got this mad?

47
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:20,871
You and I both know the truth.

48
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,429
When someone makes a comment like that,

49
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:25,980
you just reply a little bit.

50
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Would it hurt anyone?

51
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,003
Hey, hey.

52
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:41,003
Glasses is here.

53
00:05:44,502 --> 00:05:46,969
I think God wants you to have pics on Instagram.

54
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:50,528
Whoa! The Glasses? He never took any pics for me.

55
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:54,528
The last time at the Star and Moon contest,
it's like he was forced to do it.

56
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,134
Really?

57
00:05:56,134 --> 00:05:57,057
Yeah.

58
00:05:57,057 --> 00:06:00,579
C'mon, he might have regretted that
and now he wants to take them for you.

59
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:03,967
Hey, but I heard that he can't take
any pics of the idols anymore.

60
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,636
Because he touched the idol's hand
while trying to make a composition.

61
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:08,071
Serves him right.

62
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:10,076
Donkey!

63
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:10,957
Hey, Glasses!

64
00:06:10,957 --> 00:06:11,545
Glasses!

65
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:12,267
Glasses, Glasses!

66
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:13,980
Right.

67
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:15,353
This way, this way.

68
00:06:15,353 --> 00:06:17,353
Tarntatch.

69
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:19,778
Did he forget to wear his glasses?

70
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,328
And aren't those glasses on his face?

71
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,343
Tarntatch.

72
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,695
I've found a location for you for the photoshoot.

73
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:29,695
Please spare the time, this afternoon.

74
00:06:37,357 --> 00:06:39,703
You're a good photographer.

75
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:45,223
But I don't want you to take a pic of me
and then I'll win.

76
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:47,405
Like, absolutely.

77
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,330
And you think that Lom still has a chance to win? Huh?

78
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:55,355
Hey, fattie!

79
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:56,355
Of course, I do.

80
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:03,120
I like what's fair.

81
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
If you can take Lom there,
I'll go to the shooting with you.

82
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:11,815
Me?

83
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,952
I...

84
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:25,974
I think we should skip the class in a bit.

85
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:28,049
What for?

86
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,092
Dance practice.

87
00:07:29,092 --> 00:07:30,272
For TikTok?

88
00:07:30,272 --> 00:07:33,177
Yeah, teach some dance moves.

89
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:37,165
All this time, I...

90
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,777
Lomnaw!

91
00:07:41,276 --> 00:07:42,583
Hey!

92
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,919
Lomnaw!

93
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,005
I'm talking to you here.

94
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:49,835
Oh, darn, Glasses!

95
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:52,717
You're this big, and I don't see you.

96
00:07:52,717 --> 00:07:54,354
Is this a human or a pig?

97
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:56,268
Oh, yeah, what's up?

98
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,448
Er, all this time, I'm sorry.

99
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:00,743
I didn't mean it. I'm really sorry.

100
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:07,743
Oh, er...I didn't think of it that much.

101
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:09,387
Did you overthink?

102
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:12,191
That's good, buddy.

103
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,738
That means you can go to the photoshoot
with me and Tarntatch, right?

104
00:08:15,738 --> 00:08:19,499
Hey, Tong, don't we have to
do something this afternoon?

105
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,130
Yeah, meeting with Bow. I really need to see her.

106
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,881
And you?

107
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:23,892
I can't.

108
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,911
Can I punch you in the face?
I really don't like you. I will punch you.

109
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:34,514
You're annoying. Do I have to beg
a person like you? Can I hit you in the face?

110
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,236
Glasses!

111
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,124
What?

112
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,803
Oops, excuse my language.

113
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:39,140
Er, whom did you talk to?

114
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:40,958
Nothing, buddy.

115
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,590
Er, I just wanted to tell you that...

116
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:45,327
my friends and I here checked our time...

117
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:48,549
And, we're not available this afternoon.

118
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:50,064
I'm...sorry.

119
00:08:50,064 --> 00:08:52,021
It's fine.

120
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:53,159
Next time is alright, buddy.

121
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,159
Okay.

122
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:08,008
Hey, hey, Glasses!

123
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:11,426
Well, I've checked the schedule again.

124
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,479
I looked at the wrong date.

125
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,737
Hey! So, that means you can go with me today, right?

126
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,329
You said it!

127
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:19,249
Excellent!

128
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:20,732
Then see you this afternoon.

129
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:21,484
At the garden.

130
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:22,369
You too, Tarntatch.

131
00:09:22,369 --> 00:09:23,088
See you all, guys!

132
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:23,967
Do your best with the study.

133
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,475
Your parents are worried about you.

134
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:29,011
That's awesome. See you this afternoon!

135
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,555
You're so great!

136
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,565
I'm such an expert.

137
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:40,864
And you, you were great too!

138
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:42,912
You look very handsome every inch.

139
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:45,912
I took like a hundred pics and they're all good.

140
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,465
But in the end, we only want one pic, right?

141
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:51,811
Oh?

142
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:55,604
Mmm, then do you wanna do another shot?

143
00:10:55,604 --> 00:10:56,604
It's your call.

144
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:03,203
There, over there.

145
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:06,007
Hey, you, out!

146
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,883
My best friend would like to have his pic taken.

147
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:09,526
Darn, Glasses.

148
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:27,282
Darn, Glasses got a double standard.

149
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:33,288
No, that's not it. Ten standards, I'd say.

150
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:38,085
Tatch is so good-looking.
I think he will rank the first.

151
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,982
But I don't think so.

152
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,907
Why not?

153
00:11:43,907 --> 00:11:47,907
Glasses would only rank him number two.

154
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,923
Because he's obsessed with the idols.

155
00:11:53,091 --> 00:11:56,606
I can hear that!

156
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,606
Well, it's true.

157
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:04,531
Hey, I think I'm gonna go find something cool to eat.

158
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:05,754
You want anything?

159
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:06,970
I'll come with you.

160
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,694
Stop it right there.
You need to stay for a photoshoot after Tatch.

161
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,510
Just tell me what you need.

162
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:17,510
Alright then, I'll have one bubble milk tea.

163
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,244
And you?

164
00:12:19,244 --> 00:12:23,044
I'll have unsweetened milk tea, no bubbles.

165
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:24,663
One for Tatch and for Glasses.

166
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:25,663
Okay.

167
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:31,706
Let's go sit down.

168
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:32,806
Yeah.

169
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:41,819
Where is Tong?

170
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:43,456
He went to buy some drinks.

171
00:12:45,793 --> 00:12:48,301
When did you become so close to Tatch?

172
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,563
Me?

173
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:54,326
Well, he and I are in the same dorm.

174
00:12:54,326 --> 00:12:57,126
And it's a coincidence that
our rooms are opposite to each other.

175
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:58,721
That's how we became close.

176
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:01,026
Has he ever gotten on your nerves?

177
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:02,866
No. He seems normal.

178
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:06,658
Then why does he always get on my nerves?

179
00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:10,220
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

180
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:15,011
Tatch, Lom here asked me why
you liked to get on his nerves so much.

181
00:13:15,653 --> 00:13:17,703
How should I answer him?

182
00:13:17,703 --> 00:13:19,703
No! No need to answer.

183
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:25,519
I'd like to know if he wants to be
our faculty's representative or...

184
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:28,998
if he just wants to tease me.

185
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:32,594
I mean, right now,
I wanna know if he's serious with this.

186
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:36,594
Or if he's just trying to annoy me.

187
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,615
Look at his story post.

188
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:44,213
My followers went up.

189
00:13:44,213 --> 00:13:45,802
You think too much.

190
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:49,725
He might just wanna post it, that's all.

191
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,662
But I'm not okay with it.

192
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:57,166
Especially, right now, everyone knows that
we compete on the number of followers.

193
00:13:57,166 --> 00:14:02,419
I want him to get serious
and not post anything about me.

194
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:05,586
He doesn't have to ask other people to follow me.

195
00:14:05,586 --> 00:14:08,134
Because I want him to be the real Moon.

196
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:10,134
The real winner.

197
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:14,933
Well, actually,...

198
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,167
It's your turn now.

199
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:21,180
Go have your pics taken.

200
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:27,042
Hurry up, don't loiter.

201
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:29,042
See, we're running out of light.

202
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,634
What did you say?

203
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:37,108
What? I didn't say anything.

204
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:38,286
Chill out, man.

205
00:14:38,286 --> 00:14:39,833
No, you, chill out.

206
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:42,255
Why are you looking at me like that?

207
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,628
I, I didn't say anything.

208
00:14:44,628 --> 00:14:48,003
There, take a look.

209
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:05,673
Can you make a better pose?

210
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:09,727
Relax.

211
00:15:22,275 --> 00:15:25,993
This is...so different from what I thought.

212
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,993
Normally, Glasses always has a problem with Lom.

213
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:34,327
But today, it looks like someone else
is having that problem instead.

214
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:39,087
Right, what does Tatch have to
be bothered with Lom's shooting?

215
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
It's a no.

216
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:45,005
You gotta smile with your teeth.

217
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,016
Smile. Smile.

218
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,232
Bigger.

219
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:49,362
That's right.

220
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:50,362
That's good.

221
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:55,364
Let me see the pics.

222
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:00,592
Don't look so stiff.

223
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:03,346
If you do that, I'll win.

224
00:16:03,346 --> 00:16:05,444
You don't have to act so tough.

225
00:16:05,444 --> 00:16:06,659
Smile more.

226
00:16:07,493 --> 00:16:09,795
Smile and get all sweet.

227
00:16:09,795 --> 00:16:11,795
Darn, Coach Tatch, he is.

228
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,923
Darn, man. Tatch, I have to go now.

229
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,431
But we still got light.

230
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:22,606
Yeah, that, I know.

231
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,651
But today, my idols will be on the stage.

232
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,910
I need to take pics of them.

233
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,457
But you were banned.

234
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:32,457
Right, I'm still banned but I got this...

235
00:16:32,664 --> 00:16:34,664
With this scope, I can see from afar.

236
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,977
How many pics of Lom have you taken?

237
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:45,977
Mmm, around 400-500 pics, I think.

238
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,016
How about me?

239
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:49,857
Oh, a thousand.

240
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:53,364
How could that be fair?

241
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:55,847
Well, that's true.

242
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,522
Then, how about this?

243
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:00,821
I'll send today's pics to Lom first
so he can post the pic first.

244
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,089
You have fewer pics...

245
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,883
No, you have more pics,
but he gets to post the pics first.

246
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:10,883
I think that's fair.

247
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:12,802
Okay, got it.

248
00:17:13,942 --> 00:17:14,865
Okay?

249
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:15,623
Mmm, okay.

250
00:17:15,623 --> 00:17:17,288
Then, I'm off. Good luck.

251
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:21,051
Hey, bubble milk tea! Bubble milk tea!

252
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,051
Oh, my idols. My idols!

253
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:30,683
Thanks.

254
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:43,322
Excuse me.

255
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:45,322
What's your name and what faculty are you in?

256
00:17:49,447 --> 00:17:53,124
My name is Am. I study in Business Administration.

257
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:59,316
I study there too. Why haven't I seen you before?

258
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,284
I study in Special Program.

259
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:07,284
If you don't mind,
could I please continue the meal with my friends?

260
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:15,971
You didn't tell me a thing first.

261
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,971
C'mon, it's good that I didn't give your number.

262
00:18:20,276 --> 00:18:23,493
Next time, you can give them my number.

263
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:27,252
I'm okay with that.

264
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:29,097
You're kinda hot.

265
00:18:29,097 --> 00:18:32,443
Mmm, that's what I think.

266
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:35,443
Even Manfah likes you so much.

267
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:43,658
Would you like some more dessert?

268
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,837
I'd like a honey toast.

269
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:48,432
You guys want anything?

270
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:50,412
I'll have that too.

271
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:51,670
So, I'll make that two.

272
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,670
Huh? Aren't you stuffed yet?

273
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:09,523
What's that? I thought I saw a pic of me.

274
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,488
You're mistaken.

275
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:14,503
Right, Glasses sent me the pics of yours.

276
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:17,303
He said to forward them to you.

277
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,694
Darn, he worked so fast.

278
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,694
Give me your Line ID. I'll send them over.

279
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,370
Darn.

280
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:35,628
Post it.

281
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:39,294
Later.

282
00:19:46,136 --> 00:19:48,229
If I post it now, people won't see it.

283
00:19:48,781 --> 00:19:51,620
If I post it tomorrow before class,
there will be more engagement.

284
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,620
Darn! I totally forgot.

285
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:58,822
What?

286
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,822
I did the laundry after class.

287
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:04,958
Excuse me.

288
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,135
Lom, pay for me.

289
00:20:06,135 --> 00:20:07,135
Huh?

290
00:20:15,517 --> 00:20:17,319
Are you gonna go dry off your clothes too, Am?

291
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,915
What? I'm going to the restroom.

292
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:19,915
Oh.

293
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,838
Two honey toasts are here.

294
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:50,390
"Panon XEU is calling..."

295
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:54,395
Hello, Panon, what's up?

296
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:01,194
Hey, it's okay. I understand.

297
00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:06,249
Oh.

298
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:09,643
Your uni just finished the Moon's contest?

299
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,856
Darn, that's so delayed.

300
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,856
How are you doing?

301
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,533
Don't tell me you're the Moon...

302
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:25,467
The second place is good enough.

303
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:33,399
Tomorrow?

304
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:35,784
I'm not sure.

305
00:21:48,504 --> 00:21:50,504
The second place is still good.

306
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:58,672
I'm not sure.

307
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:03,386
Yes?

308
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:10,938
You know Tarntatch?

309
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,772
Hey, I have to go now, Panon.

310
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:26,078
Oh?

311
00:22:30,004 --> 00:22:36,004
I'm sorry. Papa didn't have enough sleep last night.

312
00:22:38,563 --> 00:22:39,563
Are you mad?

313
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,810
Hey, Tatch, my followers have reached 70K.

314
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,310
Oh? Tatch!

315
00:22:54,197 --> 00:22:55,197
Tatch!

316
00:22:56,745 --> 00:23:00,745
See? I didn't get enough sleep
because I was busy thinking about him.

317
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,881
Hey, Lom, what's there
to consult with Sompoch this early?

318
00:23:06,138 --> 00:23:07,138
Hey, Am.

319
00:23:08,308 --> 00:23:10,942
What? Why the angry face?

320
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,580
Anyone did something to you?

321
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,003
Well, it's Tatch.

322
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:18,003
He was mad in all of a sudden.

323
00:23:21,082 --> 00:23:23,009
And why would you care about him?

324
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:24,856
You and he don't like each other, do you?

325
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:29,114
You do know, I don't like to get mad at people,...

326
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:32,048
for too long...

327
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:34,971
Oh, really?

328
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:35,971
Yeah.

329
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,994
Do you happen to know
why he's angry with me?

330
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:42,334
How could I know?

331
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:44,550
It's your business.

332
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:48,550
But...it seems like you're more interested
in him than I thought you'd be.

333
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:52,326
You, bonehead, Am!

334
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:55,326
Alright, I won't bother you anymore.

335
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,371
Oh.

336
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:07,163
Then try to think of the very first moment Tatch's mad at you,

337
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:11,917
have you done anything that upset him?

338
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:17,307
I was just talking on the phone.

339
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:19,272
And then he's mad at me.

340
00:24:19,272 --> 00:24:20,401
It's weird.

341
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:23,200
Tatch is like this.

342
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,328
He thinks about stuff all the time.

343
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:27,458
He doesn't say what's on his mind.

344
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,258
He's unpredictable.

345
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:32,959
But when the time comes, he'll tell you...

346
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:33,959
what's wrong with him.

347
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:40,175
Sompoch!

348
00:24:42,601 --> 00:24:44,310
How are you, babe?

349
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,518
Give me the grasses.

350
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:46,943
I've already given them to him.

351
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,202
You go take out the poop at the back.

352
00:24:48,202 --> 00:24:50,297
Oh?

353
00:24:50,888 --> 00:24:51,989
My darling, I've already fed him.
He's full now.

354
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,989
And now, I gotta take out his poop?

355
00:25:00,202 --> 00:25:04,466
Alright, students,
now we're going to study about

356
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:10,761
the principles of Farm Series,
Food and Agricultural Revolution Model.

357
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,604
But first thing first, before we dive into the lesson...

358
00:25:13,604 --> 00:25:15,604
Let's do some revision.

359
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,489
Agriculture business
is the trading of agricultural products...

360
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:46,788
What the heck is wrong with you?

361
00:25:46,788 --> 00:25:48,788
Aren't you mad at me?

362
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,591
What's wrong with you, Lom?

363
00:25:56,188 --> 00:26:00,188
Well, that bonehead Tatch,
he kicked my chair twice.

364
00:26:02,108 --> 00:26:04,066
I just wanted to stretch my legs.

365
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:06,906
You know this room is not spacious.

366
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:08,906
What's the matter with some touches?

367
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:13,970
I think he wants to smell you.

368
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,186
He used to tell me that you smelled good.

369
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:19,362
What the heck are you saying?

370
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:21,332
Does he really smell good?

371
00:26:21,332 --> 00:26:23,170
Can I try smelling him too?

372
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,170
Darn, you too?

373
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:29,184
What the heck are you all doing?

374
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:32,184
Could you be quiet?
I wanna focus.

375
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:13,899
I think when Tarntatch was in high school,
he was super hot.

376
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:14,232
Take a look at that.

377
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,987
No, he's hotter now.

378
00:27:16,987 --> 00:27:17,994
Trust me.

379
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:19,169
No.

380
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,930
I think he's super hot when he was in high school.

381
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,930
I think he'd be like, super long legs in shorts.

382
00:27:26,892 --> 00:27:28,567
So darn sexy.

383
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:30,287
What are you guys talking about?

384
00:27:30,287 --> 00:27:33,470
Well, let me say this,
I happened to find a video of Tarntatch...

385
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:34,736
when he was a teenager...

386
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,747
and I gotta say that he's super hot.

387
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:40,086
Hey, it's good that you're here, Lom.

388
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:44,165
Help me decide whether Tarntatch in high school...

389
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:46,960
or Tarntatch now,...which one is hotter?

390
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:50,271
What? And why should I be the one to decide?

391
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:53,271
Excuse me, we'd like to know.
Just answer the question already.

392
00:27:54,651 --> 00:27:55,370
Help us decide.

393
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,295
Alright, send me the video.

394
00:27:57,295 --> 00:28:00,843
Okay, I'll send you via Line.

395
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:02,222
Have you sent it?

396
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,357
Okay.

397
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:04,450
Start now!

398
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,749
Winter (Lomnaw), what'd you say?

399
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:09,749
Between then and now,
which one is more handsome?

400
00:28:10,176 --> 00:28:13,933
If you can't think,
why don't you compare with the real person?

401
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:14,933
Guys!

402
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,657
Both are ugly.

403
00:28:26,657 --> 00:28:28,706
I don't know how to answer.

404
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,421
Tarntatch, would you like to take our place?

405
00:28:31,421 --> 00:28:33,178
We'll be off soon.

406
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:35,649
Come here.

407
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:37,652
What's the rush?

408
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:38,494
We got a class.

409
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:40,415
Oh, right.

410
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:43,170
Alright, let's do our mission.

411
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,170
Ready? Three. Four.

412
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:49,593
Lady, it's you again.

413
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:52,184
You never could do it right.

414
00:28:52,184 --> 00:28:52,931
Let's sit down again.

415
00:28:52,931 --> 00:28:54,691
Focus!

416
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,442
Let's start over again.

417
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:58,160
Ready? Three. Four.

418
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,590
Let's go, queens.

419
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,129
Yeah!

420
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:03,178
Bye, see ya!

421
00:29:04,862 --> 00:29:07,247
Bye, see ya!

422
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:08,247
Let's go.

423
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:17,093
Come, sit.

424
00:29:21,796 --> 00:29:23,004
Hey, let's find something to eat.

425
00:29:23,004 --> 00:29:24,013
I'll order basil with rice.

426
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:25,013
Go ahead.

427
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
What's wrong?

428
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:45,913
Are you and Tarntatch mad at each other?

429
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:49,550
Right, normally, friends don't get mad at each other.

430
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:54,108
I don't know. He suddenly was mad at me.

431
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:56,665
When I asked, he didn't tell me anything.

432
00:29:56,665 --> 00:30:00,425
Can you guess why he's mad at you?

433
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,563
Well...

434
00:30:01,563 --> 00:30:04,194
yesterday, I was talking on the phone with Panon.

435
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,293
And suddenly, he got mad.

436
00:30:08,293 --> 00:30:12,219
The handsome Panon, your friend who studies at XEU?

437
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:14,727
Yeah, that's right.

438
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:18,274
Or maybe...Tarntatch had a problem with Panon before?

439
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,955
Yeah, why have I never thought of that before?

440
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:24,628
Because you're stupid!

441
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:27,515
And what problem could it be?

442
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:30,580
I was just having a phone call with Panon,

443
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,580
and Tarntatch looked at me
as an enemy in just a second.

444
00:30:34,957 --> 00:30:38,045
I think they had a big problem.

445
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:41,844
Or else Tatch wouldn't be like this.

446
00:30:41,844 --> 00:30:45,472
If you can't ask Tarntatch,
why don't you go ask Panon?

447
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:47,472
You should get an answer much easier.

448
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:07,669
So, are you gonna tell me
what the heck is wrong with you?

449
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:14,441
If you don't tell me, I'll call Panon.

450
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:15,441
Hey, don't.

451
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,944
I think you two know each other quite well.

452
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,796
Well, you...

453
00:31:24,796 --> 00:31:26,796
Then I'll wait for you at the library.

454
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:39,737
Wow, you look so handsome.

455
00:31:39,737 --> 00:31:41,492
Are you really in 12th grade?

456
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:43,790
Then what grade should I be in looking like this?

457
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,846
Well...

458
00:31:46,846 --> 00:31:48,857
I'm just playing. Don't get startled.

459
00:31:50,456 --> 00:31:52,595
So you came to the open house of AEU today.

460
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:55,818
What faculty are you interested in?

461
00:31:56,568 --> 00:31:58,620
Can you guess?

462
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:01,709
Judging from your looks,
I think it must be Performing Arts.

463
00:32:01,709 --> 00:32:03,211
It's not about the looks.

464
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:05,595
Anyone can be in Performing Arts

465
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:07,069
if you love it.

466
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:09,162
That's a very sweet answer.

467
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:11,382
So what faculty are you interested in?

468
00:32:11,382 --> 00:32:12,811
I'm starting to wonder.

469
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:14,695
Faculty of Agriculture.

470
00:32:14,695 --> 00:32:17,744
Wow, that's beyond expectation.

471
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:21,546
You like farming, growing plants,
being with nature, something like that?

472
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:24,760
No, I like the people who are with the nature.

473
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,315
I think they're simple.

474
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,461
My soulmate must be in this faculty.

475
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:34,643
So you wanted to be in Agriculture
because that's the type of a person you're looking for?

476
00:32:34,643 --> 00:32:36,402
Are you crazy?

477
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:40,402
And, the Agriculture of which uni
you're interested in?

478
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,737
Anything but XEU.

479
00:32:44,737 --> 00:32:46,832
Eh? Why's that?

480
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,552
Personal issue.

481
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:50,895
So he wouldn't get in XEU

482
00:32:50,895 --> 00:32:55,395
even though XEU's Agriculture
is one of the top faculties of the country.

483
00:32:57,758 --> 00:33:02,258
Or is it because Panon is there?

484
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,233
I'm glad that you watched my video.

485
00:33:12,454 --> 00:33:13,800
Who?

486
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,516
Who's watching your video?

487
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,070
I'm certain that it wasn't an ad.

488
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,121
I just played it by mistake, that's all.

489
00:33:32,394 --> 00:33:35,327
So you're gonna talk to me now?

490
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,327
Who?

491
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,317
Who wants to speak to you?

492
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,380
Just stop getting on my nerves.

493
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,970
I'll make a phone call.

494
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,025
No need to.

495
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:46,503
If you wanna know anything, just ask me.

496
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:49,904
Can I really ask you?

497
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:53,413
Yes, and you don't have to call anyone.

498
00:33:53,413 --> 00:33:55,413
Then why did you ignore me?

499
00:33:57,886 --> 00:34:00,976
I ignored you because I was scared.

500
00:34:00,976 --> 00:34:03,776
Scared? You? Scared?

501
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:05,541
Scared of what?

502
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,091
Well, I was...

503
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:10,508
scared that if you believed Panon rather than me,

504
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:11,508
I'd feel terrible.

505
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:27,431
You think I'll believe Panon
even though he hasn't told me anything yet?

506
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:29,942
You overthought about it.

507
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:37,043
I had a bad history with Panon.

508
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:38,043
Huh?

509
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:39,761
And...

510
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:43,416
What I experienced isn't memorable.

511
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,013
Nevermind.

512
00:34:45,013 --> 00:34:47,112
Just know that...

513
00:34:47,112 --> 00:34:51,085
you're in the circle that I wanna start over with.

514
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,801
I don't want anyone to feel bad about me.

515
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,975
About my past.

516
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:59,607
So you must have been pretty awful in the past?

517
00:34:59,607 --> 00:35:03,607
Not really, but I was darn handsome.

518
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:06,997
Whatever, that's your business.

519
00:35:10,419 --> 00:35:11,885
Let's call it peace.

520
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:13,814
We're competitors who won't ignore each other.

521
00:35:13,814 --> 00:35:16,521
Alright?

522
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:19,521
So aren't you gonna ask me anything?

523
00:35:21,071 --> 00:35:22,413
Why should I?

524
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:25,413
You had your own reason for what you did.

525
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:35,624
Oh, so you think I'd believe Panon
or other people from your past?

526
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:37,902
I don't care about all that.

527
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,785
All I care is about the present.

528
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:42,785
If you're good in the present, then you're good.

529
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:48,126
Except one thing, you still get on my nerves.

530
00:35:48,126 --> 00:35:51,592
Who? Who gets on your nerves?
There's none.

531
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:53,592
Are you gonna shake my hand now?

532
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:58,684
Let's call it peace.

533
00:35:59,868 --> 00:36:00,868
Peace.

534
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:03,273
We're competitors who won't ignore each other.

535
00:36:03,273 --> 00:36:04,273
Mmm.

536
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:14,787
Tatch!

537
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,464
Man.

538
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:17,813
Where are you off to?

539
00:36:22,487 --> 00:36:24,458
What's up?

540
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,081
I've just finished my class.

541
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:28,922
I'm about to go eat.

542
00:36:29,094 --> 00:36:30,094
Hey, Lom.

543
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,242
Hello, Man.

544
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:32,788
Tatch, are you free?

545
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:34,587
Have you eaten?

546
00:36:34,587 --> 00:36:36,966
I'm about to go to the class.

547
00:36:36,966 --> 00:36:40,017
Oh, dear, too bad.

548
00:36:40,017 --> 00:36:43,017
Mmm, actually, I could join you.

549
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:45,614
The faculty's cafeteria is just right over there.

550
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:46,832
I can make it.

551
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:47,972
Really?

552
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:50,646
Then let's go. Take me to the cafeteria.

553
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:53,196
Mmm.

554
00:36:53,196 --> 00:36:56,376
I'm off, COMPETITOR.

555
00:36:56,376 --> 00:36:58,376
Right, I wish you happiness.

556
00:37:09,386 --> 00:37:10,386
What's wrong with me?

557
00:37:31,993 --> 00:37:32,993
The class is over.

558
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:39,741
Lom.

559
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:43,978
What's the matter?

560
00:37:43,978 --> 00:37:47,978
I saw you drift away the whole hour,
like a soulless body.

561
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:51,166
I saw Manfah.

562
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,832
And?

563
00:37:52,832 --> 00:37:55,590
Is Manfah your soul guard?

564
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,855
I'm bummed.

565
00:37:58,855 --> 00:38:02,855
Bummed?
Bummed that she doesn't like you?

566
00:38:03,232 --> 00:38:06,232
The problem is...it's not that.

567
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,706
Are you alright, Lom?

568
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:15,963
Nevermind, it's just a tiny matter.

569
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:18,059
Alright.

570
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:20,685
I think he and I will go grab a bite at the mall.

571
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:21,312
Wanna join?

572
00:38:21,815 --> 00:38:22,665
Sure.

573
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:23,388
Let's go.

574
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:24,388
Let's go!

575
00:38:27,155 --> 00:38:28,155
Hey, Tatch.

576
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,800
Where are you guys going?

577
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,182
We're gonna go eat at the mall.

578
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:34,660
Wanna join us?

579
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,248
I already have a plan.

580
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:38,065
With whom?

581
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,158
Mmm...

582
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:42,504
Is it the one whom you walked with before the class?

583
00:38:42,504 --> 00:38:43,960
Wow.

584
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:45,929
Darn.

585
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:48,148
You're too hot.

586
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:51,320
Morning, noon, afternoon, you're never available.

587
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,159
Huh?

588
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,159
I'll wait for you guys outside.

589
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:02,602
What's wrong with your friend?

590
00:39:02,602 --> 00:39:06,572
I guess he's jealous.

591
00:39:06,572 --> 00:39:08,248
He's like this. He'll get better.

592
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:09,423
Mmm...

593
00:39:09,423 --> 00:39:09,975
Let's go.

594
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:10,941
See you around.

595
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:14,516
Let's go have shabu-shabu.

596
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:15,516
Got it, buddy.

597
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,423
So what the hell is wrong with you, Mr. Lom?

598
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:32,991
Because Tarntatch went with Manfah, right?

599
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:34,418
Mmm.

600
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:38,463
I'm not so sure if I really like her or not.

601
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:40,185
When did you start thinking about this?

602
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:41,570
Since he met Tarntatch.

603
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,375
What's that supposed to mean?

604
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:44,717
Think carefully.

605
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:49,186
If you like Manfah, why would you
be interested in who's new in your life?

606
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:53,067
And what does that have to do
with the confusion in my heart?

607
00:39:53,067 --> 00:39:54,666
Are you mad at me?

608
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:55,633
No.

609
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:57,633
Is it about me going out with Manfah?
