1
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,063
Lomnaw!

2
00:01:57,063 --> 00:01:59,524
Lom, come see me down here!

3
00:01:59,524 --> 00:02:00,859
Lom!

4
00:02:00,859 --> 00:02:02,608
Lomnaw!

5
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:06,608
I've come to see you here,
and you still like Tatch?

6
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:10,112
I don't like him.

7
00:02:10,112 --> 00:02:11,447
Are you serious?

8
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,450
I don't like him.

9
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,830
But I love him.

10
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,000
"Panon is calling..."

11
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,959
You saw the pic I sent you, right?

12
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,042
Non, what do you want?

13
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,042
You want your boyfriend back, right?

14
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:44,482
2 HOURS BEFORE THE AMBASSADOR CONTEST
- Lom.

15
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:48,272
Tatch told me to take a good care of you.

16
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:52,257
Here, watermelon juice. Bought it for you.

17
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,165
So I got a servant now, right?

18
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:57,790
Wait, wait, I'm not doing more than what Tatch asked me.

19
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:00,532
What? Man!

20
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:28,285
Darn.

21
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,619
Hey!

22
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:40,619
Come sit down.

23
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,287
Darn, they played agressively.

24
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:47,081
Panon?

25
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,658
Right.

26
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:51,530
If he played like that,
he'd better do kickboxing instead.

27
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,655
He's so bad even playing sports?

28
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:58,655
Yeah, I hope they lose in the ambassador contest.

29
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,736
Right. XEU is very reckless
when it comes to the contest.

30
00:04:02,736 --> 00:04:06,529
If it were our uni,
the contestant wouldn't be allowed to play sports.

31
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:09,106
Such a waste of their good looks.

32
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:12,231
But different unis have different trainings.

33
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,231
They are savage, let me tell you.

34
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:21,023
Lom, you and I,
let's see who gets to play in the second half.

35
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:22,653
Of course.

36
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,038
Yes, sir!

37
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:28,038
Coach, how about me?

38
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:35,501
What? Am I worse than Lom?

39
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:38,794
You're not worse than him.
You just skipped the practice too often.

40
00:04:46,197 --> 00:04:47,652
I'm off, man.

41
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:48,652
Go ahead.

42
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:00,410
Go! Go! Lom, buddy!

43
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,404
You're doing good!

44
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:02,404
Go! Right!

45
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:28,281
Darn!

46
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:30,281
You kicked my friend's leg!

47
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,466
"Panon is calling..."

48
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:04,808
You saw the pic I sent you, right?

49
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,894
Non, what do you want?

50
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:10,444
Whoa, whoa, take it easy, man.

51
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,444
You want your boyfriend back, right?

52
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:19,661
Then, I ask you to leave the contest.

53
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:24,375
And I promise you that I'll let your boyfriend go safely.

54
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,254
Non, you, bonehead.
If you do anything to Lom...

55
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:30,916
Darn it.

56
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,247
Yeah, what's up?

57
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:51,375
Am, go and find Lomnaw now.

58
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,587
Why do you sound so worried about Lom?

59
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:54,762
He just hurt his leg.

60
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,808
Darn. Am, listen to me.

61
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,558
Panon took Lomnaw.

62
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:00,389
He sent me a pic.

63
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,387
Huh!

64
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,348
What the heck he did?!

65
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:04,979
I'm about to go nuts.

66
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,101
Guys, go find him, please.

67
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,265
Of course, will do.

68
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,606
Thanks.

69
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,058
Guys, Lom was kidnapped by Panon.

70
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:14,933
Huh?

71
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,718
Right, we need to go help him.

72
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:17,718
Sir, I'll come back and pay.

73
00:07:33,428 --> 00:07:33,806
You!

74
00:07:33,806 --> 00:07:35,806
Wait, it's me, it's me, Parak.

75
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,529
I went to see you at the dressing room.

76
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:47,196
Your senior told me that you came out fo find Lomnaw.

77
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:49,985
So I rushed here too.

78
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:51,872
Panon took Lomnaw.

79
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,420
Do you know where he is?

80
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,420
Huh? Panon?

81
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,332
Panon cut me off.

82
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:15,370
Darn it.

83
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,165
Tatch.

84
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,962
Calm down.

85
00:08:18,962 --> 00:08:21,053
How could I be calm?

86
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:25,553
But if you're not,
we wouldn't know where Panon kept Lomnaw.

87
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:29,317
Tatch, get yourself together.

88
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:43,156
Well,

89
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:45,156
and how did you know that Panon took Lomnaw?

90
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:03,499
Are you familiar with this?

91
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:04,499
I don't recognize it at all.

92
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,174
From the pic, it seems like an old building.

93
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,207
There are many faculties in our uni that got old buildings.

94
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,663
How can we know which one?

95
00:09:24,663 --> 00:09:27,576
It must be the one Panon is certain that...

96
00:09:27,576 --> 00:09:29,576
no one would find Lomnaw easily.

97
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:34,661
Panon is very careful.

98
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,661
I don't think he would hide Lomnaw
in the building in the uni.

99
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:40,782
And it's not the university that he's familiar with.

100
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:49,195
That means right now, Lomnaw is outside of uni?

101
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:54,117
If we're thinking about it now,
it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

102
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:58,793
I think right now, we should find Panon first.

103
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:04,874
But he's not with Lomnaw.

104
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:08,874
No, because he's got the ambassador contest.

105
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,630
He's preparing himself now, I think.

106
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,964
But I went to XEU's dressing room.

107
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,964
I didn't see anyone there.

108
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:26,965
That means he must have planned it before.

109
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,965
He could ask the senior to change the room beforehand.

110
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:38,302
That means where he is must be near the contest area.

111
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:43,006
And there should be a dressing room and a makeup room.

112
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:52,510
Faculty of Fine Arts!

113
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,716
Right!

114
00:10:53,716 --> 00:10:55,302
High possibility!

115
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:58,526
Because they got a stage makeup room there.

116
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:00,526
I think we should hurry there.

117
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,687
Hey, how's it going?

118
00:11:06,687 --> 00:11:09,143
Mike went to report to the police.

119
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,601
You all, follow me.

120
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,601
Right.

121
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,389
Why are you stopping, Tatch?

122
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,389
Is that an XEU student?

123
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:31,135
Yeah, she looks like Panon's senior.

124
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:33,553
I guess they're going to the building
where the contest takes place.

125
00:11:33,553 --> 00:11:35,929
And...where is Panon?

126
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:37,843
I think he must still be in the makeup room.

127
00:11:37,843 --> 00:11:40,176
The seniors must have a look at the venue first.

128
00:11:40,176 --> 00:11:40,889
Then hurry up.

129
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,271
Let's go!

130
00:11:52,394 --> 00:11:53,356
Excuse me.

131
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:56,289
Which floor is the makeup room of XEU?

132
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,460
The makeup room of XEU?

133
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,960
There's only a makeup room
for the Performing Arts students.

134
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,081
It's on the 5th floor.

135
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,081
Thank you.

136
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,530
Could we wait for the elevator?

137
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:15,297
Let's go after him.

138
00:12:49,293 --> 00:12:52,293
Hey, Non, how should we deal with your brother?

139
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:56,749
Parak, leave this room.

140
00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:00,171
This doesn't involve you.

141
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:02,042
You have a problem with my best friend,

142
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:04,042
of course, it involves me.

143
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:11,998
Well, if you insist, then my friend here
won't have a problem with that.

144
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:16,196
Then let's get it started.

145
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:17,196
Why don't we start now?

146
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:22,733
Darn it.

147
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:24,568
Witch!

148
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:27,201
You're like a group of dogs.

149
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:29,948
Darn!

150
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,372
Where are you off to?

151
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,660
Go!

152
00:13:39,621 --> 00:13:40,621
Leave!

153
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:46,875
So such good friends you got there.

154
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:53,539
Tell me where Lomnaw is.

155
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:57,336
I won't tell you even if I have to die now.

156
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:57,913
How could you?

157
00:13:57,913 --> 00:13:58,834
Tatch!

158
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:00,539
Chill, man.

159
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,461
Chill!

160
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:09,213
Guys, help me stop Tatch.

161
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,254
Let me go!

162
00:14:10,254 --> 00:14:12,171
Tatch, chill, man!

163
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:13,219
Calm down.

164
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:13,679
Tatch!

165
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,427
Stop him!

166
00:14:15,427 --> 00:14:17,557
Tatch!

167
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:19,393
You got stuff to do.

168
00:14:19,393 --> 00:14:20,770
Don't forget that.

169
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,272
I don't freaking care about anything.

170
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,691
I want Lomnaw back.

171
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:25,692
So what's it gonna be?

172
00:14:25,692 --> 00:14:27,199
You wanna fight me?

173
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,248
If you're gonna be a crybaby
who's stopped by your friends...

174
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,039
then just go back to where you're from.

175
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:32,196
I can't take this anymore!

176
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,190
I'll kill him!

177
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,943
Tatch! You need to chill!

178
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,687
Listen to me.

179
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:40,687
If the judges find out about this,
you won't be able to participate.

180
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:45,938
And participating in the contest is Lom's will.

181
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:49,183
And if he finds out about this later,

182
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,889
he will think that it's all his fault.

183
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,889
Won't he blame himself forever?

184
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:01,124
Then what am I supposed to do?

185
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,300
Trust me.

186
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,300
And leave all this to me.

187
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:17,760
Chill out, man.

188
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,552
Are you gonna fight me, Rak?

189
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:22,471
Right, we got nothing to lose.

190
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:24,433
You and I, we should clear things up.

191
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,813
So everything will come to an end.

192
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:30,642
I can't believe this. You choose other people...

193
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,689
instead of your brother.

194
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,773
Stop being nonsense.

195
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:37,313
Stop being so jealous of other people.

196
00:15:37,313 --> 00:15:40,152
What the heck is wrong with you?

197
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:43,318
Just me being friends with Tatch
that I didn't pay attention to you...

198
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,241
and you had to lie about Tatch and frame him?

199
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:47,951
You're so childish.

200
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:49,165
You don't understand me.

201
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,871
No, I don't freaking understand you.

202
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:53,830
What the fuck is wrong with you?

203
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,830
But to me, you'll always be my twin brother.

204
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:02,200
Tell me, where is Lomnaw?

205
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,238
So this all can end.

206
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:08,238
I've told you all,
I won't tell you even if I have to die now.

207
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:11,945
Then I may have to use force with you.

208
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:16,967
Hey, don't pass out yet.

209
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:20,173
Tell me where Lomnaw is first.

210
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:24,173
Tatch, didn't you tell me
that Panon sent you a pic of Lomnaw?

211
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:25,866
Look at his phone.

212
00:17:25,866 --> 00:17:26,866
Look for the location of the pic.

213
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:32,915
Let me have it.

214
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:37,781
What?

215
00:17:38,822 --> 00:17:41,451
Only twin brothers can do that?

216
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,042
I've found the location.

217
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,668
Take a look, guys.

218
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:47,789
Isn't this from our building?

219
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,792
Tatch!

220
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,871
You need to go to the contest.

221
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,411
We'll go get Lomnaw.

222
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:55,909
No, I have to see him with my own eyes

223
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,621
that he's safe.

224
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:01,621
What Lomnaw wants the most
is you getting to be the Ambassador.

225
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,084
Lom will be safe.

226
00:18:08,084 --> 00:18:09,084
We promise you that.

227
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:03,706
Guys, please line up.

228
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:06,290
It's almost time.

229
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,291
Hey, finally you came!

230
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,791
My heart almost stopped.

231
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:10,787
I'm sorry.

232
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:12,417
It's fine.

233
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,701
Let's tap your face.

234
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,371
And go line up.

235
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:16,959
The contest starts 30 minutes earlier.

236
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,381
Alright.

237
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:20,384
Oh, dear.

238
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:21,972
Are you done?

239
00:19:21,972 --> 00:19:23,972
Panon, answer the phone.

240
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:27,598
Panon is not answering my call.

241
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:28,640
I'll go look for him at the dressing room.

242
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,387
Okay.

243
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:30,387
Wait here.

244
00:20:46,885 --> 00:20:50,521
Hey, Fourth! I could spill that. It's hot.

245
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:54,521
Wow, such a sweetie. Thank you so much.

246
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:58,318
What are you looking at? Can I see it too?

247
00:20:58,318 --> 00:21:01,109
Take a look.

248
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:04,530
"So handsome, Beam."

249
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,248
"Where did you go? Can I go drink with you?"

250
00:21:08,248 --> 00:21:10,790
"Are you still single?"

251
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,121
"You're so cute."

252
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:15,460
Cute, my ass.

253
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,506
I took a pic for you to look cool.

254
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:20,215
And they said that you're cute.

255
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:26,062
My boyfriend is so popular.

256
00:21:26,062 --> 00:21:28,600
You just saw the likes and you took it as I was popular?

257
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
Have you taken a look at yours?

258
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:37,678
Right, today, Pha invited me for a night out.

259
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:38,976
You wanna come along?

260
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:40,106
Yes, I do!

261
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:41,561
My boyfriend is freakin' hot.

262
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,943
I need to keep an eye on him.

263
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:44,943
I told you I wasn't hot.

264
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:50,830
Then let's see if tonight,
will you not be hot as you say?

265
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,912
Alright, good, I wanna prove what I said too.

266
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,418
That you're hotter than me.

267
00:21:56,885 --> 00:21:58,300
Dress handsomely.

268
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
Alright. You got it.

269
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,003
And what if I can prove that you're hotter than me,

270
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:08,455
what will I get from you?

271
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:12,455
If I'm hotter than you,
I'll go out with you, anywhere.

272
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,042
We have a deal.

273
00:22:20,366 --> 00:22:21,366
Hey.

274
00:22:21,534 --> 00:22:22,534
Hey.

275
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:32,924
What happened? Are you two mad at each other?

276
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,638
But you're sitting apart for the first time.

277
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:42,638
Yeah, just we sitting apart, you think there's a drama?

278
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:47,438
We don't know. Normally, you're stuck to each other.

279
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:48,106
Who would know?

280
00:22:48,106 --> 00:22:51,156
Right.

281
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:53,159
Fourth...

282
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:54,827
Er...

283
00:22:54,827 --> 00:22:56,664
It's me Jiji.

284
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:57,744
Can't you remember?

285
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:00,536
We used to...

286
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:01,790
Nevermind.

287
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,259
Can I ask for your number?

288
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:06,259
In case we need to get in touch.

289
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:18,222
Thank you.

290
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:31,185
1-0.

291
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:32,185
We'll see.

292
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,521
What the hell are you playing?

293
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:40,266
It's nothing. Just bet who's hotter.

294
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:43,097
But I'm not competing or anything.

295
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:45,807
I told him that he was hotter than me.

296
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:47,308
But he didn't believe me.

297
00:23:47,308 --> 00:23:50,270
So we dressed handsomely to compete tonight.

298
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,015
So that means if Fourth is hotter, then, you'll win?

299
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,015
Of course.

300
00:24:14,056 --> 00:24:16,719
It's Beam, right?

301
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:18,472
Yes.

302
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:22,135
What a coincidence...to see you here.

303
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:25,093
Umm...can you remember me?

304
00:24:25,093 --> 00:24:28,103
I usually comment on your Instagram.

305
00:24:28,103 --> 00:24:33,103
Eh...I can...I guess.

306
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,102
I come here alone today.

307
00:24:40,102 --> 00:24:42,102
Can you drink with me?

308
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,629
I think it doesn't look good.

309
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:54,344
Beam knows how to take care of himself.

310
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:57,263
But that dude doesn't seem to mean well.

311
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:59,263
I guess this is where the fun ends tonight.

312
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:03,551
Don't destroy the place, alright.

313
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,262
Beam.

314
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,512
Time to go. Game's over.

315
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,259
I lose.

316
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:19,337
Hey, what is this? Who are you?

317
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:21,005
Know your place around here.

318
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:23,756
Let me tell you who I am.

319
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,803
I am...

320
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:32,559
Do you want me to take care of him?

321
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,559
Don't.

322
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:40,138
Beam.

323
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:42,517
Let's go.

324
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:45,277
Hey, man.

325
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,784
If he doesn't want to go, why do you force him to?

326
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:49,784
Huh?

327
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:50,912
Don't butt in!

328
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:53,334
No, you're the one who butts in.

329
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,334
I'm just standing here with him.

330
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:00,382
Let me tell you something, Beam.

331
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:02,382
This guy...is a player.

332
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:06,304
Be careful, Beam.

333
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
Hey.

334
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:23,762
Fourth, chill, man.

335
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:28,555
You're playing a game, aren't you?

336
00:26:28,555 --> 00:26:32,555
He's playing with you,
but I don't know what freaking game it is.

337
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,935
That serves you.

338
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:42,524
I think you'd better make it up with Beam.

339
00:26:42,524 --> 00:26:45,104
He loves you.

340
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:48,980
If you let this go on, he'll pass out.

341
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
It's my guy who doesn't keep distance.

342
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:55,145
He'll get even madder at you.

343
00:26:55,145 --> 00:26:58,073
You spoke to him like you're his boyfriend.

344
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,073
He has to accept the truth.

345
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,321
Fourth.

346
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:10,405
Look at that bonehead.

347
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:10,985
Darn!

348
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:13,322
Hey, Fourth!

349
00:27:13,322 --> 00:27:14,831
Let go of Beam.

350
00:27:14,831 --> 00:27:17,496
Hey, you still keep butting in?

351
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:19,252
You're the one who butts in.

352
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:21,833
Do whatever you want,

353
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,499
but leave my boyfriend alone.

354
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:25,622
Donkey!

355
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:28,880
Boyfriend, my ass!

356
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,578
I'm not his boyfriend.

357
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:32,705
See.

358
00:27:33,006 --> 00:27:34,212
Let him go, handsome.

359
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:37,898
He's going with me.

360
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:38,893
That's it!

361
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:40,010
How dare you!

362
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,144
Hey, don't. Leave him to me.

363
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:45,972
Fourth!

364
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:50,268
Darn!

365
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:51,268
My cousin's bar.

366
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,356
Ouch!

367
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:03,270
Does it hurt?

368
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,642
It does.

369
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,642
Serves you right.

370
00:28:09,766 --> 00:28:10,514
Beam.

371
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:12,398
Let me ask you this.

372
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:14,689
Were you really going out with him?

373
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:17,937
I weren't, nuthead.

374
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:21,937
I saw you two cuddle. How's that not going?

375
00:28:22,856 --> 00:28:26,441
I just wanted to make you angry.

376
00:28:26,441 --> 00:28:28,441
You didn't have to do that much.

377
00:28:31,268 --> 00:28:33,352
Please don't do this again.

378
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:35,565
I don't like it.

379
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:39,353
You started it first.

380
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:42,719
Okay. I won't do that again.

381
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:45,140
And you must not too.

382
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,140
Tell that to yourself.

383
00:28:54,692 --> 00:28:57,480
And don't ever play this kind of game again.

384
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,021
Of course, I won't.

385
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:03,436
That means we're both hot.

386
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:05,436
So, where's the reward?

387
00:29:07,985 --> 00:29:08,985
Alright.

388
00:29:12,394 --> 00:29:13,394
Here.

389
00:29:18,611 --> 00:29:19,611
Japan!

390
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,820
Yeah. Let's go there together.

391
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,285
This is all I can take you. I'm broke.

392
00:29:24,285 --> 00:29:27,245
That's fine. I'll pay you back.

393
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,251
You're acting like you've never been there.

394
00:29:32,251 --> 00:29:36,166
I have, but not with my boyfriend.

395
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:39,122
It's Japan.

396
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:43,122
And...what about...

397
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,328
No.

398
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm sleepy. I wanna sleep.

399
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,361
We'll do it in Japan.

400
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:56,361
That's for Japan. But tonight...I want...

401
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:22,175
Wake up.

402
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:30,273
If you don't wake up, I'm gonna pin you down.

403
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,439
Then I won't wake up.

404
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:36,321
So you said it.

405
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:39,407
Hey, hey, hey, just kidding.

406
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:40,407
I'm up, I'm up.

407
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:55,089
This is my room.

408
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:57,969
It is.

409
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:58,969
What time is it?

410
00:35:05,098 --> 00:35:07,612
It's 00.30.

411
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:10,112
Oh, I didn't know at all.

412
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:16,251
Slumbering like this,
that's why you're taken to places easily.

413
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:19,709
So frustrating.

414
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,501
I'm sorry, Tatch.

415
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:24,970
I didn't know that the medicine in the infirmary
was this strong.

416
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,809
I was unconscious.

417
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:29,809
And I didn't get to root for you in the contest.

418
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,431
It's alright. Just let it go.

419
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,728
Are you tired today?

420
00:35:42,728 --> 00:35:46,476
I am, a lot.

421
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:48,765
I'm super exhausted.

422
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:52,724
Then let's get to sleep, so today passes quickly.

423
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,717
Huh?

424
00:35:55,717 --> 00:35:57,840
It's okay to lose.

425
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,177
Your friends just make fun a little bit.

426
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:02,892
I'm used to that.

427
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:04,480
It's alright.

428
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:07,480
Someday people will forget

429
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,480
that you didn't get to be the Ambassador.

430
00:36:13,062 --> 00:36:15,942
It's okay for our uni to lose.

431
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:18,825
We've won too often.

432
00:36:18,825 --> 00:36:19,825
It's boring.

433
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,837
I think you should get back to sleep.

434
00:36:26,837 --> 00:36:29,637
Every word you say is so depressing.

435
00:36:31,303 --> 00:36:33,892
We'll talk tomorrow.

436
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:37,892
Then...go take a shower and come back to cuddle me.

437
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:25,057
Darn!

438
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:27,599
That hit my face.

439
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
Luckily, your breath smells nice as in the advertisement.

440
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,854
It's you. When did you come here?

441
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,148
And where's Tarntatch?

442
00:37:38,148 --> 00:37:40,232
Tatch is at the faculty's library.

443
00:37:40,232 --> 00:37:42,481
He asked me to look after you.

444
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:45,481
And, this evening, there's a party for Tatch.

445
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:50,438
That's good. A consoling party will do.

446
00:37:50,438 --> 00:37:52,733
Like how you treated me before.

447
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:56,901
Why do we have to have a consoling party like yours?

448
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,990
He's lost in the contest.

449
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,447
Huh?

450
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,823
A man like Tatch would lose?

451
00:38:04,823 --> 00:38:07,744
Did you oversleep?

452
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,744
Well, he lost.

453
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:13,831
Look at that.

454
00:38:13,831 --> 00:38:15,831
Do you see the trophy?

455
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:21,955
Tatch totally won the contest.

456
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:25,755
But he nearly lost too.

457
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:27,965
What do you mean?

458
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:30,925
It's because of you, Mr. troublemaker.

459
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:33,432
Me? What did I do?

460
00:38:33,432 --> 00:38:36,314
You were kidnapped.

461
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:41,971
Huh? Who kidnapped me?

462
00:38:41,971 --> 00:38:45,884
Who else could it be? The same old Panon.

463
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:49,224
I guess it was the strong antihistamine.

464
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:51,480
Or maybe you're drugged with anesthesia.

465
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,400
That's why you were out.

466
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,658
Luckily, Parak, Panon's twin,

467
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:59,668
helped too.

468
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,668
Otherwise, it would've been chaotic.

469
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:08,087
I witnessed their fight.

470
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,087
Parak's fist went straight to Panon's face.

471
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:14,917
In the end, he didn't get to the contest.

472
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:16,955
He didn't get any prize.

473
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,246
So satisfying.

474
00:39:19,246 --> 00:39:21,871
Darn.

475
00:39:21,871 --> 00:39:25,128
If I were a girl, I'd hit on him.

476
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:27,128
So cool, he was.

477
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:31,745
Ouch!

478
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,329
Where are you going?

479
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,997
I'm gonna take a shower.

480
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,665
I'll go see Tarntatch.

481
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,462
Wait, mister.

482
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,164
The party starts in the evening.

483
00:39:41,164 --> 00:39:42,955
No need to rush.

484
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:45,369
Are you overwhelmed by his love?

485
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:46,369
Nosy!

486
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:14,462
The prize I got is also yours.

487
00:40:14,462 --> 00:40:15,590
Nonsense.

488
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,306
You won this by yourself.

489
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:20,649
I was there because you gave up your position for me.

490
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:24,063
What if he found a pretty doctor and changed his mind?

491
00:40:24,063 --> 00:40:25,815
He's very busy.

492
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:28,694
And you two have been together for so long,
and you still don't know each other well?

493
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,036
Let's spy on him.

494
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,039
Like how we spied on him at the faculty.

495
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,505
If I'm still like this, can you endure it?

496
00:40:35,505 --> 00:40:37,505
Why are you asking that?
