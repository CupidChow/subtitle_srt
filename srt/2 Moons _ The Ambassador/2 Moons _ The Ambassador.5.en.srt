1
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,448
Manfah and I aren't a thing.

2
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:59,712
She's just a girl that I'm close to the most.

3
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:00,632
Can it not be like that, Tatch?

4
00:02:00,632 --> 00:02:02,522
I don't want to be just friends.

5
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,825
I think we shouldn't talk anymore.

6
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:06,177
I'm sorry for today.

7
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:09,139
I can do anything if it makes you stop being mad at me.

8
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:13,895
I mean, you sit next to me,
and I don't get to see a beautiful thing.

9
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:17,395
Tatch, what spell have you casted on me?

10
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:21,896
Car stealer!

11
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:29,361
Darn, you can also dress up nicely?

12
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:34,835
If Tatch sees you like this, he'll die.

13
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:42,437
Are you mad at me?

14
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:46,437
I was the one who brought you two together.

15
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:48,568
Did you ask me if I wanted that?

16
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,546
I'm just kidding.

17
00:02:53,546 --> 00:02:55,600
I'm hungry. Let's go.

18
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,573
Hold on.

19
00:02:57,573 --> 00:03:00,955
Why are you in such a good mood?

20
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:02,466
Tell me.

21
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,891
How was yesterday?

22
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:07,777
Did Tatch tell you he liked you yet?

23
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:10,412
You went on a date at the noodles place, right?

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Have you guys kissed?

25
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:17,353
I'm rooting for this guy, man.

26
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:20,353
He's handsome, rich and nice.

27
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,567
The pretty girls know that he likes you.

28
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,840
Just take him already.

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,431
Or else, I'll have to answer
the questions about you and him.

30
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,861
What is it with you?

31
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,122
There's nothing.

32
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,622
Stop asking me questions.

33
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:40,973
You changed your perfume?

34
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:44,730
It's…nicer than usual.

35
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,230
If you don't stop now,
you go to uni on your own.

36
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,610
No, you have to send me off at the building first.

37
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,610
What? Then why don't you ride with me first
and then take the bus together to the building?

38
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,622
It's hot.

39
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,549
To hell with that, you're such a problem.

40
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,611
Get in the car.

41
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,373
If you don't get in the car,
I'll leave you here.

42
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:06,373
Alright, buddy.

43
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:25,307
Darn! He came early today.

44
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:37,185
What's that noise?

45
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:19,249
Darn.

46
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,845
Man, what's wrong, Man?

47
00:05:25,845 --> 00:05:28,689
I had a fight with Tatch.

48
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:32,194
Lom, please help me.

49
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:34,285
Er...

50
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,290
Tatch doesn't like me anymore, Lom.

51
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,750
Calm down now.

52
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,750
Tatch likes someone else.

53
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:49,343
Thanks.

54
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,447
Tatch has changed, Lom.

55
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:57,168
He has never been like this.

56
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:59,596
He is my best friend.

57
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:02,783
Whenever I ask him to go somewhere with me,
he always does.

58
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:06,038
Whenever I ask him for help, he helps.

59
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,250
Mmm.

60
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,250
But I feel like he's changed recently.

61
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,730
And I broke up with Rak for quite some time now.

62
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,490
Why is it like this, Lom?

63
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,396
Lom.

64
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:31,324
Can you keep me company?

65
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,665
Of course, why can't I.

66
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:34,665
Thanks, Lom.

67
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:42,641
I think I'm gonna skip class today.

68
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,403
What time is your class, Lom?

69
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:48,403
Er...8:30 a.m.

70
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:53,745
Sorry, Lom. Then, I think I'd better go now.

71
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:54,963
Oops.

72
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,261
Are you alright?

73
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,793
I'd say I have to even I'm not.

74
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:04,214
How about this?

75
00:07:04,214 --> 00:07:07,053
I'll skip class with you.

76
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:10,238
I'll be your driver, Manfah.

77
00:07:10,238 --> 00:07:12,242
Are you sure?

78
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,324
Normally, I never skip any classes.

79
00:07:14,324 --> 00:07:16,663
Just once would be fine.

80
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:18,047
Hey, it's alright.

81
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,095
I don't want to be a bother.

82
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:23,095
How can I leave you in this condition all day?

83
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:25,764
Thank you, Lom.

84
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:47,363
What's wrong?

85
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:54,459
I guess, his motivation to study hasn't arrived yet.

86
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:24,094
It's late. Why isn't your friend here yet?

87
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:28,194
Man, you've been apart for a few hours,
and now you miss him already?

88
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:33,710
I thought you guys said he'd arrived.

89
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,221
He arrived, really.
I had him send me off in front of the building.

90
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:41,024
And he went to park at the Engineering building.

91
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,495
But...it's been a while already, really, Toon.

92
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:47,964
He should've been here by now, right?

93
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:49,802
Alright, hold on, let me call him.

94
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:50,802
Yeah, go ahead.

95
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,554
So?

96
00:08:58,554 --> 00:08:59,554
Hold on, hold on.

97
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:04,823
Lom isn't answering his phone.

98
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:06,716
What?

99
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,769
Or something happened?

100
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:08,830
Should we check on him?

101
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,583
Yeah.

102
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,850
No need to. You guys stay here.

103
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,850
I'll go find him.

104
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:18,769
What is it with him?

105
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,999
C'mon, Beam. I told Ming to meet us there.

106
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,135
You didn't zip your bag.

107
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:32,076
Let's go.

108
00:09:32,076 --> 00:09:33,076
Fourth.

109
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:41,572
Don't flirt with anyone again this time.

110
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,269
I won't do that anymore.

111
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,109
I only love my boyfriend.

112
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:52,578
C'mon, our friends are waiting.

113
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:54,958
Use the mosquito spray that I gave you too, alright?

114
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:55,958
Got it.

115
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:00,280
Don't let me see any bites when you're back.

116
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,987
There won't be any.

117
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,188
Hey.

118
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:08,591
Then, I'll get going now.

119
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:09,591
Mmm.

120
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,433
Go ahead.

121
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,433
I don't wanna go.

122
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:18,368
You guys are annoying.

123
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,251
Why, Fourth? I wanna spend time with Kit.

124
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:23,378
Or you don't wanna spend time with Beam?

125
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:24,378
He's right.

126
00:10:25,014 --> 00:10:26,014
Of course, I do.

127
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:30,153
But don't you forget that I'm the club president.

128
00:10:30,153 --> 00:10:33,153
And you are the vice president.

129
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Alright.

130
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,030
I'm gonna go now.

131
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,076
Mmm, bon voyage.

132
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:41,076
Thanks.

133
00:10:42,077 --> 00:10:43,700
Are you really not gonna stop me?

134
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,375
Well, can you not go?

135
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,958
Yeah.

136
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,885
Hey, if you don't go now,
I'll sign a resignation letter for Fourth.

137
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:50,846
That's a good idea.

138
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,240
Wait, wait, wait.

139
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,035
A resignation letter?

140
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,124
Yeah, I'm serious.

141
00:10:55,124 --> 00:10:58,701
Hey, you guys, hurry up or we'll be late.

142
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,333
Okay.

143
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,381
Ming, go.

144
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,302
Let's go.

145
00:11:02,947 --> 00:11:03,837
I love you.

146
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,288
Me too.

147
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,293
I'll come back soon.

148
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:08,793
Go!

149
00:11:09,255 --> 00:11:09,755
Go!

150
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,182
Bye-bye.

151
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,470
I miss him already.

152
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:27,595
You miss me?

153
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:29,573
No.

154
00:11:36,003 --> 00:11:38,754
Where do you wanna go, Manfah?

155
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:39,754
Mmm...

156
00:11:41,184 --> 00:11:42,902
Can you just drive around?

157
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,243
I'll let you know if something comes up.

158
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,168
Okay, got it. Then I'll just keep driving.

159
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,019
And then find something good to eat, okay?

160
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,019
Mmm! Okay!

161
00:12:07,572 --> 00:12:08,572
Let's eat together, Lom.

162
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:11,171
Manfah, you go ahead first.

163
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:19,927
Where did I leave my cell phone?

164
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,004
Right, Manfah, can I borrow
your phone to call my own number?

165
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:30,089
Oh? What happened?

166
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:33,655
I don't know where I left my phone.

167
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:35,288
I can't find it.

168
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,422
Hey, and why did you just tell me now?

169
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,798
Here. Hurry up and call.

170
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:40,798
There.

171
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:53,811
No one is answering.

172
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,705
Then, once finish the meal,
we should hurry and head back.

173
00:12:59,705 --> 00:13:03,705
No need to rush, I want you
to feel better first before we go back.

174
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,552
Are you sure?

175
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,437
Mmm.

176
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:09,498
It's alright. I guess it's in the car.

177
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,498
Mmm, okay.

178
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:19,226
What are you doing?

179
00:13:19,226 --> 00:13:22,114
I'm taking it for an Instagram story.

180
00:13:22,414 --> 00:13:24,913
Let me see it. Do I look good?

181
00:13:24,913 --> 00:13:26,422
C'mon!

182
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:29,315
Lomnaw always looks handsome.

183
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:30,315
See? You're a cutie.

184
00:13:37,653 --> 00:13:40,042
Mmm...

185
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:42,042
Lom, are you close to Tatch?

186
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:47,008
Oh, not that much.

187
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:49,255
Right.

188
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:54,052
I've known Tatch since high school.

189
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:59,561
And I've liked him ever since I first saw him.

190
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:11,490
It's awful. I liked Tatch
even though I already had a boyfriend.

191
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:20,129
So I broke up with Parak
to begin a relationship with Tatch.

192
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,212
At first, Tatch talked to me.

193
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:32,212
But recently, I feel like that he's changed.

194
00:14:34,014 --> 00:14:37,014
Lom, do you happen to know why?

195
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:49,990
How's it? Found him?

196
00:14:51,663 --> 00:14:52,663
No.

197
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:55,131
Guys, take a look!

198
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:56,977
Hey!

199
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:59,197
Manfah is with Lom.

200
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:00,876
What? How are they both together?

201
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:03,674
I don't know. It's on Manfah's story.

202
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:05,221
Let me call Tatch first.

203
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:06,221
Yeah, you do that.

204
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:13,903
Where did he go?

205
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:44,462
Yeah, Phu?

206
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,630
Hello, Tatch.

207
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,717
I know where Lom is.

208
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:49,850
I saw it on Manfah's story.

209
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,364
I think they're at the cafe at the back of the uni.

210
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:55,364
Manfah?
Okay, guys, thanks a lot.

211
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:11,649
"Tarntatch is calling..."

212
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:15,876
Hey, it's Tatch calling.

213
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,801
Hello, Tatch.

214
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,355
Are you calling me to say that you're sorry?

215
00:16:19,355 --> 00:16:21,206
You know how you feel about me, right?

216
00:16:21,206 --> 00:16:24,010
I'm glad that you know it now.

217
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,890
Is Lomnaw with you?

218
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:30,085
Yeah, he's with me.
Lom took me out for a meal.

219
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:32,510
Can I talk to him?

220
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,308
Why would you talk to Lom?

221
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:37,693
Just go easy on him.
Don't be jealous.

222
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:40,128
I want to talk to Lom.

223
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:44,128
Tatch, you called me.
Why don't you pay attention to me?

224
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:48,188
I have something to talk to Lom.

225
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:51,157
Alright. I'll let you talk to Lom.

226
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:53,157
Here, Tatch wants to talk to you.

227
00:16:57,126 --> 00:16:58,126
Where are you?

228
00:17:00,143 --> 00:17:02,269
What the hell is it with you?

229
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:05,056
You dropped your phone at the parking lot.

230
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:07,611
Oh, really?

231
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:09,958
I've been looking all over for you.

232
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,221
Wait, you, chill out.

233
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:16,221
If you want to be with Manfah, I'll let you.

234
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:19,102
But you must have your phone with you.

235
00:17:19,102 --> 00:17:20,277
So where are you?

236
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:23,577
I'll bring your phone to you.

237
00:17:23,577 --> 00:17:26,577
Man, Tatch will bring my phone to me.

238
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,584
Can't he give it to you at uni?
I don't wanna see Tatch now.

239
00:17:34,343 --> 00:17:36,976
Well, Manfah doesn't want you to come here.

240
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:38,273
Hey, what the heck?

241
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:39,951
I don't wanna see Manfah.

242
00:17:39,951 --> 00:17:41,753
I'm gonna go see you.

243
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:44,753
So where exactly are you?
I'll bring your phone to you.

244
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:47,990
I'll talk to Tatch.

245
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,990
Tatch, you don't have to try
making it up to me. The time's up.

246
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,787
Hello? Wait.

247
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:56,877
Darn it.

248
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,107
I think I'm gonna go back to class in late morning.

249
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:16,740
What do you think, Lom?

250
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,282
Mmm, it's up to you, Manfah.

251
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,135
Tatch is always like this.
He doesn't know what his heart wants.

252
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,135
In the end, he cares about me
but he just doesn't say it out.

253
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:32,625
Lom, are you done eating?

254
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,586
I'm done. I think I wanna go back now.

255
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,586
Then should we ask for a takeaway?

256
00:18:43,138 --> 00:18:46,138
Excuse me, can you wrap this up
for a takeaway for me?

257
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:51,736
Why do I feel a little bad?

258
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:11,307
2 MONTHS AGO

259
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:21,788
You've just moved in.
Why do you have so little stuff?

260
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,721
Hey, thanks a lot, man.

261
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:28,272
You look really bad, pal.

262
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,559
They look worse, man.

263
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,863
So are you gonna go to the party with me?

264
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:35,246
Oh, the opposite room?

265
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:36,803
That's why it's so loud.

266
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:38,642
Yeah, it's my room.

267
00:19:38,642 --> 00:19:41,522
I'm a party animal.

268
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:45,522
You want me to join
but I don't know anyone there.

269
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:47,459
That's why you should go.

270
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:51,255
So you'll meet new friends.

271
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,558
You want me to join, looking like this?

272
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:56,981
No.

273
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,915
Man, that's a pity.

274
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:01,174
Our faculty's Moon is here too.

275
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:03,561
But I think he's drunk as hell now.

276
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:06,903
He just placed the second from the bottom.

277
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:10,459
Faculty's Moon?

278
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,012
Is he handsome?

279
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:13,440
I'm not telling you.

280
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,375
But if you wanna know,
you gotta take a look yourself, okay?

281
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,961
Alright, alright.

282
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:22,961
Let's go so you'll know.

283
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Cheers!

284
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,606
Bottoms up!

285
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:43,872
Where are Tong and Toon?

286
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:47,671
I heard they said they were hungry
so they went to get the fish

287
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:51,173
from the uni's pond and grill them.

288
00:20:51,173 --> 00:20:52,887
What?

289
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:56,887
Right, what they were thinking?

290
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:00,695
Look at the time now.

291
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:02,586
The dean hasn't known about it yet.

292
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,925
It's not about that.

293
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,125
It's just messed up
they didn't invite me to go along.

294
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:40,798
Hey.

295
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:43,478
Tatch!

296
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:51,696
Tatch!

297
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,511
You don't take your eyes off!

298
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:58,511
Yeah, he's a proper Moon.

299
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,950
But if that day, you were with me,
I think you'd become the Moon.

300
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:06,248
It's better this way.

301
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:08,676
He's fit for the title.

302
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:11,894
Alright, if you say so.

303
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:15,689
Go, have a seat and eat!

304
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,108
I'll get us some glasses.

305
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:21,826
Right, I'm gonna go take a shower first
and I'll come back.

306
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:23,633
Alright, hurry up, man.

307
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,259
We'll be waiting and drinking.

308
00:22:25,459 --> 00:22:27,930
Hurry up, okay?

309
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,567
C'mon, guys, let's have some fun!

310
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:35,332
Bottoms up!

311
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:39,332
Am, open the door for me.
Why did you lock the door?

312
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:41,315
Am!

313
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:42,904
Alright, alright.

314
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,297
Open the door for me.

315
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:48,102
I've gotten some more beer.

316
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:50,102
Here's the beer.

317
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,030
Why didn't you tell me that
you were gonna open the door?

318
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,030
Mmm, I'm not...

319
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:06,166
Right, I'll take a nap for a while, okay?

320
00:24:11,304 --> 00:24:12,304
Manfah.

321
00:24:19,064 --> 00:24:20,064
Manfah?

322
00:24:23,784 --> 00:24:29,784
Although I placed second from the bottom,
my love for you is at the top, Manfah.

323
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:00,756
Hello, Phu?

324
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:03,807
Yeah, Lom is back.

325
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:08,916
Okay, I'll hurry and go back.

326
00:25:08,916 --> 00:25:11,263
Where are you now?

327
00:25:11,263 --> 00:25:15,263
I don't know, around 30 kilometres from uni.

328
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,707
Darn, will you be able to make it
in time for our next class?

329
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,182
I'll try my best.

330
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:21,114
Yeah, drive safely, man.

331
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,114
Mmm, okay, man.

332
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:37,631
Is he coming back now?

333
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:41,631
Right. You!
You should tell your friends where you're going.

334
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,443
I'm sorry.

335
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:46,040
I think you should say that to Tarntatch.

336
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,294
He seemed so troubled that
you disappeared in all of a sudden.

337
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,553
Really?

338
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:51,144
Yeah.

339
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:54,144
Mmm. He looked very scary.

340
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:59,523
I was gonna text you all
but I couldn't find my phone.

341
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,798
If you weren't here already,
Tatch would drive to the border to find you.

342
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,798
And what did you do?
Why does Tatch seem to be so worried about you?

343
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:13,721
I don't know. I'm confused.

344
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:21,099
I liked Tatch even though I already had a boyfriend.

345
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:27,771
So I broke up with Parak to begin a relationship with Tatch.

346
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:33,211
Manfah told me something.

347
00:26:33,211 --> 00:26:35,969
Er...I think you could tell us later.

348
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,065
Because it's almost time for our next class.

349
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:38,699
Right.

350
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,297
We should head to the class.

351
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:42,297
Guys! Let's get to class.

352
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:52,942
Hello, students.

353
00:26:52,942 --> 00:26:56,942
Today, we're gonna study
about Agricultural Business Management.

354
00:26:57,332 --> 00:27:01,332
First of all, you need to understand
what Agricultural Business is.

355
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:06,131
Agricultural Business is Agriculture + Business.

356
00:27:07,215 --> 00:27:09,101
So, what is agriculture about?

357
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:11,232
Well, there are three things.

358
00:27:11,703 --> 00:27:15,703
First, it's planting.
(Tarntatch: Come out here.) (Lomnaw: Now?)

359
00:27:16,221 --> 00:27:27,027
Second, it's livestock, all of them, including pigs,
chicken, cows, buffalos, or exotic animals like ostriches.

360
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:31,027
So it's all about Agriculture.

361
00:27:31,162 --> 00:27:33,162
And third, it's about fishery.

362
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,632
Thanks, but you could give it to me
when the class is over.

363
00:27:46,632 --> 00:27:48,052
Why don't you go to class first?

364
00:27:48,052 --> 00:27:51,263
I'm worried about you to death.
I thought you were kidnapped.

365
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:52,609
Me? Kidnapped?

366
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:53,911
Yeah.

367
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:57,427
I was looking for you at the parking lot
and I saw your phone on the floor.

368
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,568
Don't overreact.

369
00:27:59,568 --> 00:28:03,537
And were you happy going out with Manfah?

370
00:28:03,537 --> 00:28:05,427
You dragged me out of the class to talk about this?

371
00:28:05,427 --> 00:28:07,799
Answer me.

372
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,019
No. Not at all.

373
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:11,937
Why weren't you happy?

374
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:13,937
Don't you really like her?

375
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,349
Not really.

376
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:17,868
What is it with you?

377
00:28:17,868 --> 00:28:19,376
So what's it gonna be?

378
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:21,216
What's what gonna be?

379
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:22,216
Lom!

380
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:29,513
So do you like girls or guys?

381
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:44,326
Answer me.

382
00:28:45,672 --> 00:28:49,672
So I'd know whether I should continue or stop.

383
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:54,363
I...

384
00:28:54,363 --> 00:28:57,363
Hey, those two students...

385
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:01,473
Do you want to be in the class or not?

386
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:05,000
If not, please go fight somewhere else.

387
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
You're grown ups. What you're doing
disturbs other students.

388
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:11,105
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,966
So do you like girls or guys?

390
00:29:39,966 --> 00:29:40,966
Answer me.

391
00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:46,485
So I'd know whether I should continue or stop.

392
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:53,137
Who could sleep after hearing that?

393
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:02,744
Wayo is live?

394
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,137
He's just doing a live broadcast of Pha's study.

395
00:30:30,137 --> 00:30:31,853
The audience is more than ten thousand...

396
00:30:31,853 --> 00:30:35,853
If he's this hot,
he should stop being a doctor and go be a star.

397
00:30:41,615 --> 00:30:43,967
Yo, what are you doing?

398
00:30:44,437 --> 00:30:45,437
Come here.

399
00:30:47,718 --> 00:30:49,188
Pha, what's up?

400
00:30:49,188 --> 00:30:51,188
Are you doing a live while I'm studying?

401
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:57,242
Darn, is it gonna be another drama?

402
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:03,754
Why? I'm just going on live.
Why do you have to be mad at me?

403
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,816
No, I'm not mad.

404
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:09,620
But I don't want you to do it while I study.

405
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,377
Why? It's so cute.

406
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:13,888
Give it to me.

407
00:31:13,888 --> 00:31:15,897
No, Pha.

408
00:31:15,897 --> 00:31:19,897
Hey, it's live broadcast of them
fighting for the phone now.

409
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:20,630
Give it here.

410
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,554
No.

411
00:31:21,554 --> 00:31:22,608
C'mon.

412
00:31:22,608 --> 00:31:24,000
No.

413
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,051
Give me.

414
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:26,609
No.

415
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:31,078
Pha, Pha!

416
00:31:31,078 --> 00:31:32,078
No.

417
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:34,832
No.

418
00:31:39,152 --> 00:31:41,088
Give it back.

419
00:31:41,088 --> 00:31:43,020
I won't.

420
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,116
Why? I was just going live with your daily routine.

421
00:31:46,116 --> 00:31:48,167
I didn't disturb you.

422
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,921
Yo.

423
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:52,182
So you're doing my daily routine, right?

424
00:31:52,182 --> 00:31:54,182
Alright, I got this.

425
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:58,988
Pha, what are you doing?

426
00:31:58,988 --> 00:32:02,085
Well, you want other people
to see my daily routine, don't you?

427
00:32:02,085 --> 00:32:04,803
So I'll show them.

428
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:07,434
What routine, Pha?

429
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:11,236
Well, the routine between you and me.

430
00:32:11,236 --> 00:32:12,236
Pha.

431
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:19,685
Pha, I give up.

432
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:39,698
What the hell is this?

433
00:33:43,386 --> 00:33:45,386
The live broadcast turns into an erotic movie.

434
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:44,163
Crazy cousin!

435
00:34:57,475 --> 00:34:58,475
What should I do now?

436
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:03,817
Otherwise, I won't get rid of
Wayo and Pha out of my head.

437
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,430
Well, I'll go live.

438
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:22,644
Why the hell is Lom going live right now?

439
00:35:24,533 --> 00:35:25,533
Hello, everyone.

440
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,660
I couldn't sleep so I'm now going live.

441
00:35:31,883 --> 00:35:34,350
So maybe I'll be able to sleep.

442
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,350
Earlier, I saw Wayo's live and I saw Pha.

443
00:35:40,232 --> 00:35:41,732
So I wanted to try to go live myself.

444
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:50,042
I think I'm gonna sing a song for you guys.

445
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:53,066
You can make a request of songs you'd like.

446
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:56,066
I'll sing for you.

447
00:35:57,627 --> 00:36:00,515
Leave the song you like in the comment.

448
00:36:00,515 --> 00:36:03,236
Oh, you wanna hear the drums too?

449
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:06,713
Wait up, let me find something.

450
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:08,713
Here. Coming.

451
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:13,175
So, imagine it's a real drum, alright?

452
00:36:14,557 --> 00:36:16,557
So how's it? Beautiful?

453
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:28,922
Darn, you should quit from being the candidate.

454
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,679
Shaking as heck.

455
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:38,616
"The chicken is roasted!
The chicken is roasted."

456
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:44,116
"It's poked in its left butt,
and its right butt."

457
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:53,053
"Calling Lomnaw..."

458
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,023
Er...please excuse me, guys.

459
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:03,538
Who's calling now?

460
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,510
Hello.

461
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:17,872
Stop going live right now.

462
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:20,121
Who's this?

463
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:22,303
It's me, Tarntatch.

464
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:25,518
Wait, how did you get my number?

465
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:29,518
Er...I got it from Am
in case there's something urgent.

466
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:35,045
Oh? And how's it urgent that you have to call
and tell me to stop going live?

467
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,053
I want a reason.

468
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,733
Er...it's late.

469
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:38,952
Huh?

470
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:42,087
Right, I don't want you to go live.
You'll get more followers.

471
00:37:42,087 --> 00:37:45,048
How about this? I'll stop the live.

472
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:47,976
But I want something in exchange.

473
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:49,979
Name your price.

474
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:52,405
You have to go live.

475
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:53,449
What? No.

476
00:37:53,449 --> 00:37:54,832
I don't know how to.

477
00:37:54,832 --> 00:37:57,388
How is it difficult? Just press live.

478
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:00,856
Say what you wanna say. Anything at all.

479
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:02,944
Er...can it be tomorrow?

480
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:05,749
No, you have to do it tonight.

481
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:06,921
Only tonight.

482
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:09,275
So tomorrow, people will share it.

483
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:11,283
And you have to save the file.

484
00:38:11,283 --> 00:38:12,669
So people will keep coming to see it.

485
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:15,009
Why are you telling this to your competitor?

486
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,985
If you don't do it, I'll continue my live.

487
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:19,904
Ah, alright.

488
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,708
Excellent. I'll look forward to it.

489
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:24,100
But you gotta delete your previous file.

490
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,818
What the hell is wrong with you?

491
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:28,537
You're afraid people will share it and you won't win?

492
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:30,042
C'mon.

493
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:31,000
Alright, alright.

494
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,592
You're so annoying.

495
00:38:32,763 --> 00:38:33,763
You go live now.

496
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:40,619
Here we go.

497
00:39:02,364 --> 00:39:03,364
Hello.

498
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:30,306
"Are you doing well?"

499
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:33,267
Oh, yes, I'm doing well.

500
00:39:37,496 --> 00:39:41,496
So this is my first live...

501
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,139
Please support me.

502
00:39:57,149 --> 00:40:01,149
I asked Lom if he liked girls or guys...

503
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:02,961
Darn!

504
00:40:02,961 --> 00:40:04,889
There he is...

505
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:05,523
Lom!

506
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:06,746
My friend likes you.

507
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:07,800
So I got turned down?

508
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,928
Who's turned down?

509
00:40:09,214 --> 00:40:12,515
He's blushing and he doesn't know what to do now.

510
00:40:12,515 --> 00:40:14,730
Tarntatch's followers are up.

511
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:16,616
But you still got many more followers.

512
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,251
You think Tatch can catch up?

513
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:21,005
Well, I have to do everything
in order for him to catch up.

514
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:22,563
He must be the faculty's representative.

515
00:40:22,563 --> 00:40:23,619
Get in the car first.

516
00:40:23,819 --> 00:40:28,019
If you don't leave now, I'll think of it
as if you wanna spend more time with me.
