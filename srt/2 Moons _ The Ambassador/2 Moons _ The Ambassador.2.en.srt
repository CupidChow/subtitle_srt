1
00:01:55,379 --> 00:02:01,427
Next week, our uni will hold a festival
named "Kaset Festival".

2
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:04,152
There will be the Ambassador contest.

3
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,910
Therefore, I think we should have a serious selection.

4
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,250
How?

5
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,028
Numbers of followers on Instagram.

6
00:02:10,028 --> 00:02:11,242
Huh?

7
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:14,300
And most importantly, don't buy followers. At all!

8
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,022
Whatever, anything else?

9
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:17,360
Excuse me.

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,158
Pha told me if I wanted his number,

11
00:02:20,158 --> 00:02:22,497
I had to come and ask from you.

12
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:23,714
089...

13
00:02:23,714 --> 00:02:25,052
Darn.

14
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:26,440
Thank you so much.

15
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,239
I'll call you later.

16
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,378
Alright.

17
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:31,220
Thank you so much again.

18
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,220
No problem.

19
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,126
Let's go.

20
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:48,593
Beam.

21
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,849
What's wrong? Why are you sitting here alone?

22
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,199
Beam.

23
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,048
What's the matter?

24
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,561
Are you happy?

25
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:04,005
Happy about what?

26
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:07,555
Well, that's a beautiful car.

27
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:08,905
Beautiful?

28
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,170
You're such a flirt as usual.

29
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:18,676
A flirt?

30
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,273
I was just helping them with their car.

31
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:23,823
If they weren't pretty, you wouldn't help them, would you?

32
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:25,996
Of course, I would.

33
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:28,808
Their car broke down at night.

34
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,278
How could I not help?

35
00:03:30,278 --> 00:03:33,278
And one more thing, I barely talked to them.

36
00:03:33,741 --> 00:03:35,741
And you know why?

37
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:42,094
Because I told them that my boyfriend is sitting here jealous.

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Who? Who's jealous?

39
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,298
And...

40
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:52,887
where is my coffee?

41
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,603
I forgot.

42
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:00,217
Hey, Beam.

43
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,960
I'm sleepy as hell. C'mon. Go buy one.

44
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:08,666
This is so hard.

45
00:04:10,048 --> 00:04:12,048
How can I pretend to lose?

46
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Ouch!

47
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:25,721
Darn.

48
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:38,826
"Wanna be a number two in your heart."

49
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,826
Darn, that gave me goosebumps.

50
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:53,278
Darn, I slipped.

51
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,428
Tarntatchtatchtatch: Are you peeking?

52
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:03,062
Man, he knows.

53
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:05,039
"Isn't my competitor going to update anything tonight?"

54
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,039
"Oh, right, he's afraid he's gonna lose."

55
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:14,594
Alright, you asked for it, Tatch.

56
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:17,652
I'll make it happen.

57
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,108
A dog?

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
A buffalo?

59
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:29,593
A tree?

60
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:32,799
Where have all my pics gone?

61
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,805
Ah, this'll do.

62
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:45,152
"Number two is bad. I'll tell my Mom about it."

63
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,206
You asked for it, Tatch.

64
00:05:51,675 --> 00:05:57,675
Tarntatchtatchtatch: Why don't you jump in
so you can be with your friends?

65
00:06:14,612 --> 00:06:18,612
Guys, here I come!

66
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,955
Would you die if you don't get on my nerves?

67
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:37,481
"Shut up!"

68
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,161
"I'm gonna sleep."

69
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:43,161
"I get nightmares from reading your messages."

70
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:48,511
Tarntatchtatchtatch: Sorry, I meant it.

71
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,017
Darn you, Tatch!

72
00:06:56,898 --> 00:06:58,898
There, that will make me have a good night sleep.

73
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:34,595
Right, Yo, can you go help me with the beer cases?

74
00:07:35,816 --> 00:07:36,816
They're in the car.

75
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,490
I'm busy.

76
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,708
KungKringg: I'm at the hotel now. Have you arrived yet, Pha?

77
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:54,004
Yo!

78
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,770
Yes?

79
00:07:57,954 --> 00:07:59,954
You gave that woman my number?

80
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:03,806
You seemed so popular, so I wanted to support.

81
00:08:03,806 --> 00:08:04,806
Why don't you reply?

82
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,744
C'mon, Yo, I've got a wonderful boyfriend already.

83
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:11,444
Why would you let me talk to other people?

84
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,961
C'mon, Yo, is it fun to tease me like this?

85
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,850
And why did you do that to me?

86
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:20,694
Hey, Yo, I'm sorry.

87
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:23,129
Yo!

88
00:08:34,622 --> 00:08:37,622
I'm sorry that Papa's late today, dear.

89
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:43,751
Last night, there was a guy getting on my nerves all night.

90
00:08:44,506 --> 00:08:46,506
He's such a bad guy.

91
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:49,042
Ah, here, take it easy.

92
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,090
And he's very handsome too.

93
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,896
True. He's very handsome.

94
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,366
Darn, when did you get here?

95
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:03,794
Actually, he's not that handsome, dear.

96
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:05,281
So this one is your dear baby?

97
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,962
I believe you. He looks just like his Papa.

98
00:09:10,055 --> 00:09:13,000
Sompoch, why don't you share your food with your Papa?

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Nosy!

100
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,050
Tell your Papa that I'm talking to you, Sompoch.

101
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:25,393
You woke up early.

102
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:27,692
Are you talking to me or the buffalo?

103
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,375
If I talked to a buffalo, how would he answer?

104
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,159
No need to think. I was talking to you.

105
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,349
I came here early because I got a morning class.

106
00:09:48,436 --> 00:09:50,436
But you got here too early.

107
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:54,864
There's no one here yet.

108
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:57,882
You, too, got here early.

109
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,890
That's normal for me.

110
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:01,487
And that's normal for me too.

111
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:04,089
I have something to ask you.

112
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,466
Shoot.

113
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,429
Can you not say the word real Moon and fake Moon?

114
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,519
It sounds weird.

115
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,740
Then what would you like me to call it?

116
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Moon number one and Moon number two.

117
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm number one.

118
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:20,105
Yeah.

119
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,413
What?

120
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:22,887
Well, you were here first.

121
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:25,188
What's with him?

122
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Wanna go grab a bite?

123
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,247
I'm asking you.

124
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:34,925
Everyone in the faculty knows that we're competitors.

125
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:38,643
Eating together, wouldn't that be strange at all?

126
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Your friends aren't here yet, not even one.

127
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:47,749
Alright. But you gotta keep distance from me.

128
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:50,718
You're scared of being compared?

129
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
It's because you're my competitor!

130
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
Alright, I don't wanna be bitten too.

131
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,789
Wow, how come you got so much?

132
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,731
Beauty previlege, of course.

133
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:27,745
You want me to buy you a meal?

134
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:30,745
Nope, they will lose profit.

135
00:11:58,193 --> 00:11:59,193
Tatch.

136
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:00,623
Hey, Man.

137
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,713
I was just thinking about you, Tatch.

138
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,972
Why are you eating here alone?

139
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:09,085
Er...where were you? You bought a lot of stuff.

140
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:13,085
I just got off class so I bought something
from the back of uni's building.

141
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,184
So where are you going
after you're done eating?

142
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,944
I'm not so sure.

143
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,364
Can you take me to buy some clothes?

144
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:21,751
Where?

145
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,839
At Siam. I happened to see from Instagram
that it's at Siam.

146
00:12:26,556 --> 00:12:28,569
So I think I'm going.

147
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:31,000
I think I saw it there.

148
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hey, Lom.

149
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:35,769
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

150
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,820
Are you still wondering about things
between Tatch and Manfah like us?

151
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:44,373
Tatch, who made the move first? Tell me.

152
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,624
It's hard to tell with this kind of stuff.

153
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:48,838
Did she hit on you first?

154
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:51,319
You guys are way too curious.

155
00:12:51,319 --> 00:12:53,331
I just wanna know...

156
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,648
how you can get a uni's Star to follow you.

157
00:12:57,648 --> 00:12:59,648
I guess you'd have to be a Moon first.

158
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:12,751
Guys, can I sit with you?

159
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:15,046
Of course, sit down.

160
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:27,969
I have to get going.

161
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,101
See ya.

162
00:13:42,014 --> 00:13:43,014
Here.

163
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:46,608
Tatch.

164
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,608
Here, the clothes I was telling you about.

165
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:50,257
Are they pretty?

166
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:51,458
Mmm.

167
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,697
This one is cute too.

168
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:53,760
Man.

169
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,760
Huh?

170
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:57,064
I'll go put away the dish first.

171
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:59,090
Tatch, you haven't eaten anything.

172
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:01,696
I'm already full.

173
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:02,696
Okay.

174
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:04,172
I'll wait here.

175
00:14:10,895 --> 00:14:12,816
Why are you eating here?

176
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,816
Your bag is there, so you should be there.

177
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:16,996
Well, you have a guest.

178
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:19,709
You like her?

179
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:27,482
Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't know she was seeing you.

180
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,659
But I will stop talking to her.

181
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,710
Tatch! Tatch! Tatch!

182
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,710
I haven't finished my dish yet!

183
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,694
Lom, you have to pretend
that you're competing with Tarntatch...

184
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:51,828
though you'd like to give up from the beginning?

185
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:54,328
If he finds out later, won't he be mad at you?

186
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,664
Why will he be mad at me?

187
00:14:57,555 --> 00:15:00,555
If it gets to that point, I'll handle it myself.

188
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:05,302
What if it doesn't go your way, and you got more followers...

189
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:06,393
what will you do?

190
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:08,240
C'mon, I'll handle it.

191
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,923
If it really reaches that point, and even if I have to get down on my knees and beg him,

192
00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:12,844
I'll do it.

193
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:15,026
Whoa!

194
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,950
Do you really hate him?

195
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:20,915
Yes, he gets on my nerves.

196
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:24,726
It doesn't seem like it.

197
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:28,167
I think you want him to be our uni's representative.

198
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,213
But you're saying that you don't like him...

199
00:15:30,213 --> 00:15:31,188
It sounds weird.

200
00:15:31,188 --> 00:15:33,827
Tong, take a look at my hand.

201
00:15:33,827 --> 00:15:37,579
On my left hand, it's the hatred that I have towards Tarntatch.

202
00:15:37,579 --> 00:15:43,079
And on my right hand, it's my feeling that he deserves to be the uni's representative.

203
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,175
And, I'm a right-handed.

204
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,521
I think my right hand is more important.

205
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:50,521
Even though I got two hands.

206
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:52,069
Huh?

207
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,161
What?

208
00:15:58,938 --> 00:15:59,938
Nevermind.

209
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:01,663
Simply put,

210
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:06,522
no matter how much I hate Tarntatch,

211
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:09,522
I think he's suitable for being our uni's representative.

212
00:16:12,896 --> 00:16:13,896
Therefore...

213
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:16,584
you guys help me out here.

214
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,800
First thing first, take a pic of me.

215
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Okay.

216
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's gonna be a Boomerang.

217
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,549
Okay. Ready.

218
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,709
So hot!

219
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:31,509
What happened?

220
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:44,225
Hey, guys, take a look at this.

221
00:16:48,146 --> 00:16:50,146
Look at those six packs.

222
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:54,537
The caption is so welcoming.

223
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:56,373
So what's it gonna be, Lom?

224
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:57,542
You need to fight him now!

225
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,550
Lom, you must do something now.

226
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:04,638
I guess I'll have to use an ultimate skill.

227
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:05,856
Mmm.

228
00:17:05,902 --> 00:17:06,902
What is it?

229
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,100
Tong, count to three and then snap it for me, alright?

230
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Okay.

231
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:13,902
Ready?

232
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,870
One. Two. Three.

233
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:23,128
Got it.

234
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,307
Alright, give it to me.

235
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:17,839
Darn, Beam, what if I drown?

236
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,533
I...will find a new boyfriend.

237
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:22,213
What did you just say?

238
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:23,287
Come here, you!

239
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:25,301
What did you just say?

240
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:26,603
A new boyfriend?

241
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:27,279
Huh?

242
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,243
A new boyfriend?

243
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,381
You still want a new boyfriend?

244
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:31,429
No, no, I don't.

245
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:32,429
Then...

246
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,912
shall we go back to our room?

247
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:36,912
Why?

248
00:19:38,336 --> 00:19:40,336
There's a comfy bed.

249
00:19:40,922 --> 00:19:41,922
What will you do?

250
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll tell you once we're there.

251
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll tell you what you can do in a bed.

252
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,754
What's the caption?

253
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:54,955
Eat that!

254
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:58,835
Let's take a look.

255
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,757
"Some people aren't for mingling; they're to be left in piles."

256
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:04,757
What's the caption?

257
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:13,775
Whoa!

258
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,581
This is war!

259
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:19,587
You, doing this is gaining more chance for you to win.

260
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,846
I told you I'd handle it.

261
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,855
Oh, dear, that was very fast.

262
00:20:28,323 --> 00:20:30,323
You did well. I loved it.

263
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,964
How's my competitor?

264
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,296
Your competitor?

265
00:20:38,296 --> 00:20:41,595
Well, nothing.

266
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,595
Nothing unusual?

267
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:49,049
No, you can say that he's indifferent.

268
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,249
Darn it. Why is that?

269
00:21:40,222 --> 00:21:42,236
Alright, everyone.

270
00:21:42,236 --> 00:21:44,787
We have something important to announce.

271
00:21:44,787 --> 00:21:46,298
Tell them.

272
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:56,298
Right now, Lomnaw has followed Tarntatch on Instagram.

273
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:09,253
Clap your hands!

274
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:13,253
We hope to see something fun.

275
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:21,809
We'll get to have a representative who's worthy for XXU...

276
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,193
and always wins The Ambassador,

277
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:29,193
from Kaset Festival.

278
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,183
Er...excuse me.

279
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:50,183
Could you please take a pic for me?

280
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,150
Oh, Pha.

281
00:22:58,236 --> 00:22:59,166
Oh.

282
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,166
What a coincidence!

283
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,464
Could you take a pic for me, please?

284
00:23:05,607 --> 00:23:06,607
Of course.

285
00:23:07,283 --> 00:23:08,283
Okay, got it.

286
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:17,145
Hey, aren't those the three girls from yesterday?

287
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,145
Yeah.

288
00:23:18,823 --> 00:23:20,823
They came straight to Pha.

289
00:23:21,046 --> 00:23:22,046
That's right.

290
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,096
It's like they planned to be here.

291
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,070
Hey, Yo.

292
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:28,793
Pha didn't call them here, right?

293
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,640
I don't think so.

294
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,640
But if he did, this won't end well.

295
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:39,691
From his voice, I think it won't end well soon.

296
00:23:43,528 --> 00:23:46,278
Whoa, take a look. They're flirting.

297
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:48,928
They took a selfie too.

298
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:53,229
Guys, please tell everyone that
I'm gonna go back to my room and pack my stuff.

299
00:23:53,462 --> 00:23:54,260
I wanna go back early.

300
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:55,536
Got a morning class tomorrow.

301
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,710
Hey, wait up.

302
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,602
Why don't we go back...

303
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,158
Hey, wait up.

304
00:23:59,158 --> 00:23:59,458
Yo!

305
00:23:59,583 --> 00:23:59,883
Yo!

306
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:02,299
Yo, come out here later.

307
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,125
One, here, let me. Two.

308
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,125
Yo, don't leave just yet.

309
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:09,013
Okay.

310
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:10,563
Oh, excuse me.

311
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,817
Okay, thank you so much.

312
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:13,194
Thank you.

313
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:14,542
He's inside now.

314
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:16,799
Follow him.

315
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:21,677
Hey, what's your name?

316
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:23,475
My name is Ming.

317
00:24:23,811 --> 00:24:25,811
Aren't you two lonely?

318
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,359
Would you like a company?

319
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,551
Come join us in the pool over there.

320
00:24:29,686 --> 00:24:30,611
Let's swim.

321
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:32,537
There will be four of us, so it won't get lonely.

322
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,537
Let's go as pairs over there.

323
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:08,082
Darn.

324
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:12,347
How could he gain so many followers in a short time?

325
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:18,108
But that's good.

326
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:28,488
manfahhh.sis: You upload your pics quite often.

327
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:30,488
Manfah won't stop commenting.

328
00:25:35,545 --> 00:25:39,545
Hey, why is he only replying to other people's comments?

329
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,767
But he's not replying to Manfah.

330
00:25:46,533 --> 00:25:47,533
Why is that?

331
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:58,171
Lomnawwwww: Is this all that you got?

332
00:26:02,523 --> 00:26:03,320
Tarntatchtatchtatch: If this is all what I got,
you wouldn't comment on my pic.

333
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,797
Darn. Speedy reply.

334
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:07,797
Do you despise me or what?

335
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,768
Why wasn't it Jinjin, the faculty's Moon?

336
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:33,106
Why does it have to be you?

337
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:38,122
I was gonna say I'm sorry but I changed my mind...

338
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:40,548
I'd say it served you right.

339
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What are you looking at?

340
00:26:48,777 --> 00:26:49,777
Why don't you eat your accessories too?

341
00:26:50,662 --> 00:26:51,662
Oh, getting on my nerves too, huh?

342
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:52,999
Well, you started it.

343
00:26:54,467 --> 00:26:56,467
And why did you park at Faculty of Engineering?

344
00:26:56,968 --> 00:26:57,968
There's few spots at our faculty.

345
00:26:58,652 --> 00:26:59,585
That's why I parked here.

346
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,765
And you?

347
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:01,765
I followed you.

348
00:27:02,335 --> 00:27:03,335
Darn.

349
00:27:05,702 --> 00:27:06,702
So where are you gonna get on the ride?

350
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:08,458
You changed the topic so quickly.

351
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,255
Is it over there?

352
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,599
Or there?

353
00:27:12,191 --> 00:27:13,191
Or is it that way?

354
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:14,325
I won't tell you.

355
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,883
Are you really not telling me?

356
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:28,664
You're mean.

357
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:30,968
Would you stop being so annoying?

358
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:32,768
About what?

359
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:34,438
Many things.

360
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:38,616
And to pretend to not be annoying means you're annoying me.

361
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,133
So can you tell me where to get on the ride?

362
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:45,133
I'm walking slowly now so you can follow.

363
00:27:45,354 --> 00:27:46,354
Don't talk so much.

364
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:50,611
So am I going to the class with the faculty's Moon?

365
00:27:51,415 --> 00:27:52,415
Darn, I'm so glad.

366
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,250
You suck.

367
00:28:04,495 --> 00:28:07,495
When there was a Moon selection, why weren't you there?

368
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:10,133
If I went there, you wouldn't get to be the Moon.

369
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,710
Of course not.

370
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,886
But that way, it's good that I didn't go.

371
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:17,982
I didn't want to be the Moon.

372
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:24,035
If you were a representative instead of me,
you would be the uni's Moon by now.

373
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:27,541
And our faculty wouldn't lose.

374
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:32,388
But if I were, I might not get the first rank.

375
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:35,815
Do you really think that I'm that skilled?

376
00:28:36,202 --> 00:28:38,202
I'm certain that you could do it.

377
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,910
If there's gonna be a new Moon selection,

378
00:28:43,757 --> 00:28:45,757
I'm positive that everyone in the faculty will vote for you,

379
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,559
including me.

380
00:28:49,819 --> 00:28:53,819
But I think 99.99%...

381
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,080
What about another 0.01%?

382
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:02,176
Well, it's my vote...for you.

383
00:29:04,855 --> 00:29:07,855
Don't be such an ass. You hate me.

384
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,030
Why would you vote for me?

385
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,079
And who in the world would vote for himself?

386
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:16,219
I'm kidding.

387
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:21,342
If there are another 100 selections,
I would still vote for you anyway.

388
00:29:21,895 --> 00:29:25,895
You can't go soft for me
in the Ambassador contest .

389
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:29,692
I know that. Normally, I don't post pics of myself very often.

390
00:29:30,415 --> 00:29:32,882
But I will in order to compete with you by the followers gained.

391
00:29:32,882 --> 00:29:33,882
That's good.

392
00:29:34,931 --> 00:29:36,931
If you lose, will you cry for me?

393
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:39,281
Why would I cry?

394
00:29:41,774 --> 00:29:44,774
Alright, that's a relief to hear.

395
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:03,647
It won't get here faster by just looking.

396
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:04,829
Pha!

397
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:07,789
Who's that? I can't see.

398
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:09,871
I'm here!

399
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:11,467
Hey!

400
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:14,401
How come you came back so early?

401
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:16,401
We got a little problem.

402
00:30:17,295 --> 00:30:18,795
You mean you and Yo?

403
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:21,224
Mmm, something like that.

404
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The ride is here.

405
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:32,584
Go! Get in!

406
00:31:04,233 --> 00:31:06,233
I'm here, darling. What's the emergency?

407
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:07,621
The A/C is broken.

408
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:16,629
Fix it, would you?

409
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:20,223
You think I can fix that?

410
00:31:21,689 --> 00:31:23,458
Doesn't an engineer know how to fix that?

411
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:25,458
Wait, what's the logic here?

412
00:31:26,166 --> 00:31:27,166
Oh.

413
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,771
Engineers can fix stuff.

414
00:31:30,663 --> 00:31:33,163
Okay, Kit. Let's get this straight.

415
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,340
An A/C mechanic doesn't have to graduate from Engineering.

416
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,810
And not all engineers can fix the A/C.

417
00:31:38,195 --> 00:31:41,664
So that means I gotta call an A/C mechanic to fix it.

418
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:42,664
Hm-mmm.

419
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:45,754
Then you can leave, I'll call an A/C mechanic.

420
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,799
Wait, you're gonna call an A/C mechanic
to fix the A/C one on one?

421
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:57,991
Okay, okay, I'll try to fix it for you.

422
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:58,991
Hang on.

423
00:32:04,717 --> 00:32:05,717
Take this.

424
00:32:06,146 --> 00:32:07,146
Thank you.

425
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:29,322
Do you have a screwdriver?

426
00:32:30,537 --> 00:32:31,537
Yeah.

427
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You could use some cleaning here.

428
00:32:39,433 --> 00:32:41,433
I got it, but it may be too small.

429
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But mine isn't.

430
00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:44,779
Naughty.

431
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,450
I'm serious.

432
00:32:48,747 --> 00:32:50,747
I know that. No need to repeat it.

433
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:57,048
Speaking of...when we went to the pool villa,

434
00:32:58,139 --> 00:33:00,139
we hadn't had a chance to...

435
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:04,442
What are you looking at?

436
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,366
But now we got the time.

437
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
Fix the A/C first.

438
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:10,386
What if I can?

439
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:18,215
If you can, then...you got it.

440
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:21,681
Okay. Then I'll hurry up and finish this.

441
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:23,366
Hang in there.

442
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:47,291
So can you tell me now what happened between you and Yo?

443
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:54,126
Well, we didn't have a fight. We just misunderstood.

444
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:57,431
Oh. But you're still together, right?

445
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,272
What a mouth!

446
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,110
C'mon, I just wanna know.

447
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:07,424
Right, Pha, about the thing you wanted to tell me...

448
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:08,924
Will you tell it to me now?

449
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,641
What are you talking about? When was it?

450
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:14,205
When you were going to the U.S.

451
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,040
You had a problem with Yo that you almost broke up...

452
00:34:19,762 --> 00:34:25,637
Oh, about Yo's pic with the red mark posted all over uni?

453
00:34:25,637 --> 00:34:28,637
Yeah, yeah, can you tell me all about that?

454
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,694
Do you really want me to tell you now?

455
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:35,498
I'll do it later.

456
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,041
See? You avoided it again.

457
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,177
And when am I ever gonna know it?

458
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,139
And who's this?

459
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:58,693
Oh, this is a friend from the faculty.

460
00:34:59,114 --> 00:35:00,114
Lomnaw's friend.

461
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:02,876
And who are you?

462
00:35:07,007 --> 00:35:08,007
I'm off.

463
00:35:21,512 --> 00:35:22,512
So who's that guy?

464
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:25,937
Pha-Pana Gongthanin.

465
00:35:26,683 --> 00:35:29,683
Our uni's Moon from two years ago.

466
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:35,030
And what is it between you two?

467
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:36,619
What's between us?

468
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Well, do you like guys or girls?

469
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,060
Or you like girls but you're seeing a guy?

470
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:46,147
And why are you sticking your nose into my business?

471
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:47,486
I'm just wondering.

472
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:49,572
And what if I don't answer?

473
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:52,512
Then you don't have to answer.

474
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,654
So are you being annoying again?

475
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,702
I'm waiting for you to thank me.

476
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
And what if I don't thank you?

477
00:36:14,663 --> 00:36:16,663
Then I'll kick you off the tram now.

478
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,209
You won't dare do it.

479
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:24,424
You really don't know that you got a good quality?

480
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,530
Huh?

481
00:36:27,628 --> 00:36:30,556
You said you're not suitable for being the uni's Moon.

482
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,612
But look at how charming you are.

483
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:34,612
Just standing here and you shine.

484
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:41,126
If you're not charming, a good-looking guy like that
won't have a thing for you.

485
00:36:42,551 --> 00:36:45,551
And stop saying that I'm more suitable
for being the Moon than you.

486
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:47,386
Understood?

487
00:36:49,189 --> 00:36:50,689
Wow, you can talk nicely too.

488
00:36:51,819 --> 00:36:54,219
Alright, I'll tell you.

489
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,298
Pha is...

490
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:01,855
my cousin, not the person I'm seeing.

491
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:03,855
It's a wrong guess.

492
00:37:05,864 --> 00:37:07,864
Well, who would know?

493
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:10,537
You don't look alike at all.

494
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:14,588
So you're back to being annoying again?

495
00:37:16,005 --> 00:37:17,145
Well, you two really don't look alike.

496
00:37:17,145 --> 00:37:18,109
You...

497
00:37:18,109 --> 00:37:19,109
The handsomeness is different.

498
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,068
Hey, you!

499
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,037
Darn.

500
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:01,195
What's wrong?

501
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,708
You look like it's the end of the world.

502
00:38:03,677 --> 00:38:04,677
True.

503
00:38:04,729 --> 00:38:05,729
Who did something to you?

504
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:09,024
That's right. Who did something to me?

505
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,359
Guys, take a look, my followers got bigger.

506
00:38:12,494 --> 00:38:16,494
It has skyrocketed.

507
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:17,626
Or...

508
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,632
did Pha post a pic of me?

509
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:28,105
No, from the notification I set on him.

510
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,105
He only posted pics of Wayo.

511
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:31,287
I know!

512
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:32,924
Take a look at this.

513
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,500
Tatch posted a pic of you when you weren't noticing.

514
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,941
And his arm was over you.

515
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:43,823
With this caption,
"The foundation isn't good. Needs extra care."

516
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:47,378
And have your Instagram username here without tagging.

517
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:57,393
Tatch!

518
00:38:58,554 --> 00:39:00,554
You posted a pic of me on your Instagram story?

519
00:39:03,481 --> 00:39:04,481
So?

520
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:07,779
Then people would come and follow me more and more.

521
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:09,615
Isn't that a good thing though?

522
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:12,162
You should be glad that I helped you.

523
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:14,335
You helped a competitor?

524
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,656
You're so not sincere.

525
00:39:18,897 --> 00:39:21,897
I can upload anything I want to.

526
00:39:24,077 --> 00:39:27,077
Alright, so is this how you're gonna play?

527
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,219
Well, this is my Instagram.

528
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:52,815
So can you tell me now, what the hell is wrong with you?

529
00:39:52,815 --> 00:39:54,941
If you don't tell me, I'll call Panon.

530
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:56,326
Hey, don't.

531
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:58,294
If you wanna know anything, just ask me.

532
00:39:58,294 --> 00:39:59,385
Can I really ask you?

533
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:01,690
And you don't have to call anyone.

534
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,200
Tarntatch had a problem with Panon?

535
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,072
I was just having a phone call with Panon,

536
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:09,913
and Tarntatch saw me as an enemy in just a second.

537
00:40:09,913 --> 00:40:13,039
I think they had a big problem.

538
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:15,539
I'm off, COMPETITOR.
