1
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,219
Lom, are you close to Tatch?

2
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:00,653
Recently, I feel like that he's changed.

3
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,372
Lom, do you happen to know why?

4
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:06,304
He seemed so troubled that
you disappeared in all of a sudden.

5
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:07,810
Really?

6
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,856
So do you like girls or guys?

7
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:11,069
Answer me.

8
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,069
So I'd know whether I should continue or stop.

9
00:02:19,982 --> 00:02:20,982
What's up?

10
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
What's up?

11
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:28,007
Tatch, since I've been with you,
today, you look like a fool.

12
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,365
I went to bed quite late last night.

13
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:34,365
Yeah, forget it. No matter how foolish you look,
you still look so freakin' handsome.

14
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,850
Should we kick him into a poop pile?

15
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,694
I wanna know if you'd still look this handsome.

16
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:43,495
If I'm in a poop pile,
I'll drag you both in too.

17
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:47,995
But I'm certain that even if I dive into the pile,
I'd still look handsome.

18
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:51,132
Whatever, handsome.

19
00:02:56,778 --> 00:02:58,654
He's not here yet.

20
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,870
What?

21
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,630
You don't have to act all innocent.

22
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,630
I know that you were looking for Lom.

23
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,773
Tatch, take a look.

24
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,288
Your followers are 25K.

25
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,751
And Lom's are 66K.

26
00:03:17,751 --> 00:03:20,633
Darn, why is there a huge gap?

27
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,723
It's better this way.

28
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:25,360
We're wondering about one thing.

29
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,749
Yesterday, what did you talk to Lom in front of the class?

30
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:31,013
Oh.

31
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:32,776
Well...

32
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:34,494
I...

33
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:38,494
I asked Lom if he liked girls or guys...

34
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:40,888
Darn!

35
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,888
Well, so I'd know if I should stop
what I'm doing or continue.

36
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,383
I think he knows now how you feel about him.

37
00:03:48,383 --> 00:03:51,062
If he doesn't, then he's really stupid.

38
00:03:51,062 --> 00:03:53,618
But that may be the case, Lom is really stupid.

39
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,735
That's true.

40
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,735
Well, what you're saying is reasonable.

41
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,759
Look. There he is...

42
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,232
Lom!

43
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,232
My friend likes you.

44
00:04:15,174 --> 00:04:18,880
There's no signal from the number you've dialed...

45
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,346
So, I got turned down?

46
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:21,730
Who's turned down?

47
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,779
Look at him.

48
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,052
He's blushing and he doesn't know what to do now.

49
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:29,060
I think there's hope for you, buddy.

50
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,060
Really?

51
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,110
Alright, let's go.

52
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:43,543
So, so, so...

53
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,543
Got teased since early in the morning.

54
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,946
Calm down.

55
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:55,488
They were only teasing you a little bit.
Don't get so shocked.

56
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, what would you do if it were you?

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,432
What? I'd say no.

58
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:02,194
Huh?

59
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:05,955
Well, I only like handsome guys
because I look at them as idols.

60
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:07,046
That's it.

61
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:08,135
Understood?

62
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:10,515
So what are you gonna do?

63
00:05:10,515 --> 00:05:13,224
Are you gonna let Tatch hit on you?

64
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:18,009
I don't know. The problem now
is that he's my competitor.

65
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,323
Hmm, I think the real problem for you now is...

66
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,579
why the hell are you shy now?

67
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:26,164
Or you don't see him as your competitor?

68
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:28,338
You don't seem to reject him.

69
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:29,392
You're holding back.

70
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:32,448
Or maybe you hold back
because you want to take advantage of him.

71
00:05:32,448 --> 00:05:33,694
You let him give you rides.

72
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:35,750
And rip him off 20,000-30,000 Baht.

73
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,139
I don't know.

74
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:39,858
I'll just...

75
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:41,706
think about it first.

76
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:43,888
Only the pretty ones get to choose.
It's always like that.

77
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,111
Can you use the word "handsome"?
The handsome ones get to choose.

78
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:49,451
How can I use that word?
He's not handsome.

79
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,451
Well, that's true.

80
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:01,658
Sompoch, help Papa.

81
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:12,803
What? Take a look at other unis's Agriculture's Moon,
so darn hot!

82
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:14,867
Let me see the pics!

83
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,256
They're all your type, girlie.

84
00:06:16,256 --> 00:06:17,927
No, you're Girlie.

85
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:19,147
Well, they're fabulous.

86
00:06:19,147 --> 00:06:24,748
If other uni's Moons would be this hot, our uni
should send Tarntatch only for The Ambassador contest.

87
00:06:24,748 --> 00:06:25,835
I agree.

88
00:06:25,835 --> 00:06:27,709
We gotta send Tarntatch, no matter what.

89
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:30,272
If we send Lom, then we would...

90
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:32,403
What will happen if we send Lomnaw?

91
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:34,403
definitely lose!

92
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,050
When did you get here?
You popped here just like in a movie.

93
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:46,023
Why do you think if we send Lom and we will lose?

94
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:49,319
Because Lomnaw's style is kinda cute,

95
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,670
compared to the representatives from other unis.

96
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,392
Right?

97
00:06:52,984 --> 00:06:58,826
Yeah, I think the cute style won't work. If we send
the handsome and cool one would do us more good.

98
00:06:58,826 --> 00:06:59,826
Right, gal?

99
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:01,036
Yeah, gal.

100
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,263
Take a look at numbers of the followers on Instagram.

101
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:07,648
Oh.

102
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:09,164
Today, your make-up is so gorgeous.

103
00:07:09,164 --> 00:07:10,341
See? I told you.

104
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,341
Can you teach me how to do it?

105
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:21,294
Your friends are playing a game now.
Are you lost or something?

106
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:25,321
I'm not lost.

107
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:25,458
But I'm lost in...

108
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,222
Stop it!

109
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:29,818
Don't be so cheesy.

110
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:31,818
Why didn't you look that way
when you were studying?

111
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:40,868
It's my neck and my eyes.
Why do you have to be so bossy about it?

112
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:45,965
Because if you didn't look that way,
then I wouldn't be able to see your face.

113
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:48,936
You didn't look up at all.

114
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,660
Why are you staring at me?

115
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,169
The reason I'm staring at you is....

116
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:59,093
because...

117
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:02,195
I want you to see my face clearly.

118
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:04,404
Happy now?

119
00:08:04,404 --> 00:08:05,404
Mmm.

120
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,879
Now, I'm motivated to study.

121
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:18,726
Alright, guys, stop chatting.
Are you gonna study or what?

122
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:19,726
Let's start our lesson.

123
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:31,066
The scent of love is in the air.

124
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:33,409
Stop teasing me and start focusing on your studies.

125
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:35,232
Okay.

126
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,860
Yeah! The number of Tarntatch's followers are up!

127
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,240
What a relief.

128
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,017
But yours are way too far apart.

129
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:06,017
Do you think Tatch can catch up?

130
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:13,031
Of course.

131
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:17,531
Or if not, I have to do everything
in order for him to catch up.

132
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,759
He must be our faculty's representative.

133
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:23,732
Hey, Lom!

134
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:27,169
My friend sent me to tell you
that he missed you.

135
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:29,805
Yeah!

136
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,805
Yeah, my ass, jerks!

137
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,489
They teased you as if you were a high school girl.

138
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,489
Tarntatch seems to be obsessed with you.

139
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Tarntatchtachtach: I've photoshopped a photo.
Take a look.

140
00:09:51,444 --> 00:09:54,044
Whoa, he spent time doing this?

141
00:09:54,044 --> 00:09:55,589
I guess I'll post it.

142
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:58,105
I haven't updated my Instagram for a while now.

143
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:01,105
Chill, Lom, your Instagram? Not updated?

144
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:13,712
Lomnawwwww: The sun is bright but I'm cuter than the sun!
Photo credit: @eyes_wan and @Tarntatchtatchtatch

145
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,712
Whoa, you tagged him too?

146
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:19,989
That's so sweet!

147
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,093
Darn!

148
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:31,940
What?

149
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,940
Take a look at Tarntatch's Instagram.

150
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:43,000
Tarntatch: I'm allergic to the cute one.
Photo credit: @eyes_wan

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,174
They're flirting with their captions.

152
00:10:45,174 --> 00:10:48,174
Whoa, I guess I gotta press like unstoppingly.

153
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:56,901
Lomnawwww: Do you need an anti-histamine?

154
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,498
Wow, wow, wow.

155
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:02,049
Our friend here is pretty flirty too.

156
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:05,049
You're no ordinary...huh?

157
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:10,176
I'm not flirting. I'm just getting on his nerves.

158
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:12,573
He said he was allergic.

159
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:14,083
So he needed an anti-histamine.

160
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,145
Oh, really?

161
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:20,145
Tarntatchtatchtatch: Bring it to my room tonight.

162
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:24,814
That's it. I'm done playing.

163
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,369
Seriously, you won't be able to keep up with Tatch.

164
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,369
Mmm.

165
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:31,928
Oh, and where are you going?

166
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:35,269
I'm going to the Engineering's parking lot.

167
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,787
Why don't you take the bus?

168
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,310
No. I'll just walk there.

169
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,310
See you tomorrow, bye!

170
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,879
What's gotten into him?

171
00:11:46,953 --> 00:11:49,426
I think he's not being active;
he just doesn't know what to do.

172
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,426
He has no idea what to do.

173
00:11:53,931 --> 00:11:54,787
C'mon, let's go.

174
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:55,787
Right.

175
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:06,629
"Tarntatch is calling..."

176
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,098
Darn! It's Tatch calling.

177
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:12,285
Why is he calling?

178
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:16,685
Hello.

179
00:12:16,685 --> 00:12:18,185
Where are you?

180
00:12:18,185 --> 00:12:21,519
I'm at the uni. What's up?

181
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,105
And where are you?

182
00:12:23,105 --> 00:12:26,565
I'm in my room, about to change into sports clothes.

183
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:29,525
I think I'm gonna go play soccer.

184
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,913
Oh, okay.

185
00:12:31,913 --> 00:12:34,674
After I'm done, I'm coming back to change again.

186
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:38,674
Tomorrow, I got no class
so I think I'm gonna go hang out tonight.

187
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,769
So?

188
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,152
So, what?

189
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:48,509
Am I allowed?

190
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:51,396
If you wanna go, then go.
Why are you asking me this?

191
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:54,242
I have to.
If I don't have your permission, I won't go.

192
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:55,249
Then you can go.

193
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:59,249
I must do everything that you're okay with,
so you'll like me.

194
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,965
Do whatever you want.

195
00:13:00,965 --> 00:13:02,231
You don't have to ask me.

196
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:03,860
I have to.

197
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,711
You can go anywhere you want.
Why are you asking me?

198
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,147
Are you sure?

199
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,257
You won't get all dramatic after that, right?

200
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:14,969
Are you my boyfriend?

201
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:15,814
If you wanna go somewhere, just go.

202
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:17,572
You don't need to ask me.

203
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:20,572
Well, it's because I want to be your boyfriend,
that's why I have to ask.

204
00:13:23,413 --> 00:13:27,413
So you'll know that
I behave well and listen to you.

205
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,094
So you'll easily give in.

206
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:32,561
So, cutie...do you give in now?

207
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,699
Cutie, my ass!

208
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:35,751
I guess not.

209
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:38,258
Cutie, my ass!
Can you hear me?

210
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:41,802
From now on, if you got something on your mind,
you can call me.

211
00:13:41,802 --> 00:13:43,970
I have no businesses to call you.

212
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,970
Well, if you got no one
to pick you up or drop you off,

213
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,153
no friends to have a meal with,...

214
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,866
no one to accompany you,

215
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:55,000
you can always call me.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,630
And if you miss me, you must call me.

217
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,881
Really? Who would have such a thought?

218
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,191
Alright, alright, I give up now.

219
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:06,191
That's all, bye.

220
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:08,716
What?

221
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,385
So he hung up just like that?

222
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:21,988
Or did he really give up earlier?

223
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,570
Hello.

224
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,500
What's up?

225
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,650
Nothing.

226
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:41,835
So you called me but you got nothing to say?

227
00:14:41,835 --> 00:14:44,625
Well, can I not?

228
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,257
I haven't said anything.

229
00:14:47,257 --> 00:14:48,509
Then, that'd be all.

230
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:49,290
Lom.

231
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,135
Huh? Yeah?

232
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:55,135
"I miss you," isn't so hard to say.

233
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,688
Are you crazy?
We just met during the day.

234
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,967
You're a chicken.

235
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,355
Just an "I miss you".

236
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,655
Alright, alright.

237
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:12,655
Well, if you were here in front of me right now,
I would tell you face to face.

238
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,214
Right, you said it yourself.

239
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,270
Let's hear it.

240
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:30,513
Er...I give up.

241
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,513
I'm a chicken.

242
00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:42,460
Why are you following me?

243
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,268
You don't have to follow me.

244
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:45,942
I'm sending you off to your car.

245
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:49,033
I know where my car is.

246
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,052
Where are you going?

247
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:52,253
Your car is right here.

248
00:15:57,052 --> 00:15:58,052
Get in the car first.

249
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:08,198
If you don't leave now, I'll think of it as if
you wanna spend more time with me.

250
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:20,509
Tatch.

251
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:22,737
Yes?

252
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:28,507
Tonight, if you're gonna go out for a drink,

253
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:30,507
don't look at other people.

254
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,813
Whoa, why do you go to such a classy place?

255
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:59,258
Look, man. That's the 5th one.

256
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:01,258
He's darn hot.

257
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:05,771
Why is he so hot?

258
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,768
Tarntatch: Are you not asleep yet?

259
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:39,005
Lomnaw: This is an auto-message.

260
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:42,191
Lomnaw: Hottie...

261
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,369
Tarntatch: Who's a hottie?

262
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:48,234
Tarntatch: I have no interest in anyone else but you.

263
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:51,234
Tarntatch: Did you just trick me to speak the truth?

264
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:56,938
Lomnaw: You're silly.

265
00:18:00,689 --> 00:18:04,907
Tarntatch: If you like it,
I can keep telling you this.

266
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:07,880
Tarntatch: The reason my friend said that
because there were five people asking for my number.

267
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,347
Lomnaw: Right, handsome guy.

268
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:12,437
Tarntatch: I didn't give it to anyone.

269
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:14,837
Tarntatch: So my friends were teasing me about it.

270
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:25,384
Tatch, when you're done, follow us.

271
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:26,223
Mmm.

272
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:27,423
Let's go.

273
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,847
Hello.

274
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,533
Are you alright?

275
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:40,218
You read the text but you didn't reply.

276
00:18:40,218 --> 00:18:42,859
Yeah, I'm fine.

277
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,916
Are you thinking about something too much?

278
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,799
No, I'm not thinking about anything too much.

279
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,812
Are you sure?

280
00:18:47,812 --> 00:18:48,812
Mmm.

281
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:53,036
If you're upset, I can go to your place right now.

282
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:55,036
Hey, are you crazy?

283
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:02,741
About other people asking for my number,
I don't think you should think about it too much.

284
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,377
Because I'd turned them down completely.

285
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,377
You should be proud that the one
who likes you are very much wanted.

286
00:19:15,258 --> 00:19:17,259
What should I feel now?

287
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,895
You're complimenting yourself for me to listen...

288
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:22,895
You just focus on the part that I like you.

289
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:28,579
Hello?

290
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:30,083
Did I make you stunned?

291
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,292
Give me some time to be shy a little bit.

292
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:34,292
Oh?

293
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,483
I wanna see that.

294
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:40,483
There's no way.

295
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:45,074
Tatch.

296
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:48,718
How come we both have become like this?

297
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:49,776
I've...

298
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:53,776
liked you since you were drinking at Am's.

299
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
On the day that you lost in the Moon contest.

300
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:12,776
I've gotten some more beer.

301
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,409
Did you drink that night?

302
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:26,340
I was there after you'd already been drunk.

303
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,394
You took that advantage to like me.

304
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:33,394
Well, if I approach you directly,
you wouldn't like me.

305
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:39,092
Because at that time,
I was running away from what I was supposed to get.

306
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,910
And I let you get into the contest instead.

307
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,717
Anyhow, I still think
that you're more suitable than I am.

308
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:50,728
Don't underestimate yourself.

309
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:51,728
Mmm.

310
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:56,747
And if I didn't get on your nerves,
then you wouldn't talk to me.

311
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:59,747
If I didn't scold you,
you wouldn't scold me back.

312
00:21:01,215 --> 00:21:03,094
I was so afraid you weren't even gonna look at me.

313
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:05,094
So I had to do it my way.

314
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:11,153
And one more thing, you liked Manfah.

315
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,206
Manfah.

316
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:24,122
Although I placed second from the bottom,
but my love from you is at the top, Manfah.

317
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:25,475
No!

318
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:30,813
Not since I met you.

319
00:21:33,903 --> 00:21:36,903
It's just like I've been more interested
in you than any other people.

320
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,637
Really?

321
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:40,637
Mmm.

322
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:44,448
Because I'm handsome?

323
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:47,296
Whatever, hottie.

324
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:49,433
So are you still thinking about that?

325
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,201
Not anymore.

326
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:55,201
If I didn't call you,
there would be a drama, wouldn't it?

327
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,651
I don't think so.

328
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,286
Don't think about it too much.

329
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,411
About this kind of stuff,
I always have my guard up.

330
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:06,755
I've faced it all my life.

331
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:10,712
Hey, Tatch, what are you doing?

332
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:13,351
The senior asked me to come get you to drink.

333
00:22:13,351 --> 00:22:15,117
Huh? What senior?

334
00:22:15,117 --> 00:22:17,254
What? Our seniors.

335
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,387
Right, they just got here.

336
00:22:19,387 --> 00:22:22,145
And...whom...are you talking to?

337
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:23,699
Oh, a person I'm seeing.

338
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:25,341
Hey!

339
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:27,267
You're quite something.

340
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:28,147
Who is it?

341
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,088
Is it the one I'm thinking about?

342
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:33,801
Am, just leave him alone.

343
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:37,059
Let's go. You should hang up soon
and come drink with us.

344
00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:40,059
Alright, I'll be right there.

345
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:46,625
Then, I'll go drink now.

346
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:47,625
Mmm.

347
00:22:48,094 --> 00:22:51,312
So if the seniors are there,
this could last till dawn, right?

348
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:55,282
I don't think so.
I'm afraid that you'll be worried.

349
00:22:55,282 --> 00:22:58,548
Mmm, text me when you're back, alright?

350
00:22:58,548 --> 00:22:59,548
Mmm.

351
00:23:00,932 --> 00:23:02,932
Gotta go now. Bye.

352
00:23:03,735 --> 00:23:04,735
Bye.

353
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:44,846
"Gotta go now."

354
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:21,604
"Louknam is calling..."

355
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:29,985
Hello.

356
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:31,239
Hello, Lom!

357
00:24:31,239 --> 00:24:33,627
I don't think he's gonna make it.

358
00:24:33,627 --> 00:24:35,661
Just only two days left, Lom.

359
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:38,628
Tarntatch still needs 35k followers
in order to beat you.

360
00:24:38,628 --> 00:24:40,628
Huh? 35k?

361
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:47,844
How about this? I got an idea.

362
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:51,203
Well, it might be a little dumb.

363
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:55,703
But I'll go ask for the pic of Tarntatch
from Glasses and post it on my Instagram.

364
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:10,609
Are you here for the pics?

365
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,992
Glasses is not here so I already took it.

366
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:17,083
Huh? Why would you come here and take my pics?

367
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,083
So I could do a photoshop for you.

368
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,742
I came here to take his pics.

369
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:28,257
But he came here to take my pics.

370
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:31,933
Darn! Why is it so weird?

371
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,026
Are you talking to yourself?

372
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:35,026
Huh? No, no, no.

373
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
But you seem like you're fighting with yourself.

374
00:25:42,287 --> 00:25:45,287
Nevermind. Have you called Glasses?

375
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,799
What?

376
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:57,434
He cut me off.

377
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:05,518
"I'm at my idols' concert. Not available
to answer the call from a maggot like you."

378
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,252
He's at the concert.

379
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:11,552
Mmm...then, would you like to go grab some coffee?

380
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,440
Are you inviting me?

381
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Yes, I'm asking you out on a date.

382
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:30,919
I think your number of followers seems to be stable.

383
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,435
Don't you want to do anything with it?

384
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:35,783
It's fine with whatever it may be.

385
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:41,783
But you were the one who told me
to post lots of pics and stories often.

386
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,670
Can you send me a pic?

387
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,670
Why?

388
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:51,767
Well, people seem to like it when you're with me.

389
00:26:51,994 --> 00:26:54,377
So I think I'm gonna post your pic.

390
00:26:54,377 --> 00:26:57,377
This way, I'm also helping you get more followers.

391
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:04,391
Then, I'll go live.

392
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:05,105
Hey, really?

393
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,105
On one condition.

394
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:09,956
What's that?

395
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:16,637
After the live, you have to video call me.

396
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:17,637
For what?

397
00:27:18,651 --> 00:27:20,651
I want to see your face before going to bed.

398
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:25,493
Alright.

399
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,678
But I haven't got my pics from Glasses.

400
00:27:29,678 --> 00:27:32,678
Then, give me your phone.
I'll take a selfie.

401
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:56,666
Lomnawwwww: Occupied.

402
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,188
All done.

403
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,334
Hey!

404
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,017
You posted it yourself?

405
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:04,017
Well, it's my pic.

406
00:28:30,006 --> 00:28:35,221
"Am: Bonehead, Tatch, did you occupy
the space or Lom's Instagram?"

407
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:41,221
"Tarntatchtatchtatch: Whatever,
but I've occupied everything here."

408
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,779
I got quite a lot of followers.

409
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,900
"Tarntatch is calling..."

410
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:18,907
You're so quick. Aren't you gonna go to
the restroom or drink something first?

411
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:21,342
You're already sleepy?

412
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,522
Well, a little bit.

413
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:26,522
Mmm, then I'm not gonna bother you.
I'll let you go to bed.

414
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:35,369
Er...then I'm off to bed.

415
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:39,095
Okay, sweet dreams, Lom.

416
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:41,095
Sweet dreams, Tatch.

417
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,319
Oh, right, tomorrow, we got a morning class.

418
00:29:48,068 --> 00:29:50,292
The teacher just texted us in the chat group.

419
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:51,638
When?

420
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:54,108
When you went live.

421
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:58,035
Mmm, and are you going anywhere in the afternoon?

422
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,623
I don't know. What do you suggest?

423
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:03,842
I'll be waiting for someone to post a story, I guess.

424
00:30:03,842 --> 00:30:09,649
Chome? Lerdluck? Karat? Kalaya? Or...

425
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:11,336
Sompoch, of course.

426
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:12,336
You!

427
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:14,052
Tatch!

428
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:15,815
Does it freeze?

429
00:30:16,947 --> 00:30:18,947
Darn!

430
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:23,435
What's wrong with you, Lom?

431
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:25,561
Just a frozen screen, and you're shocked?

432
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:28,075
Bonehead Tatch, are you getting on my nerves?

433
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:30,950
Well, you did that first.

434
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,950
But when I get on your nerves, you seem cute.

435
00:30:35,504 --> 00:30:38,936
Are we gonna get some sleep, you and I?

436
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:41,436
So why don't we skip the sleep
and keep video calling all night?

437
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:45,529
Go to bed already, I'm gonna do that too.

438
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,914
I'm melting.

439
00:30:51,547 --> 00:30:53,547
Alright, sweet dreams, Lom.

440
00:30:53,846 --> 00:30:55,846
Mmm, sweet dreams, Tatch.

441
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:59,073
Bye.

442
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:04,959
My gosh, how can he be this cute?

443
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:20,932
"Panon: Why don't we meet up?"

444
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:24,480
"Panon: It's been a while."

445
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,480
"Panon: Don't turn me down this time."

446
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:00,737
Here, I got the movie tickets.

447
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:05,631
Why do you look so stressed?

448
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:08,349
Well, I've got something on my mind.

449
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:09,929
About the Ambassador contest?

450
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,938
Hey, how do you know that?

451
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:14,438
Oh, well, I'm also a representative.

452
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:17,043
Let's go shopping.

453
00:32:17,043 --> 00:32:18,802
Before the movie starts.

454
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:19,802
Hold these for me.

455
00:32:26,186 --> 00:32:30,482
I'm happy that I'll get to do
this kind of activity with you.

456
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,826
It must be pretty fun.

457
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,746
I may not be the representative.

458
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:37,498
Because the one who's gonna be is Tatch.

459
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:40,716
He's way more handsome than me.

460
00:32:40,716 --> 00:32:43,638
So you're really close to him, aren't you?

461
00:32:43,638 --> 00:32:46,112
Well, yeah.

462
00:32:46,112 --> 00:32:48,373
I don't want you and him to be close.

463
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:50,831
Why not?

464
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:52,967
He stole my brother's girlfriend.

465
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,185
Hey! Are you serious?

466
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:58,907
Yeah. Manfah studies at the same uni as you.

467
00:32:58,907 --> 00:33:02,907
She's a uni's Star too.

468
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:09,379
I liked Tatch
even though I already had a boyfriend.

469
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:14,061
So I broke up with Parak
to begin a relationship with Tatch.

470
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:18,421
Is your brother Parak?

471
00:33:18,421 --> 00:33:22,218
Yes, Parak.

472
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:26,218
The one who steals other people's girlfriend
wouldn't be a good person, would it?

473
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,732
"Tarntatchtatchtatch: Where are you?"

474
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:47,732
"Tarntatchtatchtatch: You haven't posted a story yet."

475
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:52,387
Here, this is yours.

476
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:54,313
Huh? Wait, you bought these for me?

477
00:33:54,313 --> 00:33:56,859
Well, they got your size, not mine.

478
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:58,326
Oh? And why would you buy them?

479
00:33:58,326 --> 00:34:00,326
C'mon, just take them.

480
00:34:03,165 --> 00:34:06,165
I saw you posted a story
saying that you wanted these.

481
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:16,392
"Lomnawwwww: Wait for me, my babies."

482
00:34:16,392 --> 00:34:19,392
Wait, you took a screenshot of my story?

483
00:34:20,649 --> 00:34:24,414
I saw them and I wanted them too.

484
00:34:24,414 --> 00:34:26,965
Actually, I can buy these myself, you know.

485
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:32,066
It's alright. Take them as
your birthday present in advance.

486
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:35,066
That's like eight more months before my birthday.

487
00:34:35,066 --> 00:34:38,077
It's okay. I wanted to buy them for you.

488
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:42,780
Why are you being so nice to me?

489
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,780
I'll pay you back when I have the chance.

490
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:53,467
Alright, if you want to pay me back,
you just have to beat Tatch.

491
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,967
And join The Ambassador contest with me.

492
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,816
Thanks for buying me the shoes today.

493
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:12,442
It's alright, man.

494
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:13,528
Mmm.

495
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,958
Okay, I'll see you later.

496
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:16,170
See ya. Bye.

497
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,170
Bye.

498
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,899
Lomnawwwww: Sorry, I was at the movie.

499
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:35,739
Tarntatchtatchtatch: Was it fun?

500
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:37,507
Lomnawwwww: Yeah.

501
00:35:37,507 --> 00:35:42,809
Tarntatchtatchtatch: You went there alone?

502
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:46,110
Lomnawwwww: With a friend.

503
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,660
Tarntatchtatchtatch: Which one?

504
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,660
Lomnawwwww: Panon.

505
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Lomnawwwww: Actually, I have something to ask you.

506
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:32,645
"Pha: Let's play soccer.
Happy Buffalo Field. 7:30 p.m."

507
00:36:32,645 --> 00:36:33,572
"Pha: You must come."

508
00:36:33,572 --> 00:36:35,217
"Lomnawwwww: I can't..."

509
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:37,440
"Pha: There's not enough people.
Bring your friends too."

510
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,440
"Lomnawwwww: Okay."

511
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:10,125
Hello, guys.

512
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:11,590
Hey.

513
00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:15,185
Oh? Why are there so few of you?

514
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:19,185
Someone's boyfriend went to a camp again.
That's why we don't have enough people.

515
00:37:22,152 --> 00:37:23,823
It's like you're mentioning me and Beam.

516
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:25,576
Well, yeah.

517
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,751
Well, there will be more people coming.

518
00:37:27,751 --> 00:37:29,599
Let's join them, I guess.

519
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,069
And...isn't Wayo here too?

520
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:33,533
Yo's reading comics at the dorm.

521
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:36,332
Oh, right, I told you to bring some friends.
Did you invite them?

522
00:37:36,332 --> 00:37:39,551
Oh, I already texted them.
They're on their way.

523
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:43,551
Alright, good. Then, should we go jogging for a warm up?

524
00:37:44,647 --> 00:37:47,815
That's good so we won't get muscle cramps.

525
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:50,822
What's muscle camp-camp?

526
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:52,870
Well, cramps.

527
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,001
Oh, that's how doctors say it.

528
00:37:56,001 --> 00:37:58,001
Yeah, let's go.

529
00:37:59,049 --> 00:38:01,049
C'mon, follow us.

530
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,308
Pha, Pha.

531
00:38:05,308 --> 00:38:07,949
What's up?

532
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:11,380
Right, did you invite the silverware guy?

533
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,888
You mean Tatch?

534
00:38:12,888 --> 00:38:16,111
If he's the one who wears
lots of silver accessories, then yeah.

535
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:19,862
Well, I invited my friends
but I don't know if he'll come too or not.

536
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:20,862
Mmm.

537
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:26,606
Right, are you fighting?

538
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:33,015
He ditched you?

539
00:38:33,015 --> 00:38:34,317
No.

540
00:38:34,317 --> 00:38:35,661
So you ditched him?

541
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:36,715
No.

542
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,715
What? Then what happened?

543
00:38:41,311 --> 00:38:44,311
Well, I don't really have guts to talk to him.

544
00:38:46,918 --> 00:38:50,631
But in order to fix it,
you need to talk, don't you?

545
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:53,943
I don't know.

546
00:38:53,943 --> 00:38:55,831
Do you want me to help clear things up?

547
00:38:55,831 --> 00:38:58,379
Are you nuts?

548
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,669
If you can't do it, then I have to help you.

549
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:02,669
I'm like your brother.

550
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:38,017
Hey, are those your friends, Lom?

551
00:39:38,017 --> 00:39:40,109
They're finally here.

552
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:42,109
Hello.

553
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,874
You remember when Yo and I had a big problem, right?

554
00:40:00,874 --> 00:40:03,006
The one that you haven't told me yet?

555
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,434
Well, I'll tell you now.

556
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:05,271
Let's go.

557
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:07,526
Hey, hey, hey.

558
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:10,209
I'm here to see Yo.

559
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:11,840
Yo, Yo!

560
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,970
Hey!

561
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,072
Yo!

562
00:40:14,072 --> 00:40:14,746
Hey!

563
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,335
Let me go!

564
00:40:16,335 --> 00:40:17,835
What are you guys doing?
