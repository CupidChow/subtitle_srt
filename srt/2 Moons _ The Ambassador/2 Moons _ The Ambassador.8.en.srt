1
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,541
What are you guys fighting about?

2
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,262
Why don't we know about it?

3
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:00,689
Yesterday when we went to play soccer with Pha,

4
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:01,825
well, you guys were there.

5
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,342
And Pha said that Tatch wasn't the right one?

6
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:07,599
Yesterday, I went to see Panon.

7
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,599
If you don't do it now, there won't be
other conversations with Tatch again.

8
00:02:14,195 --> 00:02:17,666
Whom do you believe?
Between me and Panon?

9
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,219
I definitely believe you.

10
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,900
Thank you.

11
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,491
Yeah, and about The Ambassador, what will you say?

12
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,393
Well, you, be the representative.

13
00:02:25,393 --> 00:02:28,072
I placed the second from the bottom
when I was at the uni's Moon contest.

14
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:31,824
You know right?
Being in the contest doesn't prove anyone's worth...

15
00:02:31,824 --> 00:02:35,824
I know that but you have to be there instead of me.

16
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:41,394
Think about what you wanna eat
after we finish from the clinic.

17
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,864
I will go on a date with you.

18
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,366
Have you asked me if I'm free?

19
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:46,960
I didn't ask...

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,550
Darn you!

21
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,645
Hey, I told you to calm down.

22
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:50,402
Darn!

23
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:51,114
What the hell is wrong with you?

24
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:52,209
Why did you hurt my boyfriend?

25
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,428
Hey, calm down now.

26
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:55,156
Darn it.

27
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:56,156
Fourth, calm!

28
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:01,573
No one could stop him but Beam.

29
00:03:03,288 --> 00:03:05,043
What happened?

30
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:07,690
What did you do to my bro?

31
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,736
Hey, it's nothing.

32
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:10,332
I'll clear it myself.

33
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:11,332
Alright.

34
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:20,356
Fourth, it's not worth it.

35
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:22,698
Did you stir the fight
between Agriculture and Engineering?

36
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:23,995
To hell with it.

37
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,995
I don't care what it takes.

38
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:29,126
Calm down now.

39
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,126
Think carefully.

40
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:34,233
Yo, let him go.

41
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,233
Let me handle this.

42
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,410
Take him with us.

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
C'mon, let's go.

44
00:03:50,918 --> 00:03:54,918
That's Beam's boyfriend.
Beam was the one you kicked yesterday.

45
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:58,601
Go clear things up with him.

46
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,792
Well, go ahead.

47
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:15,070
So did you hurt my boyfriend on purpose?

48
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,121
I didn't mean to hurt your boyfriend.

49
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:19,211
I was trying to kick the ball.

50
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:22,554
I was gonna ask if he's doing alright.

51
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,779
See? Ming, I told you he hurt my boyfriend on purpose,

52
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,544
to get closer to him.

53
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:30,813
Whoa, Fourth.

54
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,118
That's enough.

55
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,787
You're getting too far.

56
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:36,344
This guy here is seeing my cousin.

57
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:38,621
Huh?

58
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,749
Really?

59
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:42,087
Er...yes.

60
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:45,093
Oh, and why haven't you told me about this?

61
00:04:45,613 --> 00:04:47,613
Were you there when I tried to tell you?

62
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:54,601
Ming called me so I rushed here.

63
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:56,065
Are you guys done here?

64
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:57,904
Yeah, we're done.

65
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:59,904
Fourth was too reckless.

66
00:05:05,877 --> 00:05:08,877
And you, hurry up and apologize to Beam.

67
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:15,644
And most importantly, leave my cousin alone.

68
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:18,030
What does that have to do with it?

69
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,371
Didn't he make you overthink?

70
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:21,749
I'm done with that.

71
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:24,554
We've cleared things up.

72
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:25,852
That's quick.

73
00:05:25,852 --> 00:05:27,770
You, come here now.

74
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,740
Then, if everything's done here, excuse us.

75
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,959
Leave them alone.

76
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,459
Er...then let's separate.

77
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:36,597
Hold on.

78
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:39,117
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:42,402
For being the cause of this choas.

80
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,402
Can I buy you all some drinks?

81
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:48,259
We're heavy drinkers.

82
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:50,806
Can you handle that?

83
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:54,025
It's alright. I'm rich.

84
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,316
That's good.

85
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:57,417
Then, I'll call my boyfriend up.

86
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:58,889
What time will we meet?

87
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,566
What time are you available?

88
00:06:01,566 --> 00:06:05,206
9 p.m. till midnight.

89
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:07,640
Tomorrow, I have a morning shift.

90
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,246
If it's not convenient to you all,
maybe we can do this later.

91
00:06:10,246 --> 00:06:12,246
Who says it's inconvenient?

92
00:06:13,866 --> 00:06:15,705
Beam will be there too.

93
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:18,464
You must not lay eyes on him.

94
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,714
C'mon, I like Lom.

95
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,680
If I'm not serious with him,
why would I buy you drinks?

96
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,651
Oh...

97
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,651
So you buy us drinks
because you have a hidden agenda.

98
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:30,831
We'll be watching you.

99
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:34,551
You're so protective of your cousin.

100
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:40,036
I'm not, well, not that,
I'm just afraid he'll be stressed.

101
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:42,833
When he's stressed out, he gets paranoid too.

102
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,214
And when he gets paranoid,
Auntie Prow will scold me.

103
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:47,214
Right.

104
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:51,892
Then, I'll go pick Beam up.

105
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:54,146
Okay, see you tonight, guys.

106
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:55,146
Then, I'm off.

107
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,442
I guess we're not going to the clinic after all.

108
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:09,252
Well, you were the one who started all of this.

109
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:10,808
What can I do?

110
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:13,157
If I can't prove myself to them
that I'm good enough,

111
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:16,157
I won't have you as my boyfriend.

112
00:07:22,015 --> 00:07:25,815
Hey, cheers!

113
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:26,910
Pha, bottom up!

114
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,494
Hey, chill.

115
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:29,494
Well, well...

116
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:33,249
Hey.

117
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,510
Should we order a lot more?

118
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,053
How much is a lot?

119
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,611
Let's wait for that silverware to come here first.

120
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:45,662
Let's see...that he said he was rich...

121
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:47,217
Is he as rich as my boyfriend?

122
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,311
Yeah, let's see.

123
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:49,311
We could drink our asses off.

124
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:57,612
Darn.

125
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,158
Yo!

126
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,371
How could you look at another guy in front of me?

127
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:21,848
What, Pha?

128
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:24,936
The light was too bright for my eyes.

129
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:26,776
Lom, you got good eyes.

130
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:27,776
Yo.

131
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:29,589
I'm sitting right here.

132
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:32,477
Hello.

133
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:35,742
Hello.

134
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:38,711
Hey, you!

135
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:43,591
Scoot away from my cousin, host.

136
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:44,591
Alright.

137
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:52,044
Are you all dressed up to intimidate us?

138
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:55,560
Wait, look at what I'm wearing now.

139
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,560
What? This is how I normally dress.

140
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,417
Am I wearing too much?

141
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:07,417
It's not like when you dress to drink around uni.

142
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:09,727
Hey.

143
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:13,113
That's too close.

144
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:20,014
Ah!

145
00:09:20,744 --> 00:09:21,744
Here comes our host.

146
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,379
You guys, order all you want.

147
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:26,535
Excuse me.

148
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:27,934
Excuse me.

149
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:29,813
What's on the menu?

150
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:33,046
Do they have french fries?

151
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:34,022
Yeah.

152
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:37,283
Make it three.

153
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:37,866
That's enough for me.

154
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:38,582
Alright, got it.

155
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:40,836
I'll have two of the truffles.

156
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:42,683
You want fish?

157
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:45,431
Yeah, let's have it.

158
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:46,025
Fried rice, too.

159
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:47,160
Pha!

160
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,019
Make it three big dishes.

161
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,019
Pha! That's enough. I feel sorry for him.

162
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:07,393
Bottoms up!

163
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:29,982
Thank you, host.

164
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:31,568
Thank you.

165
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:32,741
Thank you.

166
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:40,125
Hey, bottoms up?

167
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,293
Are you alright?

168
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:43,293
Of course.

169
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
Just order what you wanna eat.

170
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:48,444
Certainly, let's do bottoms up!

171
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:52,444
Bottoms up! Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

172
00:10:58,453 --> 00:10:59,453
Hey, did you cheat?

173
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,629
Hey!

174
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,843
Why don't you leave them alone?

175
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Bottoms up.

176
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:18,338
Ming, so what are we gonna do?
We don't have enough people for the camp.

177
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,434
The uni won't approve.

178
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:21,434
I guess.

179
00:12:34,043 --> 00:12:35,043
What?

180
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,734
Let's go.

181
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:37,734
I know what to do.

182
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:38,865
What's with you?

183
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,323
Follow me.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,520
Hello, ladies.

185
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,272
May I interrupt your fun for a moment?

186
00:12:49,272 --> 00:12:51,665
We happen to need a favor.

187
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:54,270
Are you all freshmen here?

188
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,870
Yes, we are.

189
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,627
Have you joined any clubs yet?

190
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:58,799
Not yet.

191
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,597
Ah! This is such a great opportunity.

192
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:03,148
My club is looking for more members.

193
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:07,765
I guarantee you there will be exciting,
thrilling, and fun things to do.

194
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:11,275
It's not as boring as other clubs, definitely.

195
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:13,167
How exciting could it be?

196
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,306
Ah! If you wanna know, you gotta join first.

197
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:19,399
And most importantly,
my club goes camping too.

198
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,321
Connnecting with the society,
having good friendship...

199
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:25,369
and yes, we do have more fun activities.

200
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:29,254
So are you interested?

201
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,306
Yes, we are.

202
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:31,318
That's great.

203
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:34,318
Then, please add this Line ID
and I'll invite you to the club group.

204
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,340
That's the way it's gotta be.

205
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,340
Use your beauty to do something useful.

206
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:50,146
Thank you.

207
00:13:50,777 --> 00:13:55,584
And if there's an urgent question,
how can we contact you?

208
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,468
Except from Line.

209
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,862
Like...

210
00:13:58,862 --> 00:13:59,862
talking on the phone?

211
00:14:07,356 --> 00:14:09,356
Ming, you're screwed.

212
00:14:20,077 --> 00:14:22,077
Ming, you're so screwed.

213
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,996
Hey, Kit, chill, you've drunk too much.

214
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,418
You have a morning shift tomorrow.

215
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:46,460
Mmm, girls, or should we choose another club tomorrow?

216
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,220
Er, wait up.

217
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,694
Hold on a sec.

218
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:51,384
Go ahead and give her the number.

219
00:14:51,384 --> 00:14:52,721
Really?

220
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:53,721
Just give it first.

221
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,067
C'mon.

222
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,649
Alright, it's 081...

223
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:12,100
658...

224
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
1678...

225
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:16,388
Kit.

226
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:19,158
Ming, you go ahead and follow him.

227
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,060
I'll handle this.

228
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
Please take care of it.

229
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,409
Er, thank you so much, please, excuse me.

230
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:32,899
Kit.

231
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,399
Kit.

232
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:36,442
Let go of me.

233
00:15:36,442 --> 00:15:37,443
Please listen to me first.

234
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:39,291
I will not.

235
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:42,291
Let go of me, go back there
and let those girls hit on you.

236
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm sorry.

237
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:47,851
But I really gotta do it this time.

238
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,236
I have to find more members, no matter what.

239
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:55,247
And did you have to give them your number and your Line ID?

240
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:59,247
Are you gonna talk behind my back
and then continue at the camp discreetly?

241
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:04,648
Is that the reason you go camping often
and got no time for me?

242
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,485
Have you been doing this all along?

243
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:08,912
Kit, listen to me.

244
00:16:08,912 --> 00:16:10,542
It's not like that at all.

245
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:13,645
If I want to do something behind your back, why would I
give them my Line ID and my number in front of you?

246
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:15,492
More importantly, that's not my number.

247
00:16:15,492 --> 00:16:17,215
But it's the club secretary's number.

248
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:18,215
Huh?

249
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,817
I know that I have a boyfriend.

250
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,817
How can I give my own number to random people?

251
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,880
But...

252
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,559
but you gotta see them at the camp anyway.

253
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,153
I don't even know what you guys will be doing.

254
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:36,789
And who says I'm gonna go?

255
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:37,789
Huh?

256
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:42,141
The reason Fourth and I are doing this
is because...

257
00:16:42,141 --> 00:16:44,814
we have decided not to go anymore.

258
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:46,814
That's why we need to find more members.

259
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:51,115
And why aren't you going anymore?
Aren't you gonna get scolded?

260
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,292
That's because I miss you.

261
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:00,981
I know I haven't been giving you the time lately.

262
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:02,981
That's why you're being sad like this.

263
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:11,258
Kit, you can relax.

264
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:13,770
I've never thought about cheating on you.

265
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,770
Nor making you sad.

266
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,522
Just don't.

267
00:17:21,522 --> 00:17:25,522
You have no idea how much I miss you
each time you go to the camp.

268
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:29,835
When I'm done studying with Pha,
I come back to my room and I don't see you.

269
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:33,835
You don't know how much it tortures me.

270
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,691
I'm sorry.

271
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:44,211
From now on, I'll have the time for you.

272
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:46,468
And I'll never leave you alone anymore.

273
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:47,468
Okay?

274
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:04,196
Do you love me?

275
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,785
Yes, I do.

276
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,285
I only love you, Kit.

277
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:11,090
Wayo.

278
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,090
Hand me that, will you?

279
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,350
What?

280
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,809
So, Kit?

281
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,694
How did you guys make up?

282
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:26,694
How could you both come back with such red lips?

283
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:33,862
Right, Ming, won't the girls
come mess with you at the club?

284
00:19:35,246 --> 00:19:36,246
I don't think so.

285
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:46,511
Cheers.

286
00:19:49,226 --> 00:19:50,226
Are you stunned?

287
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:58,909
Yeah, I know that this couple is sweet.

288
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,909
But I didn't know that they're gonna be this sweet.

289
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,750
Do you think I'm okay enough for them?

290
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,055
What do you mean?

291
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:16,055
I mean, do they still think I hurt Beam on purpose?

292
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:20,438
Don't be stressed out.

293
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,714
What if they don't give you a pass and then what?

294
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:30,389
I don't care.

295
00:20:30,389 --> 00:20:32,479
Really?

296
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:35,364
I'm happy.

297
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,364
Right, just that you didn't steal anyone's girlfriend,
that's good enough.

298
00:20:41,721 --> 00:20:45,721
Hey, who steals whose girlfriend?

299
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:50,780
Lom misunderstood me.

300
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,458
I used to have an infamous rumor.

301
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:58,297
But mostly, rumor has truth in it too.

302
00:20:58,297 --> 00:21:01,932
Hey, with my look,
why should I steal others' girlfriends?

303
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,939
Mmm, that's true.

304
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:06,892
Yo!

305
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:09,949
What?

306
00:21:09,949 --> 00:21:11,168
Why?

307
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:13,435
What's with your look?

308
00:21:13,435 --> 00:21:16,325
I'm good-looking alright.

309
00:21:16,325 --> 00:21:18,667
Or don't you think so?

310
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,722
I think you're a so-so.

311
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:25,312
Lom isn't really confident about himself.

312
00:21:25,312 --> 00:21:28,534
So he gets picked on easily.

313
00:21:28,534 --> 00:21:31,967
He's pliable, easily influenced.

314
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:35,223
So I want him to be with a good partner.

315
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:37,240
The one that I can trust.

316
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,240
Hey, not that,
so Auntie Prow would stop scolding me.

317
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,667
So he still doesn't admit that
he's being protective of his cousin.

318
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,724
I think I'm good enough.

319
00:21:58,573 --> 00:22:03,573
If you make my cousin sad,
I know where to find you.

320
00:22:14,503 --> 00:22:18,240
It's midnight, guys. Let's head back.

321
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,578
Alright, let's go.

322
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:25,517
C'mon, Yo.

323
00:22:25,517 --> 00:22:27,109
Ming!

324
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,109
It's such a waste.

325
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:04,465
Hey, Lom.

326
00:23:04,465 --> 00:23:05,485
You're very drunk.

327
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,485
Calm down now.

328
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:16,416
How long are you gonna hold me?

329
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,188
You're not okay with this?

330
00:23:22,478 --> 00:23:23,478
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:38,528
I don't wanna take advantage of the drunk.

332
00:23:38,528 --> 00:23:42,250
From all this, Pha's keeping an eye on me already.

333
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,250
I don't want Pha to see me as a troublemaker.

334
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,798
Pha won't know.

335
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:51,798
Huh?

336
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
What did you just say?

337
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,020
I didn't say anything.

338
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,632
You're all red now.

339
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:07,435
And the shirt is unbottoned.

340
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:09,778
Are you flirting with anyone?

341
00:24:09,778 --> 00:24:12,380
Are you flirting with anyone here?

342
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,972
Tell me, whom do you lay your eyes on?

343
00:24:14,972 --> 00:24:16,972
I only flirt with the one I like.

344
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:22,113
Stay away from me.

345
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:48,625
Why?

346
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:56,235
I will recite the name "Pha" in my head
so I won't be in the mood to do you.

347
00:24:58,586 --> 00:25:01,350
Do me?

348
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:04,460
Tatch, calm down.

349
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,170
Let's head home.

350
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,076
Can we do it after the contest?

351
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,376
Huh?

352
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:18,543
You and I...after the contest...

353
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:21,849
What about?

354
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:23,986
About that....

355
00:25:23,986 --> 00:25:25,986
Please...can we?

356
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,320
If you still look confused like this, I will...

357
00:25:33,537 --> 00:25:36,537
Er...er...okay, okay. It's an okay.

358
00:25:41,764 --> 00:25:43,654
So the contest is on next Friday.

359
00:25:43,654 --> 00:25:45,654
After that, you won't be able to get away from me.

360
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:50,076
Alright.

361
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,226
One more thing...

362
00:25:54,226 --> 00:25:57,660
You must be my boyfriend too.

363
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Huh?

364
00:25:59,717 --> 00:26:03,563
Are you asking me to be your boyfriend?

365
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,941
Well, I like you and you like me.

366
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,622
We must be a couple.

367
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:08,622
We're definitely not relatives.

368
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:16,092
Shall we leave? I'm sleepy.

369
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:24,227
Don't act like you don't know.

370
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:29,911
I won't. I know it.

371
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:33,250
Let's go. My eyes are closing.

372
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,539
Okay, okay. Such a flirt.

373
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,669
Should I kiss you now?

374
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:41,058
Just head back first.

375
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:44,058
Huh? So heading back first and then kissing later?

376
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:48,995
Whatever, my eyes are really closing.

377
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:54,378
You should say it when you're conscious.

378
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:46,345
Can we do it?

379
00:32:48,582 --> 00:32:52,136
Hey, Lom, hurry up and put it on the table.

380
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:57,893
Alright, well, well, when I got demoted,
you used me like a servant.

381
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,648
That's right, our love has gotten old.

382
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:04,329
Huh? Since when did we love each other?

383
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:05,829
Hurry up and put it here.

384
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:12,546
C'mon, let me help you.

385
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:34,322
Are you alright?

386
00:33:34,322 --> 00:33:37,292
You're red.

387
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,010
You got a summer flu?

388
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,010
What flu? I'm fine.

389
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:46,647
But your face is really reddish.

390
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:48,748
Well, that's because of you.

391
00:33:48,748 --> 00:33:49,801
Huh?

392
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,434
Because of me?

393
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:53,459
Well, about last night.

394
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:55,177
About last night...

395
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:57,177
Do you still hurt?

396
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:01,983
No.

397
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,122
Well, I was gonna ask you that...

398
00:34:06,122 --> 00:34:09,437
can we not count last night?

399
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:11,151
Huh?

400
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:12,495
So...

401
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:14,128
you're not okay with it?

402
00:34:14,128 --> 00:34:15,635
It's not like that.

403
00:34:15,635 --> 00:34:17,818
But if it's gonna be our first sex,

404
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,294
can it happen once we become a couple?

405
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:23,294
And...be more conscious.

406
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:26,504
Of course.

407
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:29,638
Last night, we were just holding hands while sleeping.

408
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,068
Right, right, we were just holding hands while sleeping.

409
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,937
Hey!

410
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:36,437
Hey, Pha!

411
00:34:45,986 --> 00:34:47,573
Well, here you are.

412
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,594
Can you help me promote my booths?

413
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:51,314
Just one Instagram story is enough.

414
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:55,299
We will be able to sell like crazy, right, everyone?

415
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:56,973
PHA!

416
00:34:56,973 --> 00:34:58,442
WELCOME!

417
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:02,457
Our booth isn't open yet but just for you,
we're always open.

418
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:04,462
Please have a seat first.

419
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:07,295
He's so handsome.

420
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:08,295
Please have a seat.

421
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:11,802
I'm not that free.

422
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:15,690
Are you talking to me or your friends?

423
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:19,208
Pha, c'mon, hurry up.

424
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:22,715
Darn you all!

425
00:35:26,382 --> 00:35:27,382
Have a seat first.

426
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:39,514
Allow us to welcome you with these.

427
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:49,315
Milk and fried veggies?

428
00:35:49,315 --> 00:35:50,919
Do they even get along?

429
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,433
Right.

430
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:55,607
It's very tasty, I guarantee you.

431
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:57,859
And what milk is this? Is it pasturized?

432
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,197
Oh, dear, the doctor is checking on the milk.

433
00:36:01,197 --> 00:36:03,248
So are you going to drink that milk?

434
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,668
Or are you going to drink from these?

435
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:06,668
They're all hygienic.

436
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:13,641
Drink with me, man.

437
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:16,122
C'mon.

438
00:36:16,322 --> 00:36:17,296
Hey.

439
00:36:17,454 --> 00:36:18,454
Are you gonna drink that?

440
00:36:26,007 --> 00:36:27,007
Are you really drinking that?

441
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,119
Well, it's quite alright.

442
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,207
And what milk is this?

443
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:42,170
Buffalo milk, of course!

444
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,136
Huh?

445
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,644
Buffalo milk?

446
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:48,849
Cow milk and buffalo milk are all hygienic.

447
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:14,155
Yeah.

448
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:45,923
Hey, it's tasty.

449
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,469
See?

450
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:48,903
Yeah.

451
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,486
It's good.

452
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:51,439
Really?

453
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,032
Don't tease him.

454
00:37:53,032 --> 00:37:55,032
Yeah, it's really delicious, bro.

455
00:37:59,117 --> 00:38:00,217
I'll be right back.

456
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:04,221
Whoa, just one drink
and you're gonna do the review for me?

457
00:38:04,221 --> 00:38:06,221
You're such a sweet cousin, bro.

458
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,660
"Pha is calling..."

459
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:17,422
Hello, Yo.

460
00:38:17,422 --> 00:38:18,255
Yes?

461
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,586
Would you like some buffalo milk?
I'll buy you some.

462
00:38:20,586 --> 00:38:23,090
Whoa, buffalo milk?

463
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:24,974
Mmm.

464
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:26,655
Where did you buy that?

465
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:28,751
I haven't had that in a long time, you know.

466
00:38:28,751 --> 00:38:30,969
Lom is selling it at their faculty's booth.

467
00:38:30,969 --> 00:38:33,434
How about this? I'll buy you ten bottles.

468
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:35,612
Wow, that's a little bit too many.

469
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,410
Just a few is fine.

470
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:38,422
I wouldn't finish them.

471
00:38:38,422 --> 00:38:40,000
C'mon, you can drink all of them.

472
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,632
I'll help you drink it.

473
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:47,767
And...if you have it a lot, won't you get bored of it?

474
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:53,153
Mmm...I can have it every night.

475
00:38:53,153 --> 00:38:54,989
And I won't ever get bored of it.

476
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:56,173
Darn, Pha!

477
00:38:56,173 --> 00:38:57,480
What the hell?

478
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,646
Aren't you embarrassed?
There are lots of people around.

479
00:38:59,646 --> 00:39:03,646
Well, why should I be embarrassed?
We'll have it together every night.

480
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:08,248
What were you talking about?
I was talking about the buffalo milk.

481
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:09,373
Jerk!

482
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:10,043
I'm hanging up!

483
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:12,508
Oh! Alright, alright.

484
00:39:12,508 --> 00:39:14,527
Focus on your studies.
See you soon.

485
00:39:14,527 --> 00:39:16,538
Bye-bye.

486
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:17,739
I'm gonna go study now.

487
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,146
Would you like to drink my milk?

488
00:39:24,146 --> 00:39:26,154
You guys are so freakin' sweet.

489
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:27,612
What's gotten into you?

490
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:29,493
Go on, study.

491
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,493
I'm just annoyed.

492
00:39:42,111 --> 00:39:44,577
So you're here alone?

493
00:39:44,577 --> 00:39:46,340
Then can I spend a night here?

494
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,302
Chill, Ming.

495
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,522
It just made me think.

496
00:39:49,522 --> 00:39:50,321
Think about what?

497
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,285
That you have someone else.

498
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:52,548
I didn't see you at the dorm.

499
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:53,680
You didn't answer any of my calls.

500
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,154
He's with me.

501
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:57,494
Man, the thing is...

502
00:39:57,494 --> 00:40:00,129
Lom and I are a couple.

503
00:40:00,129 --> 00:40:02,629
Lom and I like each other.
