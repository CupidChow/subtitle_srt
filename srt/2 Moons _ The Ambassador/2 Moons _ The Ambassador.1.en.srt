1
00:01:56,143 --> 00:02:00,025
It all started with Yo.

2
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:03,272
Since high school, Yo's liked Pha.

3
00:02:03,272 --> 00:02:05,792
And when he went to uni, he dragged me to the same uni.

4
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,440
So he could use me to spy on Pha.

5
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,487
Hey, Ming!

6
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:29,928
The reason you went to the same uni was because of me,

7
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:31,497
or you wanted to peek at Kit?

8
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:32,660
It's because of you.

9
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,668
But Kit...was a little part of it too.

10
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,360
I didn't think much but when I kept seeing him...

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,006
I liked him so I hit on him.

12
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:43,206
Ming, when you were getting on my nerves that time,

13
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:44,572
that wasn't hitting on me.

14
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:46,572
That's called annoying.

15
00:02:58,699 --> 00:02:59,629
Ming.

16
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:01,350
Yes?

17
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,350
Are you pretending to be drunk?

18
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,560
Ouch.

19
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,605
I'll get inside now, okay?

20
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:12,605
Wait.

21
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:17,963
What are you doing?

22
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:19,062
Well, a good night kiss.

23
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,599
No, someone might see us.

24
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,130
No one would see us.

25
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,130
C'mon.

26
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,387
And did it work?

27
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,635
And then you went to the same faculty as me.

28
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:44,076
So that's how I knew these uncultured doctors.

29
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:47,129
Wait, Fourth, you knew these people since when you're in the first year.

30
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:48,417
What does that have to do with me?

31
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:49,787
Well, then, I just knew them.

32
00:03:49,787 --> 00:03:51,597
But when you and Yo came in,

33
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,240
and I happened to like Yo,

34
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,572
now, I know each one more.

35
00:03:56,572 --> 00:04:00,572
Fourth, things between you and Yo ended a long time ago.

36
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:05,070
Right now, it's about you and Beam.

37
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,516
About me and him?

38
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:07,516
We were just drunk.

39
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:22,013
Let me have you.

40
00:04:22,013 --> 00:04:23,013
No.

41
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:33,555
Beam.

42
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:41,647
Please be my boyfriend.

43
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:42,647
Mmm.

44
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:55,054
I told him to end it that time.

45
00:04:55,054 --> 00:04:57,417
But he wanted to continue.

46
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,059
Well, I had to take responsibility.

47
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,674
You're my friend.

48
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:02,070
So I had to...

49
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,210
Don't...don't tell any more stories.

50
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,132
But isn't it all because of me?

51
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,132
That's why it's a happy ending like this.

52
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:16,331
Er, Lomnaw, my cousin, he says he's gonna study here too.

53
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:19,742
How's it gonna be?

54
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:22,066
Auntie Prow tells me to take care of him.

55
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:25,074
C'mon, Pha, Lom is not a child anymore.

56
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,597
We can just keep an eye on him.

57
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,210
Mmm.

58
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:52,513
Star and Moon Ambassador contest is nonsense to me.

59
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:56,082
But what more could I do?

60
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,891
I gotta do it for the sake of the faculty.

61
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,891
And, take a look at me today. I'm so bummed.

62
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:06,663
I won't enter any kind of contest.

63
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:07,663
I'm done.

64
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:40,765
Can I take a pic of you?

65
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,053
Oh.

66
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:57,892
Lom.

67
00:06:59,164 --> 00:07:00,856
Hey, Louknam!

68
00:07:00,856 --> 00:07:04,856
Why are there more roses in your hands than your faculty's Moon's?

69
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:14,751
I'm sorry, Louknam, for being unable
to get the uni's Moon Ambassador for our Faculty of Agriculture.

70
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,512
And, I place the second from the last...

71
00:07:18,512 --> 00:07:21,117
Lom, please don't think too much.

72
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:24,923
You've done your best.

73
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:28,910
Don't care about what those fools say. Let them babble.

74
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,910
"Tong is calling..."

75
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:37,487
Hey, buddy, what's up?

76
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:39,892
The judges didn't have good eyes.

77
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,421
That's true.

78
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:44,789
We were watching you. You're the most handsome guy out there!

79
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:47,788
Thank you both for watching me till the end.

80
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,559
Thank us? C'mon, man, we're your friends.

81
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:52,357
We're supposed to be rooting for you.

82
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,957
Right, Am's here to cheer for you too.

83
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:58,722
He said he invited you to his room to go celebrate.

84
00:07:58,722 --> 00:08:02,722
Celebrate? Why? I'm not the uni's Moon Ambassador.

85
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:06,202
Well, we want to celebrate for you.
Does anyone have a problem with that?

86
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:08,379
Come over, okay? We'll be waiting.

87
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,581
Alright, that's all, Bye-bye.

88
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:10,326
Bye-bye.

89
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:12,214
What?

90
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:14,335
Smile. Don't think too much.

91
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,340
Then, would you excuse me?

92
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,633
I'll go see my friends, Louknam.

93
00:08:16,633 --> 00:08:17,993
Okay, okay.

94
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:20,314
Take some rest, go see your friends.

95
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:24,517
And don't overthink. You've done your best.
You did good.

96
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,689
Thank you for doing this for the faculty.

97
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,297
Go on, go take a rest.

98
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:33,297
You! I'll hit you!

99
00:08:36,177 --> 00:08:36,824
Hey, you!

100
00:08:36,824 --> 00:08:37,438
Yes?

101
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:38,726
Since I've seen all the Moons from every faculty,

102
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,332
I know that the Moon from Agriculture would lose.

103
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:46,332
So sorry for him, but at least, he beated one faculty.

104
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:54,015
From what I heard, I think this is the first time
that Agriculture placed so low.

105
00:09:01,246 --> 00:09:02,246
Should we take this?

106
00:10:42,635 --> 00:10:44,924
Oh my gosh! He's so handsome.

107
00:10:44,924 --> 00:10:47,370
Let me have him. I want him!

108
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,254
You go find out what his Instagram is.

109
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,414
I'll tag him!

110
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,027
I'll try to find him.

111
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,027
Start now.

112
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,831
Shit, isn't it too much!

113
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,157
What a bright entry.

114
00:11:12,157 --> 00:11:15,157
We've dug into his profile because we know that you wanna know.

115
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,382
This guy here, he's Tarntatch.

116
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:20,979
First year student, like us.

117
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:24,142
Oh! Then why haven't we seen him before?

118
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,187
He's handsome just like Pha. He shouldn't slip our sight.

119
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,549
That's true. And where was he during the Star and Moon contest?

120
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:35,549
And look whom the faculty sent. Total defeat.

121
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,360
He couldn't be around during the audition for the contest. He was lazy.

122
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:44,930
So he just showed up now?

123
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,812
And let me place at second from the bottom.

124
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:49,663
And everyone at the faculty scolded me.

125
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:52,670
Lom, relax.

126
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,310
If there was another reason, I wouldn't mind.

127
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,518
But being lazy?

128
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,518
I don't like him.

129
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:10,772
Tatch, why did you just get here to study?

130
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,973
I had a little problem to clear off.

131
00:12:20,546 --> 00:12:26,046
And how did the dean let you in
since you hadn't participated in any activities?

132
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,244
My parents have some strings.

133
00:12:28,244 --> 00:12:28,895
Wow.

134
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:32,625
So you must have a huge problem that you could take leave.

135
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,076
Well, yeah.

136
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,444
Did you have to go to the court?

137
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:40,430
No. I was just in the hospital.

138
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,629
Hey, guys, I think it's his private matter.
We shouldn't get involved.

139
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:48,680
Right, I will stick my nose out.

140
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,180
But Phu, can you ask an important question for me?

141
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:58,021
Alright, you're this handsome,

142
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:59,828
why didn't you be our faculty's Moon?

143
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:02,828
How could you let this shithead enter the contest?

144
00:13:06,032 --> 00:13:10,032
Because I knew that some people
would never get to be the Moon in this life.

145
00:13:10,475 --> 00:13:13,870
So I just gave him a chance.

146
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:17,242
I guess he wanted to be the Moon so badly.

147
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:20,404
When did I say I wanted to become the faculty's Moon?

148
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,566
So you didn't want to be one, really?

149
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:27,738
No. If you'd shown up on the day of the selection,
the position would've been yours.

150
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:32,739
And if you were the faculty's Moon,
right now, our faculty would be so popular.

151
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,829
But you didn't come.

152
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:37,035
You weren't there to help the faculty.

153
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:39,035
So you didn't know what I had to go through.

154
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:49,367
Yeah, that put the guilt on him.

155
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,851
That much?

156
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:54,851
Yeah, the second from the last was awful.

157
00:13:54,946 --> 00:13:56,745
You!

158
00:13:56,745 --> 00:14:00,512
Look how Lom sees Tatch. It's like he's holding grudge.

159
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,730
Don't tease him. He's cruel.

160
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,828
How cruel are you?

161
00:14:12,828 --> 00:14:15,713
So cruel that he might bite your head off.

162
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,762
Hey, like a puppy?

163
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:18,762
Hey, you!

164
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:23,132
Tatch!

165
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:29,854
Tatch, let's go grab some coffee.

166
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:42,626
Wow, it's his first day, and he got a girl.

167
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:45,112
He's something.

168
00:14:45,112 --> 00:14:46,112
Excuse me.

169
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:48,749
I'll be back.

170
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,919
Hey, are they flirting?

171
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,919
I don't know.

172
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,815
I'll go wait upstairs.

173
00:15:05,173 --> 00:15:06,537
What's wrong with him?

174
00:15:06,537 --> 00:15:09,420
I have no idea too.

175
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,420
"Pha is calling..."

176
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,275
Hello, Lom, where are you?

177
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,716
You wanna come fishing together?

178
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:21,925
Wait, Pha, don't you have classes?

179
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:23,411
Fishing? Where?

180
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:27,099
We're just stressed out, so we wanna
go fishing at the faculty of Agriculture.

181
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:30,357
What?

182
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:31,641
Are you nuts?

183
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,974
No. If you wanna join, then come.

184
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,063
That's it.

185
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:35,063
Hey, wait.

186
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,219
Hey, don't turn it yet.

187
00:15:41,219 --> 00:15:42,219
We just grill it.

188
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:53,295
Wow.

189
00:16:03,141 --> 00:16:04,141
Pha!

190
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:07,304
What are you all doing here?

191
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:10,477
Fishing, I told you.

192
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:14,477
No, you can't. My teachers will scold you.

193
00:16:16,723 --> 00:16:19,132
We've talked to your faculty's teachers.

194
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:20,367
They didn't say anything.

195
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,176
Just clean up after doing all this.

196
00:16:22,176 --> 00:16:23,419
Huh?

197
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,267
No, you can't, Fourth.

198
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:29,030
How did you get those rights?

199
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,402
Beam, tell him.

200
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:34,922
You know who talked to the teachers?

201
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:45,866
You guys! This is like a beauty privilege.

202
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:47,103
Pha, I think I got it.

203
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,352
Yo, pull it up.

204
00:16:48,352 --> 00:16:50,593
How do I do it?

205
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,273
How do I get it up?

206
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:52,726
Here, let me teach you.

207
00:16:52,726 --> 00:16:54,371
Come here.

208
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:58,251
So you reel it in slowly.

209
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:01,825
Reel in and relax, reel in and relax.

210
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:05,275
Like...

211
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,598
Pha!

212
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:09,239
Wait! I haven't finished my sentence.

213
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,239
Like this.

214
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Both of you can't be sweet all the time.

215
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:22,329
Guys, get the dip net.

216
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:23,940
Kit, are you gonna eat the fish?

217
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:30,187
What?

218
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:31,353
Are you gonna eat the fish?

219
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:32,325
Hurry up!

220
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:33,848
Alright.

221
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:36,851
Kit, you don't have to. I'll handle it.

222
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:38,976
Okay, Ming. I'll prepare other stuff.

223
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:39,976
Okay.

224
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:46,355
Yo, give it here.

225
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:47,355
I'll do it.

226
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:53,967
Coming.

227
00:17:59,104 --> 00:18:00,104
Got it!

228
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:04,212
Alright, okay.

229
00:18:07,383 --> 00:18:11,383
Guys, the meat's ready. It's yummy.

230
00:18:12,182 --> 00:18:13,182
The fish is here too.

231
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:18,984
Hey, Lom, are you gonna eat the fish?

232
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,300
It's alright. I got an afternoon class.

233
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,341
I'll get going now. Goodbye.

234
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:28,341
Goodbye.

235
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:37,207
"Dad is calling..."

236
00:18:39,393 --> 00:18:42,354
If you don't answer it, I'll answer your Dad's call.

237
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,594
Well, I got stuff in my hands, can't you see?

238
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:47,871
Why do you have to makes things complicated?

239
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,475
Come here.

240
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,079
Leave it.

241
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:04,561
Shit, Forth, it's dirty.

242
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,561
Well, it's cleaner than your hands.

243
00:19:11,323 --> 00:19:12,323
Hello, yes, Dad.

244
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:14,565
Yes, Dad?

245
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:17,650
Really?

246
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:21,665
Hello, Beam's Dad!

247
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:24,841
Really?

248
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,196
Got it, got it. I'll handle it.

249
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,722
What is it? Why are you smiling?

250
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:39,525
Guys, my Dad just called me.

251
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:40,975
He said he reserved a pool villa.

252
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:43,935
He's going on a honeymoon with my Mom.

253
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:46,217
Thanks for telling us that, but...

254
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:47,545
what does that have to do with us?

255
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:48,918
Can you let me finish first?

256
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:49,970
The thing is...

257
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,694
my family's got some other stuff to do...

258
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:54,449
so they won't be able to make it.

259
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:55,860
The hotel's been paid.

260
00:19:56,581 --> 00:20:00,097
So that means the villa is vacant.

261
00:20:00,097 --> 00:20:02,211
And?

262
00:20:02,211 --> 00:20:04,492
Why don't we take a chance to go relax?

263
00:20:04,492 --> 00:20:07,291
Aren't you all free tomorrow?

264
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,174
Right, Yo, when we have free time,
why don't we go spend time at the pool villa like Beam's parents?

265
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:15,174
You're just saying that. You work a lot.
Do you even have free time?

266
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,704
I'll just swap my shift then.

267
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:22,204
That's a good idea. I'd love to spend time with Kit too.

268
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:26,229
Isn't what I give you enough already?

269
00:20:26,229 --> 00:20:28,510
Well, this is a change of atmosphere.

270
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,838
So, what do you guys say?

271
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,333
Yeah, it's a good idea.

272
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,026
We have 3 free days.

273
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,787
Would you like to go, Yo?

274
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:38,787
Mmm, why not? Tomorrow and the next day,
I don't have any of my major classes.

275
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:42,961
Okay, so you all are in this.

276
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,927
Tonight, we're going to the pool villa.

277
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:48,206
Yeah!

278
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:53,406
Pool villa, Pool villa, Pool villa...

279
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:02,573
Pha.

280
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:03,017
Yes?

281
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,095
How many pyjamas are you bringing?

282
00:21:05,295 --> 00:21:08,902
Mmm, I think we don't need to bring too many.

283
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:13,436
Because...I think...

284
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:17,436
when we're there, I won't be wearing anything.

285
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:20,718
Pha!

286
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,925
Pha, we'll be late.

287
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:27,042
No, we won't.

288
00:21:27,042 --> 00:21:27,922
Pha!

289
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:29,094
Hmm.

290
00:21:29,094 --> 00:21:32,538
If you do it here, I won't do it at the pool villa.

291
00:21:32,538 --> 00:21:35,424
Yo, you're so mean.

292
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,909
Then, can I have a kiss instead?

293
00:21:56,434 --> 00:22:00,434
Tonight, I won't let you sleep, Yo.

294
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:03,196
What? Continue packing, so we won't be late.

295
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,700
Ah, okay.

296
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,200
"Beam is calling..."

297
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:13,984
Yeah, what's up?

298
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,630
Hey, are you done packing?

299
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,351
We need to hurry. Don't just keep having sex.

300
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:20,188
You know too much, man.

301
00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:22,225
Alright, we're done here. We'll hurry up and go.

302
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:24,829
And your cousin, Lom, did you invite him?

303
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:26,996
I don't know. I'll call him up.

304
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:29,692
Alright, alright, okay.

305
00:22:29,692 --> 00:22:31,692
We'll pack things up and go, alright?

306
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:37,660
Yo, could you please finish this?

307
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:39,425
I'll make a phone call real quick.

308
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,114
Alright.

309
00:22:41,114 --> 00:22:42,119
You're such a sweetheart.

310
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,119
Go ahead and make the call.

311
00:22:51,229 --> 00:22:51,792
So...

312
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:52,914
you!

313
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:53,642
What?

314
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:54,652
I've found his Instagram.

315
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:56,018
Woo! How?

316
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,389
Let me see.

317
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:58,667
And why should I tell you guys?

318
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,830
It's a sin not telling the truth, don't you know?

319
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,721
Give it here.

320
00:23:02,721 --> 00:23:03,167
Hey, damn you!

321
00:23:03,863 --> 00:23:05,797
Hey!

322
00:23:06,712 --> 00:23:08,967
His username is rad.

323
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:12,967
T, A, R, N, how's that read?

324
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,901
C'mon, let me help you.

325
00:23:15,901 --> 00:23:24,031
T, A, R, N, T, A, T, C, H...T, A, T, C, H, T, A, T, C, H...

326
00:23:24,031 --> 00:23:28,077
Tarn-tatch-tatch-tatch...

327
00:23:28,077 --> 00:23:31,282
Just a name and it's so classy, gals.

328
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:33,120
Stupid!

329
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,400
Right.

330
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,161
To hell with you guys!

331
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:37,343
You guys just keep talking.

332
00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:38,028
Give it here.

333
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:39,421
I'll follow him first.

334
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:40,415
I'd rather go home.

335
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:41,418
Oh?

336
00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:43,425
You got his Instagram already so you just leave.

337
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,830
Why can't you just share?

338
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:51,248
manfahhh.sis : You're so handsome.

339
00:23:51,248 --> 00:23:55,248
Shit, the pic with the shoes look so awesome.

340
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:58,426
I'm so bummed.

341
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,426
When did he follow me?

342
00:24:04,231 --> 00:24:05,320
What's wrong, Lom?

343
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,833
I've seen it since in the class.

344
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,833
You sighed and got all frustrated.

345
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,047
This is Tatch's Instagram.

346
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:18,374
You're peeking at his Instagram?

347
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,374
Let me have a look.

348
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,544
Shit, Manfah commented on his pic.

349
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,029
Yeah.

350
00:24:31,836 --> 00:24:35,836
Don't think too much, maybe those two aren't flirting.

351
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:38,317
Mmm, that's true.

352
00:24:38,317 --> 00:24:41,121
Tatch is that hot. There're so many girls coming after him.

353
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:42,399
They might be friends after all.

354
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,040
Right, Tong?

355
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,603
Mmm, that's right.

356
00:24:45,603 --> 00:24:47,687
They suit each other well.

357
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:49,533
Huh?

358
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,452
They're a perfect match.

359
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:54,777
Manfah is our uni's Star.

360
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:57,944
Tarntatch, if he were to enter the contest,
he would be the uni's Moon.

361
00:24:57,944 --> 00:25:00,161
Moon and Star are the perfect match.

362
00:25:00,161 --> 00:25:01,724
That's not true.

363
00:25:01,724 --> 00:25:04,817
I think Manfah suits you best, buddy.

364
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:10,817
Right, if you've had a crush on her this long,
you should hit on her.

365
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,420
I don't even have the guts to talk to her.

366
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:18,546
Let's go. Let's head back.

367
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:19,546
C'mon.

368
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,877
Tatch, what is it between you and Manfah?

369
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:33,196
Hmm, you're asking too much.

370
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,192
Right, I wanna know about that too.

371
00:25:34,192 --> 00:25:35,192
True.

372
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:39,471
Hey, guys, you're here.

373
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:43,471
Are you still wondering about things between Tatch and Manfah like us?

374
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:47,833
Tatch, who made the first move? Tell me.

375
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,755
This kind of stuff, it's hard to tell.

376
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:52,755
Did she hit on you first?

377
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:59,842
You guys are way too curious.

378
00:25:59,842 --> 00:26:02,287
I just wanna know...

379
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:06,048
how you can get a uni's Star to follow you.

380
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,048
I guess you'd have to be a Moon first.

381
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:15,851
Lom is a Moon but I've never seen any Stars follow him.

382
00:26:15,851 --> 00:26:18,343
Am, Lom can hear you, you know.

383
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,735
C'mon, I was just teasing.

384
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:22,342
He won't be mad.

385
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:25,344
What's wrong with me being a fake Moon?

386
00:26:25,344 --> 00:26:27,585
I know that I'm not as good-looking as him.

387
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,071
Why did you have to bully me?

388
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,571
You guys don't get to blame me for what I didn't do wrong, you know.

389
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:40,036
How cruel are you?

390
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,962
So cruel that he might bite your head off.

391
00:26:42,962 --> 00:26:44,852
Hey, like a puppy?

392
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:45,852
Hey, you!

393
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:48,419
Tatch!

394
00:26:49,903 --> 00:26:51,903
Tatch, let's go grab some coffee.

395
00:27:01,344 --> 00:27:03,344
Lom, I was just playing, I'm sorry.

396
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,624
Why is he mad? Normally, he isn't like this.

397
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,722
Lom!

398
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:22,331
Hey, hello, Louknam.

399
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:23,502
Come here now.

400
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:24,106
What's wrong?

401
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:26,505
I have something to talk to you.

402
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:29,754
Today, I wanted to tell you that...

403
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:29,920
Oh!

404
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,286
Tarntatch!

405
00:27:31,286 --> 00:27:32,855
Tarntatch is here too.

406
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:34,141
So you both are here.

407
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:36,422
I have something to talk to you both.

408
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,389
Today, I must tell you both that...

409
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:44,479
next week, our uni will hold a festival called "Kaset Festival"

410
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:47,643
And in the festival, the XEUs are coming too.

411
00:27:47,643 --> 00:27:51,684
So no matter what activities we do, we cannot lose to them.

412
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:55,291
In the festival, we do booths, snacks, sports...

413
00:27:55,291 --> 00:28:00,844
but most importantly, there will be the Ambassador contest.

414
00:28:00,844 --> 00:28:05,615
And actually, I'd like to send our faculty's Moon to enter the contest.

415
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:07,862
But I just saw...

416
00:28:07,862 --> 00:28:09,909
That's good. Send Tarntatch.

417
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:11,917
I don't mind. Don't you worry.

418
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:14,800
I do mind.

419
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,443
Isn't it weird that we don't send this year's Moon?

420
00:28:18,443 --> 00:28:20,807
Every year, we do that.

421
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:23,566
Hey, you! That's too much!

422
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:27,288
If everyone in the faculty gets to vote, they would choose you.

423
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:27,734
Calm down.

424
00:28:28,134 --> 00:28:28,944
No.

425
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:31,067
I won't participate.

426
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:34,669
Why not? Are you scared?

427
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:37,669
Are you scared that you're uni's representative and lose?

428
00:28:40,115 --> 00:28:43,232
I just don't wanna steal the scene
from the one that's got none like you.

429
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:44,232
Damn you!

430
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:46,965
Chill, guys.

431
00:28:46,965 --> 00:28:49,651
I think you're that one who's scared.

432
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:52,651
Because you ranked the second from the last in the Moon's contest,

433
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:58,304
when there's a big event, you won't participate.

434
00:28:58,304 --> 00:29:00,115
Because you're afraid that you'll lose again.

435
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:01,761
That's not it!

436
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:03,834
Then prove it.

437
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:07,834
I think it's not fair to send me to participate in The Ambassador contest

438
00:29:09,595 --> 00:29:12,759
although we already got the faculty's Moon.

439
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:15,604
I think we should have a selection.

440
00:29:15,604 --> 00:29:18,604
A selection? How?

441
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,841
I don't want to join because it makes me feel like
I outshine the faculty's Moon.

442
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,175
His scene is too little enough.

443
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:29,424
It's like I'm picking on a kid or something.

444
00:29:29,424 --> 00:29:30,712
Damn you, Tatch!

445
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:33,757
I don't want him to feel worse.

446
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:37,442
He doesn't even have one good thing to think of anyway.

447
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,772
Therefore...

448
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:40,889
I tried to simply give the position to you.

449
00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:42,888
But why won't you take it?

450
00:29:42,888 --> 00:29:48,888
Or you think the selection will be without any biases?

451
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:51,328
Actually, you'd love to be the Moon, right?

452
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:53,218
I only do it to protect your reputation.

453
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:56,097
Okay, you both, stop it right here.

454
00:29:56,097 --> 00:29:59,823
Just this, I've already felt bad for Lom.

455
00:29:59,823 --> 00:30:03,823
And seeing you two fighting in front of me is making me feel a lot worse.

456
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:07,795
I agree with you, Tarntatch.

457
00:30:07,795 --> 00:30:10,958
I shouldn't send you instead of Lom

458
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:14,846
because Lom is the still considered the faculty's Moon.

459
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:18,416
Therefore, I think we should have a serious selection.

460
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,314
How would you select?

461
00:30:20,314 --> 00:30:22,032
Numbers of followers on Instagram.

462
00:30:22,032 --> 00:30:23,032
Huh?

463
00:30:24,511 --> 00:30:27,995
The number of followers of Lom is 59K.

464
00:30:28,873 --> 00:30:32,402
And yours, it's 5.4K.

465
00:30:32,402 --> 00:30:33,714
That's a huge gap.

466
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:38,202
I can keep it up with him in time anyway.

467
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:41,687
At first, I didn't want to compete with you or anything.

468
00:30:41,687 --> 00:30:44,452
But now that I see your face, it gets me going.

469
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:46,257
Chill out, guys.

470
00:30:46,257 --> 00:30:49,665
You said it yourself that you could keep the followers up with me.

471
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:53,300
Don't say that you got no advantage when it's over.

472
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,906
I told you that I could...that means
I really can keep it up with you.

473
00:30:55,906 --> 00:30:57,268
And I have the rule.

474
00:30:57,268 --> 00:30:59,433
You can't do anything with the followers.

475
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:02,916
If they go up or down, let it be.

476
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:06,759
And most importantly, don't buy followers. At all!

477
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,160
Whatever, anything else?

478
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,160
And upload lots of pics and stories often.

479
00:31:15,216 --> 00:31:17,863
Why would you tell me that?

480
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:19,909
Aren't I your competitor?

481
00:31:19,909 --> 00:31:22,149
Guys, stop it, please.

482
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,471
Then let me say this...

483
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:28,471
Lom and Tarntatch, you will compete
with the number of followers on Instagram

484
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:32,277
Whoever got the most followers will be the winner.

485
00:31:32,277 --> 00:31:37,329
And the winner gets to be the representative
of our uni to enter The Ambassador contest.

486
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,929
In Kaset Festival.

487
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:41,421
Okay?

488
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,870
The result will be out on Tuesday at 4 p.m.

489
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,870
Who will be our uni's representative? Let's wait and see!

490
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:05,721
Upload lots of pics and stories often, understood?

491
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:13,566
Louknam.

492
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:15,833
Yes, dear?

493
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:20,333
I think you know that the representative should be him.

494
00:32:21,112 --> 00:32:24,184
I'm sorry, Lom, I'm really sorry.

495
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:26,040
You don't have to be sorry.

496
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,161
The one who should be sorry is Tarntatch.

497
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:30,804
He looks good but he doesn't want to enter the contest.

498
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,919
Lom, but you do understand me, right?

499
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,919
I do, but if you don't send Tarntatch in, our uni will lose.

500
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:42,767
Oh, dear...my dear...

501
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:44,659
Thank you for understanding me.

502
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,831
But the number of followers...

503
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:49,438
I know that those numbers are quite different.

504
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:51,475
But I have a plan B.

505
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,678
Hmm?

506
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:56,678
If I win, I will ask him to join the contest myself.

507
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:58,847
Really, Lom?

508
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:03,130
But if it doesn't work, and even if it takes everyone in the faculty,

509
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,537
I'll do it.

510
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:08,019
My friends would agree with me.

511
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,029
You're so sweet.

512
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:14,029
Thank you so much, Lom, thank you, my dear.

513
00:33:14,233 --> 00:33:17,436
But please let me pretend to compete with him.

514
00:33:17,436 --> 00:33:17,841
Mmm.

515
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,374
Or he'll get suspicious.

516
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:22,860
Okay, okay, Lom, thank you so much, really.

517
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,623
It's no problem. No matter what,
he and I will have to fight anyhow.

518
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:29,747
One more fight wouldn't harm us.

519
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:31,747
Thank you, Lom.

520
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:48,721
Hello, Pha, what's up?

521
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:52,721
Hello, Lom, my friends and I are about to go to the pool villa.

522
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:55,058
We'll be back the day after tomorrow.

523
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:57,343
And everyone wants you to join.

524
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:58,825
So I'm calling to invite you.

525
00:33:58,825 --> 00:33:59,757
Wanna come?

526
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:01,007
Really?

527
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,653
Are you really free?
Aren't you really studying Medicine?

528
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:06,214
Well, because of that, we don't get much free time.

529
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:09,217
So when do we have free time, we want to make the most of our time.

530
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:13,217
Can you be absent for a few days?

531
00:34:14,866 --> 00:34:16,512
So what do you say?

532
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,034
There's no expense. Everything's on me.

533
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:22,480
And this time, Auntie Prow will not waste a dime.

534
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,490
You don't need to mention my mother.

535
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,806
You, crazy cousin.

536
00:34:25,806 --> 00:34:27,769
Hey, so what's it gonna be?

537
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,018
We all have to meet up at Fourth's.

538
00:34:30,018 --> 00:34:31,302
Don't wanna get there too late.

539
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,953
So are you coming? I'll come pick you up.

540
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:38,525
Lomnaw, it's because you go on a trip with Pha.

541
00:34:38,525 --> 00:34:43,025
That's why your followers are going up and up and it beats Tarntatch!

542
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:52,483
Because Tarntatch isn't The Ambassador, that makes our uni lose!

543
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:56,803
And this, is all your fault, Lomnaw!

544
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:01,336
Wait, wait.

545
00:35:01,336 --> 00:35:04,383
I haven't said yes.

546
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:08,383
I can't go. I happen to have something important to do.

547
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:11,154
Huh? Something important?

548
00:35:11,154 --> 00:35:14,766
First year in Agriculture? You study that hard already?

549
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:17,128
C'mon, Pha, you go ahead.

550
00:35:17,128 --> 00:35:19,856
Alright, it's up to you then.

551
00:35:19,856 --> 00:35:21,856
Don't say I haven't invited you.

552
00:35:36,062 --> 00:35:38,500
Fourth, can you drive?

553
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,141
I just need a little rest.

554
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:44,061
See? Guys, I've told you to come early.

555
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,148
Don't know what time we'll reach there.

556
00:35:46,148 --> 00:35:49,148
Then, should we go grab something to eat first?

557
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:52,036
Yo, are you hungry?

558
00:35:52,565 --> 00:35:53,887
A little bit.

559
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,453
So we can get some coffee for Fourth as well.

560
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,971
Alright, it's good then.

561
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:57,348
Yeah.

562
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:58,483
Good idea, let's go.

563
00:35:59,603 --> 00:36:02,192
Ming! Kit! Wake up!

564
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:02,596
Ming!

565
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:04,085
Hey, hey!

566
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:05,453
They're sleepyheads.

567
00:36:06,293 --> 00:36:09,660
How could anyone be asleep all the time?

568
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,860
We could use your help with the navigation.

569
00:36:11,425 --> 00:36:13,148
Fourth, how do we do it?

570
00:36:13,148 --> 00:36:15,074
Like this?

571
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:17,193
I think it's car radiator.

572
00:36:17,193 --> 00:36:19,151
Yeah, I think so.

573
00:36:19,151 --> 00:36:20,277
What's that?

574
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:21,277
Yeah.

575
00:36:21,475 --> 00:36:23,243
What are those two doing?

576
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:28,300
Is their car broken?

577
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Yeah, and Fourth wanted to freakin' show off.

578
00:36:33,071 --> 00:36:34,872
I don't think there's any other problem.

579
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:35,525
I think it's car radiator.

580
00:36:35,525 --> 00:36:36,769
Do we need water?

581
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:37,806
Right.

582
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:41,854
Their car overheated.

583
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:44,495
Can you go get some cloth and water for me?

584
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:45,379
Sure, hold on.

585
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,860
Hang on to this for me.

586
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Okay.

587
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,102
Yo, please wait a little bit longer.

588
00:36:51,102 --> 00:36:52,990
I'll help Fourth and then we'll be good to go.

589
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,990
Alright, but shouldn't we find them a mechanic?

590
00:36:57,307 --> 00:36:59,753
Mmm, I think it's late.

591
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:01,400
And one more thing, it's just a radiator.

592
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,929
We can fix it ourselves. No need to call a mechanic.

593
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:06,292
Alright, alright.

594
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,854
Here you go.

595
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:09,709
Pha, c'mon.

596
00:37:10,077 --> 00:37:11,750
I'll be right back.

597
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,750
Are they okay?

598
00:37:19,646 --> 00:37:22,324
Hey, Beam is mad for real.

599
00:37:23,043 --> 00:37:25,043
That's the end of my romantic trip.

600
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,101
Should we go get Beam, Ming?

601
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:30,101
Go ahead.

602
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:35,283
All done.

603
00:37:35,283 --> 00:37:37,161
I think we're done here.

604
00:37:37,161 --> 00:37:40,082
Thank you.

605
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:40,930
Pha.

606
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,737
Yes?

607
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,788
Can I ask for you number?

608
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:45,947
Er...my number?

609
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:49,876
Yeah.

610
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:53,876
Can you go ask from that guy in blue shirt over there?

611
00:37:55,434 --> 00:37:57,006
Your number?

612
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:57,728
Yes.

613
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:58,816
And ask from that guy?

614
00:37:58,816 --> 00:38:00,857
Yes.

615
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:02,857
That one, that one, in a blue shirt.

616
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:11,385
Er...excuse me.

617
00:38:11,385 --> 00:38:13,033
Yes.

618
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:15,192
My name is Ging.

619
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:19,075
The thing is Pha told me if I wanted his number,

620
00:38:19,075 --> 00:38:22,400
I had to come and ask from you.

621
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,400
Oh, right.

622
00:38:31,243 --> 00:38:34,408
Er...Yo, calm down.

623
00:38:34,408 --> 00:38:37,975
I think Pha might try to say that if she wants to hit on him,

624
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:39,748
she has to pass his owner first.

625
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:43,184
I don't think he tries to challenge you or anything.

626
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:44,872
Really?

627
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:45,872
You take a look at his face.

628
00:38:52,447 --> 00:38:54,447
089...

629
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:01,825
Shit, Yo!

630
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:03,745
Thank you...

631
00:39:03,745 --> 00:39:05,350
It's Wayo.

632
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,350
Wayo.

633
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:15,494
Pha.

634
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:16,747
Yes?

635
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,350
I got it.

636
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,350
Are you for real?

637
00:39:34,761 --> 00:39:36,807
Yo, you gave that woman my number?

638
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:38,328
And why did you do that to me?

639
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:40,018
Hey, Yo, I'm sorry.

640
00:39:40,018 --> 00:39:42,987
…on Instagram…I saw that shop before.

641
00:39:43,627 --> 00:39:44,549
Hey, Lom.

642
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,559
Wayo, Pha didn't call those girls here, did he?

643
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,562
This won't end well.

644
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:52,569
Tatch, you posted a story of me on Instagram?

645
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,659
You should be glad that I helped you.

646
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,662
You're so not sincere.

647
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:58,377
Do you like guys or girls?

648
00:39:58,377 --> 00:40:01,551
Or you like girls but you're seeing a guy?

649
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:03,076
And what if I don't answer?

650
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:04,276
Then you don't have to answer.
