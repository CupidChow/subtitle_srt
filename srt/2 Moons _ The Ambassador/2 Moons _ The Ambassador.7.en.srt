1
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:57,720
The number of Tarntatch's followers are up!

2
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,236
But yours are way too far apart.

3
00:01:59,236 --> 00:02:01,204
Do you think Tatch can catch up?

4
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,886
I have to do everything in order for him to catch up.

5
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:05,523
He must be our faculty's representative.

6
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:06,783
Get in the car first.

7
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:11,290
If you don't leave now, I'll think of it
as if you wanna spend more time with me.

8
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,455
He stole my brother's girlfriend.

9
00:02:13,455 --> 00:02:15,223
Is your brother Parak?

10
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:16,530
Yes.

11
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,757
Well, I invited my friends
but I don't know if he'll come too or not.

12
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:22,757
Are you fighting?

13
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,298
Hey, are those your friends, Lom?

14
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:38,256
They're finally here.

15
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:40,457
Hello.

16
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:48,374
Run 2 laps for warm-up.

17
00:02:48,374 --> 00:02:50,925
We don't want to play
and also do the first aid.

18
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:51,925
You got it.

19
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,479
Lom.

20
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:29,697
You remember when Yo and I had a big problem, right?

21
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:34,255
The one that you haven't told me yet?

22
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:37,802
Well, I'll tell you now.

23
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,709
Whose pic is this?

24
00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:00,977
It's Wayo.

25
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,028
What is that red mark?

26
00:04:03,028 --> 00:04:07,028
Oh, gosh, there's a hickey.

27
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:40,441
I feel so sorry for Yo.

28
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:41,657
Don't worry.

29
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:44,657
When Yo's Pa knows about it,
he'll be kicked out.

30
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,258
It's so difficult to be the Moon.

31
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,361
But I don't seem to have any difficulties.

32
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,793
I didn't mean you.

33
00:04:55,793 --> 00:04:56,972
Then why are you whining?

34
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:58,485
Take care of Pha.

35
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:01,160
I'm not yelling or anything.

36
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,759
If you don't admit it, I'll kiss you.

37
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,269
Darn you, shut up!

38
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:08,986
You have to learn to behave appropriately.

39
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,986
Pha is stressed out right now.

40
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,633
Hey, where are you going?

41
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:24,153
Hey, hey, hey.

42
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:26,153
You barge in like this
and you'll waste your life.

43
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:36,046
I'm here to see Yo.

44
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:37,593
What's your name?

45
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:41,399
I'm Pha, Phana Gongthanin.

46
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:43,538
Right now, young master doesn't welcome anyone.

47
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:44,846
Even Mr. Ming.

48
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,394
Me too?

49
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:50,394
And most importantly, young master
insists that the doors are closed to all visitors.

50
00:05:51,062 --> 00:05:53,566
Especially, the one named Phana Gongthanin.

51
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,406
You heard it wrong.

52
00:05:55,406 --> 00:05:57,250
No, I didn't.

53
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,639
How could that be? I'm getting in.

54
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,312
Absolutely not!

55
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:05,312
What the hell? I'm your young master's boyfriend.

56
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:07,579
No exception.

57
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:10,172
Why is that? I'm getting in!

58
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:11,644
I've told you, you can't.

59
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:13,311
Calm down, man.

60
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:13,694
I'm getting in!

61
00:06:13,694 --> 00:06:14,694
Hey!

62
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:22,874
Go sit over there.

63
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:25,138
Alright, I won't get in.

64
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,138
But I will wait right here.

65
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,317
I wanna see Yo.

66
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:58,335
Yo's family is like this.

67
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:02,335
When he wanted to go to the same uni as you,
he had to beg his Pa.

68
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,759
Well, being an only child is like this.

69
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,759
His Pa loves him more than anything.

70
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,991
Are you really going to wait here?

71
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:13,833
Yo is for real.

72
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,045
I don't think he's gonna let you in easily.

73
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:17,045
Mmm.

74
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:24,145
He'll go soft with me.

75
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:27,897
Honestly, I don't think he will this time.

76
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:33,407
Yo loves you but that's the reason why
he's not gonna come see you easily this time.

77
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:36,373
You know, he's been through a lot.

78
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,373
Accept that.

79
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,467
"Wayo_ph: You should go back."

80
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,483
"Pa_Phana: I won't."

81
00:07:50,483 --> 00:07:54,483
"Yo, I think we should talk."

82
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:59,293
"It's not your fault.
Please come out and talk to me."

83
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:03,683
"It's hot out here, Yo. T_T"

84
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,762
Yo!

85
00:08:35,852 --> 00:08:36,852
Yo!

86
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,701
Come out and talk to me, Yo.

87
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:39,701
Yo.

88
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:43,756
Yo, Yo, Yo, come out and talk to me first.

89
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,221
Yo, it's not your fault, Yo.

90
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:45,978
Yo!

91
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:46,443
Let me go!

92
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:46,820
Yo.

93
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,095
Let me go!

94
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,768
Yo!

95
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:52,013
Let me go!

96
00:08:52,013 --> 00:08:54,063
What are you guys doing?

97
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,063
Pa.

98
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:01,888
Come and talk inside.

99
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,316
Get in, get in.

100
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,574
What's with all the noise here at my house?

101
00:09:17,128 --> 00:09:18,128
Hello, Pa.

102
00:09:19,046 --> 00:09:20,046
Hello, Pa.

103
00:09:22,393 --> 00:09:26,393
Pha, you look more handsome than before.

104
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:30,959
Er...Pa, I mean, Dad...

105
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,931
Just call me Pa already.

106
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:34,690
Yes.

107
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,861
Pa, you've seen me before?

108
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:39,702
How have I not?

109
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:42,589
I have only one son.

110
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,942
I know everything.

111
00:09:45,942 --> 00:09:48,998
Where my son is,
whom he's with or whom he's seeing,...

112
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:51,791
I know everything.

113
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,791
Actually, I've known you
since you were in high school.

114
00:09:57,974 --> 00:10:01,729
Yo asked me to slow down
when I was driving...

115
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:05,729
so he could see you buy the meatballs
in front of the school.

116
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,570
Ah, what took you so long?

117
00:10:15,946 --> 00:10:17,994
And when it became a routine,

118
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:21,994
I knew that he liked you.

119
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:27,996
Unlike me, when I was a teenager, I liked girls.

120
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:38,345
But about today, you know, I was very mad.

121
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,224
How could he do that to my son?

122
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,610
If I wasn't busy today,
I would have my men beat you up.

123
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:56,023
But he already got what he deserved.

124
00:10:56,023 --> 00:11:00,023
I already sent my men
to destroy his family's business already.

125
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:05,611
Not for long, they’re gonna go out of business.

126
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:15,231
Whoever dares cross my family, won't get away.

127
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,990
So, what brings you all with the noises here?

128
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:29,493
You don't give up, but it's not your fault.

129
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,641
Why would you try to make it up to Yo?

130
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:34,576
I just wanna talk to him, Pa.

131
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:38,122
Because I think he must be overthinking now.

132
00:11:38,122 --> 00:11:43,122
I just wanna talk to him and tell him
that what he thinks is not true.

133
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:47,629
So you're not disgusted?

134
00:11:48,181 --> 00:11:49,181
No.

135
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:54,027
Do you think you'll be embarrassed
being in a relationship with him?

136
00:11:54,285 --> 00:11:55,460
No.

137
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,382
And, you're not embarrassed?

138
00:11:57,382 --> 00:11:58,231
Not at all.

139
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,231
Never.

140
00:12:02,777 --> 00:12:06,415
I only have one son.

141
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:10,340
I am like a woman.

142
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,434
I always get irritated, and overthink.

143
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:21,734
If you're certain, and determined,
then go up, son.

144
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,466
Thank you very much.

145
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,466
Thank you.

146
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:28,729
Wait up.

147
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:32,568
But you two, come here.

148
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,951
Let them clear things up.

149
00:12:33,951 --> 00:12:35,835
Come have some drinks with me.

150
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:39,835
C'mon, come here.

151
00:12:51,744 --> 00:12:52,744
Yo.

152
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,799
Stay away.

153
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:26,253
Don't touch me.

154
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:31,715
Wayo.

155
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:33,972
I'm dirty, Pha.

156
00:13:36,568 --> 00:13:37,568
No, Yo.

157
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:41,544
Yo.

158
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,973
Yo.

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Come here.

160
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,006
Calm down.

161
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,061
It's me.

162
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:51,365
Look at me.

163
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:53,709
Calm down.

164
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,210
Yo, I'm worried about you, you know.

165
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:03,972
I'm so worried about you, you know.

166
00:14:07,366 --> 00:14:10,366
I'm very worried about you, truly.

167
00:14:10,797 --> 00:14:12,797
I won't let you be alone like this.

168
00:14:22,219 --> 00:14:25,142
Listen to me, Yo.

169
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,733
You don't have to hate yourself.

170
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,995
And don't you think that I'll hate you too.

171
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:39,751
Stuff like this, nobody wants it to happen.

172
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:46,058
And that jerk, don't you worry.

173
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:50,572
Right now, he's punished.

174
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:55,299
And about us...

175
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,475
listen to me now.

176
00:14:57,475 --> 00:15:02,783
I've told you no matter what happens,

177
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,466
I love you.

178
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:08,057
And I wouldn't change.

179
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:12,057
Therefore, don't overthink.

180
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,983
But right now...

181
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,321
Yes?

182
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:22,583
other people look at me in a bad way.

183
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:48,245
I don't care.

184
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:50,245
I only care about you.

185
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:58,567
Tomorrow, I'll have you by my side to the uni.

186
00:15:58,567 --> 00:16:03,067
And I'll let everyone know
that we both are actually together.

187
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:07,197
Not just a rumor.

188
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:08,197
Smile now.

189
00:16:09,122 --> 00:16:10,122
Okay?

190
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:18,295
I love you, Yo.

191
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,033
Lom.

192
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,708
When people have a problem,

193
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,708
the best way to fix it is to talk.

194
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,635
If any of you thinks about it in your own way,

195
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:48,520
it won't end well.

196
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,520
If we don't speak our mind, how would they know?

197
00:16:58,288 --> 00:17:00,288
Pha, come help us divide the team.

198
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,424
You guys are with me.

199
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:12,898
You too, Lom.

200
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,875
There's one open slot left.
Who'd like to join?

201
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:16,872
Me!

202
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:18,073
Come.

203
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,975
My team, shirts on.

204
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Your team, shirtless.

205
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,799
C'mon.

206
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:41,469
Lom, hurry up.

207
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Hey.

208
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:18,395
Beam.

209
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:19,582
Darn!

210
00:19:19,582 --> 00:19:21,140
Are you alright?

211
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,067
Are you alright? I’m sorry.

212
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:27,000
Stay out of this.

213
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,299
You! Back off!

214
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:31,065
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

215
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:32,911
No.

216
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:34,749
But I've seen you trying to press him
since the beginning.

217
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:37,053
Well, he's the best player.

218
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:37,608
Shut your mouth!

219
00:19:37,608 --> 00:19:40,070
Hey! Not now.

220
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,467
Get him to the hospital first.

221
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,467
Guys, help me out here.

222
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:02,016
I don't think he's the right one.

223
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,389
Lom.

224
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,857
Are you alright?

225
00:20:47,857 --> 00:20:49,912
Looks like you're gonna pass out.

226
00:20:49,912 --> 00:20:51,664
What is it?

227
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:55,549
Where is the scoreboard?

228
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:56,549
Lom!

229
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,010
The one who will give you the answer is there.

230
00:21:05,352 --> 00:21:07,352
I miss you.

231
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:08,619
Louknam.

232
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:10,174
Where is the scoreboard?

233
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:13,474
The scoreboard? The dean told us to put it away.

234
00:21:13,474 --> 00:21:15,444
He said it's in the way.

235
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:16,579
Isn't that confusing?

236
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,918
Huh?

237
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:19,722
It's in the way?

238
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:20,863
Yeah.

239
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,922
I'm confused too.

240
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:24,181
But nevermind.

241
00:21:24,181 --> 00:21:26,281
Because that's not our problem today.

242
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:28,004
Our problem today is...

243
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:31,344
the number of Instagram followers of Tatch's and yours...

244
00:21:31,344 --> 00:21:33,611
Don't worry about it, Louknam.

245
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:36,744
Well, I've promised you.

246
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,964
So I'll keep my word.

247
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,972
I will beg Tarntatch.

248
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:42,972
Oh, dear.

249
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:46,160
The good deed you do to me will return its favor.

250
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,900
I guarantee you, you will have a good partner,
and a rich one too.

251
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,799
Really.

252
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,799
Huh?

253
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:56,234
Oh, he's here now.

254
00:21:56,234 --> 00:21:57,371
Here's Tarntatch.

255
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:00,093
Louknam...er...

256
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:01,729
Then, I'll get going.

257
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,235
Well, he's here...

258
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:04,537
Hey, wait up.

259
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:05,958
Wait, Lom!

260
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,958
What? Lom! You said you're gonna help me!

261
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,103
Oh.

262
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,561
I'm off.

263
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:17,561
It's nothing, Tatch.

264
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,143
I feel the pressure from all sides...

265
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:40,366
Yeah, that's right, it comes from everywhere.

266
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:22,278
What are you guys fighting about?

267
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:24,455
Why don't we know about it?

268
00:23:24,455 --> 00:23:26,417
It's not like we're fighting.

269
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:28,417
If not, then why don't you talk?

270
00:23:34,307 --> 00:23:36,094
Well...

271
00:23:36,094 --> 00:23:37,777
Yesterday when we went to play soccer with Pha,

272
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:40,900
well, you guy were there.

273
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,208
I think it was an accident.

274
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,208
Tatch didn't mean it.

275
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:50,771
And Pha said that Tatch wasn't the right one?

276
00:23:50,771 --> 00:23:52,623
Right.

277
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:54,623
And...what else is there?

278
00:23:56,754 --> 00:24:00,226
Yesterday, I went to see Panon.

279
00:24:00,226 --> 00:24:03,355
Yeah, and what did he say?

280
00:24:03,355 --> 00:24:05,205
I don't want you and him to be close.

281
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:06,205
Why not?

282
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:09,628
He stole my brother's girlfriend.

283
00:24:11,436 --> 00:24:15,588
He said Tatch stole his brother's girlfriend.

284
00:24:15,588 --> 00:24:16,588
Huh?

285
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:21,433
What?

286
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,688
Don't tell me that his brother's girlfriend was Manfah.

287
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:26,688
Well, yeah.

288
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:32,271
Look on the bright side, maybe he doesn't like Tatch
so he used it against him.

289
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:36,364
But...

290
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:42,193
Manfah told me that...

291
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:47,193
she broke up with Parak, Panon's brother,
in order to get to Tatch.

292
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:52,117
And there's this The Ambassador contest thingy too.

293
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,034
I got a headache now.

294
00:25:00,537 --> 00:25:01,537
Chill, Lom.

295
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:03,884
You gotta fix this step by step.

296
00:25:03,884 --> 00:25:06,639
First thing first, you need to talk to Tatch.

297
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:10,027
To see if he really stole
Panon's brother's girlfriend.

298
00:25:10,027 --> 00:25:12,411
Well...

299
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:14,411
I'm scared of the answer.

300
00:25:17,813 --> 00:25:20,696
If you like him, you need to hurry
and clear things up with him.

301
00:25:20,696 --> 00:25:22,696
Or else other problems will come endlessly.

302
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:30,952
I know but...

303
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,892
Lom, you listen to me now.

304
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:36,031
You don't have to be scared of the answer.

305
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:38,582
If you wanna know, you just ask.

306
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:42,386
This involves many of your unfixed problems.

307
00:25:42,386 --> 00:25:47,386
If you don't do it now, there won't be
other conversations with Tatch again.

308
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:17,769
Hey.

309
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,186
Er...hey.

310
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:22,059
I'm gonna get going now.

311
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:23,259
Can we have a talk?

312
00:26:26,554 --> 00:26:28,356
Yeah, about what?

313
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:32,235
Then let's start with The Ambassador contest?

314
00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:35,416
I don't care about other things
except what's between you and me.

315
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,424
This is about what's between you and me too.

316
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:41,600
Well, I don't care.

317
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Let's start with us first.

318
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:47,826
Are you really close to Panon?

319
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:49,826
Well, not that much.

320
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:54,297
We had a tutoring together
when we were in high school.

321
00:26:54,297 --> 00:26:56,297
We met at the tutoring school.

322
00:26:58,344 --> 00:27:00,819
You asked me like what he asked me.

323
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,819
He asked me if I was close to you.

324
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,090
Did he say anything about me?

325
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:11,303
Can you tell me the things he told you?

326
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,399
He said I stole his brother's girlfriend, didn't he?

327
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:20,946
And do you believe him?

328
00:27:27,008 --> 00:27:28,008
Lom!

329
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:32,351
Answer me.

330
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,279
Do you believe Panon?

331
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:42,917
Well...

332
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:45,801
Do you believe him?

333
00:27:45,801 --> 00:27:47,774
No.

334
00:27:47,774 --> 00:27:49,774
I'm just scared.

335
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:55,705
I will be so hurt if you believe him.

336
00:27:58,295 --> 00:27:59,295
Listen to me, Lom.

337
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,842
I've never stolen anyone's girlfriends.

338
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:04,766
Man liked me.

339
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,234
And she thought that I liked her too.

340
00:28:08,234 --> 00:28:12,375
My friend, Panon's twin brother, and I...

341
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:14,683
had a fight and he was sent to the hospital.

342
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:17,673
You smashed him?

343
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:18,673
No.

344
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:23,521
He tried to commit suicide after talking to me.

345
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:27,871
So Panon hated me.

346
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:29,962
He blamed me.

347
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:32,962
Even now, he's still furious.

348
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:37,026
When the semester started and I was absent,...

349
00:28:37,026 --> 00:28:40,660
I went to see Parak at the hospital the whole time.

350
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,461
But that doesn't stop him from being mad at me.

351
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:48,461
Actually, you could've told me this before.

352
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:52,285
Well, I overthought.

353
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:55,065
Because everyone who listened to Panon's story,

354
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:56,614
believed him.

355
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,538
No one believes me.

356
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:01,538
I finished high school
without having any single friend.

357
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,957
Lom.

358
00:29:12,556 --> 00:29:16,556
Whom do you believe? Between me and Panon?

359
00:29:17,193 --> 00:29:19,193
I definitely believe you.

360
00:29:24,707 --> 00:29:25,707
Thank you.

361
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,798
Hey, Tatch.

362
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:35,468
What are you doing?

363
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:37,468
Let go. People might see this.

364
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:41,229
There's no one.

365
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:01,003
Lom.

366
00:30:02,378 --> 00:30:05,378
I was scared that you might become
like other friends of mine.

367
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:09,875
I was scared that you might steal
other people's girlfriend too.

368
00:30:10,262 --> 00:30:12,262
To be honest...

369
00:30:14,217 --> 00:30:18,217
I don't really know you that much.

370
00:30:19,094 --> 00:30:21,437
But I've already liked you.

371
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:23,319
I want to...

372
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,536
Whom do you like?

373
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:25,536
Tatch!

374
00:30:26,137 --> 00:30:28,137
Why did you have to
lean your face so close to me?

375
00:30:30,768 --> 00:30:32,768
Don't you trick me into saying that again.

376
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:37,739
Yeah, and about The Ambassador,
what will you say?

377
00:30:37,739 --> 00:30:40,754
Well, you, be the representative.

378
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,759
Are you out of your mind?

379
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:45,759
I placed the second from the bottom
when I was at the uni's Moon contest.

380
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:49,735
But your Instagram followers are more than mine.

381
00:30:49,735 --> 00:30:53,498
How could I be the representative when you're the winner?

382
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:56,755
Well, yeah, but...

383
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,802
I will give up my position for you.

384
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:03,360
No, it's alright.

385
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
Tatch!

386
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:07,291
Please do it for the faculty.

387
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,291
You're way more handsome than me.

388
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:14,345
But you're way cuter than me.

389
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:19,198
Tatch, if you don't get into the contest,

390
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:23,198
all the people in the faculty will beat me up.

391
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:27,970
What's that supposed to mean?

392
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,110
Although my followers are higher than yours,

393
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,127
you will join the contest anyhow.

394
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:35,682
Because I gave up since the beginning.

395
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,682
Huh? How so?

396
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,619
You don't know how great you look?

397
00:31:42,619 --> 00:31:44,544
Have you ever seen yourself in a mirror?

398
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:46,083
You're very handsome.

399
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:47,875
You're way more handsome than me.

400
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:50,169
Please join the contest.

401
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:51,169
No.

402
00:31:51,674 --> 00:31:54,051
Why can't other people in the faculty
see that you're worthy?

403
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:57,432
I don't like this.

404
00:31:57,432 --> 00:31:59,432
Just let them think whatever they want to.

405
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,740
You know, right? Being in the contest
doesn't prove anyone's worth...

406
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:10,593
Because everyone has his own worth.

407
00:32:10,593 --> 00:32:14,059
I know that but you have to be there instead of me.

408
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,956
And you will win.

409
00:32:16,956 --> 00:32:19,956
And you will be able to help our faculty shine.

410
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:26,719
But our rule is to compete
by the followers on Instagram.

411
00:32:26,719 --> 00:32:29,719
Yours are bigger,
so you must be the representative.

412
00:32:31,565 --> 00:32:34,865
Everyone in the faculty sees it the same way.

413
00:32:34,865 --> 00:32:37,365
That you're more suitable than me.

414
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,359
Scoot.

415
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:26,581
How about this?

416
00:33:26,581 --> 00:33:33,215
Tell me what you want
in order to get you to join the contest.

417
00:33:33,215 --> 00:33:35,100
It could be anything, right?

418
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,564
Yeah, anything.

419
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:40,564
Well, I don't want to be the representative.

420
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,941
So are you gonna tell me or not?

421
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:47,456
Ah, alright, alright. So annoying.

422
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:49,887
I'll join the contest.

423
00:33:49,887 --> 00:33:52,056
But...

424
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:54,538
you have to be my assistant.

425
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:56,923
What the heck?

426
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:57,923
Well, then I'm not joining.

427
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:05,357
Just one thing that I want,...
and you can't give it to me...

428
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:08,659
Er...alright, alright.

429
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,212
I'll be your assistant.

430
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:13,727
I'm totally okay with whatever you say now.

431
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:14,727
That's good.

432
00:34:23,456 --> 00:34:24,965
Let's post the Instagram story.

433
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:28,965
So people will know that
we have the most handsome representative.

434
00:34:38,672 --> 00:34:41,344
Go on, aren't you gonna press it?

435
00:34:41,344 --> 00:34:42,344
Yeah, yeah.

436
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:52,275
Please holler for our faculty's representative, Tarntatch!

437
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,159
Tatch!

438
00:35:11,038 --> 00:35:15,038
I smelled Sompoch so I wanted to smell something nice.

439
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,131
Smell my foot, will you?

440
00:35:53,674 --> 00:35:56,008
Why are they looking at me and smiling?

441
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:58,141
Do they still notice you?

442
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:00,813
Right now, they do. But this morning, probably not.

443
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:03,454
People are ready to bite his head off
because he has more followers than you.

444
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:07,048
Why does this guy have to be so serious
about the handsome guy on the stage?

445
00:36:07,048 --> 00:36:09,720
Just say this, it's for the faculty!

446
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,771
I'm not doing it for the faculty.

447
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,816
But I'm doing it for you.

448
00:36:15,816 --> 00:36:16,816
Right.

449
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:21,948
Hey, guys.

450
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:27,044
A texted me that if anyone's interested
in the upcoming soccer game,

451
00:36:27,044 --> 00:36:31,044
go sign your name at the faculty today.

452
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,433
How can we miss that?

453
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:38,156
Tong, Toon, this time we must be in the team.

454
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,002
Substitutes would still be okay.

455
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:40,002
Mmm.

456
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:44,845
That's good but I wouldn't aim for the substitute.

457
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:48,852
If it were me, I would be in the forward,
the number one on the team.

458
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:51,422
You can't go to the tryout.

459
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:52,723
Why not?

460
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:56,723
You must spend all your time doing the beauty routine.

461
00:36:57,062 --> 00:37:00,360
I want to play soccer.
You know how good I am at soccer.

462
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,699
No. No one in the faculty wants you
to do lots of things at the same time.

463
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:08,542
Trust me, they wouldn't ask too much from you.

464
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,841
One more thing, you won't be able to keep up.

465
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:14,841
You gotta join The Ambassador contest,
and another soccer game?

466
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:21,070
Hey, here you are, guys.
I've been looking all over for you.

467
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,715
Here she is.

468
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:24,080
You must prepare yourself for a mission.

469
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,839
Tarntatch and Lom.

470
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:28,357
Is there anything, Louknam?

471
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:33,610
Here, I got some gift vouchers from beauty clinics
so you can go pamper yourself.

472
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:37,610
My duty here is to make you the most handsome possible.

473
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,540
It's alright. I'll go by myself.

474
00:37:45,375 --> 00:37:46,375
With this guy.

475
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,599
Oh, then it's up to you, Tarntatch.

476
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,599
Er...Lom, if it doesn't bother you,
please take care of him.

477
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:57,074
Well...

478
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,789
Oh, Lom, you can go pamper yourself too.

479
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:00,346
I have so many vouchers.

480
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:00,728
Well, I...

481
00:38:00,728 --> 00:38:01,825
Of course, he will do it.

482
00:38:01,825 --> 00:38:05,446
He's been looking like crap recently.

483
00:38:05,446 --> 00:38:10,446
Okay, then, when you're ready,
tell me the date and time, I'll reserve it for you.

484
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:11,872
Today.

485
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,872
Huh?

486
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:14,879
Today?

487
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,551
Oh, okay, of course.

488
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:22,851
And Louknam, have you known that
Lom will become my assistant on the contest day?

489
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:24,507
Huh?

490
00:38:24,507 --> 00:38:27,507
If it's not him, I won't join the contest.

491
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:35,693
Lomnaw? The assistant?

492
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:41,297
That's great.

493
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:48,636
The more, the merrier.
Everything will be easier, right?

494
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,494
That's a good idea.

495
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:54,494
Then, today, you go ahead.
Here you go.

496
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,012
Deal.

497
00:38:56,012 --> 00:38:59,155
Yes, deal, deal, deal.

498
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:00,155
What was that?

499
00:39:03,326 --> 00:39:06,873
Think about what you wanna eat
after we finish from the clinic.

500
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:09,422
I will go on a date with you.

501
00:39:09,422 --> 00:39:11,814
Have you asked me if I'm free?

502
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:12,941
I didn't ask...

503
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:13,406
Darn you!

504
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:15,161
Hey, I told you to calm down.

505
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:15,953
Darn!

506
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:16,377
What the hell is wrong with you?

507
00:39:16,377 --> 00:39:17,223
Why did you hurt my boyfriend?

508
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:19,816
Hey, calm down now.

509
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:20,402
Darn it.

510
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,402
Fourth, calm!

511
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,579
Who could stop him except Beam?

512
00:39:28,754 --> 00:39:29,754
What happened?

513
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:43,438
What did you do to my bro?

514
00:39:43,438 --> 00:39:44,607
Hey, it's nothing.

515
00:39:44,607 --> 00:39:45,783
I'll clear it myself.

516
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,706
Did you stir the fight
between Agriculture and Engineering?

517
00:39:47,706 --> 00:39:48,636
To hell with it.

518
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,579
I don't care what it takes.

519
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,050
Calm down now.

520
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,405
I don't wanna take advantage of the drunk.

521
00:39:58,405 --> 00:40:00,704
From all this, Pha's keeping an eye on me already.

522
00:40:00,704 --> 00:40:02,880
Pha won't know.

523
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
Huh?

524
00:40:04,174 --> 00:40:07,469
I'm sorry but this time, I just have to.

525
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:10,229
And did you have to give them
your number and your Line ID?

526
00:40:10,229 --> 00:40:13,429
Are you gonna talk behind my back
and then continue at the camp discreetly?
