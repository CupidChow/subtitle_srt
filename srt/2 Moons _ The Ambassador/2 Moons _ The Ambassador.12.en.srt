1
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:56,941
Darn, Am, listen to me.

2
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,068
Panon took Lomnaw.

3
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,888
He sent me a pic.

4
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,936
Huh! What the hell?

5
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:05,131
I want Lomnaw back.

6
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:06,177
So what's it gonna be?

7
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,671
You wanna fight me?

8
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,751
If you're gonna be a crybaby
who's stopped by your friends...

9
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,382
then just go back to where you're from.

10
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,295
I can't take this anymore!

11
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:13,584
I'll kill him!

12
00:02:13,584 --> 00:02:15,339
Tatch! You need to chill!

13
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:16,878
Listen to me.

14
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,877
If the judges find out about this,
you won't be able to participate.

15
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:22,928
Then what am I supposed to do?

16
00:02:22,928 --> 00:02:26,175
Leave all this to me.

17
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:27,751
Are you gonna fight me, Rak?

18
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,751
Right.

19
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,710
Yeah!

20
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,709
Let's celebrate!

21
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:12,252
Our faculty spares no expense.

22
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:15,542
We booked the whole bar just to celebrate for Tatch.

23
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,089
Well, he's our faculty's pride.

24
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:20,995
The seniors must really went all in.

25
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:24,290
Remember when Lom participated?

26
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,250
That time, it was a party at Am's room.

27
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,077
Like a consoling private party.

28
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,378
That's right.

29
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,969
A very sad party, was it?

30
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:36,892
And the contestant was drunk like hell?

31
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:40,891
We gossiped so loud.
Wouldn't you care to look at us?

32
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:42,392
Lom!

33
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:43,849
Lom!

34
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:45,467
Lom!

35
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,723
Huh? Yeah?

36
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:50,722
You didn't have to look that hard,
Tatch hasn't arrived yet.

37
00:03:51,178 --> 00:03:55,177
If he had, the crowd would go...

38
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:56,807
Here he comes!

39
00:04:06,977 --> 00:04:07,977
So handsome.

40
00:04:13,563 --> 00:04:15,563
Wait, he'll be right back.

41
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:29,345
Can we have a talk?

42
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:31,841
Mmm.

43
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,139
Guys, may I have a talk with Lomnaw for a while?

44
00:05:00,524 --> 00:05:03,851
You had to announce that we're gonna talk?

45
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,024
Announce what?

46
00:05:05,024 --> 00:05:09,023
If I didn't tell them,
I wouldn't have a chance to talk to you.

47
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,530
So, now you know, right? I didn't lose.

48
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:21,364
You could've told me last night.

49
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,081
Well, you assumed I lost...

50
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:27,616
So I didn't want to interrupt.

51
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:28,616
Thanks.

52
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:31,411
For what?

53
00:05:32,546 --> 00:05:34,749
Thank you for putting effort.

54
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:38,748
Thank you for trying this hard.

55
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,382
I intended to say it last night.

56
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,381
Even if you'd lost, I would've thanked you anyway.

57
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:51,177
But you won. Everyone would be so proud of you.

58
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:54,975
Honestly, Lom...

59
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,568
I didn't do it for the faculty.

60
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:59,025
I didn't do it for the uni.

61
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,023
I did it for you.

62
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:03,868
The prize I got is also yours.

63
00:06:03,868 --> 00:06:07,867
I just represented you.

64
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:08,996
Nonsense.

65
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:10,869
You won this by yourself.

66
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:13,387
That's not true.

67
00:06:13,387 --> 00:06:17,013
I was there because you gave up your position for me.

68
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:19,390
You pushed me.

69
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,854
You supported me.

70
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:25,853
I couldn't have done it without you.

71
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,492
For my beloved.

72
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,708
The true Ambassador in my heart.

73
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:01,509
I love you.

74
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,890
I love you too.

75
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,348
What are we doing here?

76
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:40,645
Well, Pha didn't reply to my text.

77
00:10:40,645 --> 00:10:42,935
Wait, calm down.

78
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:46,934
You can't expect him to stay with you all day like
when he was a freshman or a sophomore.

79
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:51,101
He's a grown up now and he's got more responsibilities.

80
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:54,938
You of all people should know that.
You work for your Dad's company.

81
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:57,400
I think I'm reasonable.

82
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,402
But this is too much, man.

83
00:10:59,402 --> 00:11:03,401
He just didn't change a bit. He changed a lot.

84
00:11:05,195 --> 00:11:07,612
And have you talked to him about this?

85
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:09,572
Well, not exactly.

86
00:11:09,572 --> 00:11:10,913
But I said something, so he could think,

87
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:11,597
Mmm.

88
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:14,390
Something like, aren't you gonna stay for a meal?

89
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,390
Aren't you gonna sleep with me again?

90
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,107
And...

91
00:11:16,107 --> 00:11:17,526
That's enough.

92
00:11:17,526 --> 00:11:20,355
Even a fool knows that you're mad now.

93
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:23,017
And I think he does too.

94
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,686
I guess.

95
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:28,096
What if he found a pretty doctor and changed his mind?

96
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:29,874
You're being nonsense.

97
00:11:29,874 --> 00:11:31,660
He's very busy.

98
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,530
And you two have been together for so long,
and you still don't know each other well?

99
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,370
Stop being so dramatic.

100
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,323
Let's go.

101
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,693
Let's spy on him.

102
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:42,572
Like how we spied on him at the faculty.

103
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:45,527
Back then, you spied on him, and I spied on my guy.

104
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:46,502
C'mon.

105
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:48,005
You're just too much.

106
00:11:48,005 --> 00:11:49,005
Too much?

107
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,672
Buddy, why are you wearing shades and a hat?

108
00:11:55,672 --> 00:11:57,375
Why don't you go back and change?

109
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,730
But even if you take those off, you still stand out.

110
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,730
Just do whatever you need to do.

111
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,482
Hello, Mr. Yo, would you like any help?

112
00:12:09,482 --> 00:12:10,526
Er...

113
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,196
Right now, the doctor is in the examine room.

114
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:17,821
And there are full of patients now.

115
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,279
Oh, you can remember me?

116
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,785
Of course, Mr. Yo.

117
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,584
Thank you, then may I be excused?

118
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:25,959
Please.

119
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:26,828
Thank you.

120
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:27,661
Goodbye.

121
00:12:27,661 --> 00:12:30,159
Thank you.

122
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,159
How do you know him?

123
00:12:40,287 --> 00:12:41,955
Why are you hiding?

124
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:43,665
Everyone saw you.

125
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:44,542
Shhh.

126
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:46,920
What?

127
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,430
Do you think Pha is in the room?

128
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,888
I guess so.

129
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,552
He wouldn't be flirting with any girls outside.

130
00:12:53,552 --> 00:12:54,063
Darn you.

131
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:55,811
What?

132
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:59,350
Seriously, he doesn't seem like
he's gonna change his mind.

133
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,475
You think too much.

134
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:01,435
C'mon, let's go.

135
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:02,142
Hey, c'mon, stay.

136
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:03,615
It's a waste of time, let's go.

137
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,621
Don't jump to conclusion.

138
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:06,294
What?

139
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:07,546
Wait.

140
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:08,923
We've been waiting for long. Let's go.

141
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,425
C'mon, a bit more.

142
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:11,425
Oh.

143
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:19,301
Oh, it's on you, then.

144
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,297
Can we go now?

145
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:24,417
No.

146
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,624
Alright, don't forget to take the medicine on time.

147
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:29,624
Alright.

148
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,625
Goodbye.

149
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:38,752
Doctor, a guest is here to see you.

150
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:42,751
Mmm, if it's a pretty girl with great figure...

151
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:46,377
please tell her that I'm busy.

152
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:50,376
Er...if it's pretty girls, then, there are plenty.

153
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:54,336
But I told them that you're busy, so they left.

154
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,290
But there are two more coming.

155
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,211
One of them is Mr. Yo.

156
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:03,210
The other one is quite handsome and stylish.

157
00:14:03,338 --> 00:14:06,137
C'mon, you've seen this handsome doctor everyday...

158
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,265
Are you not used to it yet?

159
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,717
Oh, why didn't you tell me sooner that they're here?

160
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:14,308
Well, you're busy.

161
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:18,105
Mmm, it's fine.

162
00:14:18,105 --> 00:14:21,856
So, which guest should I invite in first?

163
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:25,771
This is the next patient's folder.

164
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,771
And...

165
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,570
Mr. Wayo.

166
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,570
I told you they could recognize you.

167
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,853
Please go see the doctor in the examine room.

168
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:13,154
Pha.

169
00:15:15,987 --> 00:15:16,987
Sit down.

170
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,323
Are you here to see me?

171
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:36,411
Yeah.

172
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:39,076
I saw a lot of girls coming to see you.

173
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,487
I don't know them.

174
00:15:43,487 --> 00:15:47,486
They were hitting on me.

175
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:53,618
Then...

176
00:15:53,618 --> 00:15:54,618
I'll leave.

177
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,450
I have less than 30-minute break.

178
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:04,536
Please stay for a talk.

179
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,615
I have nothing to talk about.

180
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:13,236
Yo.

181
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:29,442
I'm a little mad.

182
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,410
Do you love me less?

183
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:36,001
Or have you changed your mind?

184
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,204
Yo.

185
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:41,138
It's not like that.

186
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,178
Answer me.

187
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:44,221
Why are you quiet?

188
00:16:44,221 --> 00:16:46,183
Why did it take you so long to answer?

189
00:16:46,183 --> 00:16:47,183
Yo.

190
00:16:48,397 --> 00:16:51,228
It's not like that.

191
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:54,105
I have my reasons.

192
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,983
I got a lot of work.

193
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,942
You know that.

194
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:00,858
You've always had lots of work.

195
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:01,976
You said you studied hard.

196
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,472
When you work, you have lots of work to do.

197
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:06,472
You don't care about me.

198
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:10,433
Then can I ask you something?

199
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:19,014
If I'm still like this, can you put up with it?

200
00:17:22,894 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't sleep at the time that you do.

201
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,479
Some days, I won't be able to go home.

202
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:35,281
I won't have time to take you out,

203
00:17:35,281 --> 00:17:36,869
to have a meal together...

204
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:37,911
to watch a movie together...

205
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:39,453
to listen to music together...

206
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,202
like we used to when I was a freshman or a sophomore.

207
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:49,708
If I keep being like this, will you be okay with that?

208
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:52,381
Why are you asking that?

209
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,167
Then, I'll go home first.

210
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:11,882
Yo.

211
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:20,533
If you can't endure it,
do you know what we both will be like?

212
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,895
No.

213
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:53,895
Where is Ming?

214
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:58,776
Wake him up to talk to me.

215
00:19:03,864 --> 00:19:04,864
Where is Yo?

216
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,931
Don't think that we're grown ups,
and I won't dare fight you.

217
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:13,931
Mingkwan.

218
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:25,834
Really?

219
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He hasn't come home.

220
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,126
Where could Yo be?

221
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:39,632
Instagram?

222
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:43,217
Alright, that's it.

223
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:27,909
Pha.

224
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,710
What's up, little brat?

225
00:20:36,543 --> 00:20:37,543
Is it like before?

226
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,039
How?

227
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:47,368
Well, you liked to sit here and watch me play basketball.

228
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:51,915
Right here. It's your favorite spot, isn't it?

229
00:20:52,706 --> 00:20:56,705
And you used to bring me water.

230
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,826
And you never paid attention to me.

231
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:18,773
Right over there.

232
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:22,689
You found a cat, didn't you?

233
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,945
How did you know that?

234
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,407
Of course, I knew.

235
00:21:27,407 --> 00:21:30,948
I'd always noticed you.

236
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:34,947
I got eyes on you.

237
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,208
C'mon.

238
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,796
This is late. Let's head back.

239
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:52,795
What? I came here to sit alone.

240
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,801
If you'd like to go back, then go.

241
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:56,850
Are you crazy?

242
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,779
I came here to pick you up.

243
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:01,321
Let's head back together, alright?

244
00:22:02,243 --> 00:22:03,879
C'mon.

245
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:07,553
You peeked at me and you got me at last.

246
00:22:07,553 --> 00:22:10,269
And still, you're overthinking?

247
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:12,149
How could I not?

248
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:14,149
You don't pay attention to me, Pha.

249
00:22:16,195 --> 00:22:17,195
I do.

250
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,826
I was just testing you.

251
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:22,826
What?

252
00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:27,658
I just pretended that I didn't care about you.

253
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:31,786
But about the time that I don't have, that's for real.

254
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,074
I'm afraid that one day...

255
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:41,074
you won't be okay with it.

256
00:22:42,411 --> 00:22:44,746
And it wouldn't be too late,

257
00:22:44,746 --> 00:22:46,950
if you have a new start.

258
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:47,999
What are you thinking?

259
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,330
Hey, wait, chill, chill, chill.

260
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,329
I've been mad since when you asked me
if I could endure it.

261
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:59,543
You being a doctor...seriously, c'mon,
what were you thinking? Are you nuts?

262
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:03,139
How many years have we been together?

263
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:05,680
How could I not know how you're like?

264
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,098
How could I not endure it?

265
00:23:08,374 --> 00:23:10,583
Er...

266
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,505
Don't start.

267
00:23:13,711 --> 00:23:16,429
I'm mad that you don't pay attention to me.

268
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:19,009
Honestly, why would you do such a thing?

269
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,519
It's a waste of time.

270
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,550
I'm okay with you not having time.

271
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,877
But I'm not okay with you not paying attention to me.

272
00:23:28,294 --> 00:23:32,001
Are we clear?

273
00:23:32,001 --> 00:23:33,001
Yes.

274
00:23:45,784 --> 00:23:46,784
I love you, Yo.

275
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:09,289
C'mon, let's go home.

276
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,743
No.

277
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:13,910
C'mon.

278
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,910
No.

279
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,661
Hurry up, give me a hug, little brat.

280
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:19,871
Come here, don't be stubborn.

281
00:24:19,871 --> 00:24:23,870
Little brat.

282
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:25,378
Don't tease me again.

283
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:26,378
I know that already.

284
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:40,508
Are you back, darling?

285
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:42,508
Mmm. I'm tired.

286
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:48,336
Oh, I miss you!

287
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:51,631
Oh, what's wrong with you?

288
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,799
What's wrong?

289
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:56,640
Well, I got something for you.

290
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,139
What is it?

291
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:00,778
Can I take a rest for today?

292
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:02,981
I'm exhausted.

293
00:25:08,523 --> 00:25:10,523
Why do you close your eyes? Open them!

294
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,894
What's HKT?

295
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:19,274
It's Phuket.

296
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:20,274
Huh?

297
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:21,409
You booked a flight to Phuket?

298
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:22,409
Mmm.

299
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,372
Don't tell me that your parents booked it but can't make it.

300
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:28,709
Are you crazy? I bought it for you.

301
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,994
It's the present for finishing the exam.

302
00:25:30,994 --> 00:25:32,532
Since when?

303
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:34,532
Since our pool villa trip.

304
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:38,567
Really?

305
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:39,448
And when are we going?

306
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:40,321
Tonight.

307
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:41,195
Huh?

308
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:42,195
Tonight!

309
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:43,832
Mmm.

310
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,292
Then, we should hurry and pack our bags.

311
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:48,458
And we'll continue our sweet moment together in Phuket.

312
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:49,163
Why do you make that face?

313
00:25:49,163 --> 00:25:49,665
Go pack your bags!

314
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:50,742
Or we'll miss the flight!

315
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:51,916
Hurry up!

316
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:59,244
I think this Hawaiian shirt is kinda cute.

317
00:25:59,244 --> 00:26:02,412
Would you like to take it?

318
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:04,825
Thanks.

319
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,364
Let's take that too.

320
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,987
And the games too.

321
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:10,527
Take them all.

322
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:14,526
And...RC cars too, so we could play it by the sea, okay?

323
00:26:16,518 --> 00:26:19,812
And, guitar too.

324
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,770
And what else should we bring?

325
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,314
Ming, how could they all fit in a bag?

326
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:28,531
That's quite big. You could take them all.

327
00:26:28,531 --> 00:26:30,243
Take them.

328
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:31,713
Why'd you bring a teddy bear?

329
00:26:32,252 --> 00:26:33,499
So I can hug him.

330
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:37,498
Let's take this car here. Take the teddy bear out.

331
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:00,387
It's pretty nice.

332
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:08,793
Keep it out.

333
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:10,506
Why?

334
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:12,294
I'll continue.

335
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:13,882
Good?

336
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:17,088
Mmm.

337
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
It's gonna be runied.

338
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:22,959
What should I do?

339
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,833
I guess I will be like that too.

340
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:41,517
What's that?

341
00:27:42,347 --> 00:27:43,347
Pha!

342
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,867
Pha has a key to you room?

343
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:49,366
Right, my Mom gave him another copy.

344
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:50,366
Darn!

345
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:54,908
Pha!

346
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:07,544
I...I'll head back.

347
00:28:08,126 --> 00:28:09,635
No need to.

348
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:11,720
It's my cousin's room.

349
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,306
You can stay.

350
00:28:13,306 --> 00:28:14,306
Alright.

351
00:28:17,894 --> 00:28:20,192
I came by to see you.

352
00:28:20,192 --> 00:28:21,988
Auntie Prow is worried.

353
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:25,581
I thought you were gonna be crying and all that.

354
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:26,581
For getting The Ambassador taken away.

355
00:28:29,831 --> 00:28:30,831
Mom—

356
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,592
Next time you come over, knock on the door first.

357
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:40,016
I didn't hear anything from outside.

358
00:28:40,016 --> 00:28:43,191
Do you guys moan at all?

359
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:44,191
Huh?

360
00:28:45,198 --> 00:28:48,078
If you never moaned so loud that next door can hear you,

361
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:52,603
that means you're not doing it well, Tatch.

362
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:56,234
Please consider it your homework.

363
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,654
Alright.

364
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,868
Okay, okay, I'm fine, don't worry.

365
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:04,234
You can go home now.

366
00:29:04,234 --> 00:29:07,395
Alright, alright, I won't be a bother anymore.

367
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:10,394
Do whatever you need to.

368
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:12,894
Alright, so to you, am I alright?

369
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,570
What's alright and what's not?

370
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:24,787
Am I good enough to take care of you bro here?

371
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,130
I'm good-looking, I'm rich
and I'm the uni's ambassador.

372
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:35,836
You already had him.

373
00:29:35,836 --> 00:29:38,836
Why would you show off your qualities now?

374
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,420
If my bro loves someone,
do I have the right to stop him?

375
00:29:50,932 --> 00:29:55,432
Then, you, take a good care of my bro. I count on you.

376
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:06,194
Why so happy?

377
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:08,618
I've gained your cousin's trust.

378
00:30:08,618 --> 00:30:12,620
And it's been the thing I've always wanting to prove.

379
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,673
But...

380
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:17,881
we still have a mission to do.

381
00:30:18,766 --> 00:30:22,025
What mission?

382
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:26,027
To make you scream so loud the next door can hear you.

383
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:26,947
Hey!

384
00:30:26,947 --> 00:30:28,076
Are you crazy?

385
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:28,874
Come here.

386
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,627
Hey, don't, he'll come back!

387
00:30:33,627 --> 00:30:34,627
Relax.

388
00:30:53,178 --> 00:30:57,180
Pha, what's with the cruise in all of a sudden?

389
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,020
Because I have something I need to
ask a permission from you, Yo.

390
00:31:03,231 --> 00:31:05,947
A permission?

391
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,119
And you had to go through all this?

392
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,005
Of course.

393
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:14,837
Hey, Lom!

394
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:16,262
Why are you so late?

395
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:18,392
We're about to leave now.

396
00:31:18,392 --> 00:31:20,138
Oh, hello, Pha and Yo.

397
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:21,060
Hello, hello.

398
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:21,894
Hello.

399
00:31:21,894 --> 00:31:24,901
Why did you call us here?

400
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:26,034
You'll find out.

401
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:27,577
Really.

402
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:30,381
Oh, you're keeping secrets now?

403
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:33,381
You had us all dressed up...

404
00:31:34,553 --> 00:31:35,842
You complained so much.

405
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:37,756
You could jump off the river and go home.

406
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,926
Alright, you, crazy cousin!

407
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:41,727
Right, I am crazy.

408
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:43,062
I was just playing.

409
00:31:43,062 --> 00:31:46,109
Come here, sit down and eat.

410
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:47,109
Yo, give him the glass.

411
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:58,455
So, what do you have in mind?

412
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:01,664
It's a long term thing, Yo.

413
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:04,830
I must wait until you graduate.

414
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,254
What are you up to?

415
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:10,627
Are you gonna study abroad?

416
00:32:10,627 --> 00:32:11,627
No.

417
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:17,335
Yo.

418
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:20,249
When you graduate,

419
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:32,495
will you marry me?

420
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:36,206
Yo!

421
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,961
Don't be quiet.

422
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:38,961
I'm scared.

423
00:33:01,338 --> 00:33:02,338
Yo.

424
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:07,767
I love you, Wayo.

425
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:11,106
I love you, Pha.

426
00:33:11,106 --> 00:33:13,106
Let's stay together forever.

427
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
That's so romantic.

428
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,679
What's wrong with you, Tatch?

429
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:41,489
What is it, Tatch?

430
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:43,787
Normally, I'm not a romantic person.

431
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:45,778
And you know that.

432
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:49,449
I only got sincerity for you.

433
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:52,992
What's wrong with you?

434
00:33:52,992 --> 00:33:54,834
I have a gift for you.

435
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,252
But you need to promise me first,

436
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:58,665
that you'll say you like it;

437
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:01,339
though you may not like it...

438
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,255
Why wouldn't I like it?

439
00:34:03,255 --> 00:34:04,297
I'll like it for sure.

440
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:06,297
Anything that comes from you, I always like it.

441
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:16,785
I hope you'll like it.

442
00:34:16,785 --> 00:34:18,662
What's gotten into you?

443
00:34:18,662 --> 00:34:20,246
Don't be romantic.

444
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:22,241
I'm shy.

445
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:24,622
Man, you're ruining the moment.

446
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:26,666
I thought I could be romantic.

447
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:27,666
C'mon, give me your hand.

448
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,832
Now, it's your turn.

449
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:38,832
Wear it for me.

450
00:34:51,177 --> 00:34:53,380
You'll wear it often, right?

451
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,306
Forever.

452
00:34:54,513 --> 00:34:57,349
And you? Will you wear it often?

453
00:34:57,349 --> 00:35:01,351
I might...wear it for the rest of my life.

454
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:05,726
Could you do that? There's only one ring
and you'll have to wear it for the rest of your life?

455
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:10,743
Then you buy me a lot more.

456
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:13,377
Lom, I love you.

457
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,377
Very much.

458
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:19,001
I love you too.

459
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:57,247
Right, what's with Panon now?

460
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:59,119
Do you know?

461
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,784
Why do you ask?

462
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:04,786
Nothing, I just feel for Parak.

463
00:36:04,993 --> 00:36:08,994
No matter what, they're twin brothers.

464
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,090
Mmm. Rak told me that after what happened...

465
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:17,261
Panon apologized to Parak.

466
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,688
I think they've made things up.

467
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:23,689
Parak told Panon to stay out of our business.

468
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,641
Mmm, that's the way to end it.

469
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,192
Why are you smiling?

470
00:36:39,192 --> 00:36:41,192
Can I not look at my boyfriend and smile?

471
00:36:58,369 --> 00:36:59,369
Tatch.

472
00:37:00,112 --> 00:37:01,112
Yes?

473
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:04,488
Can I ask you for one thing?

474
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,902
You can ask me for anything.

475
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:08,695
I can give them all to you.

476
00:37:08,695 --> 00:37:12,696
If one day, you get bored of me and wanna leave me,

477
00:37:13,656 --> 00:37:15,118
please let me know.

478
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,740
So I can handle it.

479
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,879
Why did you say that?

480
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:23,881
Honestly, you're stuck to me.

481
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:28,962
But I really like the way you are, like this.

482
00:37:28,962 --> 00:37:32,963
But what if one day you change,
what am I supposed to do?

483
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:34,715
I can't leave you, my boyfriend.

484
00:37:34,715 --> 00:37:38,262
My boyfriend is super sweet.

485
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,262
Anyone could say that.

486
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:46,017
Hold on, Lom.

487
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:53,101
Hey, what is that?

488
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,389
Clearly, it's a pocket knife.

489
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:58,806
I know that, but why are you taking it out?

490
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:01,141
Don't tell me that you're gonna cut yourself
and do the blood swear.

491
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:05,021
I'm not gonna do that. It hurts.

492
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,147
Hey, Tatch, don't, don't.

493
00:38:07,147 --> 00:38:08,189
Are you crazy?

494
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:10,811
Have you watched too much of Kwan-Riam?

495
00:38:10,811 --> 00:38:12,811
You, look that way.

496
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:33,460
Take a look at your Instagram,
I've already tagged you.

497
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,460
Hmm?

498
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:47,701
See? I wasn't just saying,
I posted it on Instagram too.

499
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:51,156
Crazy!

500
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,012
Are you really Lomnaw (Cold wind)?

501
00:38:59,012 --> 00:39:00,012
You're not cold.

502
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,975
You're warm.
