1
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,159
Why do you want to become the emperor?

2
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,359
If it is to protect you,

3
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,159
will you believe it?

4
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,599
Yes, I do.

5
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,439
Your Majesty.

6
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,879
It's time to go to court.

7
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,879
Come with me.

8
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,840
You're the Right Minister.

9
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,080
You are supposed to discuss state affairs.

10
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,280
Do you want me to ride into the palace

11
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,000
In this case, I will avoid being known

12
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,759
that I went out of the palace in the middle of the night.

13
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
This is vixen.

14
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,039
The sinister.

15
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,800
Shouldn't you be

16
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
shouldn't you have just come out

17
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,800
In the bed with him?

18
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,759
Why is it raining today?

19
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,159
It's so boring

20
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,840
from Your Highness

21
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,439
I heard that your brother has been

22
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,840
you have been punished to kneel by your brother for two consecutive times.

23
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,960
What do you mean?

24
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,360
I bet that

25
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,800
after the imperial court meeting today,

26
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,319
you have to kneel

27
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,680
In the Imperial Study.

28
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,280
Commander Xue.

29
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,879
What's the situation today?

30
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,039
Why can an evil minister enter the palace on a carriage?

31
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,840
Because His Majesty is in the carriage.

32
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,040
High Priest.

33
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:17,759
These days,

34
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,000
always appear in my mind.

35
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,240
When I was little,

36
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,199
I didn't teach him to practice sword either.

37
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,199
He was the one who taught me.

38
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,319
Brother Xiaoqi.

39
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,759
You finally come to see Yi'er.

40
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,720
My son.

41
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,680
From today on,

42
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,680
you'll join the Dark Pavilion.

43
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,959
On your own.

44
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,560
I hope in two years,

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I can see a brand new South Yi

46
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,319
yi'er.

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,839
Congratulations on your becoming married.

48
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,639
This is the first task I've given you.

49
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,839
Go undercover in Qin's State Uncle's Mansion

50
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,600
to search for evidence of his crime.

51
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,839
I have arranged it properly.

52
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,040
From now on,

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,639
you are Miss Qin Yi who has been wandering around

54
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,240
who was just found.

55
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,839
Yes

56
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,240
but Brother Xiaoqi,

57
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
I've inherited the throne,

58
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,920
from now on,

59
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,680
call me Your Majesty.

60
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,439
For some reason,

61
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,439
since the first time I saw Cang Hanyu

62
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
I have had

63
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,600
this kind of

64
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:27,879
and kind.

65
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
Even the entire court

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,040
are in awe of him,

67
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,240
everyone remained silent in front of him.

68
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,800
But I always

69
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:36,759
this feeling

70
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,399
do you know about previous lives?

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,160
Two stars are gathering.

72
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,839
The wheel of fate has begun to turn.

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,439
Don't be anxious.

74
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,360
To find a solution

75
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,240
to your doubts.

76
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:53,839
to your doubts.
