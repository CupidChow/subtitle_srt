1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,039
Here comes the imperial edict.

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,640
Here is the imperial edict.

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,559
His eldest son Cang Ming is stripped of his title

4
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,000
and order the second son Minghua to be granted the title.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,440
That's all.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,359
Eunuch!

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,079
What...

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,640
Why?

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,039
I don't know either.

10
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,840
This is His Majesty's order.

11
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,359
How could you?

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:49,920
You must have done something

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,079
behind your back.

14
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,479
He took away my throne.

15
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,439
Do you want to die?

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,439
Your Highness.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,280
How can an illegitimate son inherit the title of Duke Duan?

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,439
I don't agree,

19
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,119
I won't agree no matter what.

20
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,280
You don't agree with it?

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,079
How can you not agree?

22
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,560
This is His Majesty's order.

23
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,920
Quarrel with the Emperor if you dare,

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,280
your Majesty,

25
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,760
prince Duan

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,640
he's waiting outside with Childe Ming Hua.

27
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,519
Let Prince Duan come in first.

28
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,359
Yes

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:33,760
my lord.

30
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,480
Long live Your Majesty!

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,640
About my decision to remove Mingqi's title

33
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:41,280
and changed my title to Minghua.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you unhappy about that?

35
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,280
Nothing.

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,519
Your Majesty,

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
according to the law,

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,560
a concubine's son

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,959
to inherit the noble title.

40
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,599
However,

41
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,159
It's His Majesty's decision.

42
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:57,799
I should

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,480
you should follow that.

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,920
But I don't know

45
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,719
why Your Majesty made such a decision.

46
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,120
Both Mingqi and Minghua are my uncle's sons.

47
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,319
You should know

48
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,400
and their temperament.

49
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,719
If you wish the Palace of Duan

50
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,240
fall earlier.

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
I will

52
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,879
I can still let Mingqi be my son.

53
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,159
But I don't like him.

54
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,280
That he has the Palace of Duan

55
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,319
so that he won't be favored by him.

56
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,759
Your Majesty,

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,599
yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,759
Uncle can go home now.

59
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
You don't have to wait for Minghua.

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,159
Please

61
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,360
I'll leave now.

62
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,280
Long live Your Majesty.

63
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,960
Long live the Emperor!

64
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,759
Minghua.

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,439
Do you know

66
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,400
why I promoted you?

67
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,400
I don't know.

68
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,000
It is conditional

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,240
the noble title of Second Prince.

70
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
I have a question for you.

71
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,919
Do you only want the Crown Prince's position

72
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,599
or do you want the power

73
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,199
and become

74
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,919
of Palace Duan.

75
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,879
I want real power,

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
please tell me clearly.

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,759
That Minghua

78
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,680
he's willing to serve you.

79
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,919
I won't dare to disobey.

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,039
My lord,

81
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,719
he's been on his knees for a day and a night.

82
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,560
Palace of Duan's illegitimate son who isn't even on his clan's list

83
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,520
what do you think

84
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,319
your Majesty, what do you mean?

85
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,560
What else can it be?

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,479
Apparently, you let me resign and go home.

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,000
And they send a white

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,159
to trip me up again.

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,000
And spying on me.

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
Who made you kneel for the whole night.

91
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,960
It's my fault.

92
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,759
His Majesty asked you to be a servant

93
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,159
and become a servant.

94
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,800
Are you willing to do that?

95
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,879
He's got grievances.

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,080
If you don't want to accept the reality,

97
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,120
I picked it up

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,039
to defeat me.

99
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,040
The strongest one

100
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,079
never needs pity or alms from others.

101
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,879
By our own efforts

102
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,000
on their own.

103
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,839
One day,

104
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
I will become stronger

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,920
recognized by father,

106
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,720
and recognized by all of you.

107
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,040
We have a deal, Cang Xiaoqi!

108
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,879
The loser will be my disciple.

109
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,360
Learn sword with me.

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,920
Call Master.

111
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,720
Remember, when you haven't done anything wrong,

112
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:51,879
you don't have to kneel down.

113
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,319
This...

114
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,800
When did this happen?

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:54,160
When did this happen?
