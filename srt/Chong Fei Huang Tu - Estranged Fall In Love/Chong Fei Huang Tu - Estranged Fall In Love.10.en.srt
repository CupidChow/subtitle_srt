1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,519
I'll pay you ten times the price for drinks tonight.

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,239
But if you lose,

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,839
this building is mine.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,079
Come on.

5
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:32,679
From Your Highness!

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,479
This hand.

7
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,920
How about I bet with you?

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,719
The stake is

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,640
Is your life.

10
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,600
Who are you?

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,679
Why do I...

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,159
Sorry, Fourth Miss.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,759
My lady has had an accident.

14
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,159
Please save her.

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,679
She's your mistress.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,679
Why is Qin Jingshu here?

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,679
Yes

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,159
because Li Wang is here.

19
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,200
Since Li Wang called off her engagement,

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,520
hoping Li Wang could change his mind.

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,760
I'm busy. I don't have the time.

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,239
Please save her.

23
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,760
I'm willing to be your servant.

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,959
Please save her.

25
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:09,959
Where is it?

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,239
You take him first.

27
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,000
I...

28
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:26,879
This...

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,359
The King of Li Si.

30
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,519
Let's play together.

31
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,319
Okay, come on.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,359
That was

33
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,760
fourth sister.

34
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,439
Somebody help me!

35
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,799
Please save me.

36
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,760
Qin Yi, you fox spirit.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,319
The room was poisoned.

38
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,799
Just enjoy the feeling

39
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,560
being served by others.

40
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,680
Little beauty.

41
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,599
To be innocent or to live with me?

42
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,240
Of course it's for my life.

43
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,879
Your innocence

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
less than

45
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,919
than the whores in the building

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,599
why are you here?

47
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,280
Don't you explain yourself first?

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't mention it.

49
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,919
It's a pity that

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't accompany His Majesty

51
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,680
to see the lanterns.

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,159
Not at all.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,360
We're just in time.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,399
It's been so many years.

55
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,439
The lanterns on the Lantern Festival

56
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,360
haven't changed at all.

57
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,079
Pretty.

58
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,879
My heart for Yi'er

59
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,439
has never changed.

60
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
Yi'er,

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,959
sleep with me for a while.

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,040
Later in the court,

63
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,879
we'll leave separately.

64
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,800
That's not good.

65
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,079
When Your Majesty brought me back yesterday,

66
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
I was wearing a dress.

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,240
I need to go back and change.

68
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,560
Alright then.

69
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,399
Then let's meet in the morning meeting.

70
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,600
See you later.

71
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,680
See you later.

72
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,079
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

73
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,959
Your wish will come true.

74
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,079
Rongchu Xiu,

75
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,680
why is it suddenly feeling a bit cold?

76
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
Why don't you prepare Southern Minister's clothes

77
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,240
prepare Southern Minister's clothes for Yi'er in my imperial chamber?

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,279
This...

79
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,279
Aunty.

80
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,480
What about

81
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,879
cousin, do you have any good news?

82
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,480
That's indeed good news.

83
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,079
The monarchs of the neighboring states

84
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:41,079
knowing that we had the map,

85
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,000
and is willing to lend us the troops.

86
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,160
But they

87
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,680
they want to talk to me face to face.

88
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,279
That's great!

89
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,040
Your birthday party in a few days,

90
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,759
will be a good opportunity.

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,279
When that time comes,

92
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,439
ask the ministers to write a joint letter

93
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,879
to send Ze'er back to the capital to celebrate her birthday.

94
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,160
Aren't you afraid that Cang Han Yu won't allow it?

95
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,079
Your Highness.

96
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,600
Our scout reported that

97
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,480
last night,

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,759
fourth Miss of the Qin family.

99
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,079
Stay and sleep with the dragon.

100
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,399
How could this happen?

101
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
Isn't she supposed to be

102
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,000
and South Minister have arranged a marriage.

103
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,800
To have Right Minister and Emperor at the same time.

104
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,800
It seems that Elder Brother's daughter

105
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,839
to be a whore.

106
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,360
to be a whore.
