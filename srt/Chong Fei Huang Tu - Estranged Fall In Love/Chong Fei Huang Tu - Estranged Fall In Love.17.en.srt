1
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,880
Yes

2
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,679
I placed the poison.

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,079
Because I didn't want you out of the palace.

4
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,160
You thought you could stop me?

5
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,519
Son,

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
all I want is for you to be the empress,

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,440
and stay by my side.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,839
Why are you resisting me so much?

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,200
Remember this.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,399
Never marry him.

11
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,640
Have you forgotten your motto about the Empress?

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,119
The Imperial Palace of Luan.

13
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,359
Which of these four words

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,000
are relevant to me.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,840
I won't care.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,119
Only you

17
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,039
with me.

18
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,719
I will appoint a queen.

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,359
The Imperial Household Department.

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,119
The imperial edict is proposed.

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,840
The four daughters of the Qin family, Qin Yi,

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,759
virtuous and virtuous,

23
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,560
she is elegant and graceful

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,359
kind in nature.

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,840
And is a model for all women.

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,759
She'll be entitled to Consort Luan.

27
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,560
From tomorrow on,

28
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,079
to Weiyang Palace from tomorrow.

29
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,480
Your Majesty, please do as you wish.

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,040
I will leave now.

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,840
To the south.

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,159
You dare to step out of the imperial chamber.

33
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
You will regret.

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,239
Your Majesty.

35
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,920
No matter His Majesty really wants to die,

36
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,319
or if I become soft-hearted,

37
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,840
I can tell you that

38
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,920
these threats are useless to me.

39
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,560
Your Majesty, what do you want?

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,680
I'll drink with you.

41
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,799
South Yi.

42
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,159
Do you really think I let you do whatever you want?

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,120
You don't care about my life?

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,879
Then don't you care about

45
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,359
your subordinates?

46
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,040
How dare you?

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
As long as I can keep you around,

48
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,920
I will do whatever it takes

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,200
both of you...

50
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,560
Please calm down,

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,280
alright?

52
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,319
Your Majesty.

53
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,680
You should know

54
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,680
you shouldn't have kept me around.

55
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,680
The Empress Dowager's birthday banquet is around the corner.

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,759
At that time,

57
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,960
all states came to court

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,759
I heard that the two princesses

59
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,159
from West Xinjiang State,

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,719
there's a Luan character

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,840
has the character Luan in it

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,840
and it's named Phoenix (Luan Moon).

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,639
She should

64
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,919
she is the perfect match for His Majesty.

65
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,960
There's only one good match for me,

66
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,759
and that is you.

67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:30,479
Rong Chu Xiu,

68
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:31,159
why are you standing there?

69
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:31,960
The imperial edict.

70
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,840
Don't go!

71
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,759
Help

72
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
who can control these two ancestors?

73
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm all

74
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
greetings, Mother.

75
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,080
Son,

76
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,159
wake up!

77
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,520
Son.

78
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
We're finally reunited

79
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,439
are finally reunited.

80
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,360
But now,

81
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,240
the map of the arsenal has been destroyed.

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,719
We also lost

83
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,520
to negotiate with the other states.

84
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,960
Unexpectedly, Qin Yi

85
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:16,680
Is just a pawn placed by the emperor in Qin House.

86
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,960
I was too careless.

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
And the assassination of Cang Han Yu

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,719
Is very strange.

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,960
I suspect there is a big conspiracy.

90
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,360
He might want to frame us

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,560
and take the opportunity to make troubles.

92
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560
What should I do?

93
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,639
After what has happened,

94
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,000
we can only wait and see.

95
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,520
As long as Princess Royal is alive,

96
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:43,639
he won't dare to

97
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,319
won't dare to attack us.

98
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,319
We've been in the Wu Dynasty for two days.

99
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,879
Why haven't we met the Emperor?

100
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,439
My lord.

101
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,560
To prevent us from entering the palace

102
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,560
and prevent us from entering the palace?

103
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,240
Little princess, why are you so anxious?

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,439
When the time comes,

105
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,319
when it's time.

106
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,280
He should see you.

107
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,680
To meet you?

108
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,280
Your Highness,

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,120
this is questioning him.

110
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,879
Sorry.

111
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,719
She's young and insensible.

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,319
She was rude,

113
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,240
please forgive her.

114
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,480
This is the first time

115
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,160
entered the capital without being called.

116
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,639
It's our fault.

117
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,560
If

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,279
your Majesty is busy with official duties.

119
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,920
We can rest in the inn next door

120
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,519
we can rest for a few more days.

121
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,120
I've heard that there are two Prime Ministers in our country.

122
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,360
The Left Minister.

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,560
Don't you feel embarrassed to be called Second Minister

124
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,879
aren't you ashamed?

125
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,600
Hey.

126
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,519
Shut up.

127
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,759
The princess has provoked me repeatedly.

128
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,560
You think I can't do this to you?

129
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,120
Please forgive me.

130
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,879
I apologize to him

131
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,839
I apologize to Prime Minister.

132
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,519
It won't happen

133
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,920
this won't happen again.

134
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,879
I'm not

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,879
I wouldn't have dared to

136
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,959
square accounts in every detail

137
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,839
however,

138
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,759
discrediting Southern Minister

139
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,279
your Majesty might not forgive her.

140
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,959
Princess Luanyue.

141
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,040
Do what you think is right, but you will have to do whatever it takes.

142
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,439
Then

143
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,519
I won't bother you.

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,959
Good bye.

145
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:47,959
You fool!

146
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
You can't accomplish anything but make trouble.

147
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,879
Then I'll go to the palace.

148
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,040
Don't go.

149
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,079
I don't want to

150
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,439
yes, Qing.

151
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,439
The little princess,

152
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,120
the eldest princess is going to this far.

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
She didn't even allow you to attend the palace banquet.

154
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,519
How can you meet His Majesty then?

155
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,079
I did it on purpose.

156
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,759
She wanted to commit suicide in the palace.

157
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,439
I don't want to die with her.

158
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,560
Not the palace?

159
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,360
Just what I want. Let's go.

160
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,120
The little princess in Western Xinjiang

161
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,759
she's interesting.

162
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:15,759
she's interesting.
