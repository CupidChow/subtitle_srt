1
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:18,079
Your Majesty,

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,839
that's a heavy punishment.

3
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,920
In the future,

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,120
nobody would dare to utter a single word in the imperial court.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,640
Any outsiders

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,320
he will be furious and thunderbolt.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,719
For our little ancestor,

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,240
he was removed from his official position.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,079
But she's actually

10
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,079
you just want her to go home and support the baby.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,079
South Yi.

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,359
Do you have to abort him?

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,159
What else?

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,679
Dong Hua said that I'll pay for being reborn.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,880
We can't be in love.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,600
We won't be married.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,000
Or see the bridal headpiece and wedding robes.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,520
♪ He said we shouldn't be together ♪

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,679
Otherwise, we'll be punished by fate.

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,560
Can't we

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,759
we can't be so irresponsible

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,840
Irresponsibly

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,200
and show up in the world.

24
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,479
Do you understand

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm sorry, Yi'er.

27
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,280
It's all my fault.

28
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,200
I have no right to blame you.

29
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,920
It's your choice.

30
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,480
We can't love each other, but we can stay together.

31
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,879
I never believe in fate.

32
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,560
My son.

33
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,680
No one should be born in this world.

34
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:41,439
We didn't see babies

35
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,439
we didn't see the baby.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
Do you really bear to see it?

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,479
Yi'er,

38
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,800
trust me.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,280
I promise that

40
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,680
no one will harm you

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
who can harm you and the baby.

42
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,080
Please stand up.

43
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,520
Princess Nanjia,

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,080
you are wronged.

45
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,439
As long as you're willing to cooperate with me,

46
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,479
I promise I won't mistreat you.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,879
How can I help you?

48
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,719
Very simple.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,120
Be my messenger.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
And unite with Blue Moon,

51
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:00,800
forced the emperor?

52
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,240
And the regicide.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,280
Lanyue is just a small state.

54
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,280
Even if you hate Cang Hanyu

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,479
because of Princess Wuya,

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,280
she is powerless to fight against Wu Chao.

57
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,599
Don't worry.

58
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,919
I have my own ways.

59
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,680
Congratulations on your new appointment.

60
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,800
Lord Cang...

61
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,879
Sister Su Yi.

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,400
Stop teasing me.

63
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,960
Is the Supervisor of Hidden Boudoir

64
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,280
the Head of Hidden Boudoir?

65
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,680
My lord.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,960
Yi'er, walk slowly.

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,360
Be careful, baby. Don't talk too much.

68
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,800
I told you not to come over.

69
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,400
Please get up.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
No need.

71
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,319
You'll be the new Supervisor of Hidden Vault.

72
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,080
Congratulations.

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,159
Thank you

74
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,639
and His Majesty.

75
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,599
You fought hard for it.

76
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,639
There is another person who wants to see you.

77
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,560
Father.

78
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,680
Good boy.

79
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,319
You're finally successful.

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,279
Alright.

81
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,120
Stop here.

82
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,279
We will still see each other

83
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,319
In the court tomorrow.

84
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,879
Father.

85
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,160
Father!

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,279
Father!

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
Father.

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,839
Your Highness.

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,000
What do you want?

90
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,399
My Lord,

91
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,879
I want to cooperate with you.

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,720
And share the world with you later.

93
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,480
What will you do?

94
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,639
Interested in this.

95
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,800
If I tell you

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,160
I know who is the murderer

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,079
of your father?

98
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,720
What did you say

99
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,439
this dagger

100
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,480
and the one

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,040
the knife that killed your father

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,079
were supposed to be a pair.

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,319
It was when Cang Hanyu

104
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,079
to protect me and Nan Yi,

105
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,920
this dagger is made of

106
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,000
a dagger made of this material.

107
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,040
With this material.

108
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,279
It seems

109
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,839
he really puts you up to the wall.

110
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:19,639
You'll sell your life for Hidden Pavilion!

111
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,199
What about

112
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,240
are you interested in joining now?

113
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,680
Chief Steward of Hidden Boudoir.

114
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,879
Alright.

115
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,519
I'm in.
