1
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,320
Got it.

2
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,719
Let His Majesty know.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
If what it says in the letter is true,

4
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:43,840
I will

5
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,719
thank him very much.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,640
I will leave now.

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,359
Go now.

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,159
Invite Prime Minister Nan to the palace.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,680
your Highness.

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,439
Stand up.

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,079
Bestow a seat to watch tea.

14
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

15
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,959
I need something from you.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,079
I have a daughter who has been missing for 18 years,

17
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,599
according to my knowledge,

18
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:36,959
It should be hidden in the Hidden Boudoir.

19
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
You've been in charge of Hidden Boudoir for so many years.

20
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,879
Please help me

21
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,719
be sure to find my daughter.

22
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,640
How can the Princess Royal's daughter

23
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,959
how can she be in the Hidden Boudoir?

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,319
This is a long story.

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,560
Back then,

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,319
I made great contributions to help the late emperor ascend the throne

27
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,959
to help the late emperor ascend the throne.

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,159
They made use of the Crown Prince to hide himself.

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
In the imperial palace.

30
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,159
With a few exceptions.

31
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,680
After I lost my daughter,

32
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,239
her uncle

33
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,959
she can be said to be very loved.

34
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,599
He still took her away

35
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,840
by giving her the title of the princess,

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,759
and never return.

37
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,759
The late emperor was meticulous

38
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,520
and I was afraid of him.

39
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,400
So these are the only clues

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,240
these are the only clues I have.

41
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,439
My daughter is hidden in the Hidden Pavilion.

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,680
Not as your Princess Royal,

43
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm asking you as her mother.

44
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,159
To ask Prime Minister Nan

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,360
find my daughter for me.

46
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,159
OK?

47
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,120
If what you said is true,

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,159
she is in the Hidden Boudoir now.

49
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,960
I will do my best to investigate it

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,560
and help you find your daughter.

51
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,560
Thank you.

52
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,159
Your Majesty, don't you think

53
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,840
for an important matter.

54
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,120
May I ask what is it?

55
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,439
To be here.

56
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,400
Have a child?

57
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,879
Isn't that important?

58
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,720
Your Majesty, have you taken something wrong today?

59
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,439
I'm serious.

60
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:26,959
Now that you're leaving,

61
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,959
keep me a baby

62
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,920
of my son.

63
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,879
Your Majesty, you'd better not daydream.

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,879
Then you won't leave.

65
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
You can't stop me.

66
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
At least now,

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,360
you haven't left yet, right?

68
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,680
What are you doing?

69
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,399
How long are you going to keep an eye on me, Your Majesty?

70
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,920
Your son is beautiful.

71
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,199
I can't see enough.

72
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,040
So Your Majesty

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
the Emperor already knew

74
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,000
suyi is the Princess Royal's daughter.

75
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,439
Right.

76
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Because Princess Royal is the regent Princess,

77
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
she has never had any relations

78
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,199
relationships with friends and relatives

79
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
and Rong Chu Xiu

80
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,279
he's with me.

81
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,040
He and Suyi

82
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,079
the boy and girl are innocent playmates

83
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,399
and we've known each other for a long time.

84
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,639
That's why

85
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,680
I didn't tell her.

86
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,399
Understood.

87
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
That His Majesty didn't tell the Princess Royal.

88
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,600
Because he's worried

89
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,560
once Suyi is made princess,

90
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
princess Royal,

91
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,160
to end your marriage.

92
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,720
I know you well.

93
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,560
I didn't expect His Majesty is such a

94
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,759
a kind person

95
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,519
and considerate person.

96
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
Yi'er,

97
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,680
It's my bad.

98
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,199
I always thought

99
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:49,000
I hope it's not a bad thing.

100
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,360
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

101
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,279
You already

102
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,399
you've already known it,

103
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,160
It's up to you to decide

104
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:57,000
how to reply to her.

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll take the bad guys.

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,399
You

107
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,199
I also like to be a bad guy.

108
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,279
Can't you see

109
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
aren't you ashamed?

110
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Go to

111
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,279
and report to Her Highness

112
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,600
that I've found out about it.

113
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:32,720
Her daughter

114
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,799
entered the Hidden Chamber at an early age

115
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,879
and died tragically.

116
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,279
She is dead.

117
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Understood.

118
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,879
Plain Clothes.

119
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,440
Master, are you

120
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,080
you really like My Lord?

121
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,080
Your Excellency Rong,

122
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,279
of course I like it.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,720
Back then,

124
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,039
when I was in Hidden Boudoir,

125
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,639
without a good foundation.

126
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,039
If it wasn't for him,

127
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,480
I'd be kicked out of

128
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,879
from the Hidden Boudoir!

129
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,840
And also

130
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,720
he bought me candied haws

131
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,200
for me since I was little.

132
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,039
You were bought by a few bunch of gourds.

133
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,919
Too bad she's Your Highness!

134
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,240
A family of scholars.

135
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,559
You're still a maid.

136
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
As a maid.

137
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
Even if she wants to marry you later,

138
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,559
he might not marry you.

139
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,679
But it's OK.

140
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a relationship thing.

141
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,440
Cherish the present.

142
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,279
Seize every minute

143
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,000
I think

144
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,879
as long as I can be like this

145
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,759
yes, I can.

146
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,840
Every day

147
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:44,960
every day.

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,840
Can

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,159
being with him

150
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,600
Is already great.

151
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Oh, right, master.

152
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,559
You have been sleeping a lot recently.

153
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,600
This can't go on.

154
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,039
You'll be bored.

155
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,240
Did you and His Majesty

156
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,279
quarreling again?

157
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,759
Let's go to the market to get some fresh air.

158
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,320
Nothing.

159
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,279
He's

160
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,960
he has behaved himself a lot.

161
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,679
It's fine. Let's go.

162
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,759
Come on.

163
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,960
My lord!

164
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,759
My son.
