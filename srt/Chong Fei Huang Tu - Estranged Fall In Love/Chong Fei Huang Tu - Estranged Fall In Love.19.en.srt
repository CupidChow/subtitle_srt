1
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:00,600
Your Majesty.

2
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,640
Did you punish Princess Lanyue

3
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
Is too harsh?

4
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,000
Are you pretending to be dumb

5
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,640
or you can't figure it out?

6
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,159
It's hard to predict Jun's mind.

7
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,640
I wouldn't know that.

8
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,840
I just thought

9
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,319
will His Majesty be too cruel?

10
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,439
And demoted the pretty princess

11
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,560
Into slavery.

12
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,959
And threatened to destroy her hometown.

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,760
Instead of hacking them into pieces,

14
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,400
by not cutting them into pieces.

15
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Over ten years ago,

16
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,439
If I hadn't brought you to the military dynasty,

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
and Lanyue is your hometown now.

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,640
That's right.

19
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,760
But now,

20
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,159
I thought you brought me here.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,239
Yi'er is teasing me again.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,000
Even though

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,959
I have changed your destiny,

24
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,400
dan'er,

25
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,040
blue moon is blue moon.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,040
The country that betrayed you

27
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,439
that forced you to die.

28
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,519
In the last life,

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,000
In this life,

30
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:10,840
I won't be soft on them.

31
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,439
Cang Xiaoqi,

32
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,719
come here.

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,759
Cang Han Yu,

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,240
thank you for loving me.

35
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,240
However,

36
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,159
I won't be your concubine

37
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,319
and marry you.

38
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,599
From the south.

39
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,479
You are such a liar.

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,479
You are just a lowly servant.

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,439
You weren't even able to carry my shoes back then.

42
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,960
Why now

43
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,400
how come all eyes are on you?

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,039
You even want to take away

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,560
my brother Yu.

46
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,759
Why did you come out?

47
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,599
Where's His Majesty?

48
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,120
His Majesty is still sleeping.

49
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,159
He hasn't been resting

50
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,719
he hasn't had a good rest.

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Not to let anyone disturb him.

52
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,400
Lord Nan,

53
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,199
where are you going?

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,159
This is

55
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,919
Is your crowning ceremony.

56
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,840
I have things to do.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,039
I'll be back soon.

58
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,919
My lord.

59
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,719
Our mansion is surrounded by martial arts masters.

60
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,520
I've done some research.

61
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,919
She's with Princess Nanjia.

62
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,599
So that I can't participate in the Crowning Ceremony.

63
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,479
I'll grant her my wish.

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,120
It's the blessed moment.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
From Consort Luan.

66
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,840
Consort Luan!

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,879
Consort Luan, receive the imperial edict.

68
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,839
By the grace of heaven's will, Her Majesty hereby proclaims that

69
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,079
qin Si, the Fourth Young Lady of the Qin family,

70
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,480
quiet, gentle, delicate and agile.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,720
Elegant, quiet, refined, and virtuous.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,839
Rou Jiawei is a great comfort to me.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,519
She'll now be entitled Consort Luan.

74
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,519
That's all.

75
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

76
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,720
Raise your head.

77
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,920
Before I say it again.

78
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,240
This...

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
It's Princess Nanjia.

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
Why is it Nanjia?

81
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,079
I don't know.

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
Where's Yi'er?

83
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:27,920
His Majesty just

84
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,600
granted me the title of Consort Luan.

85
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,240
I'm conferring the title of Qin Yi, the fourth daughter of the Qin family.

86
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,720
But I am the one who received the imperial edict.

87
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,480
Guard!

88
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,079
To escort Princess Nanjia back.

89
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:37,959
Yes

90
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,839
take off her clothes

91
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,199
and burn her.

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Brother Yu.

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,519
Why can't you look at me?

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm the one who loves you.

95
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,519
Why are you so heartless?

96
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,360
After all,

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,560
I shall leave now.

98
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,279
I'll leave now.

99
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,319
This is

100
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,399
In the crowning ceremony,

101
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
and stood His Majesty up.

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,879
She's really unprecedented.

103
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,120
He's crossed the line.

104
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:16,879
That's right.

105
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,319
The Third Division

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,879
and invite six provinces.

107
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,120
He didn't show up

108
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,199
you are really not giving me face.

109
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Your Majesty,

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,079
as for Prime Minister Nan,

111
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,920
you know

112
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,199
he is aloof

113
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,240
he doesn't like lively places.

114
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
Can you be understanding?

115
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
And calm down.

116
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,639
Just punish him lightly.

117
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,399
A stumble may prevent a fall

118
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,920
what are you two fools talking about?

119
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,680
Why did I bring you here?

120
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,439
Yi'er is mad at me now.

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,240
She wants to leave?

122
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,319
I've told you very clearly.

123
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,079
No, you have to do it.

124
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,079
Did you listen to my words?

125
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,240
Great.

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,800
I really want to marry you.

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,600
That's impossible.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Why?

129
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,519
Why is it impossible?

130
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,120
You also love me.

131
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,720
Why do you refuse to marry me?

132
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,399
I...

133
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Remember that

134
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,920
never marry him.

135
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,319
Cang Hanyu

136
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,759
I don't love you

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,120
Isn't that close to you?

138
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,639
What?

139
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,639
You're taking it seriously?

140
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,639
I don't believe you.

141
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,199
I don't believe you would be so ruthless.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,800
Yi'er,

143
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,800
we've suffered so much

144
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
to have what we are today.

145
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,319
Why do we still torture each other?

146
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,319
Our agreement is still valid.

147
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,920
I taught Cang Ming Hua

148
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,519
he's already taken over the management.

149
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,519
I will resign and return home.

150
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,720
I...

151
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,800
I just came to tell you

152
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,879
In any case

153
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,039
I won't give you up.

154
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,840
I just want to know

155
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,120
are there any ways

156
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,000
to stop Yi'er from leaving?

157
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,440
Your Majesty.

158
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,559
How about

159
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,799
another hole in our heart?

160
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,799
I'll stab you in your heart.

161
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
By the way, Your Majesty,

162
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:55,720
we should

163
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,440
like the Soft Muscle Powder last time,

164
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,840
make some poison

165
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,519
for Miss Nan.

166
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,320
Exactly.

167
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,799
The kind that will cause amnesia.

168
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,679
Enough. Enough.

169
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,080
What kind of ideas do you have?

170
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
How can I poison

171
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,919
can she be poisoned again?

172
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,679
In my opinion,

173
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,240
prime Minister Nan.

174
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:14,279
Hasn't she said

175
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,000
after the handover?

176
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,279
We gave her a lot of work.

177
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,440
But I was too tired to do anything about her.

178
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:31,240
You're already so humble.

179
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,879
What a degeneracy!

180
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
We will find someone

181
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,600
someone who can persuade her.

182
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,919
Rong Chu Xiu,

183
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,080
go to the Princess Royal's mansion now

184
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,519
to send me something.
