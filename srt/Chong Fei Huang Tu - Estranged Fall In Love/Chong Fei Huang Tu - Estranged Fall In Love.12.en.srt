1
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,719
Stop!

2
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:52,600
Stop!

3
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,200
Stop!

4
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,680
The moment

5
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,239
Is finally coming.

6
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,680
You and I

7
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,239
and our relationship ended

8
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,319
and are no longer with each other.

9
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,319
My child.

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,120
Yi'er,

11
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,680
master.

12
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,159
You are awake.

13
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,560
You remember now.

14
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,680
The action plan we made

15
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,479
In our plan of action.

16
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,680
However,

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,080
to punish myself.

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,560
If I hadn't arrived in time,

19
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,120
you would have been dead.

20
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,680
What exactly is going on?

21
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
You really are my Master?

22
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,280
How could you be my master?

23
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,520
Those pictures,

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,759
what's with that?

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,280
Your previous life

26
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
or to be more accurate,

27
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,360
It's the last version

28
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
the last version.

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,639
The previous version.

30
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,280
Don't worry.

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,719
Just remember this.

32
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,840
To restart your life

33
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,439
just once.

34
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,560
In this life,

35
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,199
you're the powerful Right Minister,

36
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,000
you were the Emperor,

37
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,960
but over thousands of people.

38
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,400
You can be strong

39
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,840
and can live freely.

40
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,120
But why was it restarted?

41
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,280
It's you.

42
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,759
Of course it wasn't me.

43
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,240
Other people.

44
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,639
They asked me to cast magic tricks

45
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
to be reborn in this life.

46
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,240
Who?

47
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,839
Who else can it be?

48
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,040
To be a man

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,759
to feel regretful.

50
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,040
He will be here soon.

51
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,240
I'll leave him

52
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,240
later on.

53
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,560
The secret of God can't be talked too much.

54
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,959
And south to south.

55
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,519
I want to remind you

56
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,839
the cost of turning back time

57
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,759
Is very expensive.

58
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,959
In this life,

59
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,759
you are destined to accompany each other with misfortune.

60
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,000
Remember that

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,759
never marry him.

62
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,120
My son...

63
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Son?

64
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
Son?

65
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,759
My son!

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,319
Yi'er, are you all right?

67
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,279
What's up

68
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,240
what's going on?

69
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,079
Sorry.

70
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,399
I was late.

71
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,319
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,600
Why did you have to be so stupid?

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
Why did you risk your life?

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
If something bad happened to you,

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
me? How did you find me?

76
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,199
I have added

77
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,839
Into your hair clasp.

78
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:41,199
He found you through his dog training.

79
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,399
I'm tired.

80
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,800
I'll leave now.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,800
Yi'er,

82
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,160
don't follow me.

83
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:55,879
Yi'er.

84
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,160
Is it because

85
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,040
something wrong?

86
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,959
Cang Han Yu?

87
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,800
You lied to me all this time.

88
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,079
We knew each other in a previous life.

89
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,560
I lost my child in the previous life.

90
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,439
Being betrayed by the whole nation as a gift

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
and was forced to commit suicide.

92
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,199
It was all your fault.

93
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,600
Yi'er,

94
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,079
you remember everything now.

95
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,000
How could you arrange for this?

96
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,160
You abandoned me in your previous life,

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,839
but in this life, you're so affectionate.

98
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,040
That's not the case, Si.

99
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,560
That's not true.

100
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:46,800
Your love

101
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,600
your love is too selfish.

102
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:53,000
You've never truly loved me.

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,480
You're just trying to satisfy your regrets.

104
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:53,680
You're just trying to satisfy your regrets.
