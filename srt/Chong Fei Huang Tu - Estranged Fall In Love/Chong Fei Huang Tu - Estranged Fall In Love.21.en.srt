1
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,960
You're really pregnant?

2
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,559
You are really something.

3
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,559
Not to get married.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,280
You got pregnant with him.

5
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,760
You once told me

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,840
In this life,

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,320
If I marry him,

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,640
I will be punished by God.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,079
Then if we have a child,

10
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,359
what will happen to this child?

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,280
I can't calculate.

12
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,320
But being born again

13
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,159
Is against the heaven.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,079
So in this life,

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,479
the more you wish for,

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,359
the more they can't dream of.

17
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:00,840
If you insist on something,

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,960
the wheel of doom will collapse.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,480
Will be destroyed.

20
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,959
Do you understand

21
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:07,760
so,

22
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,239
In this lifetime,

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,319
no one can marry him.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,879
This child

25
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,920
come to such a wrong place.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Come, Yi'er.

27
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,959
The new royal chef makes this.

28
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,519
Your favorite braised pork.

29
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,560
What's wrong, Si'er?

30
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,439
Right?

31
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,640
You don't like the dishes?

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,560
My son.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,359
My son.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,640
What's the matter?

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,640
I need the imperial doctor to check on you.

36
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,239
Let go of me.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,719
I'm fine.

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,560
Don't call me to sleep with you anymore.

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
My lord.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,759
It's been so many days.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,639
No matter how you ignore His Majesty,

42
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,240
eat some anyway.

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Otherwise your baby

44
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,240
I won't.

45
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,719
Take it away.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,759
Honey.

47
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,439
What should Mother do to you?

48
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,439
By the way, master.

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,960
This is the invitation from Princess Nanjia,

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,159
what is it?

51
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,280
To the palace for a banquet.

52
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,439
I won't go.

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,639
But...

54
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,280
Princess Nanjia even said

55
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,520
If you don't show up,

56
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,080
she will come to invite you in person.

57
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:01,400
Come on.

58
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm angry and I don't have any space.

59
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,159
Please tell me

60
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,960
why have you been in such a bad mood recently?

61
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,240
Why do you dislike me so much?

62
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,240
Maybe they are

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,960
his Majesty is too unrestrained.

64
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
And got a guy

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,080
It's so hard to pull him out.

66
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,560
Come on.

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Has Prime Minister Nan

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,960
lately,

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,039
to His Majesty.

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,159
Nothing unusual.

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
We go to court every day

72
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,639
Investigating cases.

73
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,159
Offend people in the capital

74
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,159
Influential and influential officials in the capital city.

75
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,439
If there's really something wrong,

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,919
just a while ago,

77
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,960
minister Nan often went to see the Chief Priest.

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,280
High Priest?

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,599
Call them.

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,159
I'll go right away.

81
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,960
Your Highness,

82
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,159
you invited me to a feast.

83
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,319
That's it?

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,560
Isn't that a little too shabby?

85
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
It doesn't matter who you are,

86
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,079
I'm asking you for the last time,

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,160
If you can leave the capital city

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,319
leave Brother Yu?

89
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,759
And get lost.

90
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,360
Sorry

91
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,079
I'm never threatened by anyone.

92
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,040
Take care.

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,160
Stop!

94
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,319
Come!

95
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:43,959
Help

96
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,959
help

97
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,639
I promised Prime Minister Nan

98
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
that I wouldn't tell anyone

99
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,680
the news of her pregnancy.

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,480
Why are you telling me it now?

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,560
Because you're the emperor.

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
No one dares

103
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,040
would dare to disobey your order.

104
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:07,079
It is an important matter.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,040
Why did she keep it from me?

106
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:12,759
Your Majesty.

107
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,079
Your Majesty.

108
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,160
Prime Minister of the South,

109
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,839
something has happened.
