1
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,199
I'm a man who takes care of other people

2
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,359
standing here,

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,600
the lofty Prince Qi

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,000
Is kneeling.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How do you

6
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,320
what are your thoughts?

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,320
Your Highness,

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,759
you've got to kneel down.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,200
His Majesty doesn't like slackers.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,280
Otherwise, he wouldn't be so easy on his knees.

11
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,799
After making him kneel for four hours,

12
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,719
and announce the imperial edict.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,000
Prince Qi

14
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,959
he's the son of the Empress Dowager, after all.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,319
Will it be possible

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,599
prince Qi entered the capital

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,799
and entered the capital without permission

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,959
with malicious intentions.

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,280
From now on,

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,519
the Emperor is removed as the Marquis.

21
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,680
Forfeit his salary for three years.

22
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,519
Drive him out of the capital before dawn.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,439
That's all!

24
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,159
I accept the imperial edict.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Can Canghanyu

26
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,400
don't push me too far.

27
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,799
And take the throne away.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,599
And my brother died,

29
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,599
you even want to kill my son!

30
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,239
What?

31
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,799
Uncle has...

32
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,120
Not only him,

33
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,400
mother,

34
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,680
are we just going to sit there and do nothing?

35
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,000
Mother still has one last trump card.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,000
To fight back in a desperate situation.

37
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,799
Assistant Minister Lu has taken bribes.

38
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,959
The informants are tired.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,480
His son Lu Mingyuan forcibly took a daughter

40
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,519
Irrefutable evidence

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,960
the Lu family will be removed from all official positions

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,800
and his properties and mansion will be confiscated,

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,280
and never step foot in the capital.

44
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,199
That's all.

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
Are you satisfied

46
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,680
the result?

47
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,120
His Majesty intends to

48
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,520
to kill anyone

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,680
anyone who annoys me?

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
That's not impossible.

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
Then I don't like Deputy Prime Minister.

52
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,360
But I'm trying to be his opposite.

53
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,280
But the ministers

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,120
praised him for being a upright gentleman

55
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,400
and handled the state affairs cleanly.

56
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,360
And said I abused my power

57
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,719
and bully the government.

58
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm furious.

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,319
I...

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,639
Alright.

61
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,319
From now on,

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,520
I'll remove Rong Chu Xiu from the title.

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,599
And make him responsible.

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,120
To clean the toilet bowl

65
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,800
clean the toilet bowl every day.

66
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,759
What do you think?

67
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,159
Forget about it.

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
Let him stay on court.

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,400
After all, he lost his official position

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
and with no pay,

71
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,039
no one will buy sugar-coated haws

72
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,479
sugar-coated haws for Su Yi.

73
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,159
Prime Minister Nan, you are broad-minded.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,319
I will go and buy them now.

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,879
Are all prime ministers.

76
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,759
Why is that

77
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,479
so different?

78
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,199
That darn Lu Mingyuan

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,960
that I should punish again.

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,159
What?

81
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,360
Nan Yi was at brother Yu's palace.

82
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,599
He's so tall.

83
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,919
How can he be so shameless?

84
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,000
Your Highness.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,800
Stop it!

86
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,199
I'm having a headache.

87
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,560
Call Brother Yu right away.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,800
Yi'er,

89
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,199
what's wrong?

90
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,199
She's not well.

91
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,759
Please don't bother me.

92
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,599
Not at all.

93
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,000
I am happy to see you.

94
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,400
How can that be a disturbance?

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,079
I know His Majesty

96
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,680
his Majesty pays so much attention to me.

97
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,920
He is worried that I would quit.

98
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,720
Don't worry.

99
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,199
Qin Yi and I haven't settled our engagement.

100
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,399
Won't leave for now.

101
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,160
The South

102
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,480
In order to leave me,

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
you're willing to leave

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,199
you've worked so hard on for years!

105
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,199
What do you think

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,600
I have submitted the memorial for resigning.

107
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,199
Where are you going after resigning the government?

108
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,199
I won't tell you.

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,399
Alright.

110
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,800
If you really want to leave,

111
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,600
that's fine.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,839
But over all these years,

113
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,560
as a secret official

114
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,000
and is in charge of the Hidden Pavilion.

115
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Should you give me

116
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,000
shouldn't you hand me a person

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
to take your place?

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,279
Who does His Majesty favor?

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Don't worry.

120
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,639
I've already found

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,160
has been found for you.

122
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,920
Is this what Dong Hua said?

123
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,879
Allow my students to leave the country

124
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:14,519
Allow my students to leave the country
