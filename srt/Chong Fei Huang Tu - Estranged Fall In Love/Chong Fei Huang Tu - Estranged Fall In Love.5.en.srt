1
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,079
Your Majesty.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,280
The Qin and Lu Palaces

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,559
use the peach blossom banquet

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,800
to force Fourth Young Lady

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,120
to marry Lu Mingyuan.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,480
What?

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:26,839
Wife.

8
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,679
Who are you calling Madam?

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,840
Is there anyone else here?

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,719
You, of course.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,560
My mom has made an arrangement with Mrs. Qin.

12
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,719
She'll marry you

13
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll marry you.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,600
Come on.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,840
Let's walk around first.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,719
Please behave yourself.

17
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,320
Qin Yi is my fiancée.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,679
Why are you a servant getting involved here?

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,159
Piss off!

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,560
Mr. Lu, why don't you

21
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,840
you want to cancel the marriage?

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,240
You'll regret it later.

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,439
You think I'm a cabbage?

24
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,880
She is here to pick and choose.

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,359
Fourth Miss,

26
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,159
the annulment

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,079
Is just a misunderstanding.

28
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:05,799
I was deeply in love

29
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,719
deeply in love with you.

30
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,840
Never judge people by their appearance.

31
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,079
She usually looks so quiet.

32
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,480
I didn't expect Yinzhen

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,480
was so popular with the men.

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,319
Mrs. Qin.

35
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,359
Fourth daughter,

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,920
It's rare that Mr. Lu doesn't abandon you.

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Say yes now.

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,799
I can't.

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,599
Fourth Miss has promised

40
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,799
to marry the Prime Minister.

41
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,719
A marriage should be decided by the parents.

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:30,879
Even if His Majesty is here,

43
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,319
even if His Majesty comes,

44
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,439
he should ask me

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,840
of the main wife in charge.

46
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,079
It's so boring.

47
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,280
Greenzhu has left.

48
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,519
Qin Yi.

49
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,560
Stop!

50
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,480
It's because you're linked to Minister Nan,

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,200
because you're related to Prime Minister Nan?

52
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,200
That Prime Minister Nan is only showing off

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,400
In exchange for

54
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,079
In exchange for the status of Right Minister.

55
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,840
Don't you think it's dirty?

56
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,120
Who are you calling dirty?

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,040
Who are you?

58
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,519
How dare you hit me?

59
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,560
So what?

60
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,239
The Prime Minister said

61
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,079
anyone who dares to bully Fourth Miss today

62
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,040
will be against Minister Feng.

63
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,560
You

64
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,159
the Qin family

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,280
aren't you just a concubine's daughter in the Qin family?

66
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,639
You are so proud.

67
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,919
If it weren't for your

68
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,520
and that you were still pretty,

69
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,319
do you think I'll marry you as my real wife?

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,840
Shit!

71
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,719
Don't be shameless.

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,680
Shit!

73
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,560
Shame on you!

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,680
The people from the Prime Minister Residence are really overbearing.

75
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,680
She is as good

76
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,680
you're both alike.

77
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,840
I don't know how handsome

78
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,520
will maintain her beauty for a few years.

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,919
How can a man

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,520
to win his special favor

81
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,840
by cheating on her.

82
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,719
How dare they show off?

83
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,319
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

84
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,319
Fourth Young Lady and the others

85
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,400
are really troublesome.

86
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,680
What do you mean by that?

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,919
Now the world is falling apart.

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
They think my son is too kind.

89
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
There are too many bad guys who want to bully her.

90
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,599
That's right.

91
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,840
Your Majesty, you just left the palace recently.

92
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,080
Don't leave the palace again.

93
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
And Duanmu Feng isn't here. Stop it.

94
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,199
I'll never let her face it alone.

95
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,120
How dare you touch my woman!

96
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
It seems that someone is dying.

97
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,120
Cousin.

98
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
You're finally back in the capital city.

99
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,439
How can you win His Majesty's favor only because of your handsome face?

100
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,319
He deserves the credit.

101
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,439
Compared with some ugly ones,

102
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,240
and can't be found

103
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,159
and fail to find him in a crowd.

104
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,919
Stop!

105
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,919
How dare you say such thing about Prince Qi!

106
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
Lowly slave! Courting death!

107
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,919
I'm Jing Shu.

108
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,439
Jing Shu.

109
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,639
Come on!

110
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,599
Come to help!

111
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,680
Come to help.

112
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,960
Jingshu, give me your hand. Give me my hand.

113
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,319
Fourth cousin,

114
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,520
Is that how you teach your servants?

115
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,800
But Greenzhu is from the South Minister Residence.

116
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,719
I can't help it.

117
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,080
Then today,

118
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,960
I'll set a rule for you.

119
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,680
Anyone there!

120
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,439
Prince Qi!

121
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,520
You are going against Prime Minister Nan in public.

122
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
I'm afraid you won't end up well.

123
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,240
I am the dignified Sovereign Prince

124
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
how can a humble Right Minister

125
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,479
can do anything against me?

126
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,960
To take this snob away.

127
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,479
Flog her 50 times!

128
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Let go of me.

129
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,800
Hit him severely.

130
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,039
His Majesty has arrived!

131
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,360
Come and see him immediately.

132
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,519
Long live Your Majesty!

133
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,680
Miss Qin Yi, don't be so formal.

134
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,759
I came here uninvited.

135
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,000
Did I bother you?

136
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
Your Majesty, it's a long grace.

137
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,399
Your Majesty.

138
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I heard

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,319
some people think Right Minister isn't clean

140
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,480
your Majesty.

141
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,360
Your Majesty.

142
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
Your Majesty, spare me. Drag her out.

143
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,480
Your Majesty, spare me. Don't stain it.

144
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,680
With such a good manor,

145
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,639
yes

146
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
- Your Majesty. - Yourmajesty.

147
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,000
Your Majesty, spare me!

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
Your Majesty, spare me!

149
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Why is Prince Qi here?

150
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
You were ill.

151
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,240
I came to offer an imperial edict.

152
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Even the patient came to this peach blossom banquet.

153
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,839
You must be in good mood to enjoy.

154
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,000
I happened to

155
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,319
to visit aunt.

156
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
Prince Qi's filial piety is admirable.

157
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,399
I need to reward you.

158
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,839
Your Majesty has decreed

159
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,639
summon her.

160
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,399
Prince Qi!

161
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,079
Yes, Your Majesty.

162
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,839
Green Bamboo, we're leaving.

163
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,600
Yes

164
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:50,959
fourth Miss,

165
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,319
let me ask you something.

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,839
Have you met

167
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,480
with my Older Brother?

168
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,959
Yes, we have.

169
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,199
We're close, too.

170
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,480
We've done whatever we can or can't do.

171
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,040
Goodness.

172
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,839
It seems that

173
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
yes, sister-in-law.

174
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,920
Official Cang Yunze

175
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,240
your Majesty.

176
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,439
Your Majesty.

177
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,360
Prince Qi asks for an audience with Cang Yun Ze.

178
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Your Majesty.

179
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,040
Prince Qi asks for an audience with Cang Yun Ze.

180
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,759
Summon Rong Chu Xiu to come in.

181
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,079
Yes

182
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,600
what about Huarong?

183
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,839
You want to vent your anger again?

184
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,879
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

185
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,600
To see if you are hurt.

186
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,600
I didn't see any blood.

187
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,480
Why was he angry?

188
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
As the Minister of Humerus,

189
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,600
he is of high rank and powerful,

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,040
deal with a host of problems every day

191
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,439
the Emperor shouldn't have vented his anger on him.

192
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,680
I can remove him as Deputy Minister

193
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,319
and protect you.

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,480
Does His Majesty want to be a fatuous ruler?

195
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,639
It's his honor

196
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,800
to protect you.

197
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,839
Instead of honor.

198
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,600
His Majesty is the Emperor.

199
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,040
It is normal to have 3,000 beauties in the harem.

200
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,959
I shouldn't waste my time

201
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,120
on me.

202
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,920
I will leave now.
