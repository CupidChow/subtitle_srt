1
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,079
I want you to be the empress.

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,719
Your Majesty must force me

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,960
I know what I want.

4
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,399
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

5
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,439
I can't obey your order.

6
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,000
Can't you just obey me this once?

7
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,840
You can't.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,880
What if I really punish you?

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,439
You want me dead.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,079
I have no choice but to die.

11
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,719
Please leave.

12
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:17,680
I'll leave now.

13
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,040
Let go of me.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,000
Let go of me!

15
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,120
How dare you

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,439
kidnap me!

17
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,319
I am the state uncle.

18
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:33,760
Of Empress Dowager.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,319
State Uncle, you have the wrong words.

20
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,680
It's not a kidnapping.

21
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,120
It's to arrest

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,799
from the south.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,359
You're just a male toy.

24
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,719
By climbing up the dragon's mansion.

25
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,560
Those dirty things

26
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,239
behind your dirty tricks!

27
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,680
You think Her Majesty doesn't know?

28
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,439
A concubine's son's son

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,599
by the posthumous edict of the late emperor.

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,200
We don't even know

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
whether the posthumous edict was real.

32
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,879
I'm ordering you

33
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:04,159
release me immediately.

34
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,920
Otherwise, I can release you,

35
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,560
give me the name list of the Empress Dowager's clique

36
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,759
what list?

37
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,639
I...

38
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,400
I don't know.

39
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,000
I...

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,080
I want to see Queen Dowager.

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,159
Your Majesty, please be perceptive.

42
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,759
The Right Minister, Nan Si

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,400
the arrogant

44
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,879
and runs rampant in the court.

45
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:28,759
Recently,

46
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,520
and hurt my son for no reason.

47
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,800
He has abandoned the law

48
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,000
the law in his eyes.

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,599
If we don't punish him,

50
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,439
I'm afraid all the officials will not accept it.

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,599
And the people will be in trouble.

52
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,360
Your loyalty to Your Majesty

53
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,759
Is known by all.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,479
But Prince Duan

55
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,319
and check on your good son.

56
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,319
And see what you've done.

57
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,360
Don't slander us good officials.

58
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,280
Good officials.

59
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,759
How can you be worthy?

60
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,520
Your Majesty,

61
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,919
prince Duan's son Cang Mingqi

62
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,680
and humiliate me in public.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,439
I was humiliated

64
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,639
and this figure.

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,800
No wonder Her Majesty

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,280
out of her mind.

67
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
She really thinks about herself.

68
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
Considering that

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,280
since Prince Duan is usually cautious,

70
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,719
Is cautious.

71
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,639
However,

72
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,639
at least one thousand taels of silver

73
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,159
you still want to compensate me?

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,840
1,000 taels is not much.

75
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,479
I can afford that.

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,039
Your Majesty,

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,520
and insulted officials of the court.

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,280
Are you sure you want me to hold you accountable?

79
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,520
My lord.

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,400
Your Majesty.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Come here.

83
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,199
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,319
What are you doing?

85
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,719
Of course I love you.

86
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,360
Your Majesty did not punish you

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,360
I just let you have your wish.

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,160
I asked him to pay you 1,000 taels of silver.

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
That stubborn man.

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
So easy-going today.

91
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,839
I don't know

92
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,360
If His Majesty secretly

93
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,720
In private?

94
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,279
As expected, nothing can be hidden from us.

95
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,439
Your Majesty.

96
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
Stop acting.

97
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,759
Yi'er,

98
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,399
you're not funny the older you get.

99
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,600
I remember when I was little,

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,920
If I remember correctly,

101
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,560
the emperor summoned me here

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,920
to discuss something serious.

103
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,079
Qin telling us the truth?

104
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,160
Not yet.

105
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,560
But tonight,

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
by tonight.

107
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,680
What's your decision, State Uncle?

108
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,279
Are you going to surrender?

109
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,439
I'll...

110
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:17,279
I'll pay you.

111
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll pay you now.

112
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,079
At His Majesty's instruction,

113
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,959
state Uncle Qin has been causing troubles in the imperial court.

114
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,680
From today on, he will be stripped of his official status

115
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,959
and will be exiled with me.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,560
Without ever returning to the imperial court.

117
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,160
But His Majesty is kind.

118
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,879
He only said that you're guarding the tomb for the late emperor,

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
everything will remain as before.

120
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,040
I'll fight you to the end!

121
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,160
It's you

122
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,680
I planned to spare your life,

123
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:15,480
but you're not good with your hands.

124
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
I didn't expect that

125
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,040
my fourth daughter who never

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,000
who never rarely walks through any doors

127
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,160
turned out to be

128
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,040
the biggest treacherous official in the dynasty!

129
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,319
From the South

130
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,000
no, Qin won't.

131
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,800
You'll hit me with thunder

132
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,199
Impossible to acquire a peaceful end

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,879
state Uncle Qin.

134
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,600
Are you sure that

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,279
I'm your biological child?

136
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
Stop.

137
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,680
Come and get me some tea.

138
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,680
What else can I do for you, Miss Nanjia?

139
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,079
Not that.

140
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,800
To advise someone.

141
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,279
Yu is my...

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm the only one

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,079
Is only open to me.

144
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Some people,

145
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,240
no matter how high his official position is,

146
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,040
you are just a slave,

147
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,319
you're not even pregnant yet.

148
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,519
Stop pestering Brother Yu all the time.

149
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,160
What's the taste of the tea?

150
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,600
Is it spoiled?

151
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,600
No way.

152
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,560
Let me have a look.

153
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,720
It smells good.

154
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,920
Are you the one

155
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
has been so angry recently

156
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,759
and I've lost my sense of taste.

157
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,680
How dare you!

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,600
You're nothing but a dog.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,480
How dare you talk to me like this?

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,000
How dare you talk to me like this?
