1
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,440
It's moving!

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
The baby moved again.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,719
Idiot.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,160
Of course, a living person moves.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,960
Yi'er.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,719
Do you prefer boys or girls?

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,320
Both are good.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,759
As long as we don't

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,079
as his father.

10
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,079
By the way,

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,640
rong Chu Xiu and Su Yi are...

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:44,960
What's up

13
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,240
nothing.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,399
Some people

15
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,000
take it easy.

16
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,240
Have a good rest.

17
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,399
Leave everything to me.

18
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,600
Alright.

19
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:57,679
When you come back,

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,040
what?

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,840
You said my daughter is still alive?

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,439
Yes

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,879
but Nan Yi said that

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
she passed away long ago.

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,359
What exactly does she want?

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,359
Controlling your daughter

27
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,159
which means he's also controlling you.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,439
She and Cang Hanyu

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,840
will they be able to

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,400
the foundation of Wu State

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,840
and the country?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,439
How absurd

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,640
I shouldn't have trusted him so much.

34
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,680
He even said

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,560
he will be a good emperor.

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,959
That's right.

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,599
Now he is deceived by the evil queen, Nan Yi.

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,799
Is no longer the wise Emperor he used to be.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,040
Qin's State Uncle and his family are loyal to the country.

40
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,159
But now, because of a woman,

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
because of a woman.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,519
I have heard a little about this.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,560
I come here

44
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,519
hoping Princess Royal to borrow some soldiers

45
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,519
and help us against the tyrant

46
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,799
so that the world can be safe.

47
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,479
With the might of the heaven,

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
the Earth contains light.

49
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,439
The Emperor Star Luan and Wen Qu are disappearing.

50
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,360
A great danger!

51
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,360
This is not good!

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,599
The punishment is coming.

53
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,520
Yi'er.

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,560
You and baby go first.

55
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,280
No way.

56
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,400
Are you trying to drive me away like in your last life?

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,479
No way!

58
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,039
No matter what it takes,

59
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:46,479
In short, in this life,

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
life together...

61
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,680
Live together.

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,439
Live together.

63
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,120
Together.

64
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,360
And catch him alive.

65
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,280
Is the son of the late Emperor.

66
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
Your Highness,

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,879
It's a deal.

68
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,080
After you take down the Wu Chao,

69
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,520
you'll cut 20% of Lanyue's territory.

70
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,800
Rest assured.

71
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
What do you mean?

72
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,639
They didn't force the imperial family

73
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,719
but to divide the land.

74
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,120
You lied to me.

75
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,400
It turns out

76
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,520
are traitors to our country!

77
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,680
Right!

78
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,719
It's a pity that Your Highness

79
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,319
understand too late.

80
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,240
Where is my daughter?

81
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,039
She died.

82
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,159
Your daughter

83
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,599
Is Suyi who is close to Nanyi.

84
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,840
Snuck out of the capital to get help at night.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,520
And we intercepted her halfway.

86
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,000
Now is

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,560
to send you off

88
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,000
to see you off and reunite with her.

89
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
Don't move.

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,240
And Cang Ming Hua

91
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,360
plain Clothes.

92
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,959
You

93
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,720
you two...

94
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,759
When will you

95
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,279
when you find him

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,120
you started to drive a wedge

97
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,000
his relationship with South Prime Minister.

98
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,000
The last lesson my master taught him

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,360
last lesson to him?

100
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,560
His last lesson is

101
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,199
Is trust between peers.

102
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:38,560
Means trust between partners.

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,959
Plain Yi.

104
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,360
Why...

105
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,600
Why did you save me?

106
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,120
That's because

107
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,160
you're my child,

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
my...

109
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,480
Sorry.

110
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,800
I was useless 19 years ago

111
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,680
and asked the late emperor to take you away.

112
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,279
And put you in a Hidden Pavilion.

113
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,560
I'm...

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,839
I'm your child.

115
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,120
How have you been these years?

116
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,439
Pretty good.

117
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:51,759
My Lord.

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,240
Namely Consort Luan.

119
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,399
They've treated me well.

120
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,480
That's good.

121
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:07,480
I...

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,519
I may not live long.

123
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,240
I can recognize you

124
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,399
to recognize you

125
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,680
to see you as my mother.

126
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,000
Can you call me mother?

127
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,480
Forget about it.

128
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,680
I didn't bring you up.

129
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,439
I don't think I have the right to raise you.

130
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,639
Mother.

131
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,079
Mother.

132
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,000
Good child.

133
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,839
Your Majesty.

134
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,040
Please forgive me

135
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,040
my son.

136
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,560
Son?

137
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,720
My son.

138
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,519
How are you?

139
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,279
Yi'er.

140
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Can Cang Han Yu

141
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:23,879
go to hell!

142
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,279
Child!

143
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:25,840
Child.

144
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:28,440
Child.

145
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,679
That our child

146
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:30,279
That our child
WEBVTT
