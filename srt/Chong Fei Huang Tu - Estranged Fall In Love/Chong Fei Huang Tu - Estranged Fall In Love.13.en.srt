1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,120
Your Majesty.

2
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,160
This year,

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,960
there were frequent floods in Jiangnan this year,

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,399
causing crop failures.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,160
Your Majesty, please open a warehouse for disaster relief

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,519
to relieve the people's plight.

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,799
My son is the best.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,439
Your Majesty.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,119
You

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,479
brother Emperor,

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,680
I made this soup myself.

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,879
Try it.

13
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:07,879
Is it good?

14
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,879
Your Majesty.

15
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:12,359
I poisoned this soup with hibernate medicine.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,560
Is it yours

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,680
or not?

18
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,159
As long as it's made by you,

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,319
that you made.

20
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:20,799
Brother Emperor,

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,959
what did you say

22
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:22,879
what poison?

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,319
It's you.

24
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,599
Your Majesty.

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,359
You'd better take a rest.

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,879
She won't come.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,359
No, she won't.

28
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,799
I need to wait for Yi'er.

29
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,000
Someone tried to assassinate His Majesty.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,319
The Emperor was assassinated?

31
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,120
Come. His Majesty is assassinated.

32
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:24,840
My Lord.

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
How come you're free now?

34
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,400
My Lord.

35
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,879
You were the fourth lady of the Qin family.

36
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,159
And went shopping with me.

37
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:35,840
Right?

38
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,960
That's right.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,439
And he used you.

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,599
Then

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,719
when I was fighting with the man in black,

42
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,280
I hit the stone

43
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,400
that flew over your head.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,560
So you brought me

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
because my martial arts skills are weak.

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,400
So that you can be taken away naturally.

47
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,400
Yes

48
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,599
were you injured when you left

49
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:57,800
after leaving with the man in black?

50
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,759
Look at me now.

51
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,199
I'm fine now.

52
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,759
That's good.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,759
Don't you hate me?

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,360
I know I have a poor foundation.

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,199
Even if I train every day,

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,759
I still can't compare to Su Yi.

57
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,400
I just want to know

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
beside my master,

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,360
that I'm still useful,

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
I'm already very happy.

61
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
As for resentment,

62
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,240
I hate that I'm not strong enough.

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,319
Otherwise,

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,199
you don't have to risk yourself.

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,639
If you're not strong enough,

66
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,560
I will train more every day

67
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,599
two hours

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,199
for extra training.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Alright.

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,319
Master.

71
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,240
My lord.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
His Majesty has an accident.

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,759
Trash!

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,360
A group of rubbish!

75
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,400
If something bad happens to His Majesty,

76
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,199
If His Majesty dies.

77
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,240
Die with us.

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,599
Kill them all.

79
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
His Majesty is not dead yet.

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,039
And Her Majesty couldn't wait for him to be buried alive.

81
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,120
What

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,919
what his intention is.

83
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,199
What do you mean?

84
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,159
Guards!

85
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,360
Get everyone out of here

86
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,199
get everyone out of here!

87
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,199
Nan Yi, how dare you!

88
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,639
Before me, can you

89
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,959
It's your turn to speak!

90
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,720
Your Majesty.

91
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,879
Do I have any credibility?

92
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,680
The words of Prime Minister Nan

93
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,759
Is me.

94
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,759
Your Majesty.

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,959
Not for the second time.

96
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,519
What are you doing as an Imperial Guard?

97
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm the Empress Dowager,

98
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,199
but also harm His Majesty.

99
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,560
But this villain

100
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,839
If he tries to harm the emperor,

101
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,120
who will bear the consequences?

102
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,480
If I really wanted to harm His Majesty,

103
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,279
Isn't that just what you want?

104
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,759
From the South?

105
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,160
Who gave you the courage to talk to me like that?

106
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,360
Who on earth will be in power

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,639
who's going to be in charge

108
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,399
anyway,

109
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,319
you won't have the right to

110
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,199
leave all this to me,

111
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,959
If he is involved today,

112
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,759
I want you all to die with him.

113
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
How dare you?

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,480
If you don't believe it,

115
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,560
you can have a try.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,959
I don't know.

117
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,360
Guard the palace gate well.

118
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,560
No one can come in

119
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
without my permission.

120
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,079
Bring me the wound ointment.

121
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,560
Deputy South.

122
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,639
If she draws the dagger,

123
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,120
his Majesty will

124
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,040
that's why

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,360
just plug it in.

126
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,319
Or

127
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,639
you want to see the posthumous edict announced now?

128
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:08,959
Yi'er,

129
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,680
shut up!

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
I'll pull out a dagger for you.

131
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,319
And everything will be fine.

132
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,279
This is unacceptable.

133
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,360
His Majesty is in mortal danger.

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,160
How dare you stop me?

135
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,680
You just let Prime Minister Nan do what you want?

136
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,160
How dare you!

137
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,160
Guard!

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,879
The Princess Royal is here.

139
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:41,720
The Princess Royal is here.
