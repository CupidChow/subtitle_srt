1
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,279
Miss.

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,640
Using your status as South Minister to block Prince Li?

3
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,760
Then you won't be able to resign.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,399
It's more shameful.

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,199
Please rest early.

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,520
Please

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,000
my son.

8
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,679
My head hurts.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,960
If my head hurts, I should see an imperial doctor.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,960
No need.

11
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,200
Give me a massage.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,759
I'm sleepy.

13
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:53,799
Please go back, Your Majesty.

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,439
I won't leave.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,640
I'll stay here tonight.

16
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:01,920
His Majesty won't leave.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,759
I'll leave.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
My son.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,120
My son,

20
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,280
I want to make you the Queen.

21
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,239
What?

22
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,560
Of course it's because I like you.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,920
Jun is the cloud in the sky.

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,480
I am the clay under the ground.

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:17,920
You can't ascend to the heaven.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,040
I said jokingly back then

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
how could you remember them all these days?

28
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,879
Back then, I was immature

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,159
I didn't want you to become my weakness

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,439
because of your love.

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,840
That would be too dangerous for you.

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm not worthy of it.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,480
South Yi

35
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,239
what are you yelling at?

36
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:35,879
I'll count to three.

37
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,680
Leave now

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,719
otherwise,

39
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,200
or what?

40
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,359
Yi'er.

41
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:55,200
This...

42
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:59,319
Didn't you say that my son and I are destined to be locked?

43
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,480
Our marriage is hard to break?

44
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,560
But why is she often distant and nearby?

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,599
And lukewarm to me?

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,680
And start all over again.

47
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,479
I also said that

48
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,919
may not happen as you wish.

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,639
What you can do

50
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,120
Is to use your memory

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,240
to prevent the tragedy in your past life

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,240
from happening again.

53
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,439
Or are you saying

54
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,120
you regret it?

55
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,360
I will never regret.

56
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,599
I didn't protect her well in the last life.

57
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,400
The wild ambitions of Prince Qi

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,919
the tyranny of the Later Party,

59
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,599
I won't let this happen again.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,840
My Lord.

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,479
I heard that His Majesty

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,960
hasn't eaten for days.

63
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,919
He's willful.

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,039
And ignoring him.

65
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,479
Your Majesty.

66
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:57,800
You haven't eaten anything for the whole day.

67
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,319
You have to eat something.

68
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,360
Hush.

69
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,280
You're finally here.

70
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
My son.

71
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,000
Please

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,800
ask the imperial kitchen to prepare some food that His Majesty likes.

73
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,120
I'll do it now.

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
Yi'er still cares about me.

75
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,879
Your Majesty.

76
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,599
How long will you be self-willed?

77
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,159
Until you agree to be my empress.

78
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,120
I'll make you starve to death.

79
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,240
Yi'er,

80
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,400
her Majesty is here.

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,479
Minister of the South,

82
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,080
why can't you kneel down when you see me?

83
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,560
Mother, something's up.

84
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,360
I came to get married

85
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,599
wang Li and Jingshu.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,199
May Your Majesty please issue an edict

87
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,159
to order Wang Li and Jingshu to get married on an auspicious day.

88
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,560
Qin Jingshu isn't good enough for Li Wang.

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Your Majesty, don't bother.

90
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,159
To the south.

91
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,599
Who do you think you are?

92
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,360
You have no right to speak before me.

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,120
Mother,

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
nanyi is an important minister on court.

95
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,879
He's my capable assistants.

96
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,560
Shouldn't I speak

97
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,800
In front of you?

98
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,479
No wonder Minister Nan is usually so rude.

99
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,719
Your Majesty has your back.

100
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
I have things to do.

101
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll leave now.

102
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,080
Your Majesty is busy with official duties.

103
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,639
Don't overwork yourself.

104
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
So is Prince Ai of Nan.

105
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,079
Mother,

106
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,000
I have no interest in

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
I'm not interested in getting involved.

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,279
You can talk to Prince Li on your own.

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,439
I'll leave now.

110
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,439
Please

111
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,279
miss.

112
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,399
Why did Mrs. Qin and Ms. Wang

113
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,800
suddenly want to hold a peach blossom banquet?

114
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,879
She even wrote a invitation for you to attend.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
She is up to something.

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Forget about her.

117
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,800
Why do you have to mess with Prime Minister South's mansion?

118
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,959
Shouldn't you

119
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,279
too much?

120
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,959
I'm here today

121
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,879
was sent by Minister Nan to protect you.

122
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,439
Honey.

123
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Honey.
