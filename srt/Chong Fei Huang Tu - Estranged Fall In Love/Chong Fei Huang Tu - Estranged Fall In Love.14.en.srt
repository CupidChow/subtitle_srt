1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,719
They are rebels.

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,640
Guard!

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,280
Here comes Princess Royal.

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,960
She lives a simple life.

5
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,280
What brings you here today?

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,960
The Princess Royal lived a simple and simple life,

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,239
she's the eldest sister of the late emperor.

8
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,359
At the same time,

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,879
and Regent Princess,

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,960
the assassination of the emperor is a huge matter.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,079
The assassination of the emperor.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,840
Your Highness.

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:43,159
Stand up.

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,799
How is His Majesty?

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,479
Princess Royal,

16
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,359
the imperial doctors are treating her.

17
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,920
Princess Royal,

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,679
the Prime Minister chased us out.

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,159
He's in there alone.

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,719
With no idea what he was doing.

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,159
The emperor's brother was dying.

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,159
And disregarded the imperial brother.

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,079
She surely will complain.

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,959
Did you do something to His Majesty?

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,359
What else can he do?

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,519
Of course she is saved.

27
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,120
Then the blood

28
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,079
It's for healing.

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:16,760
It's inevitable.

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,439
It's you.

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,640
Your Highness.

32
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,560
How is His Majesty?

33
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,599
His Majesty is safe now.

34
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,920
But this time he is seriously injured.

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,840
He needs rest.

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,079
Prime Minister of the South,

37
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,560
what happened today

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,280
In your opinion,

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,480
we should do?

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Duanmu Feng,

41
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:36,760
yes, Your Majesty.

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,159
The Palace Guards failed to protect you.

43
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,359
All of them will be punished by 200 taels of silver.

44
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,359
Remove your clothes and take responsibility.

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
The imperial doctors didn't perform the medical skills well.

46
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,200
And your salary will be halved.

47
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,079
As for the Queen Dowager,

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,159
his Majesty was assassinated.

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
Queen Dowager was so worried about His Majesty

50
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,760
her Majesty is so worried that she is ill,

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
from now on, he will rest behind closed doors.

52
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,560
You must not leave the Fengqi Palace

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,159
without leaving Fengqi Palace within a month.

54
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,040
Is considered proper.

55
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,239
Just do as you wish.

56
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Please, Your Majesty.

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:07,920
I accept the imperial edict.

58
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,759
Yi'er.

59
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,879
200 is too much?

60
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,560
That's right.

61
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,919
His execution should be punished by flogging

62
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:21,520
that's as good as flogging.

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:22,520
And failed to protect her.

64
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,719
She should've died

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
then...

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,520
In fact,

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,159
protect myself well.

68
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,360
Shouldn't he be punished?

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,520
Your Majesty, good health.

70
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,759
No one dares to punish you.

71
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,120
But in fact,

72
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,319
duanmu Feng has already

73
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,439
we have tried our best.

74
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,000
How about

75
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,439
fifty.

76
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,280
Luck is allowed to protect me.

77
00:02:59,159 --> 00:02:59,960
Yi'er.

78
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,960
20!

79
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,159
Not give me less.

80
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:05,599
Get out of my way.

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,039
I'll go in and visit Brother Yu.

82
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,080
His Majesty is not feeling well.

83
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,560
It is not convenient for you to meet guests at the moment.

84
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,080
How can I go in?

85
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
She...

86
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,479
She...

87
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,360
He went in and took a look.

88
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
He found His Majesty was still breathing.

89
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,159
And then left.

90
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,039
Let go of me.

91
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,680
Yi, I told you to let go, didn't you hear me?

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,319
Yi'er,

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,120
don't go.

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm dying.

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,680
You're going to die?

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,879
This is pretty strong.

97
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,919
It's a reflection of life.

98
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,039
Son,

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,159
If something happens to me,

100
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,719
I will pass the throne to you.

101
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,159
I don't want that.

102
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,879
Then pass it to Prince Li.

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,520
Then keep the tomb for me.

104
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,879
Shut up, will you?

105
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:47,960
If you don't leave,

106
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,840
I'll shut up.

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,879
All right. Fine.

108
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,240
I won't leave, okay?

109
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,039
How are you?

110
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,400
Lie down.

111
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,439
Lie down together.

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,360
It hurts.

113
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,280
It hurts.

114
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,280
It really hurts.

115
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,000
How do you think

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,319
what do you think?

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,160
And able to govern the state and serve as an official.

118
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,959
In the Palace.

119
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:19,199
However,

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,519
his Majesty has been

121
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,759
by him.

122
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,079
To pretend to be a playboy.

123
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,920
Especially a boy toy.

124
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,199
Yi'er,

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,199
I didn't expect that

126
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,959
I took the initiative today.

127
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,399
But it's not

128
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,800
for me now.

129
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,279
I think

130
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,720
his Majesty is old now.

131
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,920
She really should pass the throne

132
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,360
something.

133
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,120
Do you mean that...

134
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,920
High Priest, haven't you made any divination?

135
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,600
You go to the priests' hall.

136
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,040
Tell him it's my idea.

137
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,920
To have the position

138
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,000
of the Feng throne.

139
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Now who is the winner?

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,600
Yes

141
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,319
just now,

142
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,720
her Majesty's wound

143
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,040
as if an acquaintance has had a stab.

144
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,800
That's why Her Majesty was unprepared.

145
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,560
And the wound

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,600
Is deep, but it's not fatal.

147
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,319
They are so low.

148
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,680
Let me think it over.

149
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,399
Could it be that His Majesty

150
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,399
summoned some beauty to sleep with him?

151
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,439
But the beauty

152
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,720
the beauty plotted against me.

153
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,040
Yi'er is joking with me.

154
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,920
There's only one possibility then.

155
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,720
Your Majesty, does it hurt?

156
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,839
No, it doesn't.

157
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,120
Your Majesty would rather die

158
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
than tell me the truth?

159
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,120
than tell me the truth?
