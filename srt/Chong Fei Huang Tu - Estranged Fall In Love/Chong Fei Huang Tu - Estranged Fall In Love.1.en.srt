1
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,359
(The death of Emperor Gaozong)

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,199
After Emperor Gaozong passed away,

3
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:21,480
and eldest son,

4
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:22,960
after Prince Qi ascended the throne,

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,320
he was brutal and ruthless,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,440
and killed all the royal members and officials.

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,600
There are endless wars,

8
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,679
the people are destitute

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,920
and Pale Cold Yu.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,799
These are the charges found in your mansion.

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,359
Princess, South Yi.

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,719
Colluded with Blue Yue State

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,159
for rebellion.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,600
Tell me about it.

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,920
How should I punish the queen?

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,640
This is the divorce papers.

17
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,159
We are

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,359
now our relationship is over.

19
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,640
And our relationship is broken.

20
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,519
Why?

21
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,480
No reason

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,439
because I don't love anymore.

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,280
Because I want to marry another woman.

24
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,480
I don't believe you. Can't you understand my words?

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,359
I want you to get lost.

26
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,159
Get out now!

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,200
Get out of Wu State!

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,239
And never come back again.

29
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,800
Nanyi has been abandoned and driven back to Lanyue State.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,319
Collaborated with the enemy, betrayed the country and usurped the throne.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,759
I was responsible for all the crimes.

32
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,919
We have found an abandoned inn ahead.

33
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,159
Your Highness,

34
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,000
please bear with it a little longer.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,960
We'll be there soon.

36
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,039
- Your Highness. - Exert yourself.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,840
Hurry up!

38
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,639
It's happening.

39
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,159
The mistress gave birth.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Nanny.

41
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,680
Mammy.

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,919
Mammy.

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,039
Mammy.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,120
Nanny.

45
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,599
Nanny, what do you want?

46
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,759
Your Highness,

47
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,759
I received a message from Lanyue.

48
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,000
This child

49
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
to keep this child.

50
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,360
The Wushu army pressing on to our border.

51
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,599
And will break into the Blue Moon soon.

52
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,080
As long as we give her the princess,

53
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,879
to protect Lanyue State from war.

54
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,840
Father actually

55
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,520
your Highness,

56
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
I'm guilty.

57
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,439
Please rest assured.

58
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,240
My master will protect him

59
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,080
I will protect him.

60
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,319
Nanny.

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,039
Your Highness,

62
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,560
nanny.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,000
Princess, give the child back to me.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,080
Be careful, Princess!

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,319
Return the baby to me.

66
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,199
Return the baby...

67
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,240
Let go of him!

68
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,839
My child!

69
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,439
Give him back to me!

70
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:55,680
South Yi.

71
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,560
Come back with me.

72
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,040
I will give you great glory.

73
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,240
All these

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,639
are all your plans?

75
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
I am the king of the empire.

76
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,720
I should own

77
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,639
In the world.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,720
This coward Cang Hanyu

79
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,879
how can he be worthy of you?

80
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,839
Come back with me.

81
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,240
Can Cang Yun Ze

82
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,839
why do you force me to this point?

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,319
From the south.

84
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,639
♪ If autumn comes, September eighth ♪

85
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,959
♪ After I blossom ♪

86
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,240
Hundred Blossoms Kill.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,240
South Yi is dead.

88
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,600
South Yi can't get it.

89
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,560
Your Cang Hanyu

90
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,959
can never expect

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,839
my son.

92
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,920
Son?

93
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,480
My son,

94
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,279
even if you want to start over,

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,439
It's not impossible.

96
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,639
It's just that...

97
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,360
May not meet your expectations completely.

98
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,559
As long as I can start over with her,

99
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,440
as long as I can start over with her.

100
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,600
Done.

101
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,879
Yi'er.

102
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,759
I'm useless in this life.

103
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,519
If there really is a next life,

104
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,799
I will hold the power

105
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,559
and protect you forever.

106
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:21,840
and protect you forever.
