1
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,359
Master, you're back.

2
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
His Majesty has just asked someone to summon you.

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,440
I won't go.

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,039
Yes, Master.

5
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,119
I'm leaving now.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,399
Where are you going?

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,640
Mr. Rong is ill.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,320
I have to send him some medicine.

9
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,119
That's a little

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,880
why don't you move my Southern Minister's Mansion away?

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,119
My Lord.

12
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,679
I'll go now.

13
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:56,560
By the way,

14
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,759
official Duanmu personally invited him here.

15
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,280
He said

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,479
his Majesty hasn't eaten for a long time.

17
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,159
This again.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,840
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,799
I told you I wasn't hungry.

20
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:29,400
Not to disturb you?

21
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:30,680
Your Majesty.

22
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,239
Yes, Minister Nan.

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,840
He's on his way to Zichen Hall.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,400
Your Majesty.

25
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,479
Does he want to be beaten again?

26
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,960
(Your Majesty has reduced a lot recently.)

27
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,599
Has he been indulging in sexual intercourse

28
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,840
or are you busy with government affairs?

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,800
That you forgot to eat and sleep.

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
I don't...

31
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,479
It's just a poor appetite.

32
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,879
How is your appetite today?

33
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,560
Pretty good.

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,080
Then have more.

35
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,759
Don't let the officials see this

36
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,439
and think our national treasury is empty.

37
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,039
Your Majesty is poor and can't even afford to eat.

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,520
Then cook for me.

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,039
Try it.

40
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,319
What?

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,599
It's not good.

42
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,639
It's good.

43
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,639
Why don't you swallow it?

44
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,039
Is it because

45
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,599
my cooking?

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,800
I heard Rong Chu Xiu is injured.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He is seriously injured.

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,839
Right.

49
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,600
I was about to tell you about it. Let's eat.

50
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,000
Tell me then.

51
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,839
I received a message that

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,439
your Majesty has found

53
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,000
the legendary weapons of the former dynasty.

54
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,439
A huge amount.

55
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,680
And excellent quality.

56
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,040
If these weapons

57
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,439
are controlled by those behind,

58
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,639
to avoid chaos.

59
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,759
Rong Chu Xiu was severely injured

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
because of tracking this.

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,839
I'll take over the investigation.

62
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,759
No way.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
You have to stay away from it.

64
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,639
Queen Dowager has made a tight arrangement

65
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,639
according to Rong Chu Xiu,

66
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,560
these people are terrifying.

67
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
They are neither human nor ghosts.

68
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,560
To drink blood and eat flesh,

69
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,199
they're no different from beasts.

70
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,639
Are you trying to

71
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,800
trying to scare me?

72
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,279
What kind of understanding is that?

73
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,240
Didn't you resign the government post?

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,519
Don't interfere in this matter.

75
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm not done with the resignation, am I not?

76
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,680
I'll be careful.

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Talk about this again?

78
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,079
Actually,

79
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,040
actually, today I

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,040
to invite you

81
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,839
with me to the Lantern Festival.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,879
I remember when you were little,

83
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,560
the lantern paintings of Chen's are your favorite.

84
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,759
Save the Lantern Festival

85
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,759
on the Lantern Festival.

86
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,000
My son.

87
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
My son.

88
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,160
See you there and be square.

89
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,680
My Lord.

90
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,160
What have you found?

91
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,759
Those who hurt my appearance

92
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,160
are people from the underworld named Luosheng Clan.

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
They are cunning with their movements

94
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
and are highly skilled.

95
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,399
Only money, not people.

96
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,399
Also,

97
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,519
they always hold

98
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,079
they always held the red umbrella in their hands.

99
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,079
You were unable to tell it

100
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,439
but you're finally released.

101
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,240
Your Majesty. It's not right.

102
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,600
They should be here soon.

103
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,000
Long-winded.

104
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,199
Plain Yi.

105
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,480
Go meet them first.

106
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,399
I'll come later.

107
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,160
What's up

108
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,959
red umbrella.

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,839
Red...

110
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,959
It's so late.

111
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,240
Why are they still not here?

112
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,839
No rush.

113
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,399
I have enough patience.

114
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,480
Your Majesty.

115
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,759
They are making a scene

116
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,160
and causing trouble in Mengxiang Restaurant.

117
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,240
Take care of it.

118
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,079
I...

119
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,120
Young Master,

120
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
the drunk Wang Li Wang

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,639
and only you

122
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,800
but never recognize people like you.

123
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,920
He's in charge of

124
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,639
of Minister Feng and Finance Division.

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,600
If the Empress Dowager

126
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,879
finished the story,

127
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,279
where's your master?

128
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,040
He went after her.

129
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,160
Today,

130
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,240
I've asked the best girls

131
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
the best girls in Mengxiang Restaurant.

132
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,360
Do you know who I am?

133
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,759
The younger brother of His Majesty.

134
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,160
The finance of the Ministry of Revenue

135
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
are all in my charge.

136
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,960
Cut the crap.

137
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,440
I want to see your boss.

138
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,679
If you win,

139
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,600
I will pay you ten times

140
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,559
I'll pay you back ten times as much.

141
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,720
If you lose,

142
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,240
the building is mine.

143
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,159
My Lady,

144
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,720
li Wang was drinking too much

145
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,279
to buy the building.

146
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,000
Mengxiang House

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,679
belongs to the Empress Dowager's Auntie.

148
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,840
All information must go from here.

149
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,399
Must not be exposed.

150
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,440
Why isn't the Rashomon people here?

151
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,279
Did you reply to your letter?

152
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:18,879
I'm being followed.

153
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,600
Qin Yi.

154
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
(It's her?)

155
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:29,720
You go first.

156
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,720
Go on.

157
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:36,399
- Lure her here. - Okay.

158
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:34,879
- Lure her here. - Okay.
