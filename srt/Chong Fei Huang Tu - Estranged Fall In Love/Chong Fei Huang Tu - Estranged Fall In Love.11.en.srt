1
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,600
Master.

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,679
I've practiced the sword technique

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:23,559
you taught me before.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,600
I can be by your side.

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,399
If you want to work in the Hidden Pavilion,

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,480
don't reveal your side

7
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:32,799
don't show that look

8
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,799
look on your face just now.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,679
Brother Green Bamboo.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Our master

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,280
Is a girl.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,840
Master. Master.

13
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,799
Do you really only want Cang Ming Hua

14
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:53,759
to follow you.

15
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
How can he protect you?

16
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,000
If he had the same ability as you,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,119
If Empress Dowager came to catch me,

18
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,079
If she comes to capture me?

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,200
But there are dangers in that.

20
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,439
Are you really going to

21
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,879
from His Majesty.

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,959
We won't enter the tiger's den.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,280
Where there's a tiger.

24
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,760
But when I enter the tiger's den,

25
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,480
when I enter the tiger's den,

26
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:14,400
yi'er,

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,200
why don't you

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,239
and obey me?

29
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,200
If something happens,

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,599
my heart will ache for him.

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,040
To argue with him.

32
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,319
Lest he be thwarted.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,040
With His Majesty's attention,

34
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,079
how can he not find out?

35
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,599
Don't worry.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,200
I have a plan.

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,719
Your Majesty.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,439
This is the osmanthus cake you made by Fourth Miss herself.

39
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,000
This is

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,480
my gift to you.

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,439
Fourth Miss,

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
that you might not know.

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Your Majesty.

44
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,799
Eat this kind of food.

45
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,519
Your Majesty.

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,400
Tell me.

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
I really like that.

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,280
Last night,

49
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,120
I also prepared a gift

50
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,280
for your daughter.

51
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,439
The flowers are so beautiful.

52
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,240
This is the Prime Minister's favorite preserves.

53
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,960
Give me one.

54
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,560
The gouache looks so nice.

55
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,159
Prime Minister will love it.

56
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,400
These

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,560
are all wrapped up?

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,639
My Lord.

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,280
Why did we

60
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
why did we come here?

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,240
Stop.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,960
Who are you?

63
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,039
What do you want?

64
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,360
Miss Qin.

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,439
Please come with us.

66
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,039
My lord is gifted.

67
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,840
He has studied in the Prime Minister Residence for some time.

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
You have made great progress.

69
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,199
Stop!

70
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,400
Don't kill him.

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
I'll go with you.

72
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Let's go then.

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,479
Miss Qin.

74
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,319
Go back to where you belong.

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Don't mind me.

76
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,360
Miss Qin.

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,039
Emergency!

78
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,680
What's up

79
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,400
my Lord.

80
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,919
Let me see His Majesty.

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,319
Miss Qin Yi

82
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,360
she is abducted

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,919
by the Rashomon Sect.

84
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,840
What?

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,280
Hurry to save him!

86
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,000
Sorry.

87
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,520
Secret guards.

88
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,319
They only follow orders

89
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,280
or Nanblind Cave.

90
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,639
What if things go wrong with both of them?

91
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,319
What?

92
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,719
Then we will

93
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,879
I'll wait...

94
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,399
She won't wake up

95
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,480
he won't wake up.

96
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,319
Leave him here.

97
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,720
The owner will interrogate him later.

98
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:28,800
Come on.

99
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,199
I can't believe Mengxiang Pavilion

100
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,720
Is the den of the Empress Dowager.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
Sure enough, it's the map of the arsenal.

102
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,639
Is destroyed.

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,279
There are no shortcuts to governing the country.

104
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,920
Hidden troubles in people.

105
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,920
It's precisely because such weapons

106
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
that exist in the world.

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,519
It keeps reminding those in power

108
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,600
In their hearts.

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,600
Stirs up war and strife.

110
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,120
Hidden troubles in people.

111
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:05,800
What are you doing?

112
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,120
Stop!

113
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,120
Stop!

114
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,560
Stop!

115
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:30,759
Stop!
