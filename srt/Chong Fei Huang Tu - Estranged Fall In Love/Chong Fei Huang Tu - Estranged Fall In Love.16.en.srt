1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,679
You've changed my clothes into women's clothes.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,399
You look good in ladies' wear.

3
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,359
I like to see you in ladies' wear.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,719
I'm afraid Your Majesty has been crazy thinking about women.

5
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,679
If I really be crazy,

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,119
I'll hide all your clothes.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,119
It seems like you have almost fully recovered.

8
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,840
It hurts.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Stop acting cute.

10
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,719
I won't buy it.

11
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:52,560
So which do you favor?

12
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,520
I'll learn now.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,560
Your Majesty, please dance for me.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
That's impossible.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,719
I need to save face, okay?

16
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,239
Brother Yu.

17
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,920
Qin Yi.

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,519
She's staying here.

19
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,120
Isn't it south to the south?

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,359
So that

21
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,719
qin Yi is Nan Yi.

22
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,000
How did you come in?

23
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:53,000
Why are you with such a witchy woman?

24
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,879
Nanjia!

25
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,599
We are family.

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,040
And South

27
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,400
Is my lover.

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,840
She will take care of me.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
You said that

30
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,080
she took the arrow for me.

31
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,800
Why is she your lover?

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,599
What you said then

33
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,840
It was only a temporary measure.

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,080
Nanjia,

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,240
I truly want to protect you,

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,439
but I also want to protect

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,840
Is Yi'er.

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,879
Because she

39
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,439
she is the reason

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,240
to do everything in my life.

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,199
You're lying.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,439
You haven't got a queen for all these years.

43
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,840
You're reserving this for me.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,319
I never promised you this.

45
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,879
But you granted me the title of princess.

46
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,199
Because you're living in South Prime Minister's Mansion

47
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,240
and disturbing the peace of her.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,479
I can't believe it.

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
That's all I can say.

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,319
From Nanjia,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
I hope you won't

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,520
don't make trouble for Yi'er in the future.

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,159
Otherwise,

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,439
don't blame me for neglecting my brotherhood.

55
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,719
Now I believe

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
there's nothing

57
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,400
between her and me.

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,599
What's up?

59
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:21,520
Then the matter

60
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,919
about the appointment of the Queen,

61
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:23,840
think about it.

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,639
My lord.

63
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,400
His Majesty gives you this.

64
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,240
She said

65
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,840
It matches your dress perfectly.

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,719
I'll help her to wear it.

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,919
No need.

68
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,240
I'm still men's clothing.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
I'll wear it later.

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,800
But we have to

71
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,039
for your kindness.

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you new here?

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,159
Right.

74
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,039
I'll take it. Go back to work.

75
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,960
Alright.

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,839
What's wrong, Yi'er?

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,720
Kneel down.

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,040
This...

79
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,040
There is gold under the knee of a man.

80
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,079
Yi'er,

81
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,519
stop fooling around.

82
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,199
I am the leader of a kingdom.

83
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,319
How can you

84
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,600
what a shame!

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,519
Cang Xiaoqi, I feel proud, right?

86
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
I said it this morning.

87
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,439
I'm almost back to the mansion.

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,240
How could you release me?

89
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,319
On your knees!

90
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:03,439
On your knees!
