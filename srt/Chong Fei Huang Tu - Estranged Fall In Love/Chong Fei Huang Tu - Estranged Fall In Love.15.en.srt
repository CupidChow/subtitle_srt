1
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,320
Yi'er.

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,239
Sorry.

3
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,480
I can't stand your ignoring me these days.

4
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:28,920
That's why I made such a bad choice.

5
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:34,799
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,119
I didn't expect that

7
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,159
I really wronged the Empress Dowager.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,679
I always thought she framed you.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,159
I didn't expect it was you.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,479
Kill yourself in the guise of assassination.

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:46,920
How could you think of that?

12
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,240
Yi'er,

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,359
I'm such a fool.

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,799
To be cheated by someone for a lifetime,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,799
for the rest of my life,

16
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:56,039
and I have to listen to your words

17
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,399
and worried about you.

18
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,200
My son.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,679
My son.

20
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,560
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm sorry, Yi'er.

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,439
I always wanted to tell you in person.

23
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,560
I need to apologize to you

24
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,560
In this life,

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,200
I will protect you.

26
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,400
Let's start all over again.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,920
Alright?

28
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:21,799
What makes you think

29
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,799
I'll give you another chance.

30
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,799
You begged him to live this life.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,640
So I'm obligated to start it all over again with you.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,480
It's not that.

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,159
It's good that you know.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,280
Yi'er, you're right.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,840
All your tragedies in your last life

36
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,159
started with that repudiation paper.

37
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,799
It's my fault.

38
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:49,799
It's all my fault.

39
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,400
I have something to ask you.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,519
I want to ask you about the throne.

41
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,560
Thank you for the ten articles.

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,840
About you and Cang Hanyu?

43
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,159
One thousand taels of silver.

44
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,360
Why don't you just grab it?

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
You're blessed, Prime Minister.

46
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,719
I want to ask

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,879
but it's a deal.

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
About you and him in this life and the future.

49
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,800
Is a secret

50
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,080
so I can't answer that.

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
In his previous life,

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
why did he repudiate me?

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,639
Didn't he tell you himself?

54
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,479
That's the only question

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
to answer my question.

56
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,560
He only said

57
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,120
It was his fault.

58
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:51,280
Kind of.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
He's

60
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,400
Is too stupid.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,280
After Prince Qi ascended the throne,

62
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,800
and coveted your beauty.

63
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,400
And fabricated evidence

64
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,240
framed you for treason.

65
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,199
Cang Hanyu took all the crimes for you.

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,400
He was put into the imperial prison,

67
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,319
and endured torture.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
My son...

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,599
Son?

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,800
Son?

71
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,319
My son.

72
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,879
Also,

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,879
he's just too kind-hearted

74
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
he's too not in contention.

75
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,599
So I wouldn't be able to protect you

76
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,400
when danger comes.

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,199
What are you...

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,199
You're crying?

79
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,120
No one.

80
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,400
Count your money.

81
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,719
All right.

82
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,240
Buy enough wine.

83
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,319
Scram.

84
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,960
For the sake that you looked so upset today,

85
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,199
I enclose a message for you.

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,319
The empress will leave Luan Yu Jiuzhou.

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
My son.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
My son.

89
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,040
Is this a dream?

90
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,399
You weren't in a dream.

91
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,319
Drink the medicine.

92
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
I don't believe you.

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,759
How can I make you believe me?

94
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,600
Then you

95
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,680
give me a kiss.

96
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,720
Your Majesty.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,600
Physician.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Doctor?

99
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,720
His Majesty is lost.

100
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
I'll go look for it.

101
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:00,959
Take the medicine first.

102
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:05,319
Yi'er,

103
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,560
I thought you had really left.

104
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,959
I would never see you again.

105
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
The military court is so big.

106
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,199
Where else can I go?

107
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,000
It's bitter.

108
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,360
And feed me.

109
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,879
Then the ghosts are feeding you?

110
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,079
With your mouth.

111
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,680
Your Majesty.

112
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,120
Here is a quick memorial for you to pass.

113
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,399
It doesn't seem to be that urgent.

114
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,759
Go on.

115
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,519
I might as well drink it for you.

116
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,720
Great.

117
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,720
Dream on.

118
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,720
Drink it or not.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Yi'er,

120
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,199
I want to have some too.

121
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,879
Don't you know what

122
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,120
see also have a share.

123
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,480
You're sick. You can't eat it.

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,000
Look at your mouth. It's oily.

125
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,199
Is it vegetable or meat?

126
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,720
You're not well. Let me have a try.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,120
You can feed me with your mouth.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,319
Don't tickle me.

129
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
I'll eat that.

130
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,600
Just the thing in your mouth. Gross?

131
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,199
Let go of me, Cang Hanyu.

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,240
It hurts. Are you OK?

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,240
What's wrong?

134
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,920
I... I need to eat it today.

135
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,120
Brother Chu,

136
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,199
you slapped me,

137
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,480
that hurts a lot.

138
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,360
Was His Majesty that I just saw?

139
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,720
You were right.

140
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,800
I saw it, too.

141
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,639
And

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,279
did you hear that?

143
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,240
What Fourth Miss

144
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,199
what did you call him?

145
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,240
what did you call him?
