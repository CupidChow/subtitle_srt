不 他没有杀人动机啊
No, he had no reason to kill him.

82
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,560
他可能有什么隐情吧
I'm sure he did.

83
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,860
事务长 在推理作品中 像这种有着凶手面孔的人
Mr. Sa, in detective stories, the ones who seem like the villain

84

你在说什么
What are you talking about?

91
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,790
不管我怎么叫你 你都不起来
I tried to wake you up, but you didn't budge.

92
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,260
等出租车来了 我就走了
I waited until the taxi came and just left.

93
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,470
没有自己的床 我可睡不了觉
I can't sleep anywhere else but in my own bed.

94
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,300
千律师如果睡着了 被谁背走了也不知道
Mr. Cheon wouldn't even know if you carried him away in his sleep.

95
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,220
真是不可理喻
This is unbelievable.

96

剧透？你看到凶手是谁了吗
Spoiler? Did you see who did it?

100
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,320
万幸的是 我没有看到是谁
Fortunately, I didn't.

101
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,450
事务长 你能确认一下吗
Mr. Sa, can you check for me?

102
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,580
不 我下次再看

反正你也猜不对凶手 你就确认一下吧
You couldn't guess who did it anyway. Check it out for me.

白实习 你最好小心点
Ms. Baek. You really have to be careful.

110
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,800
如果你剧透 我们的关系就决裂了
If you ruin it for me, you're done here.

111
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,350
-住手 -真是的
Stop.

你可要遵守约定 实现我的愿望
You'd better keep your promise about my wish.

128
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,750
当然了 我会遵守约定的
Of course. I'll keep my promise.

129
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,790
她竟然可以这样解决此事
I can't believe she fixed it like this.

130
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,470
天啊 她怎么会想到如此妙计
Gosh, how did she think of fixing it like this?

131
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,010
对了 白实习 你还记得我上次让你整理的资料吗
By the way, do you remember the files I asked you to organize?

It's a murder case.

154
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,390
很抱歉 我们不接 凶杀案这种刑事大案
I'm sorry… We don't take on violent crimes like murder.

155
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,430
他绝对不是凶手
I swear he didn't do it.

156
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,350
很抱歉 这是我们事务所的方针
I'm sorry, but it's our office policy.

157
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,650
他说如果是你 一定会帮他的
He said he was sure you would help him out.

158
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,310
我会帮他？是我认识的人吗
That I'd help him out? Is it someone I know?

159
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,030
他说我答应过帮他吗
He said that I'd help him?

160
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:05,070
请你一定要看完这个 我弟弟在等你
Please read through this. My brother is waiting for you.

161
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,590
反正我们不会接这个案子 你还看它干吗
Why look at it when we aren't taking it on?

162
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,130
我们说好不会接手可怕的案子
We promised not to do anything scary.

163
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,800
千律师可胆小了
Mr. Cheon is a scaredy-cat.

164
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,100
我就看看是什么样的案子
I'll just see what kind of case it is.

165
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,890
千律师 你不好奇吗
Mr. Cheon, aren't you curious?

166
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,480
好像是你认识的人
It seems like someone you know.

167
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,150
我很好奇啊
I am curious. Yes.

168
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,400
那我们这样如何 举手表决
Then, how about this? Let's vote on it.

169
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,820
举手表决？
Vote?

170
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,030
我们什么时候举手表决过
Since when did we vote on things?

171
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,160
我们现在三个人 所以举手表决怎么样
Since there are three of us, why don't we vote on it?

172
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,200
好啊 我也是这里的成员 我们就举手表决吧
Okay. Since I work here too, let's take a vote.

173
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
非常好
Very good.

174
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,870
那看不看案件卷宗
Okay. We'll take a look at the case file, yes or no?

175
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,080
一 二 三
One, two, three.

176
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,470
我先看吧
I'll look at it first.

177
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,480
就当作我没看过吧
I didn't see anything.

178
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,020
怎么了 你刚刚不是还很好奇吗
What's wrong? You were dying to find out only a moment ago.

179
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,650
那我也看一下
Then, let me take a look…

180
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,240
我也什么都没看到
I didn't see anything either.

181
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,460
是那个案件吧 在上面发生的那个
Isn't it that case? The one that happened up there.

182
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,880
没错 因为这个命案使枫津洞
It is. Thanks to this case,

183
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,260
没错 因为这个命案使枫津洞
the whole country knows of our neighborhood, Pungjin-dong.

184
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,760
变得全国上下家喻户晓
the whole country knows of our neighborhood, Pungjin-dong.

185

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,750
刀去哪了
Hey, where did the knife go?

188
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,610
警察
POLICE

189
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,460
你有话对去世的母亲说吗
Any words to your late mother?

190
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,420
你主张凶手是失踪的父亲 这是事实吗
You claimed that the murderer is your missing father, is that true?

191
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,970
-他们两位关系不融洽吗 -请你说几句吧
-Didn't they get along? -A comment, please!

192
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,260
请说句话吧
Give us a statement!

193
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,060
请你们让开
Please move out of the way!

194
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,350
请说句话
A word, please!

195
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,810
《平价正义》
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

196
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,350
他杀了自己的父母啊
He killed his parent.

197
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,310
我反对 不能接
I'm against it. No.

198
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,610
我也是
I'm against it too.

199
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,900
只不过还没开庭而已 不是已经结案了吗
He didn't go to trial, but isn't it already a done deal?

200
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,700
凶手很明确啊
He's clearly the murderer.

201
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,700
首尔钟路警察局

202
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,490
千律师
Look, Mr. Cheon.

203
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,330
你不会要接这个案子吧
You aren't considering taking this case, are you?

204
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,210
你看看
Look at this.

205
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,880
前所未闻的恶魔
"The devil of the ages."

206
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
标题就很骇人听闻
Even the title is horrifying.

207
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,010
画家夫妻凶杀案
"The murder of an artist couple.

208
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,010
律师团队全部退出
All of the lawyers withdraw." Okay.

209
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,260
让我看看
Let me see.

210
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,720
你看
Look.

211
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,220
由于形成恶魔律师的批判性舆论
"When the public criticized them for being the devil's lawyer,

212
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,390
负责辩护的白法律事务所 决定退出此…
Law Firm Baek who were representing him decided to withdraw…"

213
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,020
白法律事务所
LAW FIRM BAEK

214
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,730
-白法律事务所？-没错 白法律事务所
-Baek? -Yes, Baek.

215
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,150
这么大的律所都放弃辩护了
If a huge law firm like that would withdraw from it,

216
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,690
我们为什么要接手
why would we take it on?

217
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,620
这件案子和我们事务所的性质不符
This case doesn't go with the characteristics of our office.

218
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,490
我的想法也是如此
I think so too.

219
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,950
我们欠了他的债
We're indebted to him.

220
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,620
-欠了债？-没错 欠了债
-Indebted to him? -Yes, we are.

221
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,460
事务长 你不记得了吗
Don't you remember him, Mr. Sa?

222
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,580
什么
What?

223
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,190
完美
It's perfect.

224
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,960
-天啊 -事务长 稍等一下
-Wow. -Hang on, Mr. Sa.

225
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,750
让我先观赏一下 稍等
Let me appreciate it for a moment.

226
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,170
原来你还有这种才能
Who knew you had such a talent?

227
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,890
你画得可真是栩栩如生
It's alive. It's as if it's moving.

228
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,430
它正在草原上奔跑啊
It's running through a meadow.

229
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,100
它是只牛吧
Isn't it a cow?

230
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,730
是我 我要擦了它
It was me. I'm just going to erase it.

231
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,730
这是我的自画像
It was a self-portrait.

232
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,780
我从中看到了苦恼
I can see the agony.

233
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,910
我给你们算便宜点 怎么样
Want me to do it for cheap?

234
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
什么
Pardon?

235
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,790
赵女士 你的心脏没问题吧 你可要做好心理准备
Ms. Cho, how's your heart? Prepare your heart for this.

236
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,880
你看
Ta-da!

237
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,340
怎么样 画得很好吧
How is it? Isn't it nice?

238
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,130
人真是各有所长啊
You do have something you're good at.

239
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,010
作为一个月的房租 我给你算得很便宜了
For a month's rent, I did this work for cheap.

240
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,430
但是关于壁画 我思考了一下
But I was thinking about this mural…

241
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,140
如果把画画到那上面
If we drew this mural all the way up to the top,

242
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,400
画就会变得非常雄伟大气 还有…
the painting would look very majestic and…

243
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,150
-壮观 -变得非常壮观 你觉得呢
-Spectacular! -Spectacular, don't you think?

244
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,280
可不可以商量一下 抵半年的房租呢
Should we cut a deal for six months' rent?

245
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,410
你做梦
No way!

246
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,490
真是欠揍
Unbelievable.

247
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,990
唉唷 真是的
My goodness. Geez!

248
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:26,500
整个街坊会看起来很不一样的
The whole neighborhood looks totally different.

249
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,410
变得又温暖又友善
It looks so warm and friendly.

250
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,750
-氛围真好 -真好
-It's so nice! -So, nice!

251
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,210
你是律师吧
You're a lawyer, aren't you?

252
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,220
是的 我是律师
Yes, I am. I am… a lawyer.

253
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,550
我是千智勋律师
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

254
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,100
我该怎么答谢你呢
I don't know how I can thank you.

255
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,970
我不需要谢礼
You don't have to thank me.

256
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:50,310
如果我以后需要帮助 请你帮我
If I need your help later on, just help me out.

257
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,730
我很难相信画出这种画的人
I can't believe someone who drew something like this

258
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,980
会做出那种事
could do something like that.

259
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,320
知道他的为人后 这些画看起来也阴森森的
Now that I know what he's like, even this picture gives me the creeps.

260
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,830
不 他之前看起来并不那样
No, he didn't seem like that at all.

261
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,040
我们当时不是说好要帮他吗
Didn't we say that we'd help him?

262
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,250
可能只是随口说说而已吧
I'm sure it was just in passing.

263
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,830
就算是随口说的 也算口头约定吧
Even if it was just in passing, it's still a verbal promise.

264
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,550
你当时好像没有回答他吧
You didn't give him an answer, though.

265
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,470
当时他只是说让你帮他
He did ask you to help him out,

266
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,760
但你并没有答应他
but you didn't say that you'd help him.

267
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,260
让我想想 那时…
Come to think of it, I don't think--

268
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,510
你没有回答他
You didn't give him an answer.

269
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,020
-我们还是去吃饭吧 -是啊 去吃饭吧
-Let's just go grab a bite. Come on. -Yes, let's go grab a bite.

270
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,640
我没回答 对吧
I didn't answer, did I?

271
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,230
千律师 都说你没有回答他了
Mr. Cheon, you said you didn't give him an answer,

272
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,030
你怎么还在看那个
so why are you looking at that again?

273
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,110
你不是说要去吃饭吗 我们不去吃吗
Didn't you say we should go eat? Aren't we going to go eat?

274
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,320
千律师
Mr. Cheon.

275
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,740
事务长
Mr. Sa.

276
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,700
金敏宰为什么要让我为他辩护呢
Why did Kim Minjae want me to represent him?

277
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,410
你不觉得事有蹊跷吗
Don't you think it's rather strange?

278
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,870
这能有什么蹊跷
Why is that strange?

279
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,670
估计他认识的律师只有你
I guess you were the only lawyer he knew.

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,590
-难道不是吗 白实习 -你说得对
-Don't you think so, Ms. Baek? -Exactly.

281
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,130
因为他不认识其他人
He doesn't know anyone else.

282
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,630
如果白法律事务所拒绝了 他不是应该找其他大律所吗
If Law Firm Baek refused to represent him, shouldn't he go to another big law firm?

283
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,260
难道不是吗 白实习
Don't you think so, Ms. Baek?

284
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,350
你说得对
That's true.

285
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,600
这一点确实有点奇怪
That is kind of strange.

286
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,560
他既然是著名画家家庭出身 想必应该很富有
If he comes from a famous artist family, he must be rich.

287
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,940
他不是应该找其他有名的律师吗
Shouldn't he look for another famous lawyer?

288
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,360
何况他还被冤枉 背负了杀人罪名
He has been wrongfully charged with murder.

289
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,030
但他为什么要找你
So, why did he ask for you?

290
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,950
就是啊 白实习 你的问题很犀利
Exactly. Ms. Baek, you are so sharp!

291
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,780
你怎么这么聪明
How are you so smart? Hmm.

292
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,160
好 所以我们去见见他吧
All right. That's why we should go see him.

293
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,500
什么 见谁
What? Who?

294
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,420
金敏宰
Kim Minjae.

295
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,170
什么 为什么
What? Why?

296
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,710
我们得见见他
We have to meet him

297
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,050
问他为什么要让我为他辩护
to ask him why he wants me to represent him.

298
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,300
玛丽 你来开车
Mari, can you drive?

299
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,510
你的车挺不错啊
You have a nice car.

300
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,470
我们走
Let's head over there.

301
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,270
唉唷
Darn it.

302
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,280
以国民为中心的检察官 值得信任和公正的检察官
PROSECUTORS FOR THE PEOPLE, TRUSTWORTHY PROSECUTORS, FAIR PROSECUTORS

303
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,110
唉唷 这气味
Gosh, this smell.

304
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,370
依然如故
It hasn't changed at all.

305
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,120
你听说过枫津洞案吧 儿子杀害了自己的父母
Have you heard of the Pungjin-dong case? The son murdered his parents.

306
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,460
因为这件案子 我忙得团团转
That case is giving me a headache.

307
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,710
嗯 我听说了
Yes, I heard about it.

308
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,920
这件案子这么快就到我们手里了吗
Was it already handed over to us?

309
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,750
地检长说上面对此案非常感兴趣
The higher-ups are very interested in this case,

310
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,670
所以让我们好好调查
so I was told to do a good job.

311
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,380
上面对此案很感兴趣啊
The higher-ups are interested?

312
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,720
他们不感兴趣才奇怪 所有新闻都在报道这个
It'd be weird if they weren't. The news is all over it.

313
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,890
-要不你趁机加入我们吧 -什么 我吗
-Want to take this opportunity to join us? -What? Me?

314
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,100
如果你加入了 对我来说也更轻松
If you join us, it'll make things much easier for me.

315
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,060
怎么了 你也可以受到闪光灯的洗礼
Why not? You can get some of the spotlights too.

316
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,520
闪光灯的洗礼？
Spotlight?

317
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,400
现在开始 发表枫津洞案的调查…
From now, the investigation of the Pungjin-dong case…

318
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,490
枫津洞案的…
The Pungjin-dong case…

319
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,160
检察

320
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,950
枫津洞案的…
The Pungjin-dong case--

321
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,040
调查结果…
The result of the investigation…

322
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,420
枫津洞案…
The Pungjin-dong case…

323
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,550
等一下 你们的后台是谁
Wait! Who is behind all this?

324
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,130
我快瞎了
I can't see anything!

325
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,890
近身采访
IN-DEPTH COVERAGE

326
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,270
不了
No.

327
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,350
我不太想
I… Well…

328
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,940
接凶杀案
No. I don't want to take on a murder case.

329
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,240
唉唷 真可惜
My gosh. What a shame.

330
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,410
你趁机得到大众传媒的关注该多好
It would be nice for you to get some publicity.

331
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,490
你还记得重案部的朴检察官吧
Do you know Prosecutor Park in Violent Crimes?

332
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
他长得像黑社会
He looks like a gangster.

333
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,710
记得 我第一次见他的时候 以为他是被抓来的
Yes, I thought he was arrested when I first saw him.

334
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,000
是啊 就是那个朴检察官
Yes, that's Prosecutor Park.

335
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,380
自从他抓到黑社会 上了新闻以后…
After he caught that gang member and was in the news…

336
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,840
他的社交媒体账号涨了多少粉
How many more followers did he get on his social media?

337
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,180
我记得好像是十万多
Oh, I think it was over 100,000.

338
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,600
-十万？-十万吗
Over 100,000?

339
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
-十万？-十万吗
Over 100,000?

340
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,270
他通过这种事粉丝还能破十万吗
He got 100,000 followers over something like that?

341
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,150
15个关注者 检察官徐民赫
15 FOLLOWERS PROSECUTOR SEO MINHYEOK

342
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,730
如果是你 粉丝破百万都是小菜一碟
You can easily have one million followers.

343
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,030
唉唷 什么百万啊 太不像话了
Come on. One million followers? That's insane.

344
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,950
徐检察官

345
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,540
一百万粉丝
ONE MILLION FOLLOWERS

346
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,420
你可是我们厅的颜值担当啊
You're the most handsome in our district prosecutor's office.

347
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,670
你说得也对
That is true.

348
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,960
你会加入吧
Won't you do it?

349
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,010
让我考虑一下
I'll think about it.

350
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,300
见面后你想做什么
What are you going to do when you meet him?

351
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,550
我很好奇 所以我想问他
I'm going to ask him since I'm curious.

352
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,350
千律师 还有什么我不知道的事吧
Mr. Cheon, there's something more to it than what I know, isn't there?

353
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,150
什么事啊
What do you mean?

354
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,230
你不是因为好奇才去见他的啊
You aren't meeting him simply because you're curious.

355
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,150
我就是因为好奇才去见他
I am meeting him because I am curious.

356
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,620
正确的矫正
PROPER CORRECTION

357
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,500
正确的矫正

358
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,300
教化
REFORMATION

359
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,900
金敏宰 好久不见
It's been a long time, Mr. Kim Minjae.

360
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,320
这位是白玛丽律师
This is Ms. Baek Mari, attorney-at-law.

361
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,490
你好 初次见面
Hello. Nice to meet you.

362
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,320
我确实是第一次见到你
I am meeting you for the first time,

363
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,870
但我一点都不好
but it isn't nice for me.

364
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,870
看来是这样
Oh, you're right.

365
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,370
我在开玩笑
I'm just kidding.

366
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,130
看来我当时帮你还是值得的
It did pay off to help you out back then.

367
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,880
我们还没有决定要接这个案子
We haven't decided to take on your case yet.

368
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,680
但你们都来这里了 就说明还是有机会
But the fact that you came all the way here means there's a chance.

369
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,180
剩下的就看我如何回答了
The rest is left to how I answer.

370
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,850
是吧
Isn't that right?

371
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,100
没错 你说对了
That's about right.

372
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,940
你的双亲去世了 你不难过吗
Both of your parents died. Aren't you sad?

373
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,110
我一定要难过吗
Do I have to be sad?

374
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,320
而且不是双亲 是其中一位吧
It isn't both of them. Isn't it just one of them?

375
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,540
我爸还没被发现 所以他还是失踪状态
My father hasn't been found yet, so he's missing.

376
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,870
我听说你主张自己无罪
I heard you claim innocence.

377
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,460
不是主张 是事实
It's not a claim, it's the truth.

378
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,790
检方说我遗弃了我爸的尸体
The prosecution says I disposed of my father's dead body…

379
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,800
并对我妈做了那种事
and did that to my mother,

380
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,260
但我只是洗了个澡
but I was simply taking a bath.

381
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,800
我也不知道楼下当时发生了什么事
I didn't know what was going on downstairs.

382
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,560
如果知道 我还会洗澡吗
If I had known, do you think I would've taken a bath?

383
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,350
还是泡泡浴
A bubble bath at that?

384
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,190
那个时间洗泡泡浴也不是常有的事
It doesn't seem normal to take a bubble bath at that hour either.

385
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:52,190
就算不是常有的事 也不能说明是我做的啊
Just because it isn't normal doesn't mean it's a crime.

386
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,780
那你认为杀死你母亲的人是谁呢
Then, Mr. Kim, who do you think did that to your mother?

387
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,740
消失的父亲
My missing father.

388
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,870
他俩平时关系就不好
The two didn't get along.

389
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,670
你和他们的关系也不好 不是吗
You didn't get along with them either, did you?

390
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,510
我很期待能够见到律师
I was looking forward to meeting my lawyer.

391
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,430
但今天来的好像是检察官
But it feels like a prosecutor is here.

392
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,970
很抱歉 其实
I'm sorry. Actually,

393
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,100
我们来这里是有很重要的原因
there's a particular reason why we came here.

394
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,400
白法律事务所的级别 和我们律所的差距很大
There's a huge gap between Law Firm Baek and our office.

395
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,900
你为什么要委托给我们
Why do you want us to represent you?

396
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,610
他们规模很大 收费又高 我以为很有实力
I thought they'd be good because they're big and expensive,

397
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:37,900
但其实没什么能耐
but they weren't so impressive.

398
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,200
他们只会看眼色
They kept minding others.

399
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,540
他们说要放弃辩护 我就同意了
They wanted to withdraw, so I told them to do so.

400
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,870
所以呢
So?

401
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,000
我也想过找其他律所
I thought about hiring another law firm,

402
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,920
但可能会让人觉得 我在试图用钱逃避罪行
but it might appear as though I'm getting away with it using my money.

403
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,760
在寻找的过程中 我想起了你
While I was searching for one, you came to my mind.

404
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,380
好 然后呢
Okay, and?

405
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,720
就这些吗
Is that all?

406
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,970
你找律师也太随意了吧
You aren't putting much effort into it.

407
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,440
如果败诉 你可能就无法被释放了
You may not be released if you lose the trial.

408
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,020
你找律师应该更慎重些
You should be more careful about hiring a lawyer.

409
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,280
但我是无辜的
But I'm not guilty.

410
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,820
我为什么要担心那些
Why would I worry about that?

411
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,570
难道不是吗
Don't you think so?

412
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,330
你不觉得他让人毛骨悚然吗
Doesn't he seem rather creepy?

413
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,870
哪方面
What do you mean?

414
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,340
没什么 他看起来一点都不冤枉
Well, he doesn't act like he was wrongfully charged.

415
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,170
在这种情况下 他却表现得游刃有余
It's odd that he is so relaxed in a situation like this.

416
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,590
他看起来也很会动脑筋
And he seems pretty clever.

417
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,810
你不会接的吧
You won't take it, right?

418
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,610
你的疑惑已经解开了吧
You've got all your answers.

419
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,150
我们再去一个地方吧 我还想了解一些事
Let's drop by one more place. I need to figure something out.

420
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,200
你还要去哪里
Where are we going now? Hey.

421
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,740
千律师
Mr. Cheon.

422
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,490
白法律事务所

423
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,580
你来这里干吗
Why do you want to go here?

424
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,790
他们可是退出了此案
This law firm withdrew from this case.

425
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,550
我想当面问他们一些事
I have to ask them something in person.

426
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,760
那你有预约吗 你至少要先预约吧
Did you make an appointment? You should make one first.

427
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,680
好 我现在就去见他们 然后预约
Sure. I'll make one when I see them.

428
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,890
哪有人见面再预约的
Who makes an appointment when they see the person?

429
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,560
在这里
Right here.

430
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,230
我快疯了
He's driving me insane.

431
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,570
白实习
Ms. Baek.

432
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,450
你在干吗 我们快走吧
What are you doing? Let's get going.

433
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,080
判决已经出来了
It was ruled as unconstitutional,

434
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,290
所以请大家充分准备好 相关资料和案例
so please thoroughly search for related materials and instances.

435
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,420
-好的 -好的
Yes, sir.

436
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,840
有位叫千智勋的律师来访
A lawyer called Cheon Jihun is here to see you.

437
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,010
我们现在在开会 你让他下次约好再来
We're in a meeting, so tell him to make an appointment next time.

438
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,390
不了
No.

439
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,680
让他进来吧
Let him in.

440
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,020
什么
Pardon?

441
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,730
我们休息一会儿吧
Let's take a brief break.

442
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,810
休息一会儿吧
Let's take a break.

443
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,190
好久不见
It's been a long time, sir.

444
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,280
是啊 好久不见
Yes, it has been a long time.

445
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,530
假装你不认识我
Pretend you don't know me.

446
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,250
这位是我的实习生 白实习 快打声招呼
Oh, this is my probationary employee. Ms. Baek, say hello to them.

447
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,630
你好 初次见面 我是白玛丽
Hello. Let me greet you. I'm Baek Mari.

448
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,040
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

449
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,670
我也很高兴
Nice to meet you too.

450
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,430
不过请问有什么事
Anyway, what brings you here?

451
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,560
我听说你放弃了枫津洞案的辩护
I heard you withdrew from representing the Pungjin-dong case.

452
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,600
是的 这有什么问题吗
Yes, is there a problem with that?

453
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,230
我在考虑接这个案子
I thought I'd take that case.

454
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,940
-千律师 -怎么了
-Mr. Cheon. -Yes?

455
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,650
看来你打算接一件困难的案子
You're about to take on a difficult case.

456
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,690
你一定会受到很多指责
You'll receive a lot of criticism too.

457
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,910
徐律师负责的时候
When Mr. Seo took on the case,

458
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,070
-他还曾被人叫做恶魔律师 -虽然
-he was called the devil's lawyer. -Well,

459
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,620
我不是因为这种事退出的
that's not why I quit though.

460
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,790
所以我来寻求你的帮助
I came here to see if I could get your help.

461
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,750
只要不违法 我可以尽我所能
As long as there aren't any legal issues, of course, I can.

462
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,210
你为什么要放弃辩护呢
So, why did you withdraw from the case?

463
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:27,800
-千律师 -怎么了
-Mr. Cheon. -Yes?

464
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,930
这个问题是不是有点无礼
Isn't that a bit rude?

465
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,600
你没有事先预约就跑过来
You came here without an appointment.

466
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,730
还直接问我为什么放弃辩护
Now, you're asking me why I withdrew from the case.

467
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,360
是啊 你说得对
Yes, you're right.

468
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,570
对不起 我向你道歉
I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize.

469
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,030
我接受你的道歉
I accept your apology.

470
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,950
你知道金敏宰主张无罪吧
You know that Mr. Kim is pleading not guilty, don't you?

471
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,200
-是的 -他说这是他的父亲干的
-Yes. -He claims that his father did it

472
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,280
并说他的父亲还活着 对吧
and that his father is still alive.

473
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,040
没错
Yes.

474
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,750
你也认为他的父亲还活着吗
Do you think his father is still alive too, Mr. Cheon?

475
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,170
所以我才放弃的
That's why I withdrew.

476
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,340
我只有相信他的父亲还活着 才能接手这个案子
I take on the case as long as I believe he's alive,

477
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,720
但我无法相信
but I couldn't believe that.

478
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,890
所以我对如何为他辩护毫无头绪
So, I couldn't figure out a way to defend Mr. Kim.

479
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,350
不过
Anyway,

480
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,560
你为什么要接这个案子
why are you thinking of taking on this case?

481
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,600
因为我相信他的父亲还活着
Because I believe he's alive.

482
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,530
你相信他的父亲还活着？谁说的
Do you believe he's alive? Says who?

483
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,830
我说的
Says me.

484
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,790
只是还没发现尸体而已
The body simply hasn't been found.

485
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,160
任谁看都是金敏宰 杀害他的父亲后遗弃了尸体
It's obvious that Mr. Kim Minjae killed him and disposed of the body.

486
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,710
你是实习检察官还是实习律师
Are you a probationary judicial officer or my probationary employee?

487
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,840
我现在当然是实习律师
Of course, I am your probationary employee at the moment.

488
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,010
你才工作两个月 就完全把他想成凶手了呢
You've only worked for two months, but you see him as the murderer.

489
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:54,640
那万一明天就发现尸体了呢
What if the body is found tomorrow?

490
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,010
-万一发现了呢 -没错
-If it's found-- -Yes.

491
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,310
-万一发现了呢 -没错
-If it's found-- -Yes.

492
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,560
不会被发现的
It won't be found.

493
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,110
B A E K
B, A, E, K.

494
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,030
这用韩语怎么读
How is that read in Korean?

495
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,990
-白 -你姓什么
-Baek. -What is your last name?

496
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,490

唉唷
Well…

501
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,960
这世上姓白的又不只有一两个
There are so many Baeks out there.

502
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,800
还有谁
Who?

503
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,680
-白种元 -还有呢
-Baek Jongwon. -And?

504
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,480
-白智荣 -还有呢
-Baek Zyoung. -And?

505

508
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,490
还有白胜秀啊 你看过《棒球大联盟》了吗
Oh, there's Baek Seungsu. Did you watch Stove League?

509
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,610
当然了
Of course.

510
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,530
那个超好看 但不知道为什么不出第二季
That was really good. I don't know why they aren't making season two.

511
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,370
你也不知道为什么吗
Don't you know either?

512
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,700
不知道
No, I don't.

513
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,500
这张照片每次看都被帅到
You know, it looks so good every time I see it.

514
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,210
把你放在这里
You can go here.

Of course.

528
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,430
枫津洞怎么这么遭人热议
I keep hearing about Pungjin-dong. Why is it such a hot topic?

529
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,680
你来负责吧
I want you to be in charge.

530
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,890
你不是让我战略性地做选择吗
Didn't you want me to be strategic in my choices?

531
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,140
我负责那件案子干吗
Why would I take that case?

532
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,890
这是你一定能胜诉的案子 百分之百
You can win that case no matter what. No matter what.

533
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,190
百分之百？
No matter what?

534
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,030
凶器和尸体到现在都没有发现
They haven't even found the weapon used in the murder nor the body.

535
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,650
他们很快就能找到的
I'm sure they'll find it soon.

536
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,450
我会叫你负责会败诉的案子吗
Do you think I'd tell you to take a case you'd lose?

537
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,030
而且千智勋接手了这个案子
Also, Cheon Jihun took this case.

538
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,700
他刚刚和玛丽一起来过
He came by with Mari a while ago.

539
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,170
白代表把玛丽送到那里 一定是有缘由的
I'm sure he had a reason for sending Mari there.

540
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,210

You should win that case

541
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,500
趁此机会给他留下好的…
so that you can leave a good impression on Mr. Baek--

Detective, can you please compile the files on the Pungjin-dong case?

543
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,300

No, lunch isn't important right now. I'll buy you something good later.

544
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,270
我还在说话呢 这小子真是的
I was still talking. Geez.

545
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,110
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me right now?

546
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,030
案子也该挑着接
How could you take this case?

547
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,200
你接这种案子想干什么啊
What are you taking this case for?

548
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,580

你看看

He notified the Prosecutors' Office and copied all the related files.

552
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,380
你不就只是见见他吗
You just went to see him.

553
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,800
金敏宰不是凶手
Kim Minjae didn't do it.

554
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,670
-为什么这么说 -为什么
-Why do you say that? -Why?

555
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,640
白实习
Ms. Baek.

556
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,850
你知道我是什么样的人吗
Do you know what kind of person I am?

557
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,770
我是猜出
I'm the person…

558
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,190
《少年侦探宰民》第16卷凶手的人
who guessed the villain of Boy Detective Jaemin, Vol. 16.

559
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,810
你就相信我吧
You can count on me.

560
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,150
我找到了
I figured it out. The villain is…

561
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,610
凶手就是…
I figured it out. The villain is…

562
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,670
白实习
Ms. Baek.

563
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,590
我们从案件发生前一天开始
Let's begin on the day before

564
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,550
一一来梳理吧
the incident occurred.

565
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,630
抱歉
Sorry.

566
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,720
根据检方的记录 5月1日晚上6点
According to the prosecution's records, on May 1st, at 6:00 p.m.,

567
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:07,890
当时 住宅里
in their residence,

568
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,690
有迎来58岁生日的著名画家金春吉
there were the famous artist Kim Chungil who was celebrating his 58th birthday,

569
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,310
他的妻子兼永远画廊馆长柳熙珠
his wife and director of Gallery Yeongwon Yoo Heeju,

570
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,780
他们的子女金秀妍和金敏宰

574
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,160
一共七个人
There were a total of seven people there.

575
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,710
-金画家 生日快乐 -金画家 生日快乐
-Happy Birthday, Mr. Kim. -Happy Birthday, Mr. Kim.

576
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,250
我都让你不要准备这些东西了 这样很兴师动众
I told you not to make a fuss about this.

577
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,250
只要你同意
If you were okay with it,

578
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,300
我很想邀请人们来开个庭院派对
I would've invited people over for a garden party,

579
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,590
但你就是不喜欢出风头
but you don't like to be the center of attention.

580
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,430
画家凭作品说话就行 不用非得见面
An artist speaks through his paintings. There's no need to meet up.

581
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,560
朴记者 他就是这个样子
Mr. Park, this is how he is.

582
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,730
这次也有很多人对他的展会感兴趣
So many people are interested in his exhibition this time as well.

583
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,230
希望大家的关心能持续到拍卖会上
Hopefully, that interest will lead to the auction.

584
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,520
我也会通过报道多多支援你的
I'll support you well through my article, sir.

585
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,110
大家不用做到这个份上
That isn't necessary.

586
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,910
根据韩才淑的陈述
According to Ms. Han Jaesook,

587
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,160
之前他们的关系很和谐
there wasn't any issue before,

588
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,530
但自从金敏宰决定出国留学
but after Mr. Kim Minjae was told to go study abroad,

589
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,750
他与父母的关系就开始恶化了
he started having issues with his parents.

590
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,830
唉唷 你终于解放了
Gosh, you're free now.

591
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:14,870
我真羡慕你
I'm so jealous.

592
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,040
那你要替我去吗
Do you want to go to my place?

593
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,670
什么
What?

594
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,130
算了 我们出去玩吧
Don't mind him. Let's go hang out.

595
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,260
据他的朋友说
According to his friends,

596
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,180
留学是父母强迫他去的 所以金敏宰很不情愿
his parents were forcing him to study abroad, so he didn't want to go.

597
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,980
他乘出租车回到家的时间是 凌晨0点50分
Mr. Kim Minjae took a taxi home and arrived at 00:50 a.m.

598
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,270
你怎么这样对你妈
What are you doing to me?

599
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,480
-怎么了 -喂 金敏宰
-Let go. -Hey, Kim Minjae.

600
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,790
凌晨1点5分 韩才淑目击到 柳熙珠和金敏宰有过争吵
01:05 A.M., HAN JAESOOK SEES YOO HEEJU AND KIM MINJAE ARGUING

601
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,540
此后就没有任何动静
After that, it was pretty quiet.

602
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,300
你不是说策展人和记者 当晚住在另一栋楼了吗
Didn't you say the curator and the journalist stayed at the annex?

603
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,130
他俩没有陈述什么吗
Did the two say anything in particular?

604
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,300
那栋楼和主楼有段距离
The annex was quite far from the main house,

605
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,550
他们说没有听到任何声音
so they didn't hear anything.

606
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,220
那金敏宰呢
Then, what about Kim Minjae?

607
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:15,980
据他的陈述
Well, he testified

608
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,900
他去二楼自己的房间睡觉了
he went upstairs to his room and fell asleep.

609
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,020
那金秀妍呢 她没有听到争吵的声音吗
Then, what about Kim Suyeon? Didn't she hear them fight?

610
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,190
是 她也说自己当时睡着了 没有听到任何声音
No, she didn't hear anything either as she was asleep too.

611
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,950
什么啊 都没有人听到
What? No one heard anything then.

612
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,450
他们怎么会没听到呢
How couldn't they hear anything?

613
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,740
-还有… -难道隔音很好吗
-And-- -Maybe the rooms are soundproof.

614
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,660
可能用了好的建筑材料
Yes, they used good building materials.

615
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,790
我昨天因为邻居争吵的声音没睡好
I didn't sleep well since my neighbors were fighting.

616
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,290
-还有… -报警啊
-And-- -Call the police.

617
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,910
-报警吗 -嗯
-Should I? -Yes.

618
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,290
请集中精神 专注
Please pay attention. Focus.

619
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,460
好 现在开始才是重点
All right. What goes on from now is important.

620
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,550
检方主张在凌晨2点到3点之间
The prosecution thinks that between two to three o'clock,

621
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,140
金敏宰用尚未知的方法杀害父亲后
Mr. Kim Minjae murdered his father in an unknown method…

622
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,390
为了遗弃尸体离开了住宅
and left the house to dispose of the body.

623
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,020
当时 住宅大门的监控
At that time, the CCTV at the gate

624
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,650
拍下了金敏宰乘车出门的画面
caught Mr. Kim Minjae driving away in the car.

625
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,650
检方正在关注此主张
The prosecution is focused on this statement.

626
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,570
他的行车路线你确认到哪里了
How much have you found out about the movement of the car?

627
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,740
确认到了龙虎山隧道
Its location's been confirmed up to Mt. Yongho Tunnel.

628
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,120
据推测他大概在 龙虎山附近待了一个半小时
It is estimated that he stayed around there for one and a half hours.

629
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,830
检方认为他在这段时间里 把他父亲的尸体
Prosecution suspects that he has disposed of his father's body

630
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,960
遗弃在了龙虎山的某处
in the vicinity of Mt. Yongho at that time.

631
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,680
但金敏宰却主张他去龙虎山透透气
But Kim Minjae is claiming that he came to Mt. Yongho to get some air

632
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,220
然后在车上睡着了 是吧
and fell asleep in his car, right?

633
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,680
是的 但检方的主张更有说服力
Yes, but the prosecution's claim is much more convincing.

634
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,060
为什么 不是没有行车记录仪吗
Why? There isn't even dashcam footage.

635
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,480
并不是有说服力的主张
It isn't a convincing claim.

636
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,730
有可能不是没有行车记录仪 而是金敏宰把它销毁了
Maybe it isn't that there wasn't footage but that Mr. Kim got rid of it,

637
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,240
因为他需要处理他父亲的尸体
since he had to get rid of his father's body.

638
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,360
好
Well, all right.

639
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,780
那他父亲的尸体现在在哪 白实习
Then, where is his father's body now, Ms. Baek?

640
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,870
在龙虎山附近
In the vicinity of Mt. Yongho.

641
00:38:58,450 --> 00:38:59,660
他们应该很快就能找到吧
They'll find it in no time.

642
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,210
虽然范围有点广 但只要花时间就能找出来
It's a large area, but it's only a matter of time.

643
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,420
不
No.

644
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,670
他父亲应该还活着躲在某个地方
The father is alive and probably hiding somewhere.

645
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,170
你要一直这样吗
Are you going to be like this?

646
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,630
千律师 你真的相信他还活着吗
Mr. Cheon, do you really believe he's alive?

647
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,140
直到警方找出尸体 我们都要相信他还活着
Until the prosecution finds the body, we have to believe he's alive.

648
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,390
因为我们是他的辩护律师 难道不是吗
We're his attorneys. Don't you think so?

649
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,350
是啊
Yes.

650
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:26,230
韩才淑去市场买东西是凌晨4点
Han Jaesook went to get groceries at four in the morning.

651
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,400
她说这时家里很安静
She says the house was quiet then.

652
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,410
然后凌晨5点左右
And at around 5:00 a.m., Mr. Kim Minjae returns home.

653
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,740
金敏宰回到了家里
And at around 5:00 a.m., Mr. Kim Minjae returns home.

654
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,710
金敏宰
KIM MINJAE

655
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,420
你爸在哪
Where's Father?

656
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,430
什么 你在说什么
Pardon? What are you talking about?

657
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,180
我找不到你爸
I can't find your father.

658
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,680
那你为什么问我
Why are you asking me about that?

659
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:04,730
是啊 也是
Yes, you're right.

660
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:07,610
你快上去睡觉吧 我给他打个电话
Go upstairs and get some sleep. I should try calling him.

661
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,120
柳熙珠馆长 画室
DIRECTOR YOO HEEJU, ATELIER

662
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,710
您拨打的用户暂时无法接通
The person you are calling cannot answer the phone.

663
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,330
天啊 作为一个人 他怎么能做出那种事
How could he do such a thing as a human being?

664
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,790
白实习 给我时间冷静一下
Ms. Baek, can you give me some time to calm down?

665
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,830
千律师 我在发抖
Mr. Cheon, I'm shaking.

666
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,550
凌晨5点30分 金秀妍接到了紧急呼叫
Kim Suyeon gets an urgent call at 5:30 a.m.

667
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,970
凌晨5点40分左右 她离开了家
and leaves the house at 5:40 a.m.

668
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:19,340
金秀妍这次也没看到什么吗
She didn't see anything at that time either?

669
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,720
或听到什么
Or heard anything?

670
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,720
据金秀妍说 因为太暗 她什么都没看到
According to Ms. Kim Sooyeon, she couldn't see anything as it was dark.

671
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,140
而且在她的房间里 完全听不到一楼的声音
And she says she can't hear anything from downstairs in her room.

672
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:31,560
这一家人天天什么都看不到 听不到 真让人疲倦
This family never sees or hears anything. I'm sick and tired of it.

673
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,690
是啊
I know.

674
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,740
之后大概早晨6点左右 韩才淑回到家
After that, Han Jaesook returns home around 6:00 a.m.

675
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,530
发现了倒在画室的柳熙珠馆长
and discovers Director Yoo Heeju who was lying in the atelier.

676
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,290
检方认为在 凌晨5点10分到5点30分之间
The prosecution thinks that

677
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:49,460
金敏宰用刀刺向了母亲柳熙珠
Mr. Kim Minjae stabbed his mother Ms. Yoo Heeju between 5:10 to 5:30 a.m.

678
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,420
但金敏宰却主张
But Kim Minjae is claiming

679
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,920
他回家后先去水槽洗手
he came home, washed his hands at the sink,

680
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,130
喝完水后
drank some water,

681
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,800
就马上回房间了 是吧
and went straight to his room, right?

682
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,100
白实习 你的想法如何
What do you think, Ms. Baek?

683
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,980
如果他真的遗弃了父亲的尸体
If he really disposed of his father's dead body,

684
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,900
他为什么没有动母亲的尸体
why would he leave his mother's body

685
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,520
而是上楼去浴室
and go to his bathroom

686
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,860
安稳地洗了个泡泡浴呢
to peacefully take a bubble bath?

687
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:19,150
他虽然试图处理母亲的尸体
He tried to get rid of her body,

688
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,450
但意外的是金秀妍接到了紧急呼叫
but Ms. Kim Suyeon got an unexpected urgent call

689
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:25,120
在和平常不同的时间出门
and left at a time that was different from usual.

690
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,290
而且韩才淑也快回家了
And Ms. Han Jaesook was about to return home as well.

691
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,750
所以他没有时间处理尸体
He didn't have time to get rid of her body.

692
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,460
况且…
On top of that…

693
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,040
紧急医疗中心

694
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,250
-患者怎么了 -腹部被刀刺了
-Tell me about the patient. -It's an abdominal stabbing.

695
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
妈
Mom.

696
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,760
秀妍
Suyeon.

697
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,350
是敏宰…
Minjae…

698
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,220
-我们没时间了 快把她带进去吧 -医生 请让一下
-We don't have time. Take her inside. -One moment, sir!

699
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,480
请给我肾上腺素和血
Get me epinephrin and blood.

700
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:57,570
是
Yes!

701
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,820
他们的母亲柳熙珠留下的最后一句话
Their mother Yoo Heeju's last words were,

702
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:04,990
秀妍 是敏宰…
"Suyeon, Minjae…"

703
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,080
检方认为这句话是重点
The prosecution is taking note of those words.

704
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,410
他是凶手 就是他
He did it. He sure did.

705
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:16,130
秀妍 是敏宰用刀刺了我
"Suyeon, Minjae… stabbed me with a knife."

706
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,420
人在死去的时候说的话叫什么来着
What do you call one's last words before they die?

707
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:21,260
死亡信息吗
A dying message?

708
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,590
没错 死亡信息
That's it. Dying message.

709
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,430
戏可不是那么演的
That's not how you act.

710
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,930
我还得给你们表演这个吗
Do I have to show you how to do this?

711
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,810
秀妍 是敏宰…
"Suyeon, Minjae…

712
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,570
没看到我就上去了 她也有可能想这么说啊
didn't see me and walked right by me." She might've said that.

713
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,200
我堂堂一个律师怎么还要演戏 真让人害臊
Gosh, why does a lawyer even have to act? How embarrassing.

714
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,990
最适合恶魔律师绰号的人就是你
You are the perfect person to be called the devil's lawyer.

715
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,790
你去法庭那么说吧 看看人们会说什么
Try saying that in court and see what people say.

716
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,500
对啊 人们会怎么说
What do you think people would say?

717
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,830
你有点过分了
You went too far.

718
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,880
不 我的意思是柳熙珠馆长的话
What I'm saying is that Director Yoo's last words can't be used

719
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,380
没有作为证言的效力
as a testimony in court.

720
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,380
而且重要的是我们还没有找到 在案件中使用的刀
Most importantly, we haven't even found the knife that was used.

721
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,880
你们找到刀了吗
Have you found the knife?

722
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:07,640
你怎么知道是刀
How did you know it was a knife?

723
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,640
一般常用的不是刀吗
Don't people normally use a knife?

724
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,770
是你刺的吧
You stabbed her, didn't you?

725
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:18,190
所以你打算怎么证明金敏宰是无辜的
So, how are you going to prove Mr. Kim Minjae's innocence?

726
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,900
刀还没找到 尸体也没被发现
The knife hasn't been found and there's no body.

727
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,610
你打算一直这样赖账吗
Are those your only claims?

728
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,160
白实习 检方为了证明 金敏宰的罪行 现在在做什么
Ms. Baek, what is the prosecution doing to prove Mr. Kim's guilt?

729
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,870
我从刚才开始就一直在说 他们在找死去的金画家的尸体
I have been telling you that they are searching for Artist Kim's dead body.

730
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:33,160
果然是得85分的人会回答的答案
That's certainly an answer from someone who got 85 points.

731
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,080
那我们从现在起要做什么
Then, what should we do from now?

732
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,420
-什么 -什么
-What? -What?

733
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,210
-什么 -就是那个
-What? -That's it.

734
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:40,670
作为金敏宰的辩护律师
As lawyers representing Kim Minjae,

735
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,050
我们要找到活着的金画家
we need to search for the living Artist Kim.

736
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,380
真是不可理喻
What on earth are you--

737
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,590
我们要怎么去找金画家
How are we supposed to find him?

738
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,760
所以我们先去见见熟悉金画家的人吧
That's why we should find someone who knows him well first.

739
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,570
这辆车不能开得安静点吗
Can't this car go any more quietly?

740
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,690
安全行驶
Good driving.

741
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:07,160
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

742
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,160
第一洗衣店

743
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,790
那不是金秀妍吗
Isn't that Ms. Kim Suyeon?

744
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,790
她给我来电话了
She's calling me.

745
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,960
秀妍 我就在前…
Suyeon, I'm right up front--

746
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,210
千律师 我这边突然有一个急救患者
Mr. Cheon, I have a patient that needs urgent care.

00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,680
-你好… -不要喊 很奇怪
-Over here-- -Stop. It's suspicious.

752
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:35,520
她说来了急救患者 要和我明天再见
She said she has an emergency patient and asked to meet tomorrow.

753
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,350
藏起来
Duck!

754
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,730
你就大声宣传我们在这里吧 她走了
Why don't you just tell everyone we're here? She's gone.

755
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,440
我们跟她去看看急救患者是谁
Let's see who her emergency patient is.

756
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,860
没问题
Okay.

757
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,940
欢迎光临
Welcome.

758
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,360
请问预约人尊姓大名
Under whose name is the reservation?

759
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,160
我们今天来得太急 没有预约
Oh, we were in a rush so we couldn't make a reservation.

760
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,290
我们店只在每月的第一周

761
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,710
接受下个月所有客人的用餐预约

762
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,420
今天能不能破例呢
Can't you make an exception for today?

763
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,960
客人 我很抱歉 但还是请回吧
Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry, but would you please leave?

764
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:47,260
你是这里的经理吧
You're the manager, aren't you?

765
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:52,130
虽然这是机密 但我们其实正在进行调查
This is confidential, but we are actually doing an investigation.

766
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,510
调查？那你是警察吗
An investigation? Are you the police?

767
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,810
不 我是侦探
No, I'm a private detective.

768
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,230
侦探？
A detective?

769
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,520
那个…
Well…

770

771
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,680
她在等谁呢
Who is she waiting for?

772
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,850
不知道 我们再等等吧
I'm not sure. Let's wait and see.

773
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,520
不过这里氛围真好 我第一次来这种地方
By the way, it's really nice here. I've never been to a place like this.

774
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,480
千律师 这种地方很贵吧
Mr. Cheon, isn't a place like this pricey?

775
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,110
事务长 怪丢人的
Mr. Sa, stop embarrassing me.

776
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,230
如果你不清楚 就像我一样装装样子
If you don't know, just go along with it like me.

777
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,670
这是哪个国家的语言
What language is this?

778
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,550
法国？白实习 你会说法语吧
French? Don't you know how to speak French, Ms. Baek?

779
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,300
我会说英语 但法语就…
Oh, I speak a little English but not French.

780
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,890
我们还是和那桌点一样的菜吧
Let's just ask for the same thing as that table.

781
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:23,640
好 来份一样的吧
Okay. Ask for the same thing.

782
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:39,370
晚间套餐只有这一种
There's only one dinner course.

783
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,580
我们需要点主食

785
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,210

Are we all okay with medium?

786
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,460

788
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,680

please pass that on.

789
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,610
唉唷 最近的肉好老啊
Gosh, the meat is so tough these days.

790
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,050
-喂 那个人… -那个人…
-Hey, that person is… -That person.

791
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,430
她是住家帮佣韩才淑
She's the housekeeper, Han Jaesook.

792

履历表 姓名 韩才淑
RESUME NAME: HAN JAESOOK

793
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,060
-她俩在谈什么 -白实习 安静
-What are they talking about? -Hush, Ms. Baek.

794
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,150
你安静点 我一点都听不清她们在说什么
Be quiet. I can't hear a thing they're saying.

795
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,360
她们在聊什么呢
What do you think they're talking about?

796
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,490
她见帮佣会有什么事呢
What does she have to talk about with the housekeeper?

797
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,320
难道…
You don't think--

798
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,110
难道是和案件有关的…
You don't think it's about the case, do you?

799
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,530
难道他们在聊和案件有关的事情
You don't think it's about the case, do you?

800
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,850
律师事务所 二楼

我们需要点主食

805
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,330
有牛排 鸭胸肉和羊排 我就点牛排了
There's steak, duck breast, and lamb chop. We'll go with steak.

806
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,870
他到底是何方神圣
Who really is he?

807
00:50:58,920 --> 00:50:59,970
白实习
Ms. Baek.

808
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,300
你不饿吗
Aren't you hungry?

809
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,640
那种地方餐量本来就那么少吗
Do places like that usually give that little?

810
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,180
法国人吃那么少怎么活
How do French people survive eating that little?

811
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:09,810
我饿了
I'm hungry.

812
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,610
我们应该吃炸酱面 偏偏吃了那种东西
We should've eaten jjajangmyeon. Why did we eat that?

这么晚了你要去哪里 你怎么换衣服了
Are you going somewhere at this hour? Why did you change?

What?

819
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,210
现在已经晚上11点了
At 11 o'clock at night?

820
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,550
外面都已经这么黑了 你还要去哪里
It's so dark outside. Where do you think you're going?

821
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,470
你们在开玩笑吗 我们走吧
Are you kidding me right now? Let's get going.

822
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,640
从现在起
From now on,

823
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:49,220
请叫我千侦探
call me Detective Cheon.

824
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,280
还不走吗
Aren't we leaving?

825
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:11,580
千智勋侦探 千侦探
DETECTIVE CHEON JIHUN DETECTIVE CHEON

826
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:17,540
还不走吗
Aren't we leaving?

827
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:26,180
千侦探？
Detective Cheon?

828
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,220
小心有狗 禁止随意出入

829
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,490
怎么了 你不是想来看吗 快走吧
Come on. I thought you wanted to see it for yourself.

830
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,460
我的腿突然抽筋了
Wait. My leg is cramping up.

831
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,090
千律师 你不走吗
Mr. Cheon, aren't you coming?

832
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:07,550
晚上太黑了 我下次再来
It's too dark, so I'll come back later.

833
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,180
你把墨镜摘了吧
Take those sunglasses off.

834
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,100
那我们进去吧
Shall we go in, then?

835
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,180
那个
Hey.

836
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,970
这里
Here.

837
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,560
怎么回事 好像没电了
I think the power went out.

838
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,690
白天我们再来吧
Let's come back during the day.

839
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,610
我完全没有预想到会没电
I didn't expect the power to be out.

840
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,480
是我考虑不足
That was my mistake.

841
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,820
你们别再开玩笑了
Stop messing around.

842
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,920
呼吸声怎么回事
Why is he breathing like that?

843
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:46,230
金敏宰真的不知道吗
Do you think Mr. Kim Minjae really didn't know?

844
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,990
案发时如果家里很暗 而且他还喝醉了
If it was dark and he was drunk at the time,

845
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,240
就无法排除他不知情的可能性
we can't rule out that possibility.

846
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,240
你是因为自己是他的律师 所以在袒护他吗
Aren't you taking his side too much as his lawyer?

847
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,990
我也觉得有可能
I think it is possible.

848
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:00,040
金秀妍说她没有在房间里听到争吵声
Ms. Kim Suyeon said she didn't hear the fighting from her room.

849
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,170
我们去确认一下
Let's check.

850
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,670
事务长
Mr. Sa.

851
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,750
我自己？
By myself?

852
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,590
我不要
I don't want to.

853
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,680
玛丽
Mari.

854
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,760
什么
What?

855
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,970
应该是想要确认的人上去看看吧
The person who wants to check should go upstairs.

856
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,680
你上去吧
You should go, Mr. Cheon.

857
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,690
不可以
No.

858
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,230
-为什么 -我害怕
-Why not? -I'm scared.

859
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,230
那我和事务长一起上去 可以了吧
I'll go upstairs with Mr. Sa, okay?

860
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,820
-不可以 -为什么
-No. -Why not?

861
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:28,860
那就只剩我一个人了
I'll be left alone.

862
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:31,450
天啊 那我自己一个人上去 这样总行了吧
My goodness. Fine, I'll go upstairs by myself. Are you happy?

863
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,570
可以
Yes.

864
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,270
现在都几点了 你怎么才回来
Do you know what time it is? Why are you so late?

865
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,650
偶尔也有可能啊 你管我干吗
It can happen. Why do you care?

866
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:09,070
你这个家伙
You jerk!

867
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,690
-妈 我… -白实习
-Mother, I-- -Ms. Baek!

868
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,030
你能听见吗
Can you hear us?

869
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:17,700
看来听不到
It doesn't seem like she can.

870
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,200
白实习 如果听不到你就回答我
Ms. Baek, tell us if you can't hear us.

871
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,910
她都听不到 怎么回答你
How can she answer you if she can't hear you?

872
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:05,750
千律师 外面有人
Mr. Cheon, someone is out there!

873
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:14,840
千律师
Mr. Cheon.

874
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,920
待在这里
Stay here.

《平价正义》
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

876
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,490
像金敏宰的主张一样
As Kim Minjae claimed,

877
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,580
父亲杀害母亲后 消失的可能性…
the likelihood that his father killed his mother and disappeared is…

878
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:35,290
金敏宰并非你的亲弟弟 你相信他所有的话吗
He isn't even your real brother. Do you believe everything he says?

879
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,290
他连虫子也杀不了
He can't even kill a bug.

880
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:37,580
是我杀的
I'm the one who killed.

881
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,920
那会是金敏宰的真实面目吗
Is that Mr. Kim Minjae's true self?

882
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,760
-你到底为什么那么做 -只有我感到奇怪吗
-Why on earth did you do that? -Am I strange?

883
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,220
事情好像开始有点不对劲了
Something isn't quite right.

884
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,340
大家都很可疑
Everyone is suspicious. They're hiding something.

885
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,800
他们在隐瞒着什么
Everyone is suspicious. They're hiding something.

886
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:49,640
我好像终于解开谜题了
I think I finally solved the mystery.
