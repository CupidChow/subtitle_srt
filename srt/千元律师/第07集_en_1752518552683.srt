千智勋律师是个什么样的人啊
What is Mr. Cheon like?

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,380
你就告诉我他当检察官时怎么样吧
Tell me how he was as a prosecutor.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,920
我们是从首尔中央地方检察厅来的
We're from Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

8
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,300
-你晚来了一步 -你比我想象中更果断
-You're a little too late. -You're bolder than I thought.

9
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,640
现以销毁证据的嫌疑将你紧急逮捕
Mr. Choi Kitae, you're under arrest for destroying evidence.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,890
只要我打一通电话 你们就都完了
You guys are all dead with this one phone call.

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,810
喂 混蛋
Hey, you jerk!

12
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,980
你当那是什么地方 竟敢随便去
How dare you go there?

13
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,230
好好听上级的话 你才能出人头地
You'll go far if you listen to your boss.

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,770
如果我们现在把他带回去 就和他说的一样 我们得马上放了他
We'll have to release him immediately as he said.

15
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,690
我觉得你要变得有名一点 民赫
I think you should become famous, Minhyeok.

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,070
你这家伙为什么会出现在那里啊
Why would you stand there, you jerk?

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,530
你现在打算怎么办啊
What are you going to do now?

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,450
他们会请水平高超的律师
They will hire an above-average lawyer.

20
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,790
告诉他们不用让着我
Tell them to come at me.

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,500
就应该把他那样的家伙抓起来 让他赎罪 不是吗
Shouldn't a jerk like him be made to pay for his crimes?

22
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,870
对 当然了 但这里是男卫生间
Yes, you're right. But this is the men's room.

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,710
喂 是白法律事务所 我们怎么办
It's Mr. Baek's firm. What do we do?

24
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,920
我们又得和老头们较量一番了
I guess we have to go another round with the old men.

25
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,210
原来她是对方的律师啊
She was their lawyer.

26
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,090
李律师 你在耍我吗
Excuse me. Were you playing with me?

27
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,260
我们去喝杯咖啡吧
Do you want to get some coffee?

28
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,380
我刚才说的话是发自内心的
I meant… what I said earlier.

29
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,970
犯了罪的人就应该受到应有的惩罚
The person who committed a crime must be punished accordingly.

30
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,010
这就是我的想法
That's what I think.

31
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,060
你一定要赢下这场官司
Please win this trial.

32
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,520
我作为律师也会全力以赴
As an attorney, I'll do my best as well.

在结束对JQ集团秘密资金的调查之前
Prior to concluding the investigation of the JQ Group slush fund,

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,950
检方以销毁证据为由
the prosecution arrested President Choi Kitae

41
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,030
紧急逮捕了崔基泰代表
for destroying evidence.

42
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,750
我们先让他免于拘留了
For now, we stopped them from arresting him.

43
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,250
检方不是已经决定 以财务负责人贪污潜逃
They were supposed to close the case

44
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,460
检方不是已经决定 以财务负责人贪污潜逃
saying that a finance officer embezzled the funds and disappeared.

45
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,830
来结束调查吗
saying that a finance officer embezzled the funds and disappeared.

46
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,090
是的 我们都接到了这样的通知
Yes, that's what they told us.

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,630
那他们为什么又突然这样
Then why are they doing this now, all of a sudden?

48
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,890
这个嘛 他们一定是有了新发现
They must've found something new.

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,390
闯祸的检察官是谁
Who's the prosecutor that caused the trouble?

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,020
是
Yes.

51
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,980
就是之前负责 扣押搜查的千智勋检察官
It's Prosecutor Cheon Jihun. He was in charge of search and seizure.

52
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,980
他在高中毕业前一直住在法国巴黎
He lived in Paris, France with his mother until high school.

53
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,150
和他一起生活的母亲去世后 就回到了韩国
After his mother passed away, he returned to Korea.

54
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,820
还真是特别
What a special case.

55
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,030
他和民赫是研修院同窗 所以我打听了一下
I looked into him because he trained with Minhyeok at the institute together.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,660
他在韩国没有其他家人
He has no other family in Korea.

57
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,870
也几乎没有同学或朋友
He has hardly any friends or schoolmates here either.

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,870
他太我行我素 连检方那边都放弃他了
He's so stubborn that even the prosecution gave up on him.

59
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,420
这次高层也对此一无所知
It seems the senior officials had no idea about this either.

60
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,010
所以你接下来打算如何应对
So, how do you plan to respond?

61
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,800
就目前的情况来看 我不知道检方手里握着什么牌
Right now, we don't know what the prosecution has.

62
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,930
因此最有效的应该是 主张消失的杨尚久贪污
So it will be most effective to say Yang Sanggu has embezzled and disappeared.

63
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,640
崔代表
President Choi

64
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,690
想在尽可能不出席的情况下接受调查
prefers to be interviewed without attending as much as possible.

65
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,230
我们能做到只让他接受书面调查吗
Can we ask for a written investigation?

66
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,940
从千智勋检察官的性格来看 我想这很难
I think it would be difficult

67
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,740
从千智勋检察官的性格来看 我想这很难
considering Prosecutor Cheon Jihun's style.

68
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,780
你别太担心
Don't worry too much.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,580
明天我打个电话
I will make a call tomorrow.

70
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,880
是谁制造舆论说检方过度调查
Who drove the public opinion that the investigation is overly harsh?

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,640
犯了罪就要受到应有的惩罚 这才是正义
If one has committed a crime, they must be punished accordingly. That's justice.

72
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,350
请大家帮助我们建设 一个正义尚存的韩国
Please help us to ensure justice lives in Korea.

73
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,650
受到应有的惩罚…
Must be punished accordingly…

74
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,150
才是正义
That's justice.

75
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,370
是 前辈
Yes, Mr. Seo.

76
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,830
请相信我
You can count on me.

77
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
那就说好了 崔基泰代表不用出席 只接受书面调查
Then President Choi Kitae will do a written investigation without attendance.

78
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,830
我们找个时间喝一杯吧
Let's get a drink sometime. Is Minhyeok doing well?

79
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,540
我家民赫表现还不错吧
Let's get a drink sometime. Is Minhyeok doing well?

80
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,000
徐检察官吗
Do you mean Prosecutor Seo?

81
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,550
是的
Yes.

82
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,850
检察

83
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,220
你们对崔基泰的调查 就以书面形式进行
For Choi Kitae, we will do a written investigation.

84
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,890
-好的 -不行
-Yes. -We can't.

85
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,020
不行？
We can't?

86
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,820
当初你们找不到杨尚久
If you couldn't find Yang Sanggu,

87
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,740
就不应该把事情闹大
you shouldn't have made this mess. What if he's gone off and died?

88
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
如果他死在别处了呢
you shouldn't have made this mess. What if he's gone off and died?

89
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,200
你要一直调查下去 直到找到他为止吗
Are you gonna investigate until you find him?

90
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,990
听起来像是你盼着他死
It sounds like that's what you want.

91
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,530
什么
What?

92
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,290
你这家伙疯了吗
Have you lost your mind?

93
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,500
他写好了遗书 然后就消失了
He wrote a will and disappeared.

94
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,830
他肯定死在某个地方了
He must've died somewhere!

95
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,840
不然你就找到他 把他带来
Then why don't you go find him and bring him in?

96
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,850
次长 对不起
We're sorry, Deputy Prosecutor General.

97
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,680
我们先走了 走吧
Come on, let's go.

98
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,530
你不好好教育后辈们 在搞什么啊
You better train your juniors better.

99
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,280
好 我会的
Yes, sir. Understood.

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,790
首尔中央地方检察厅
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

101
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,290
你被训得很惨吗
-Did you get yelled at a lot? -Yes, a lot.

102
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,000
嗯 很惨
-Did you get yelled at a lot? -Yes, a lot.

103
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,170
你们打算一直到处闯祸吗
Are you going to keep causing trouble?

104
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,510
对不起 但是前辈
I'm sorry. But Yejin,

105
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,300
我们不是到处闯祸 而是收拾残局…
we weren't causing trouble. We were trying to fix the--

106
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,390
-喂 -我只是不理解
-Hey. -I just don't understand.

107
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,350
所有人都知道崔基泰干了坏事
Everybody knows Choi Kitae committed a crime.

108
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,220
我们都知道 所以呢
We do. So what?

109
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,520
所以为了满足他们的贪婪 我们就要愧对良心
So is it right to starve our conscience to feed their greed?

110
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,140
-这样对吗 -不对
So is it right to starve our conscience to feed their greed?

111
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,890
-这样对吗 -不对
No!

112
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,230
当然不对
Of course, not.

113
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,200
你要去哪
-Where are you going? -I'm going to feed my conscience.

114
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,360
让自己的良心无愧
-Where are you going? -I'm going to feed my conscience.

115
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,410
等等我
Wait for me.

116
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,140
这是杨尚久给你的？
Mr. Yang Sanggu gave this to you?

117
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,390
是的 他让我好好保管
Yes. He told me to keep it safe.

118
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,690
他不会有不好的想法吧
Do you think he did something bad?

119
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,520
孩子们都以为他出差了
The kids think he's on a business trip.

120
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,650
千检察官 请你一定要找到我的老公
Prosecutor Cheon, please find my husband.

121
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,860
好 我知道了
Yes, of course.

122
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,670
你们回来了 怎么样了
You're back. What happened?

123
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,920
崔基泰的出席申请批下来了
Choi Kitae's attendance was approved.

124
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,470
但是只有一次
But it's only for one time.

125
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,550
没问题吗
-Is that okay? -Mm.

126
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,100
一次
Once...

127
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,180
就够了
is enough.

128
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,980
真的吗 怎么做
Really? How?

129
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,030
我付给你数亿韩元的律师费 你连这个都处理不了吗
I paid you, lawyers, hundreds of millions. Why can't you take care of it?

130
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,740
我们已经达成协议 只让你出席这一次
We agreed to a one-time attendance today.

131
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,950
我不想再看见那个臭小子了
I don't want to see that lunatic again.

132
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,410
除了我们事先练过的问题 其他你一概不用回答
Don't answer questions other than the ones we practiced in advance.

133
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,620
我不知道 我不记得了 我只回答这两句就行吧
"I don't know. I don't remember." Do I need to say just those two things?

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,870
如果遇到了让你为难的问题 你行使沉默权就行
And for other tricky questions, you can exercise the right to silence.

135
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,500
你没有什么瞒着我吧
Do you have anything you're keeping from me?

136
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,090
你不相信我吗
Don't you believe me?

137
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,510
是的 我不相信你
No, I do not believe you.

138
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,180
你真的是我的律师吗
Are you sure you're my lawyer?

139
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,560
正因为我是你的律师 所以才不相信你
That's why I don't believe you.

140
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,600
如果连我都被你背后捅一刀
If you betray me as well, then I really won't be able to defend you.

141
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,020
到时候就真的没有办法为你辩护了
If you betray me as well, then I really won't be able to defend you.

142
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,810
我有什么可隐瞒的
What else is there to hide?

143
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,020
我没有
There's nothing.

144
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,060
我手下有两千名员工
I have 2,000 people working for me.

145
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,900
我怎么知道他们每个人都在做什么
How can I keep track of what each one is doing?

146
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,190
你们不该抓我
It's not me.

147
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,360
应该去抓那个贪污公款后潜逃的家伙
Go after that jerk who embezzled the company money and disappeared.

148
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,280
那样的话 你的误会也会消除
That will clear up your misunderstanding.

149
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,120
那家伙叫什么来着
What was the name of that jerk?

150
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,000
杨尚久科长
It's Manager Yang Sanggu.

151
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,540
没错 杨科长
That's right, Manager Yang.

152
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,500
我听说他写好遗书后就消失了
I heard he disappeared after writing a will.

153
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,960
那他肯定死在某个地方了
Then he must be dead somewhere.

154
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,670
请你小心说话
Please be careful what you say.

155
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,090
好
Okay.

156
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,010
你为什么杀了杨尚久科长
Mm, why did you kill Manager Yang?

157
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,470
-千检察官？-什么
-Mr. Cheon? -What?

158
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,560
抱歉 我说错了
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

159
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,060
你为什么让杨尚久科长
Why did you tell Manager Yang Sanggu...

160
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,640
去死
to die?

161
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,860
天啊
Gosh.

162
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,030
你不是检察官 是作家啊
You aren't a prosecutor. You're a novelist.

163
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
小说写得不错嘛
That's some piece of fiction.

164
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,030
-崔代表 -你有证据吗
-Sir. -Do you have proof?

165
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,000
那你见过杨尚久科长吧
Then have you met Manager Yang Sanggu?

166
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,620
你不必回答
You don't have to answer that.

167
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,080
这个嘛 杨科长…
Let's see, have I ever met…

168
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,710
我见过他吗
Manager Yang?

169
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,760
我应该很久没见过他了
I believe it's been quite a while since I saw him.

170
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,810
自从他潜逃后 我就没再见过他
I haven't seen him since he disappeared.

171
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,180
这样啊 你和他通过电话吗
I see. What about talking to him on the phone?

172
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,940
电话？
On the phone?

173
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,520
对 在杨尚久科长死前
Yes. Before Manager Yang Sanggu died.

174
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,230
你们通过最后一次电话
You talked to him last.

175
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,770
那个啊
Oh, that.

176
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,820
他打电话过来道歉
He had called to say he was sorry.

177
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,150
毕竟他私吞了数百亿韩元的公款
He stole tens of billions from the company.

178
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,910
所以我让他自首
I told him to turn himself in.

179
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,990
钱重要吗 人才是最重要的
A person's life is more important than money.

180
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,410
不是吗 千检察官
Isn't that right, Prosecutor?

181
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:12,750
所以你就给了杨尚久的老婆…
I guess that's why you gave his wife…

182
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,380
五亿韩元啊 你看看这个
five hundred million won. Take a look at this.

183
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,930
你想啊 我手底下的员工死了
I mean, one of my employees died.

184
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,890
我怎么能立刻翻脸不认人
I can't just pretend I don't know about it.

185
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,020
即使他贪污了数百亿韩元？
Even though he embezzled tens of billion won?

186
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,770
贪污归贪污 我不是那么无情的人
Embezzlement is embezzlement. But I'm not a heartless person.

187
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,610
他的家人得继续生活啊
His family has to live on.

188
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,190
我给的太少了吗
Maybe I gave too little.

189
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,120
智勋这家伙在想什么
What is Jihun thinking?

190
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,330
不过
But…

191
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,250
打电话也有罪吗
was it a crime to talk to him on the phone?

192
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,970
打电话没罪 不过…
Talking to him on the phone is not a crime, but…

193
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,810
你让他要么跳楼 要么上吊
it could be a crime to tell him

194
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,520
让他随便选 这可能有罪
to either fall off the building or hang himself.

195
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,450
崔代表 我会承认是我干的 不管几年 我会去坐牢
Mr. Choi, I will tell him that I did it and go to jail for however many years.

196
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,070
崔代表 我会承担所有责任
Mr. Choi, I will take all of the blame.

197
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,370
所以求你了
So, please…

198
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,870
-你会承担所有责任？-对
-You'll take all of the blame? -Yes.

199
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,460
好 就这么办吧
Fine. Let's do that.

200
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,300
我会好好照顾你的家人
I will take good care of your family.

201
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,890
谢谢你 崔代表
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Choi.

202
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,640
你不用谢我
You don't have to be that grateful.

203
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,180
应该是我感谢你才对
I'm the one who should be grateful.

204
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,980
你不是说要承担所有责任嘛
You said you will take all of the blame with you.

205
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,480
是的 那么…
Yes, then…

206
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,900
你要么跳楼
You can fall off a building…

207
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,980
要么上吊
or hang yourself.

208
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,360
你随便选吧
Do as you please.

209
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,160
你看
See?

210
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,960
我有证据
I do have evidence.

211
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,880
千检察官
Mr. Cheon.

212
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,880
我们休息一会儿再继续吧
Let's take a short break.

213
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,030
他刚才说的话是什么意思
What is he talking about?

214
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,280
我得了解清楚才能制定对策
I need to know so I can plan a response.

215
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,660
我让他去死
I told him to kill himself.

216
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
什么
What?

217
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,660
我让杨尚久去死
I told Yang Sanggu to kill himself. I thought that would cover it up.

218
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,250
我想那样就能掩盖这起案件
I told Yang Sanggu to kill himself. I thought that would cover it up.

219
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,750
你怎么现在才告诉我
-Why are you telling me this now? -I thought you didn't believe me anyway.

220
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,920
反正你又不相信我
-Why are you telling me this now? -I thought you didn't believe me anyway.

221
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,960
那家伙肯定是在什么地方听到的
He must've heard it somewhere.

222
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,460
他没有证据
He has no proof.

223
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,380
杨科长 你现在这么说 但如果你在庭审中承认是我指使的
Mr. Yang, you say this now, but you may confess that I gave the order.

224
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,390
我的面子要往哪里搁啊
What would that do to my image?

225
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,970
你不是说要承担所有责任嘛
You said you will take all of the blame with you.

226
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,520
是的 那么…
Yes, then…

227
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,980
-你要么跳楼 -这是什么
-You can fall off a building... -What is this?

228
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,230
要么上吊
...or hang yourself.

229
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,230
你随便选吧
Do as you please.

230
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,190
那家伙…
That bastard…

231
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,030
是怎么拿到这个的
How did he get this?

232
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,700
李律师 我会怎么样
Ms. Lee, what's going to happen to me?

233
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,370
会涉嫌教唆自杀吗
Is it something like abetting suicide?

234
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,830
-不会 -不会吗
-No. -It's not?

235
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,250
也是
That makes sense.

236
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,000
让他去死 他就去死的人才是傻瓜 不是吗
It's stupid to kill yourself just because someone tells you to, right?

237
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,960
如果这段录音属实
If this recording is true,

238
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,420
根据《刑法》第253条 这将构成胁迫他人自杀罪
it will be a crime of suicide by force in Article 253 of the Criminal Law.

239
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,640
胁迫…什么 很严重吗
Suicide by force… What is it? Is it bad?

240
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,810
不 不是很严重
No, it's not that bad.

241
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,890
那就好
That's good.

242
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,900
就只会受到和杀人罪差不多的惩罚
The punishment will be similar to that of murder.

243
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,070
杀人罪？
Murder?

244
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,690
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

245
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,860
人又不是我杀的 这太荒唐了
That doesn't make sense. I didn't kill him.

246
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,740
你没有办法吗
Is there no other way?

247
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,660
你说啊
Is there?

248
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,500
李律师
Ms. Lee!

249
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,800
杨尚久？
Mr. Yang Sanggu?

250
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,100
杨尚久
Mr. Yang Sanggu.

251
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,520
你怎么…
How did you…

252
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,940
千检察官 你是怎么找到我的
Mr. Cheon, how did you find me?

253
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,950
杨尚久 你认为这样做 就能解决所有问题吗
Mr. Yang Sanggu, did you think you could solve everything by doing this?

254
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,700
并不是
It wasn't that,

255
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,670
但如果我活着回去 他会杀了我
but if I go back alive, he will kill me.

256
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,380
是谁
Who will?

257
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,920
崔基泰代表
President Choi Kitae.

258
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,340
他完全有可能这么做
He is capable of doing that and more.

259
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,590
不会的
That's probably not true.

260
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,140
什么
What?

261
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,220
他见到你 反而会比任何人都高兴
He will actually be happy to see you, more than anyone.

262
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,350
他见到我会高兴？
He will be happy to see me?

263
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,900
对 我可以向你保证
Yes. I can promise you that.

264
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,690
杨尚久 这由你来决定
It's your decision, Mr. Yang.

265
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,240
是就这么死在这里
You can die here like this,

266
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,780
还是回去和崔基泰一起接受惩罚
or return and pay the price with Choi Kitae.

267
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,370
这完全是你的选择
The choice is solely yours.

268
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:03,010
既然你见到他了 就应该想尽办法劝他回来
I mean, you should've talked him into coming back.

269
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,140
你怎么就这么回来了
Why didn't you?

270
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,930
你不是检察官 简直是个疯子
He's not a prosecutor. He's a crazy bastard!

271
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,600
你之前不是还让他去死吗
You told him to kill himself.

272
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,900
如果你想让他回来 那就祈祷吧
You should pray if you want Mr. Yang Sanggu to come back.

273
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,320
你这是要干什么
What are you trying to do?

274
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,860
如果他不回来的话会怎么样
What happens if he doesn't come back?

275
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,950
说话啊
Tell me!

276
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,910
崔基泰
Mr. Choi Kitae.

277
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,000
我们以胁迫他人自杀的嫌疑 将你紧急逮捕
I arrest you for the charge of suicide of Yang Sanggu by force.

278
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,290
你有权保持沉默 也有权请律师…
You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to a lawyer…

279
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,550
你应该不用请律师了 你已经有了
I guess you don't have to hire a lawyer since you have one already.

280
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,340
-把他带走 -是
-Take him away. -Yes, sir.

281
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,560
李律师 你想办法救救我
Ms. Lee, do something.

282
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,430
我没杀他啊
I didn't kill him.

283
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,100
你现在说的话 可能会在庭审中对你不利
Whatever you say now can work against you at trial.

284
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:00,700
检察

285
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,500
杨科长
Mr. Yang.

286
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:14,380
你还活着啊
You were alive.

287
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,880
你怎么现在才来
What took you so long?

288
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,510
来得好 你来得真是太及时了
I'm glad you came back. I'm really glad.

289
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,590
你救了我一命
You saved me, Mr. Yang.

290
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,220
那我不会被指控杀人了吧
Does this mean I'm not charged with murder?

291
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,190
你来得好
I'm so glad you're back!

292
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,860
-你没事吧 -是的
-Are you okay? -Yes.

293
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,910
你来得好
I'm glad you're here.

294
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,410
但如果我活着回去
If I go back alive,

295
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,540
他会杀了我
he will kill me.

296
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,120
不会的
That's probably not true.

297
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,910
什么
What?

298
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,800
他见到你 反而会比任何人都高兴
He will actually be happy to see you more than anyone.

299
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,380
他见到我会高兴？
He will be happy to see me?

300
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,800
对 我可以向你保证
Yes, I can promise you that.

301
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
杨尚久
Mr. Yang Sanggu.

302
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,060
解决问题的方式有很多种
There are many ways to solve a problem.

303
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,480
因为陷入了最绝望的时刻
When you are in the most desperate situation,

304
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,110
你就放弃你承受不了的那条活路
is it the best choice

305
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,440
这是最好的选择吗
to just give up on everything that you can't handle?

306
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,750
杨尚久回来了
Yang Sanggu has returned.

307
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:45,340
《平价正义》
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

308
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,430
首尔中央地方法院
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

309
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,560
-来了 -他来了
-There he is. -There he comes.

310
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,190
-你承认所有指控吗 -你现在心情如何
-Do you admit to everything? -What are your thoughts?

311
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,610
请你说句话 大家都想知道
Everyone wants to know. Please say something.

312
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,950
-你对判决怎么看 -请你说句话
-What do you think of the verdict? -Do you have anything to say?

313
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,490
请你说句话
Can you give a statement?

314
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,990
-你承认指控吗 -你承认吗
-Do you admit to the charges? -Do you agree?

315
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,540
是的 我承认所有指控
Yes. I admit to all of the charges.

316
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,410
但至少我没有杀人
It's not like I killed a man.

317
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,710
-这是什么意思 -这话是什么意思
-What does that mean? -What do you mean?

318
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,540
-崔基泰 -你再说几句吧
-Mr. Choi Kitae! -Can you comment on that?

319
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,880
-崔基泰 -请再说几句
-Mr. Choi Kitae! -Any other comments?

320
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,860
就是这里吗
Is this the place?

321
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,110
我说过会请你喝酒 可没说会请你喝很贵的酒
I told you I would buy you a drink. I never said it would be expensive.

322
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,450
那样会违反《禁止不正当请托法》
I don't want to violate the Improper Solicitation Act.

323
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,120
我说要打赌请客喝酒 可没说要和你一起喝
I said I would wager a drink. I didn't say I would drink with you.

324
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,330
你要这么不讲情面吗
So you will be difficult.

325
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,540
不过严格来说 我没有输
Technically speaking, I didn't lose.

326
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,460
因为在那天之后 他换了律师
He changed his lawyer after that day.

327
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,340
所以你认为如果你继续为他辩护
Do you think the outcome would've been different

328
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,090
结果会有所不同吗
if you had stayed on as his lawyer?

329
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,010
这个嘛
Hmm. I'm not sure.

330
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,470
不会
No.

331
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,890
阿姨 我们要生啤酒和一盘明太鱼干
Ma'am, can we have draft beers and a plate of dried pollack?

332
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,060
好的
Sure.

333
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,520
你在干什么 至少应该让我来点下酒菜吧
What are you doing? Shouldn't I at least choose the food?

334
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,530
你不喜欢明太鱼干吗
Don't you like dried pollack?

335
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,820
我不是不喜欢…
It's not that I don't like dried pollack…

336
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,200
你没吃过吧 就像你没喝过自动贩卖机里的咖啡
You've never had it, just like coffee from a vending machine.

337
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,420
怎么会这样
How can that be?

338
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,840
你该不会挑食吧
Is it because you're a picky eater?

339
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,630
我吃过明太鱼干
I've had dried pollack before.

340
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,310
吃明太鱼干吧
Have some dried pollack.

341
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,870
不过千检察官
So, Mr. Cheon.

342
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,590
如果杨尚久真的不回来 你打算怎么办
What were you going to do if Mr. Yang Sanggu never came back?

343
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,050
就这么任由他自杀吗
Would you have left him to die?

344
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,260
对任何人来说 做选择都很困难 不是吗
Making a choice is hard for anyone.

345
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,640
不管再怎么困难
No matter how hard it is,

346
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,980
别人都不能替你做出选择
-others can't make the choice for you. -Aah.

347
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,690
你真的是检察官吗
Are you sure you're a prosecutor?

348
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,570
对 没错 你真的是律师吗
Yes, I'm sure. Are you sure you're a lawyer?

349
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,030
怎么 我看起来不像律师吗
Don't I look like a lawyer?

350
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,910
不像
No, you don't.

351
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,170
原来你会笑啊
You do know how to smile.

352
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,040
你刚才笑了 对吧
Didn't you just crack a smile?

353
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,630
还有人不会笑吗
Is there anyone who can't smile?

354
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,640
我就是觉得很新奇
I was just surprised you did.

355
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,180
吃明太鱼干呢
You eat dried pollack

356
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,690
要像这样把头去掉 剖开肚子
by breaking off the head and tearing open the belly like this.

357
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,040
然后干杯
And cheers.

358
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,170
好
Sure.

359
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,190
怎么样 好吃吧
How is it? Isn't it good?

360
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180

Mr. Cheon.

361
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,510
我要走这边
I have to go this way.

362
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,060
好 那你慢走
Okay. Good night, then.

363
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
千检察官 你不谈恋爱吗
Don't you ever go on a date?

364
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,530
是的 不谈 怎么了
No, I don't. Why do you ask?

365
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,160
我觉得我会谈
Because I think I will.

366
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,460
好的 那祝你恋爱顺利
Okay. Hope it goes well, then.

367
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,590
你打算继续调查吗
Are you going to continue the investigation?

368
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,840
我想崔基泰不会开口
I don't think Choi Kitae will talk.

369
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,640
如果我查到崔基泰就结案 那我当初就不会开始调查
I wouldn't have started the investigation if I was going to stop at Choi Kitae.

370
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,980
我一定会查到秘密资金的流向
I'm going to find out where he siphoned that slush fund.

我们是那种给对方 买杯咖啡也不行的关系吗
Aren't we close enough to buy each other coffee?

386
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
什么
What?

387
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,230
关系？
Close enough?

388

我还以为我们变亲近点了呢
I thought we got a little close.

389

什么 这样啊
"What? I see. What?"

392
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,960
你除了这些 就不会说别的吗
Is that all you know how to say?

393
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,330
不是
No.

394
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,800
这是你第二次笑
That was your second smile.

395
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,850
等你第三次笑出来的时候
If I make you smile for the third time,

396
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,730
你要不要和我交往
will you go out with me?

397
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,450
所以他们后来怎么样了
So, what happened to them?

398
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,170
你对智勋感兴趣吗
Are you interested in Jihun?

399
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,420

Yejin, what are you saying? That's ridiculous. That permed hair…

400
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,920
是吧 那就好
Right? That's a relief.

401
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,840
怎么了
Why?

402
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,430

There's a reason.

403
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,600
喝酒吧
Drink up.

404
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,610
那千律师进行的调查后来怎么样了
What happened to the investigation that Mr. Cheon was conducting?

405
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,440
崔基泰直到最后也没有开口
Choi Kitae never talked until the end.

406
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,110
智勋当然是继续进行调查了
Jihun continued with the investigation.

407
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,450
你没见过洗钱的人？
You never saw the one who laundered the money?

408
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,500
对
No.

409
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,710
每次我去崔基泰代表指定的地点 那里都会停着一辆车
There was a car waiting each time I went to a place Mr. Choi told me.

我从来没有见过那个人的脸
I never saw the face of the person.

Did you see the license plate?

412
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,620

很抱歉我没能帮上忙
I'm really sorry for not being much help.

414
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,160
没关系
That's okay.

415
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:09,970
如果那个人坐在车上
If there was someone in the car,

416
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,640
那他应该看到你了
that person must've seen you.

417
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,600
是的 应该是吧
Yes, probably.

418
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,860
唉唷 你明天来一趟吧
Come in tomorrow, just for a while.

金社长 我都说了和你无关
This has nothing to do with Mr. Kim.

420
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,450
如果和你有关 我们早就签发搜查令了
If it did, we would've gotten the warrant already.

421
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,030
你还不知道我们千检察官吗

你就从头到尾看一遍就行
Just look through from start to finish.

628
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,860
你可以止步于此
You can stop here.

629
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:23,650
你不能调查你的父亲

00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,730
在你预想的事情当中 出现了最糟糕的情况

00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,580
在预想的事情当中 出现最糟糕的情况？

644
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,500
你能多说一点吗
Can you tell me a little more?

645
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:04,300
我可能要调查我最尊敬的人
I might have to investigate someone I respect the most.

646
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,600
你应该很想避开吧
I guess you wish you could avoid it.

647
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,440
你别提前担心
Don't worry in advance.

648
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:22,610
也有可能不会出现那种情况啊
That situation might not come true.

649
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,480
如果出现了呢
What if it does?

650
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,910
如果出现的话
If it does?

651
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,200
换作是我…
If it were me…

652
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,410
我会进行调查
I'd go ahead with the investigation.

653
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,540
这是对我最尊敬之人的礼貌
That would be courtesy for the person I respect the most.

654
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,770
喂？智勋
Yes, Jihun.

655
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,150
你现在要过来吗
You are coming right now?

656
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,690
是的 爸
Yes, Father.

657
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,660

00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,740
好 我等你
Okay. I will wait for you.

659
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:53,950
智勋
Jihun.

660
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,490
快进来
Welcome.

661
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,990
你吃晚饭了吗
What about dinner?

662
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,460
你还没吃啊
You must not have eaten.

663
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,460
走 我们快进去吧
Come on, let's go in.

664
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:05,790
爸
Father.

665
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,040
什么
Hmm?

666
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,550
有那么多好吃的 你怎么想吃这个
There are other good things to eat. Why did you want this?

667
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,190
我小时候
When I was little…

668
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,310
因为你不在家
Because you weren't home.

669
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,610
每当我缠着妈说我想你的时候
When I whined that I missed you,

670
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,700
她就会给我买炸酱面吃
Mom always bought me jjajangmyeon.

671
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,160
但是我
But I…

672
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:41,870
真的很讨厌它
really hated it.

673
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:45,670
我见不到你 但是能吃到炸酱面
Having jjajangmyeon instead of seeing you…

674
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,710
让我觉得我是用你换来了炸酱面
It felt like exchanging jjajangmyeon for you.

675
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,930
我很好奇和你一起吃炸酱面 会是什么味道
I wanted to know what jjajangmyeon would taste like if I had it with you.

676
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,690
真的特别好吃
It's really good.

677
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,820
好
Yes.

678
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,190
快吃吧
Go ahead and eat.

679
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,330
我吃好了 爸
Thanks for the meal, Father.

680
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,880
智勋
Jihun.

681
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,130
我作为父亲
I'm sorry

682
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,970
很抱歉没能多关心你
I didn't give you enough attention as a father.

683
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,350
我们以后经常见一见吧
Let's get together more often from now on.

684
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,520
好 你最近在调查什么
So, which case are you working on these days?

685
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:58,110
唉唷 我不该问这个
Oh, no. I shouldn't have asked that.

686
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:01,160
调查的关键在于保密
The essence of an investigation is confidentiality.

687
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:08,290
我正在调查崔基泰代表的 秘密资金流向
I'm investigating the slush fund flow of President Choi Kitae.

688
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,460
这样啊 是吗
Ah...

689
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:14,670
这样啊 是吗
I see.

690
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,380
那个案子的调查还没有结束啊
I guess that investigation isn't over yet.

691
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,720
是的
No.

692
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:26,470
爸 我们很快就会开始传唤调查
Summoning will begin soon, Father.

693
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,450
好 我知道了
Yes, sir.

694
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:48,000
千检察官 地检长让你现在去他的办公室
Mr. Cheon, the district attorney wants to see you.

695
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:50,660
地检长吗
The district attorney?

696
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,500
他是不是知道什么了
Maybe he found out something.

697
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,000
应该没什么事 我过去一趟
I'm sure it's not important. I will be back.

698
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,070
智勋
Jihun.

699
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,000
我
When…

700
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,040
当检察官的时候
I was a prosecutor,

701
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,000
以为只要我不动摇
I thought I could change the world

702
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,170
就能改变这个世界
if I didn't falter.

703
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,390
就像你一样
Just like you.

704
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,480
但这并不容易
But it wasn't easy.

705
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,100
我认为即使沾上一些污点
Even if my record is a little tarnished,

706
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,480
我也必须走上这条路
I believe I needed to be on this path.

707
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,190
我就快成功了
I'm almost there.

708
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,950
只要你帮帮我就行
All I need is your help.

709
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,580
一个活得正直的人 不会受挫的社会
"A society where honest people are not discouraged.

710
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,460
一个没有人通过投机取巧 和非法手段获利的社会
A society without those who gain by cheating and breaking the law.

711
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,500
一个罪犯…
A society where a criminal…

712
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,260
为其罪行付出代价的社会
pays the price of their wrongdoings."

713
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,350
你教导我说这才是一个正义的社会
You taught me that is what a just society looks like.

714
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,350
智勋
Jihun.

715
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,060
我当上总理后 一定会让它实现
I will become the prime minister and make sure that happens.

716
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,980
不 你不能
No, you can't.

717
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:43,570
我会纠正过来
I will put things right.

718
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,290
你愣着干吗 打声招呼啊
What are you doing? Introduce yourself.

719
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,630
你好 我是千智勋检察官
Nice to meet you. I am Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.

720
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,300
我们以前见过面吧
I believe we've met before.

721
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,380
是吗 前辈
Have you met him already?

722
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,510
他让我过来接受调查
He summoned me for an investigation.

723
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:12,430
这是什么…
What are you…

724
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,430
千检察官 你告诉他们吧
Mr. Cheon, why don't you tell them?

725
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,940
是的 关于崔基泰案的秘密资金 我需要对他进行调查
Yes, I need to interview him in relation to Choi Kitae's slush fund.

726
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:23,440
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

727
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:24,900
这是什么意思
What are you saying?

728
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,110
没关系
It's fine.

729
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,780
我会接受调查
I will heed the summon.

730
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:33,870
我不能打击年轻检察官的调查意志
I shouldn't break the will of a young prosecutor.

731
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,210
首尔中央地方检察厅
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

732
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,760
智勋一个人可以吗
Will Jihun be okay alone?

733
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,680
是智勋想要这样
That is what Jihun wants.

734
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:51,510
我刚才看到他和金允燮候选人 之间的气氛很奇怪
From what I saw, things were weird between him and Candidate Kim Yoonsub.

735
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,220
他们之间有什么事吗
Is there something going on?

736
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,020
我去看看吧
I should stop by.

737
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:56,770
民赫
Minhyeok.

738
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:01,560
由他去吧 他肯定有自己的想法
Leave him alone. I'm sure he knows what he's doing.

739
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,660
你第一次见到崔基泰代表是什么时候
When was the first time you met President Choi Kitae?

740
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,330
应该是在三年前
It was probably three years ago.

741
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,210
你是在哪里见到他的
Where did you meet him?

742
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,960
是在出版纪念的后援会上
It was at a congratulatory reception for a book publication.

743
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:29,470
当时你收到他的赞助费了吗
Did you receive a contribution from him at that time?

744
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,220
我没能一一查看
I didn't have a chance to check every detail.

745
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,720
所以没有办法回答你
So, I can't give you an answer.

746
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:45,480
你见过这个人吗
Have you seen this man?

747
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,290
金议员 你曾多次从崔基泰代表那里…
Mr. Kim, you have received cash from President Choi Kitae…

748
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,290
收到过现金吧
on many occasions. Have you not?

749
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,790
这个嘛
I'm not sure.

750
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:08,380
我不记得我收过
I don't remember receiving any.

751
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,680
我想你不用再回答了
I think you can stop now.

752
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,770
应该也没什么可调查的了
I don't think there's anything more to investigate.

753
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,940
这得问问千检察官
We should ask the prosecutor.

754
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:33,240
他没说话 我们走吧
He says none. Let's go.

755
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,570
不 我们休息一会儿再继续
No. We will take a short break and carry on.

756
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:38,950
喂 千智勋
Hey, Cheon Jihun!

758
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,530
这是什么
What is this?

759
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,660
我想这是让你改变主意的唯一办法
I thought this was the only way to change your mind.

760
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,330
你看看吧
Please take a look.

761
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:40,390
你认为这样行得通吗
Do you think this will work?

762
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,640
是的 我们等着瞧就知道了
Yes. I guess we will find out.

763
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,320
如果他真的收了钱怎么办
What if he really took the money?

764
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,360
千智勋这家伙虽然经常闯祸
Cheon Jihun causes a lot of trouble, but he's a good investigator.

765
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:57,530
但他很擅长调查 不是吗
Cheon Jihun causes a lot of trouble, but he's a good investigator.

766
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,200
他肯定是有线索才会这么做
He must be doing that because there is something.

767
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,460
如果千检察官的话属实 我们得先下手为强
If what Jihun is saying is true, we need to make the first move.

768
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,830
-什么 -什么
-What? -What?

769
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,130
我刚接到几名议员的电话
I just received a few calls from some assemblymen.

770
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:11,130
其中很多人惶恐不安
Many of them are nervous.

771
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,170
我们该怎么办
What should we do?

772
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,840
我们得给他们制定一个脱身策略
We have to get them an escape route.

773
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:16,590
那么…
You mean…

774
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,850
我们得让这案子定性成 金允燮议员单独受贿
We have to make it look like Kim Yoonsub took the money alone.

775
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,170
我想这是让你改变主意的唯一办法
I thought this was the only way to change your mind.

776
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:08,890
爸 你都听到了吧
Did you hear everything, Father?

777
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,900
一旦开始调查 那些受贿之人全部会狡猾地脱身
When the investigations start, those who took the money will slip away,

778
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,860
只剩下你一个人
and you will be left alone.

779
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,780
而最终你将承担所有责任
Ultimately, you will take all of the blame.

我会帮你
I will help you.

782
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:33,420
从现在开始纠正过来吧
You can correct it starting now.

783
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,540
你转交给了几名议员
How many members of the Assembly did you give money to?

784
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
有很多
There's a lot.

785
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,670
我不知道你能否应付得了
I don't know if you can handle it.

786
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:23,180
爸 你刚才不是听到了嘛
You heard it before, Father.

787
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,350
我比你想象中
I am quite good at investigating,

788
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,720
还要擅长调查
more than you think.

789
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:37,940
我需要你转交钱财的证据
I need evidence that you delivered them the money.

790
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,940
你手里有名单吧
I'm sure you have the list.

791
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,120
我有
I do.

792
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,830
我稍后给你名单
I will give you the list later.

793
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,250

Can we do that?
