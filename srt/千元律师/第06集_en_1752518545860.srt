包括那条小路和那片湖

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,680
你父亲也是你杀的吗
Did you kill your father too?

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:27,900
这是什么意思
What are you saying?

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,690
案发当天在现场发现的 你父亲画的最后那幅画
Your father's last painting that was found at the scene of the murder…

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,860
被换掉了
was changed.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,530
那幅画出了点问题
Something happened to the painting

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,580
而为了掩盖它就把它换掉了
and it was changed to cover that.

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,790
为什么
Why…

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,790
要把它…
did it…

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,170
掩盖起来呢
have to be covered?

17
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,250
你为什么要问我
Why do you ask me?

18
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,960
因为那是你画的
Because you drew it.

Did I ask you to send me abroad?

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,120
我来之前问过韩才淑
Before I came here, I met Ms. Han Jaesook and asked her

25
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,620
她最后一次见到金画家是什么时候
when she saw Artist Kim last.

26
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,330
所以呢 她说什么了
And? What did she say?

27
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,170

千律师
Hey, Mr. Cheon.

34
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,430
这是怎么回事 你看新闻了吗
What happened? Did you see the news?

35
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,470
看了 我刚刚去见了金敏宰
Yes, I saw it. I just met up with Kim Minjae.

36
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,430
该案嫌疑人父亲是金春吉画家一事 随之成为了热门话题
It has been a hot topic that the father of the suspect is Artist Kim Chungil…

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,770
新闻都已经报道金敏宰自首了
Even the news is saying that Mr. Kim Minjae confessed,

38
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,600
你打算怎么办
so what are you going to do?

39
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,650
这个嘛 他是已经自首了
Hmm.

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,190
这个嘛 他是已经自首了
Well, he did confess…

41
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,690
而且他也交代了他父亲尸体的位置
and even told them the location of his late father's body.

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,950
什么 这是什么意思
What? What are you talking about?

43
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,820
金春吉画家已经死了？
Artist Kim Chungil is dead?

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,450
对 现在检方应该在搜寻他的尸体
Yes. The prosecution is probably looking for the body now.

45
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,000
真的是金敏宰杀了他自己的父亲吗
Then, did Mr. Kim Minjae really kill his father?

46
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,670
不是
No.

47
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,590
三年前 金画家自杀了
The artist killed himself three years ago.

48
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,810
看来金敏宰的口供是事实
I think Kim Minjae's statement is true.

49
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,070
把尸体送到国科搜 确认一下这是否是金画家的尸体
To see if it really is Artist Kim's body and what the cause of death is,

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,400
还有死因是什么
we'll send it to NFS.

51
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,700
-是 罗检察官 -辛苦了
-Yes, ma'am. -Thanks.

52
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,040
金敏宰自首了 甚至还交代了他父亲尸体的位置
His confession and now his body.

53
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,790
事情进展得太顺利了
Things are coming together too easily.

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,250
我们确实从来没有遇上过这样的事情
I've never seen it unfold like this before.

55
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,340
我为什么总觉得不对劲呢
Why doesn't this sit well with me?

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,170
也有可能会发生这种事
Things like this happen.

57
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,010
有的时候我们得努力调查 才能解决问题
Sometimes, our thorough investigation solves it

58
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,430
有的时候问题自然而然就解决了
and sometimes, it's easy like this.

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,260
我们还是感谢眼前这些证据吧 前辈
Let's be thankful for the evidence presented before us, Yejin.

60
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,020
等一下 这到底是怎么回事
Wait, what happened? Then,

61
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,980
那记者和策展人
why did the reporter and curator

62
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,020
为什么要隐藏金画家自杀的事实
hide the fact that Artist Kim committed suicide

63
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,320
欺骗大家金画家还活着
and say that he was alive?

64
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,530
应该是因为画作吧 毕竟一幅画可以卖几亿韩元
I'm sure it was because of the paintings as one sells for a few hundred million.

65
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,650
他们并不想停止出售金画家的画
They probably didn't want to quit that.

66
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,950
金敏宰是从什么时候 开始代替金画家作画的
Since when did Mr. Kim Minjae start painting for his father?

67
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,540
-从一开始 -什么
-From the beginning. -What?

68
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,370
金敏宰说从一开始就错了
He said it went wrong from the start.

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,800
金敏宰和曾是无名画家的父亲
His father, who was an unknown artist,

70
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,050
原本过着穷苦但幸福的生活
and Kim Minjae were poor but lived a happy life.

71
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,510
这是非常具有独创性的画法啊
What a creative drawing technique.

72
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,060
这幅画是你画的吧
This painting is yours, isn't it?

73
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,390
是的
Yes, it is.

74
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,480
他想要维护父亲的颜面 而说了那句谎言
That lie he said to save his father's face

75
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,400
却成了悲剧的开始
became the start of the tragedy.

76
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,610
敏宰 如果太累就别费心画画了
Minjae, if it's too tough, don't force yourself to paint.

77
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,570
如果敏宰不画 你要代替他画吗
If he doesn't do it, will you do it for him?

78
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,620
你能画得像敏宰一样好吗
Can you even paint as well as Minjae?

79
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,250
老婆 对不起
Honey, I'm sorry.

80
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,540
我们别在这里说 还是出去谈吧
Let's not do this here. Let's go elsewhere to talk.

81
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,580
在他们结婚之后 柳熙珠知道了真相
After their marriage, Yoo Heeju found out the truth,

82
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,090
但对她来说 真相并不重要
but it wasn't important to her.

83
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,340
因为比起真相 谎言能创造更多的财富
Because the lie rather than the truth made more money.

84
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,260
敏宰 你父亲…
Minjae, your father…

85
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,220
最终金画家承受不了谎言般的生活
In the end, Artist Kim couldn't stand the lies

86
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,430
选择了自杀
and took his own life.

87
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,530
不要啊
No…

88
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,910
他是为了作为无名画家的父亲 才说了那样的话
He said that for the sake of his father who was an unknown artist,

89
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,540
但最终那句话却…
but in the end, that was…

90
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,670
对 应该就是这样
Yes, I guess that is what happened.

91
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
不管怎样
Anyway,

92
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,380
看来杀了柳熙珠馆长的人 不是金吉春画家
Artist Kim Chungil wasn't the one who killed Director Yoo Heeju, then.

93
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,010
对啊 千律师 现在要怎么办啊
She's right. What are you going to do now, Mr. Cheon?

94
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,560
我就知道会是这样
I knew it.

95
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,850
你不是说你相信金敏宰无罪吗
You said you believed he was innocent.

96
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,730
只能二选一了
It's one or the other.

97
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
要么朝着为金敏宰 争取宽大处理的方向辩护
Either plan your defense by asking for leniency

98
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,940
要么放弃为他辩护
or withdraw from representing him.

99
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,110
你必须做出选择
You must decide.

100
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,780
或者…
Or…

被换掉了

104
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,190

Something happened to the painting

105
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,650
而为了掩盖它就把它换掉了
and it was changed to cover that.

106
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,030
为什么…
Why…

107
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,660
要把它掩盖起来呢

You are so awesome.

117
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,440
-你买的什么啊 -炖鸡
-What is that? -It's spicy braised chicken.

118
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,980
我不太喜欢吃炖鸡
I don't really like spicy braised chicken.

119
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,110
那你可别吃啊
Don't you dare eat any.

120
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,150
赶快吃吧
Please have some.

121
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,610
吃吧
All right.

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,580
天啊
Oh, my gosh.

123
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,450
正是他们的家人…
It was none other than their family…

124
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,750
这是意大利面还是炖鸡啊
Is it pasta or spicy braised chicken?

125
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,250
你不是说你不喜欢吃炖鸡吗
Didn't you say you didn't like this?

126
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,000
我喜欢吃掺在意大利面里的炖鸡
I like it when it's mixed in with pasta.

127
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,170
甚至连知名律所的律师 也无法为他辩护
Even the most prestigious attorneys couldn't defend him…

128
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,930
怎么回事 很好吃
Oh, my. It's delicious.

129
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,590
然而有一位站出来 要为这个恶魔辩护的…
However, the one who stepped up to defend this person…

130
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,350
就像你说的 我们都知道节目内容了 所以一点意思都没有
As you said, it isn't that interesting since we know everything.

131
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,890
这个节目总有让人惊讶的地方 所以不要放松警惕
They always surprise us with something, so don't let your guard down.

132
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,690
辩护律师已经退出该案件
The defense counsel had resigned from this case…

133
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,820
比如像现在这个场面？
Something like that?

134
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,940
确实让人惊讶啊
It is rather surprising.

135
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,780
这个卷发好像很眼熟啊
This is a silhouette that looks awfully familiar.

136
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,110
那是什么呢
What is that?

137
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,910
等一下
Look.

138
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,120
你不是说不接受采访吗
I thought you weren't going to do the interview.

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
白实习 保持安静 让我看看我都说了什么
Ms. Baek, be quiet. I have to watch how I did.

140
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,920
我的声音怎么那样 原本很好听的啊
What's up with my voice? I usually have a really nice voice.

141
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,290
-对 -为什么要变声处理啊
-Yes. -Why did they change my voice?

142
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,750
唉唷 真是烦人
Gosh. That is so annoying.

143
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,510
如果你好奇 请给我五百韩元 如果你担心某件事 请给我一千韩元
If you're curious, it's 500 won. If you're worried, it's 1,000 won.

144
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,260
看那个 五百韩元
Did you hear that? 500 won.

145
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
如果你好奇 请给我五百韩元 是我即兴发挥的
I ad-libbed "If you're curious, it's 500 won."

146
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,850
你真聪明啊 口才不错
That was pretty clever. You're good at it.

但是
However,

148
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,350
身在看守所的金敏宰
we received a letter from Mr. Kim Minjae

149
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,020
给我们写了一封信
who is in a detention center.

150
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,900
这封信指引我们去往一个地方
This letter directed us to a location.

151
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,780
就是那个
That's it.

152
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,330
那么我们在那里会找到什么呢
What do you think we found at that location?

153
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,330
虽然十分令人惊讶 但我们找到了一把刀
Shockingly, it was a knife.

154
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,500
刀？
A knife?

155
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,130
并且他在信的结尾这样写道
And he wrote this at the end of his letter,

156
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,510
我承认所有罪行并愿意接受处罚
"I admit to committing everything and I'll pay for my crimes.

157
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,470
我希望这把刀能成为 解决这个案件的
I hope this knife is used as the definitive evidence

158
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,140
决定性证据
in solving this case."

159
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,570
电视台刚寄过来的
The broadcasting company just sent this over.

160
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,940
好的
Okay.

161
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,370
真是有意思啊
How interesting.

162
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,740
他竟然亲自上交犯罪凶器
He personally presented the murder weapon.

163
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,950
马上把它送到国科搜
Please send this to NFS.

164
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,500
-好的 -谢谢
-Yes, sir. -Thank you.

165
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,710
这把刀应该是在犯罪过程中 使用的凶器吧
Are we sure it's the knife that was used in the murder?

166
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,630
我们马上就会知道了
We'll find out very soon.

167
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,530
法务部
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

168
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,200
-怎么那么长时间啊 -怎么回事啊
-Why is it taking so long? -What's happening?

169
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,370
他应该早就到了啊
He should be here by now.

170
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,370
千智勋律师
ATTORNEY CHEON JIHUN

171
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,910
-来了 -他来了
-Here he comes! -He's here!

172
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,090
-请大家让开 -请后退
-Please stand back. -Move back.

173
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,000
-让一让 -后退
-Come on. -Move!

174
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,340
你不能这样
You can't do that.

175
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,970
你为什么突然自首
Why did you suddenly confess?

176
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,510
-你感到愧疚吗 -金敏宰
-Did you feel guilty? -Mr. Kim Minjae!

177
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,770
金敏宰
Mr. Kim Kimjae.

178
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,890
今天你没有问我过得好不好
You aren't asking me if I'm doing well today.

179
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,690
这段时间十分感谢你
Thank you for everything.

180
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,740
你对你过世的父母没什么要说的吗
Do you have anything to say to your late parents?

181
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,990
-你受到父母的虐待了吗 -徐检察官 能聊两句吗
-Were you abused as a child? -Mr. Seo, can I have a word?

182
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,120
-你能先把他带进去吗 -好
Please take him inside.

183
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,450
-跟我走 -谢谢
-Come with me. -Thank you.

184
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,170
你自己来的吗 智勋呢
You're here alone? Where's Jihun?

185
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,790
他说他会来这里 但现在好像还没到
Yeah, he said he'd be here, but he hasn't arrived yet.

186
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,210
他不会临阵脱逃了吧
Maybe he took off.

187
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,800
我开玩笑呢
I'm just kidding. You had something to say?

188
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,550
你不是有话要说吗
I'm just kidding. You had something to say?

189
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,510
你认为金敏宰是真凶吗
Do you think Mr. Kim really did it?

190
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,510
玛丽 我理解你的想法
I understand how you feel, Mari.

191
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,270
不管是检察官还是律师 如果不相信 眼前的证据 那要相信什么
As prosecutors and lawyers, shouldn't we believe the evidence before us?

192
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,270
那个可能是伪造的证据
The evidence could've been fabricated.

193
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,650
那你可以找出证据证明它是伪造的
Then you should bring the evidence that it's been fabricated.

194
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,360
我们之后再谈吧 我得进去了
Let's talk later. I have to go inside.

195
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,650
要不我们一起进去吧
Unless you want to go in with me?

196
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,530
你不是金敏宰的辩护人嘛
You're Kim Minjae's lawyer.

197
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,780
好
Okay.

198
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,970
我们从画室开始指认现场
Let's start the crime scene reenactment from the atelier.

199
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,140
开始指认现场
Starting the reenactment.

200
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,120
金敏宰 你怎么了
Mr. Kim Minjae, what's wrong?

201
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,330
这幅画不错啊
This is a nice painting.

202
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,120
千律师 怎么回事啊
Mr. Cheon, what happened?

203
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,840
这幅画…
But this painting…

204
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,380
智勋 是你拿来的吗
Did you bring it, Jihun?

205
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,380
对 是我借来的
Yes, sorry I'm a little late.

206
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,590
因为这幅画是该案件唯一的目击证人
This painting was the only witness to the crime.

207
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,350
金敏宰
Mr. Kim Minjae,

208
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,810
这幅画也是你替你父亲画的吧
you drew this painting instead of your father as well, right?

209
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,560
准确地说 你父亲画了这片湖
To be exact, your father drew the lake

210
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,690
你只画了这个撑着黑伞的男人 对吧
and you only drew the man with the black umbrella, didn't you?

211
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,530
你这是在干什么
What are you doing?

212
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,700
我们回想一下案发当晚的经过吧
Shall we go back to the day of the incident?

213
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,580
案发当日的那天晚上
On the night of the incident,

214
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,120
在这个画室里放着隔天将要发表的
there was a painting by Artist Kim that was

215
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,830
金画家的画作
going to be presented the next day.

216
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,130
但是画作…
However, there was…

217
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,260
出现了问题
an issue with the painting.

218
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,970
是谁 又是为什么
Who and why

219
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,390
把这幅好好的画…
did someone tear…

220
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,940
撕烂了呢 到底为什么
this nice painting? Why?

221
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,530
是我撕烂的
I did it.

222
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,370
你吗 为什么
You did it, Mr. Kim? Why?

223
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,160
代替父亲作画让我很痛苦
I was in agony for painting on my father's behalf.

224
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,790
原来是这样
I see.

225
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,000
我充分理解你的心情
I completely understand that sentiment.

226
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,960
但是万一
But what if…

227
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,510
有人对你所感受到的痛苦
there was someone

228
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,430
感同身受呢
who had that same sentiment as you, Mr. Kim?

229
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,980
那个人肯定也想要撕烂这幅画
That person would've wanted to tear this painting up too.

230
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,690
案发当日的那天晚上
On the day of the incident,

231
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,230
和柳熙珠馆长在一起的人
the person who was with Director Yoo Heeju

232
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,530
不是我的委托人金敏宰
wasn't my client Mr. Kim Minjae.

233
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,700
那个人是…
It was none other than…

234
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,990
放开我
Let go!

235
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,380
是他的姐姐
It was none other than his sister…

236
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,920
妈
Mom.

237
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,710
金秀妍
…Ms. Kim Suyeon.

238
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,890
敏宰
Minjae.

239
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,270
姐
Su… Suyeon.

240
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,530
凌晨散步后回来的金敏宰
When Mr. Kim returned from his early morning walk,

241
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,570
-目击了案发现场 -姐
-he witnessed the scene of the crime. -Suyeon.

242
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,780
不是这样的
I didn't do it…

243
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,790
-姐 -不是这样的
-Suyeon. -I didn't…

244
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,670
不 我只是想要撕烂画而已
No, I was just going to tear the painting.

245
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,380
姐 你看着我
Suyeon, look at me.

246
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,420
我们就说是爸爸干的
Let's say Dad did it.

247
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,170
什么
What?

248
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,880
反正没人知道爸爸在哪里 一切都会没事的
It'll be okay since no one knows where Dad is.

249
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,090
-我们就这样干吧 -不行…
-Let's do that. -No…

250
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,800
虽然金敏宰说
He said that they could

251
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,680
他们可以利用过世的父亲 从案件中脱身
get away with it by putting it on their late father,

252
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,180
但他本能地觉得这是不可能的
but he must've known instinctively that it wasn't possible,

253
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,940
所以让金秀妍安心之后
so after reassuring Ms. Kim Suyeon,

254
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,190
金敏宰决定
Mr. Kim Minjae decided…

255
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,990
自己成为犯人
to become the murderer himself.

256
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,920
就算撕坏的画作被留在案发现场 也没什么奇怪的
It wouldn't have been strange to see a torn painting at the crime scene,

257
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,500
但有一个原因 让他不能对画作放任不管
but there was a reason why he couldn't leave it there.

258
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,010
如果这幅画上
If this painting had

259
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,510
溅上了一滴金秀妍的血液
even a drop of Ms. Kim Suyeon's blood,

260
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,800
那毫无疑问
it was obvious

261
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,430
金秀妍就会被怀疑
that she would've been suspected.

262
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,100
所以金敏宰…
That's why Mr. Kim Min-jae…

263
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,240
所以金敏宰在已经完成的画作上
That's why Mr. Kim Min-jae drew

264
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,370
画上了自己的标志
his signature, a man with a black umbrella,

265
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,250
也就是这个撑着黑伞的男人
his signature, a man with a black umbrella,

266
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,330
也就是这个撑着黑伞的男人
over an already finished painting.

267
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,880
别说瞎话了
That's a load of crap.

268
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,550
我让你别说瞎话了
Stop with that crap.

269
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,510
那也没有任何证据能证明犯人是我姐
There's no evidence to prove that Suyeon did it anyway.

270
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,720
那些是我画的画
I painted them. They were my paintings!

271
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,890
因为我很生气自己的画 被冠上我父亲的名字
I was upset that they sold my paintings as my father's.

272
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,350
-所以我才杀了她 -敏宰
-That's why I did it. -Minjae.

273
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,570
你可以不用再继续
You can stop now.

274
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,400
我们别这样了
Let's stop.

275
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,660
金敏宰 你打算
Mr. Kim Minjae, are you going to…

276
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,460
再犯一次同样的错误吗
make the same mistake again?

277
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,090
儿子代替自己 成为能够画出杰出作品的画家
The son who drew the great paintings instead of his father,

278
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,720
他有了不想拥有的名声
the fame that he didn't want,

279
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:23,340
但他的画永远也上不了台面
his paintings that were to never see the light of day.

280
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,810
你为了你父亲所说的谎言…
The lies that you told for your father's sake…

281
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,900
让你的父亲变得不幸
made your father unhappy.

282
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,530
而这一次
And this time,

283
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,830
你也会让金秀妍变得和他一样
you'll turn Ms. Kim Suyeon that way as well.

284
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,040
金敏宰
Mr. Kim Minjae.

285
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,050
如果你代替金秀妍成为杀人犯
If you become the murderer instead of Ms. Kim Suyeon,

286
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,720
你觉得她会幸福吗
do you think she will be happy?

287
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,850
你别这样做了
You should stop now.

288
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,990
对不起
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,700
是我对不起你
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,430
对不起
We apologize.

291
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,650
今天的现场指认到此结束
The crime scene reenactment has ended.

292
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,770
为什么突然以非公开的形式进行
Why was it done privately all of a sudden?

293
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,610
金敏宰不是真正的犯人吗
Is Kim Minjae not the real murderer?

294
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,360
我们会通过后续的报道资料告知各位
We will let you know during a press release later on.

295
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,780
对大家再一次表示歉意
Once again, we apologize.

296
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,990
-金敏宰现在还在里面啊 -等一下
-Kim Minjae is inside right now! -One moment!

297
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,620
-请离开 -不好意思 请大家离开
-Please leave now. -Sorry, you must leave.

298
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,910
金敏宰推翻了口供
Kim Minjae took back his confession

299
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,040
金秀妍又已经自首了
and Kim Suyeon confessed.

300
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,750
现在真的要结案了
I guess it's really over now.

301
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,630
结束？你说这个案件要结案了？
Over? Did you say it was over?

302
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,800
白实习 那你来说一说 这件事之后会如何
Ms. Baek, why don't you tell me? What will happen from now on?

303
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,510
首先 如果金秀妍只是为了破坏画作
Firstly, if Ms. Kim Suyeon's claim that she only wanted to tear the painting

304
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,730
而没有杀害她母亲的意图 这一主张能被法官接受
and didn't want to harm her mother is accepted,

305
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,440
那她就是过失致人死亡罪
that'll be considered as manslaughter.

306
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,900
金敏宰通过做伪证掩盖真正的凶手
And Mr. Kim Minjae tried to conceal the real killer by a false statement,

307
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,530
所以涉嫌藏匿罪犯和毁灭证据罪
he'll be charged for harboring a suspect and destroying evidence.

308
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,860
但根据亲属间犯罪特例的相关规定 他应该会被免责
However, he'll be exempt under the Special Exception to Relatives.

309
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,240
然后呢
And?

310
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,160
因为金敏宰知道母亲柳熙珠已经死亡
And since Mr. Kim Minjae knew that his mother was already dead,

311
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,500
可判断他并未故意或意识到 放任母亲不管可能致其死亡
he didn't purposely think that neglecting her would lead to her death,

312
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,250
所以也不构成帮助罪
so he's clear of aiding a crime.

313
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,340
天啊 现在你有资格在我手下实习了
Oh, you're finally good enough to work as my probationary employee.

314
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,590
但是千律师 柳熙珠馆长死之前 不是说了这样一句话嘛
By the way, Mr. Cheon, what Director Yoo said before she died,

315
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,140
秀妍 是敏宰…
"Suyeon, Minjae…"

316
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,890
她为什么要说这句话啊
Why do you think she said that?

317
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,900
你有没有过这样的经历
Have you ever experienced this?

318
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,110
就是…
You see…

319
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,530
作为父母
Parents are like that.

320
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,750
就算是自己的女儿捅了自己
Even though her daughter stabbed her,

321
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:39,290
直到最后 她也会想要保护自己的女儿
she probably wanted to protect her until the end,

322
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,580
就算不惜利用敏宰
even if it meant using Minjae.

323
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,090
虽然我也不知道为什么她会这样做
I don't know exactly why, though.

324
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
走吧
Let's go.

325
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,220
千律师 你是从哪里借到那幅画的
Anyway, where did you borrow that painting from, Mr. Cheon?

326
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,180
-这是商业机密 -什么
-It's a trade secret. -What?

327
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,600
你一个只能拿到80分的实习生
You're only an 80-point probationary employee,

328
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,020
怎么这么好奇啊
why are you so curious?

329
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,520
-不是85分吗 -刚才减去了5分
-Wasn't I 85 points? -It was deducted by 5 just now.

330
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,440
-为什么 -你跟我顶嘴了啊
-Why? -You got smart with me.

331
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,700
你到底是从哪里借的啊 那幅画的卖价很高
Where did you borrow that from? It was sold for a lot of money.

332
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,030
其实是我买回来的
Actually, I bought it.

333
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,370
对 当然是你买回来的
Fine. I'm sure you did.

334
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,080
-真是的 -抱歉
-Seriously. -Sorry.

335
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,410
你是从哪里借的啊
Where did you borrow it from?

336
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,800
你什么都不要想
Don't think about anything.

337
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,220
也不用担心我
Don't worry about me either.

338
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,190
去留学
Go study abroad

339
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,150
然后尽情地画你想画的画
and paint what you want to your heart's content.

340
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,820
嗯
Okay.

341
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,830
来 收下这个
Take this.

342
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,670
这是你父亲创作的最后一幅画
It's your father's last painting.

343
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,260
你不要有太大的负担
Come on. Don't feel uncomfortable about it.

344
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,970
这是你画壁画的报酬
It's the price for painting that mural.

345
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,580
一 二 三
One, two, three.

346
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,580
-石头 剪刀 布 -石头 剪刀 布
-Rock, paper, scissors. -Rock, paper, scissors.

347

你看 这里多好啊

心中的烦闷都会消失 而且头脑也会变得清晰
All of your frustrations are gone, so your head becomes clear

353
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,410
还能够好好地作画

354
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,510
敏宰
Minjae.

355
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,760
要我把真相告诉大家吗
Shall I tell everyone?

356
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,020
我没事 如果你觉得身心俱疲 到此为止也可以 敏宰
I'm fine. If it's too difficult, you can stop, Minjae.

357
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,270
不用 我也没事
No, I'm fine too.

358
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,870
爸
Father.

359

你听说过的的喀喀湖吗

360
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,120
的的喀喀湖？我没听说过
Lake Titicaca? I've never heard of it.

361
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,460
它是世界上海拔最高的湖
It's a lake with the highest elevation in the world.

362
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,960
你看了它的照片也会很喜欢的
You'll love it when you see a picture of it.

363
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:13,880

Mr. Cheon, we solved this tremendous case,

368
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,010
就没有什么回报吗

Ms. Cho, what are you doing right now?

381
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,450

384
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,380
这个能值多少钱啊
Why do I care? This piece of crap?

385
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,800
那个应该值20亿韩元吧
Wouldn't it have been about two billion won?

386
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,510
20亿韩元？20亿韩元
Two billion won? Two billion won!

387

肯定是作为后辈的我来找你啊
I should come meet you.

425

426
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,310
有什么可疑的
What are you talking about?

427
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,270
你为什么突然请我吃饭啊
Why do you want to… treat me to a meal out of the blue?

428
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,610
前辈 你在审问我吗 真是的
Are you interrogating me? My goodness.

429

不久前 我和千智勋律师来过这里 感觉还不错
I came here with Mr. Cheon not too long ago, and it wasn't bad.

436
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,540
这样下去 你的实习工资都要被花光了吧
At this rate, You'll spend all of your probationary employee salary.

437
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,800
请前辈吃饭 这点不算什么
I wanted to treat you, so this is nothing.

438

早知道这样 我就带着汝媛一起来了
If I had known, I would've brought Yeowon too.

他没有交房租的钱 每天躲着房东
He's always avoiding the landlady because he can't pay the rent,

444
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,370
但是他的衣服和手表

445
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,450
看起来又很贵
very expensive.

446

00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,810
次长发了很大的火
The deputy prosecutor general is very mad.

574
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,980
他已经收到风声了？
Has he already caught wind of it?

575
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,980

00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,740
平白让自己陷入进退两难的地步
You just got yourselves in trouble.

580
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,370
你们现在走人还不晚 我会帮你们美言几句

What do you want?

582
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:52,630
我跟你们去检察厅坐一会儿
I can drop by the prosecutor's office for a bit,

583
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,210
然后再回家？
and then go home.

584
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,480
我们会没事吗
Do you think we'll be okay?

585
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,650
你指什么
What do you mean?

586
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:16,650
我们来这里搜查 回去肯定会被训斥
We're going to be chewed out for what we did here.

587
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,400

我害怕
I am afraid,

589
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,490
但反正我都已经干了
but I do it anyway.

590
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,620
不过智勋 我都搜了个遍
By the way, Jihun, I looked everywhere,

591
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,330
可重要的资料似乎都被他销毁了
but I think that guy destroyed all the key documents.

592
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,960
如果我们现在把他带回去
If we take him in at this rate,

593
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,260
就和他说的一样 我们得马上放了他

600
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,980
自从我因为你被赶走 我都在这里待了多长时间了？
Do you know how long I've been here since I got kicked out because of you?

601
00:42:58,900 --> 00:42:59,940
什么
What?

602
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,700
你觉得我还会相信你说的话吗
Do you think I'd believe what you say again?

603
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,210
-走吧 -喂 智勋
-Let's go. -Hey, Jihun.

604
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,380
你让我们就这样回去？
You want us to go back like this?

605
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,800
我觉得你要变得有名一点 民赫
I think you should become famous, Minhyeok.

606
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,590
他在说什么啊
What is he saying?

607
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,810
2017年首尔艺术电影节

608
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,290

请看着这里 说几句吧
Look here and say something.

615
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,230
参加如此盛大的活动 我十分紧张

616
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,770
希望活动能够圆满成功
I hope that it finishes as a big success.

谢谢
Thank you.

619
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,830
真是的 他时隔一年给我打电话 都在胡说什么啊
Darn it. He calls me in a year and what does he have to say now?

620
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,080
又有什么事 为什么老是给我打电话
What do you want? Why do you keep calling me?

621
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,540
喂？
Hello.

622
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:46,090
我可以让你重新回到社会部
I'll get you back on local news.

623
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,990
大家好
Hello!

624
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,200
真是独家新闻啊
This is a scoop.

625
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,620
他是坏人
He's a bad guy.

626
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,840
看这边
Yes, over here!

627
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,550
JQ建设代表崔基泰 踏上了首尔艺术电影节的红毯
JQ CONSTRUCTION CEO CHOI KITAE ON THE RED CARPET…

628
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,050
富三代和检察官一同站在红毯上
"Third Generation Chaebol and a Prosecutor Stand Together on the Red Carpet."

629
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,760
你这家伙为什么会出现在那里啊
Why would you stand there, you jerk?

630
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,470
你在拍电影吗
Are you filming a movie? Why would a prosecutor go there?

631
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,810
检察官为什么去走红毯啊
Are you filming a movie? Why would a prosecutor go there?

632
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,480
对不起 金部长
I'm sorry, sir.

633
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,900
但我真的不知道
But I really didn't know.

634
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,110
你不知道？你真的不知道吗
You didn't know? Did you really not know?

635
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,690
什么都不知道的家伙 还笑得这么开心吗
How could you be smiling like this if you didn't know? How?

636
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,780
你仔细看的话
If you look carefully,

637
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,740
就会发现我不是在笑
I'm not smiling.

638
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,660
我是还没有完全睡醒
I'm simply not fully awake.

639
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,080
你觉得呢 前辈
What do you think, Yejin?

640
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,290
我最近事情太多了
I've been working a lot lately,

641
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,540
就在车上打了一会儿盹
so I fell asleep in the car briefly and woke up.

642
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,080
结果一下车就发现那里全是记者
When I got out of the car, there were reporters everywhere.

643
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,670
我还以为他们是察觉到了什么 所以都来了
I thought for sure it was because the reporters caught wind of it.

644
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,970
我真的没想到那里在走红毯
I never thought in a million years that it was the red carpet.

645
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,640
你是怎么拿到搜查令的
How did you get the warrant?

646
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,640
聚餐的时候 我去了一趟洗手间
While I was in the restroom at the party, Prosecutor Seo Minhyeok gave me a call.

647
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,390
徐民赫检察官给我打电话
While I was in the restroom at the party, Prosecutor Seo Minhyeok gave me a call.

648
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,890
他说他拿到了搜查令 但自己去有点害怕
He said he got the warrant but was afraid to go alone.

649
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:19,940
你可真会说啊
That mouth of yours.

650
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,560
你们俩都给我出去
Both of you, get out!

651
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,280
你至少应该跟我说一声啊
You should've given me a heads-up.

652
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:32,700
你怎么就和民赫擅自去那里了
How could you two do that on your own?

653
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:34,870
你刚才不是听到了嘛
You just heard.

654
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,370
我也是因为民赫才不得已过去的
I had no choice but to go because of Minhyeok as well.

655
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:41,290
那我问问他？
Should I ask him?

656
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,000
还是别问了吧
Well, don't ask him.

657
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,710
徐民赫 你怎么样
Seo Minhyeok, how did it go?

658
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:52,970
多谢前辈关心
Thanks for your concern, Yejin.

659
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,640
我爸都帮我解决好了
Dad took care of everything for me.

660
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,930
我爸以前是次长的直属前辈
He was the direct senior to the deputy prosecutor general.

661
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,350
你父亲啊 我也想见他一面
Your father. I'd like to meet him one day too.

662
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:02,980
民赫 真羡慕你
You're lucky, Minhyeok.

663
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,520
有什么好的 只会更麻烦
I'm not lucky. It's just tiresome.

664
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,280
对了 智勋 你看报道了吗
By the way, did you see the news, Jihun?

665
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,820
看了
Yes, I did.

666
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,490
按照约定 登在了头版
It was on the front page as promised.

667
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,160
对 但是…
Yes, but…

668
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,530
咱们的照片照得不太好看
we didn't come out so well.

669
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,370
JQ建设崔基泰代表 成为红毯上的热门话题

670
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:26,130
这个也不算不好看
It didn't… come out badly either.

671
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,510
你看其他报道了吗
Did you see any other articles?

672
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,260
他们应该不会用同一张照片吧
They didn't use the same photo, did they?

673
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,470
不是用同一张照片啊？
Don't they use the same photo?

674
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,180
谢谢
Thank you.

675
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:39,850
我先走了
I have to go.

676
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,770
你们真是搞笑
You guys are ridiculous.

677
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,150
你现在打算怎么办啊
What are you going to do now?

678
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,610
他们会请水平高超的律师
They will hire an above-average lawyer.

679
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:52,110
如果我害怕律师 从一开始我就不会这样做
If I was afraid of lawyers, I wouldn't have started to begin with.

680
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,410
告诉他们不用让着我
Tell them to come at me.

681
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,220
喂 检察官
Hey, prosecutor guy.

682
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,850
一会见
See you later.

683
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,560
好 今天就拜托你了
Yes, looking forward to it.

684
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,150
放开我 该死的
Let go. Damn it.

685
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,950
好的 等羁押合法性审查结束 我就过去
Yes, I'll head over as soon as the habeas corpus proceeding finishes.

686
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,580
好的
Okay.

687
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,120
你觉得你能办到吗
Do you think you can do it?

688
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,420
崔基泰闯的祸可不止一两件
This isn't Mr. Choi Kitae's first time getting into trouble.

689
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,050
我读那些文件的时候 不知道有多么生气
I got so mad reading the documents.

690
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,840
就应该把他那样的家伙抓起来
Shouldn't a jerk like him be sent to prison

691
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,760
让他赎罪 不是吗
and made to pay for his crimes?

692
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,560
对 当然了 但这里是男卫生间
Yes, you're right. But this is the men's room.

693
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,770
这次他肯定也会花大价钱 请律师帮他脱身
He'll get an expensive lawyer this time and try to get away with it again.

694
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:09,730
你有信心吗
Can you handle it?

695
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:12,020
嗯 我有信心 但你是哪位
Yes, I am confident. But who are you?

696
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,530
听说你的调查能力很强
You were known for your investigative abilities.

697
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:22,870
拜托你了 千智勋检察官
I'm counting on you, Prosecutor Cheon Jihun.

698
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,140
-喂 智勋 -怎么了
-Hey, Jihun. -Yeah?

699
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,850
那家伙有恃无恐啊
That guy must have something up his sleeve.

700
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,150
他在笑
He's smiling.

701
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,750
检察官席
PROSECUTION TABLE

702
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,840
喂 是白法律事务所 我们怎么办
It's Mr. Baek's firm. What do we do?

703
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:24,220
如果是白法律事务所 那应该花了不少钱
If it's Law Firm Baek, it must've cost a fortune.

704
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,640
你受苦了
Hang in there.

705
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:31,650
你稍等一下 马上就会有好消息
If you remain patient, we'll bring you some good news.

706
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,940
拜托你了
I'm counting on you.

707
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,030
我们又得和老头们较量一番了
I guess we have to go another round with the old men.

708
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,160
辩护人席
DEFENSE COUNSEL TABLE

709
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,720
原来她是对方的律师啊
She was their lawyer.

710
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,060
什么 谁
What? Who?

711
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,140
没事
Hmm. Nothing.

712
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,570
嫌疑人没有毁灭证据和逃跑之虑
The defendant poses no risk of destroying evidence or fleeing,

713
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,070
并且有准确的居住地址
and his residence is clear.

714
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:22,700
检方在进行扣押搜查时 已经拿到了大部分相关证据
The prosecution has secured all the evidence during their search,

715
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,120
所以我们认为检方在调查期间
so there is no need for the prosecution to know his whereabouts

716
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,740
没有必要拘留嫌疑人
during their investigation.

717
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,080
另外倘若检方传唤嫌疑人进行调查
Also, when the prosecution requests an investigation,

718
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:33,370
嫌疑人一定会到检察厅诚实协助调查
the defendant will appear and cooperate with the investigation.

719
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,880
检方 请进行陈述
Prosecution, you may proceed.

720
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,300
是
Yes.

721
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,760
嫌疑人在检方执行扣押搜查的过程中
The defendant was arrested

722
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,840
因为涉嫌毁灭证据被现场逮捕
for trying to destroy evidence during our search

723
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,060
我方怀疑嫌疑人会销毁其他证据 并收买相关人员
and we suspect that there will be additional attempts to destroy evidence,

724
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,980
所以我方认为 需要对其进行拘留调查 审判长
so we think that he must be detained during the investigation, Your Honor.

725
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:09,700
拘留？当然不能拘留
Detained? Of course, not. I was indicted without detainment.

726
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:12,750
我现在就过去 你马上出来
Hey, I'm on my way. Come out right now.

727
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,960
李律师
Excuse me.

728
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:27,470
你在干什么啊
What are you doing right now?

729
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,850
你在耍我吗
Were you playing with me?

730
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:33,310
我们去喝杯咖啡吧 我请客
Do you want to get some coffee? It's my treat.

731
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,450
咖啡厅咖啡
CAFE COFFEE

732
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,540
加奶的咖啡可以吗
Are you okay with milk coffee?

733
00:52:57,330 --> 00:52:58,830
你不喝自动贩卖机里的咖啡吗
Don't you drink vending machine coffee?

734
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,250
我可以尝一下
I'll give it a try.

735
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:04,170
你该不会没有喝过这种咖啡吧
You're saying...

736
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,130
你该不会没有喝过这种咖啡吧
...you've never tried it, are you?

737
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,850
天啊 那你肯定会被吓一跳
Gosh. You're in for a surprise.

738
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,300
怎么样
How is it?

739
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,220
还好 甜甜的
Well, it's sweet.

740
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,890
是吧 能让心情变好一点吧
Isn't it? Doesn't it make you feel better?

741
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,470
以后你会经常想喝它的
I'll be seeing you often from now on.

742
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,560
我刚才说的话是发自内心的
I meant… what I said earlier.

743
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,780
犯了罪的人就应该受到应有的惩罚
The person who committed a crime must be punished accordingly.

744
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,110
这就是我的想法
That's what I think.

745
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,240
但不幸的是我是一名律师
Unfortunately, I work as a lawyer.

746
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,950
你应该费了不少劲才抓住他
I'm sure It must've been hard to arrest him.

747
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:16,250
对不起
I'm sorry.

748
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:24,420
