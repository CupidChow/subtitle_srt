EPISODE 2

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,260
这就是你的证据吗
This is your evidence?

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,730
对 你没有理由反对提交
Yes. Do you object to the submission

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
这份证据吧
of this evidence?

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,980
检方 你同意提交这份证据吗
Will the prosecution accept it?

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,820
同意
Yes.

11
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,710
审判长和各位陪审员
Your Honor, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,250
请仔细看
look very carefully.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,840
可以证明被告无罪的证据 就在这个箱子里
The evidence to prove the defendant's innocence is in this box.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,720
里面有东西吗
Is there anything in it?

15
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,020
-没有 -你看见了什么
-No. -What do you see?

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,650
什么都看不见
I don't see anything.

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,940
对 正如大家所见
Yes, that's right. As you have all seen,

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,070
根本没有能够证明被告无罪的证据
there isn't a single evidence to prove the defendant's innocence.

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,530
因为没有证据可以证明被告无罪
There's no evidence proving his innocence,

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,120
所以大家就认为被告有罪 对吧
so, we can think that the defendant is guilty, can't we?

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,750
那么大家这就是在推定被告有罪
Then, you are all making the assumption that the defendant is guilty.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,750
但在韩国的法律中 虽然存在无罪推定原则
However, in Korean Law, one is innocent until proven guilty,

23
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,630
但却没有有罪推定原则
but one isn't guilty until proven innocent.

24
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,420
这也就是说
What I'm saying is,

25
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,970
任何人不能因为被告有四次前科记录
just because the defendant has four previous convictions,

26
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:45,260
就推定他有罪
none of us should presume that he is guilty.

27
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,890
《刑事诉讼法》第307条
Article 307 of the Criminal Procedure Act,

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,100
要依据证据来认定事实
"Fact-finding must be based on evidence."

29
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,730
这就是证据裁判主义
It's the principle of trial by evidence.

30
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,810
我们不能推定某人有罪
We don't presume one's guilt,

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,860
必须要依据确凿的证据来进行举证
but it must be proven through definitive evidence

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,900
而证明被告有罪的责任
and it is up to the prosecutor…

33
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,990
在于检察官
to prove his guilt.

34
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,820
那么白玛丽检察官
All right, Prosecutor Baek.

35
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,950
请在这个箱子里放入可以证明
Please put in the evidence that the defendant is guilty

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,910
被告有罪的证据
into this box.

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,420
这里没有…
There is…

38
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,090
证据
no evidence.

39
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,520
被告试图偷取证人的钱包
There's only the witness's testimony that the defendant tried to steal his wallet.

40
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,810
这只是证人的一面之词
There's only the witness's testimony that the defendant tried to steal his wallet.

41
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,190
我方有异议
Objection.

42
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,190
若本案件是盗窃案件的话
If this was a case about theft,

43
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,900
就会有明确的证物
we'd have clear evidence,

44
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,610
但因为本案件是盗窃未遂
but it was only attempted,

45
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,070
所以只能通过间接的证据进行判断
so, we can only judge by circumstantial evidence.

46
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,910
对 检方的观点很对
Yes, that's a great point.

47
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,080
正因如此 检察官更应该要证明
That's all the more reason for you to prove

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,910
被告是否真的有
whether the defendant had any motive

49
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,080
盗取钱包的意图
to steal.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,210
也只有这样才能够证明检方在公诉中
That way, as the prosecution claimed,

51
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,340
提到的盗窃未遂嫌疑是事实
the theft attempt charge would be proven to be true.

52
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,840
被告在检察机关的 调查过程中已经自首
The defendant has already

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,220
被告在检察机关的 调查过程中已经自首
admitted his guilt and confessed while being examined by the prosecution.

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,840
并且提交了检讨书
admitted his guilt and confessed while being examined by the prosecution.

55
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,050
被告为何会这么做呢
Why would he have done that?

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,930
依据《宪法》第12条第7项
Article 12, Section 7 of the Constitution,

57
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,600
若被告招供是因受到刑讯 殴打 威胁 不正当的长期拘留
"If the defendant's confession was due to torture, assault, threat,

58
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,810
或遭遇欺瞒等审讯手段
prolonged imprisonment, or deception, etc.,

59
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,520
而非自行供述
and it seemed as though it wasn't a willful confession,

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,810
招供内容则不能作为 证明被告有罪的证据
it cannot be used to prove his guilt nor can it be used to penalize him."

61
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,020
也不能因此处罚被告
it cannot be used to prove his guilt nor can it be used to penalize him."

62
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,280
你认为调查过程中可能存在 刑讯或殴打行为吗
Are you suggesting the possibility of torture or assault?

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,910
难到检方认为嫌疑人只有受到 刑讯或殴打才会进行虚假供述吗
Do you think one makes false confessions only because of torture or assault?

64
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,530
检方在调查过程中有没有以 若自首就能够得到从宽处理这样的话
Didn't you placate the defendant by promising him that if he confesses,

65
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,700
来劝诱被告呢
he'll be given some leniency?

66
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,370
你也得想想你的家人啊
Think of your family.

67
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,210
你有老婆和女儿啊
It says you have a daughter and a wife.

68
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,880
被告在案发当日 作为现行犯在现场被逮捕
The defendant was presumably caught in the act and arrested on the spot.

69
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,310
紧接着被拘留了36天 并在此期间接受了调查
After that, he was questioned while being in custody for 36 days.

70
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,680
他没有办法证明自己的清白
There was no way for him to prove his innocence,

71
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,480
唯一能做的就是争取从宽处理
and the only thing he could do was ask for leniency.

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,480
如果在这样令人无措的情况下
Under these frustrating circumstances,

73
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,570
被告受到了检方的劝诱呢
what if he was approached by the prosecutor with an offer?

74
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,900
辩护人正将自己的推测 当作事实来陈述
The counsel is speaking as though his speculation is a fact.

75
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,240
同意
Sustained.

76
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,070
辩护人 请注意
Take caution, counsel.

77
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,700
好的
Yes.

78
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,040
各位陪审员
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,870
检方马上就要对被告进行询问
the prosecutors will soon question the defendant.

80
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,090
到时 大家需要注意的地方
What you must carefully watch for…

81
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,260
不是被告看起来是否像要偷钱包的人
isn't whether the defendant seems like a person who might steal a wallet.

82
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,890
而是被告是否 是在准备偷钱包时被抓住的
You must carefully watch to see if the defendant really did get caught

83
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,270
请大家注意这一点 我方陈述完毕
stealing the wallet. Thank you.

84
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,020
检方 请进行询问
Prosecution, you may proceed.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,400
被告
Defendant.

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,530
到现在为止 你总共拖欠了1300万韩元的医药费
You have a total of 13 million won of outstanding hospital bills.

87
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,740
你在出狱后两个月的时间里 攒了多少钱
So, how much did you save for two months after you got out of prison?

88
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,660
你作为一名父亲 是否做到了全力以赴呢
Did you do your best as a father?

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,250
你没有尽到作为父亲的责任 不是吗
Weren't you neglecting your duty as a father?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,050
我方有异议
Objection.

91
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,340
该提问与本次的案件无直接关联
The question is unrelated to this case.

92
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,470
难道是因为被告是一名无能的父亲 所以才接受审判吗
Is the defendant in trial for being an incapable father?

93
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,350
正如辩护人所言
As the counsel said,

94
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,810
本案件的局限在于 只能够通过间接证据来进行判断
this case is limited to being judged by circumstantial evidence.

95
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,600
正因如此 我们必须要考虑被告所处的状况
Because of that, we must consider the situation the defendant was in,

96
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,820
因为做出某些行动的理由 或动机就在其中
as we can know the reason or motive behind the action.

97
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,320
驳回辩护人提出的异议
The counsel's objection is overruled.

98
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,660
《平价正义》
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

99
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,000
辩护人 请进行反询问
Counsel, you may cross-examine him.

100
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,710
被告 你有四次盗窃前科吧
Defendant, you have been convicted four times for theft, haven't you?

101
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,540
-对 -那你以前主要在哪里
-Yes. -Then, when you pickpocketed in the past,

102
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,210
进行盗窃？
where did you usually do it?

103
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,630
千律师
Mr. Cheon.

104
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,590
这应该是检察官才会问的吧
Isn't that a question the prosecutor should ask?

105
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,930
被告 请回答
Please answer, defendant.

106
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,640
百货商场 酒店的桑拿房 银行
Department stores, hotel saunas, banks…

107
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,850
主要在这些地方
Places like that.

108
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,360
-你为什么在这些地方进行盗窃 -因为可以偷到不少钱
-What was the reason? -Because I made good money.

109
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,940
-可以偷到不少钱？-对
-You made good money? -Yes.

110
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,900
所以说比起地铁或首尔站的洗手间
So, rather than subway stations or the restrooms at Seoul Station,

111
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,740
你主要在酒店 百货商场 这些可以偷到不少钱的地方进行盗窃
you preferred department stores or hotels where you could make good money.

112
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,620
那么以前你进行盗窃时
Then, when you pickpocketed in the past,

113
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,660
被当场逮到过吗
did you ever get caught in the act?

114
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,080
-没有 -为什么呢
-No. -Why is that?

115
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,250
那个…
Well…

116
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,710
被告 你以前进行盗窃时的 绰号是什么
Defendant, what was your nickname when you pickpocketed?

117
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,050
被告 请回答
Please answer.

118
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,310
无影手
It was "Invisible Hand."

119
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,810
无影手？
Invisible Hand?

120
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,650
各位 被告的绰号 并不是《无形的爱》
It isn't "Invisible Love," everyone.

121
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,940
因为他盗窃时的速度很快
It was because he was so fast.

122
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,320
他的手速很快 所以其他人根本看不到
His hand was so fast that you couldn't see it move.

123
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,030
他可是无影手啊 怎么可能会被抓到呢
So, how could he get caught when he's the Invisible Hand?

124
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,870
被称作无影手的被告
Could the defendant who was called Invisible Hand

125
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,910
-偷取喝醉了的证人的… -审判长
-drunkenly steal the witness'-- -Your Honor.

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,710
案发当时 被告的右手受伤
During this incident, the defendant was caught using his left hand

127
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,750
在他用左手试图进行盗窃时被抓住了
as he had injured his right hand.

128
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,340
对 正是如此 案发当时被告右手处于受伤状态
Yes, that's right. During the incident, the defendant did injure his right hand.

129
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,420
被告 你的右手为什么受伤了
Defendant, how did you injure your right hand?

130
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,430
请回答
Please answer.

131
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,220
这次出狱之后…
After I got out this time…

132
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,310
爸爸你能来 我真的特别开心
I'm so happy you're here.

133
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,350
我本来想要金盆洗手
I was going to clean up my act.

134
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,770
爸爸对不起你 昭弥
I'm sorry, Somi.

135
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,440
但没有一个人相信我
No one believed me, though.

136
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,240
今年的生日 你陪我一起过吧
Be here for my birthday this year.

137
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
拉钩
Promise.

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,120
所以我就用石头砸了我的右手
That's why I crushed my hand with a rock.

139
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,500
我方有异议
Objection.

140
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,370
被告陈述的真实性 无法在法庭中得到确认
It's a testimony that cannot be proven in court.

141
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,630
被告的手也可能是在干活时受伤了
He could have hurt his hand while he was working.

142
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,000
同意
Sustained.

143
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,090
同意什么
JIHUN:Sustain what?

144
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,880
我没有偷窃 你同意什么
I didn't do it, so what are you sustaining?

145
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,300
被告
Defendant.

146
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,550
你从刚才开始就把我当作罪犯对待
You treat me like a criminal already,

147
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,810
那这场庭审到底有什么意义
so what's the point of having a trial?

148
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,390
被告 请肃静
Order, defendant!

149
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,060
真的不是我干的
I really didn't do it!

150
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,690
如果你继续喧闹就责令你离开法庭
If you don't calm down, you'll be removed.

151
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,520
你们知道我坐在这里的心情吗
Do you know how it feels to be sitting here?

152
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,730
在你们这些优秀的人眼中 我不过就是个有前科的垃圾
To you high-and-mighty people, I'm nothing but a convicted piece of trash.

153
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,440
法警 请将他带离法庭
Bailiff, remove him from court.

154
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,030
李明浩
Mr. Lee Myeongho,

155
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,580
记住我刚才
remember what I said

156
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,210
说过的话
earlier.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,830
你不是跟我约定好了嘛
You promised me.

158
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,210
请一定要遵守那个约定
Keep that promise.

159
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:34,170
我也会遵守约定 让你女儿见到你
I'll keep the promise I made to your daughter to meet you.

160
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,510
你到底要怎么做
How on earth will you do that?

161
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,640
坐下吧
Please sit.

162
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,520
审判长和各位陪审员 十分抱歉
Your Honor and people of the jury, I apologize.

163
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,150
被告的情绪有些激动 我代他向各位道歉
I apologize on my defendant's behalf for his outburst.

164
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,110
审判长 我还要向证人 也就是本案唯一的目击者
Your Honor, I have one last question to the victim who happens to be

165
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,030
问最后一个问题
the only witness.

166
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,660
证人 请到证人席
Witness, please approach the stand.

167
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,830
请你闭上你的眼睛
Please close your eyes.

168
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,540
我为什么要闭上眼睛
Why should I do that?

169
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,460
这是为了更准确更细致地了解一下
It is to more thoroughly understand the circumstances

170
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,080
案发当时的状况
surrounding the case once again.

171
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,340
好 现在大家就把这里当作
All right. Let's say that

172
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,300
案发当日的首尔站洗手间
this place is Seoul Station's restroom on the day of the incident.

173
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,010
-洗手间里一个人都没有吧 -对
-Was the restroom completely empty? -Yes.

174
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,470
-只有证人自己在方便 -对
-You were urinating by yourself. -Yes.

175
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,770
但当时被告在你身后
But you claim that the defendant

176
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,770
-拿了你的钱包 对吧 -对
-grabbed your wallet from behind, right? -Yes.

177
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,110
当时你虽然已经喝醉了 但还是察觉到了异常
Even though you were drunk, you sensed something was wrong,

178
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,650
所以抓住了被告
so you caught him.

179
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,900
是的
Yes.

180
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,440
但是…
But…

181
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,990
你现在为什么没有察觉到呢
why couldn't you feel it just now?

182
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,450
证人 你今天…
You had…

183
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,200
午饭吃了河豚清汤啊
puffer fish stew for lunch today.

184
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,460
我也很喜欢吃河豚清汤 确实很好吃
By the way, I like puffer fish stew too. It's very delicious.

185
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,880
被告 你可以回到座位上了
You may go back, defendant.

186
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,170
这是你的钱包吧
This is your wallet, isn't it?

187
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,340
你这是在干什么啊
What the heck are you doing?

188
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,840
你怎么能在神圣的法庭上 做出如此举动
How can you do this in this sacred court of law?

189
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,930
我只是想要确认一下
I was checking something.

190
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,470
确认什么
Checking what?

191
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,850
你是想确认一下 他偷东西有多么熟练吗
Were you checking to see if he was good at pickpocketing?

192
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,440
对 正是这样
Yes, that is exactly right.

193
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,610
我想要确认一下 被告偷东西有多熟练
I wanted to check how good the defendant was at pickpocketing,

194
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,980
与此同时 我也想要确认一下
and at the same time,

195
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,190
与此同时 我也想要确认一下
I wanted to check how you reacted when you weren't drunk as well.

196
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,570
证人在没有喝醉的状态下会作何反应
I wanted to check how you reacted when you weren't drunk as well.

197
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,320
审判长
Your Honor,

198
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,120
辩护人正在歪曲本次案件的真相
the counsel is distorting the truth of this case.

199
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,920
当人闭上眼睛时 其他感官会变得更加敏感
When someone closes their eyes, their other senses become more sensitive.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,630
但就像大家刚才看到的一样
But as you just saw,

201
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,880
证人在没有喝醉 头脑清醒的状态下
despite being completely sober,

202
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,880
并没有察觉到被告将自己的钱包偷走
the witness didn't feel the defendant stealing his wallet at all.

203
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,220
但是案发当晚
That night,

204
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,890
证人在喝醉的状态下
the witness was drunk

205
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,100
在能听到各种噪音的洗手间内
and he was in a bathroom filled with various noises,

206
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,480
察觉到被告要偷取他的钱包 并且抓住了他
but he felt the defendant grab his wallet, so he caught him.

207
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,190
你没事吧
Are you okay?

208
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,150
各位
Everyone,

209
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,400
被告有四次盗窃前科
the defendant is a four-time convict of thievery.

210
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,860
但这是他第一次盗窃未遂
But this is the first time

211
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,610
作为现行犯被抓住
he was caught in the act like this.

212
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,530
为什么会这样 为什么之前他从未被当场逮到过
Why is that? Why wasn't he ever caught in the act before?

213
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,910
因为被告
It's because…

214
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,000
是小偷中的高手
he was truly an expert.

215
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,960
被叫做无影手的被告
The man who's called the Invisible Hand

216
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,130
却在偷喝醉的证人钱包时被逮住？
was caught trying to pickpocket the drunk witness's wallet?

217
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,220
如果被告真的打算偷证人的钱包
Well, if the defendant really wanted to steal the witness's wallet,

218
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,590
喝醉的证人真的会发现吗
would he really have been caught by the drunk witness?

219
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,140
我认为这就是我们在本次案件中
I think this is a reasonable doubt

220
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,180
应该拥有的合理怀疑
that we must have towards this case.

221
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,520
我方提问完毕
I rest my case.

222
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,040
首尔中央地方法院
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

223
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
你为什么不看到最后
Why aren't you staying until the end?

224
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,300
玛丽应该不想让我继续看下去
Mari wouldn't want me to watch.

225
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,550
作为辩护人 竟然让被告在法庭上偷东西
I can't believe he made him pickpocket someone in court.

226
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,130
真是他的一贯作风啊
How typical of him.

227
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,840
你记得吧
You remember, don't you?

228
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
记得
Yes.

229
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,020
他那么自以为是 我想应该没有人愿意招他进律所吧
He acted so proud. I guess no one wanted him.

230
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,230
你去查一下他在哪个律所工作
Find out where he's working.

231
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,020
难道你想招他进我们律所吗
You don't want to recruit him, do you?

232
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,020
你觉得他是那种招之即来的人吗
Do you think he would join us if we asked him?

233
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,150
那你为什么…
Then, why…

234
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
走吧
Let's go.

235
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,530
各位陪审员中肯定有人认为
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sure there are some of you who wonder

236
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,280
本案件只不过是盗窃未遂而已 没必要对被告进行处罚
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm sure there are some of you who wonder

237
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,370
本案件只不过是盗窃未遂而已 没必要对被告进行处罚
why we have to punish someone for just an attempted crime.

238
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,210
但像被告这样的盗窃惯犯
But in cases of repeated theft like the defendant,

239
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,540
法律明文规定不能因为犯罪未遂
the law has stipulated that one can't simply get off

240
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,210
就对其减轻刑量
because it was an attempted crime.

241
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,550
因为即使是犯罪未遂 犯罪的性质也没有因此减轻
That's because the nature of the crime isn't lessened because it was an attempt.

242
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,930
被告已经在监狱被关押过四次 但仍旧没有完全改过自新
If the defendant hasn't been reformed after going to prison four times before,

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,020
再一次经受矫正系统的教育
it would be best for him

244
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,390
对被告来说是最有益的
to go through the correctional system again and come out as a reformed person.

245
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,530
对于多次犯下盗窃罪
Therefore, the prosecution thinks

246
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,440
或盗窃未遂罪的犯人
that someone who repeatedly committed theft

247
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,400
依据《特定犯罪加 重处罚等相关法律》
or has attempted it

248
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,990
应处以无期徒刑
must be punished in accordance with

249
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,030
或三年以上有期徒刑
Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes

250
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,790
因此检方在此
which states they must serve a life sentence or over three years,

251
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,750
请求对被告处以五年有期徒刑
so I'd like to demand the defendant to serve five years in prison.

252
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,670
审判长和各位陪审员
Your Honor, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

253
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,130
法律要求检察官证明被告确实有罪
our law requires the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt

254
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,890
并且不能存在任何合理性怀疑
beyond any reasonable doubt.

255
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,350
存在疑点时 利益归于被告
"When in doubt, rule in favor of the defendant."

256
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,020
存在疑点时 要有利于被告
When it's doubtful, it should be beneficial towards the defendant.

257
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,350
因为这就是《刑事法》的原则
That's because it's the principle of Criminal Law.

258
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,900
为什么存在疑点时 要做出对被告有利的判决呢
Why should it be favorable to the defendant when in doubt?

259
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,150
万一让罪犯成为漏网之鱼怎么办
What if we really let go of a guilty person?

260
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,200
比起将被告释放
It would be a relief to lock the defendant up

261
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,410
好像把他关到监狱更令人放心
It would be a relief to lock the defendant up

262
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,870
好像把他关到监狱更令人放心
rather than set him free, right?

263
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,080
谁让他做了令人怀疑的事呢
"Who told him to do something suspicious?"

264
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,920
我一辈子都不会做令人怀疑的事 所以这与我无关
"I'll never do anything suspicious, so it has nothing to do with me."

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,580
不是的
No, no.

266
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,920
并不是这样
That's not right.

267
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,630
虽然利用法律
It is important

268
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,300
处罚有罪之人很重要
for our law to punish someone who committed a crime.

269
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,010
但让无罪之人
But it is more important…

270
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
免受处罚更为重要
to not punish someone who didn't commit the crime.

271
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,150
宁可放过十个有罪的人
Even if we lose ten criminals, "we shouldn't wrongfully imprison

272
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,230
也不让一个无辜的人获罪
even one person."

273
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,570
大家肯定都听过这句话
I'm sure you've heard that before at least once.

274
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,700
为了这样 哪怕存在细小的疑点
In order to do that, our law requires that if it is even remotely doubtful,

275
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,580
法律也会做出对被告更有利的判断
it should judge favorably to the defendant.

276
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,410
存在疑点时 利益归于被告
"When in doubt, rule in favor of the defendant."

277
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,040
这条原则会在某一天最重要的瞬间
That principle will one day protect

278
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,260
守护最珍贵的人
someone most dear to you at the most important moment.

279
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,970
也就是我们自己
Meaning, our very selves.

280
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,720
陪审员席

281
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,160
本庭判决如下
They have reached a verdict.

282
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,160
手术室
OPERATING ROOM

283
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,790
根据陪审员的评议结果
According to the jury,

284
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,960
一致通过了…
the verdict that they reached unanimously…

285
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,460
检察官席
PROSECUTION

286
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,460
对依据《特定犯罪加重处罚法》 以盗窃嫌疑
…regarding Defendant Lee Myeongho who was charged with theft

287
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,880
被起诉的被告李明浩
under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes...

288
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,720
宣告无罪
...he is found not guilty.

289
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,010
太好了
Yes!

290
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,600
证人有可能将搀扶自己的被告
The witness may have misunderstood the defendant's attempt

291
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,570
误认为是要盗取自己的钱包
to help the witness who was stumbling as trying to steal his wallet,

292
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,780
因此很难证明检方的指控
so the prosecutor's charges are difficult to prove

293
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,780
排除了所有的合理性怀疑
beyond reasonable doubt.

294
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,410
被告
Defendant.

295
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,080

297

就让他们得到刑事补偿金吧
Let's let them receive indemnification.

316
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,780

Indemnification?

328

你饿了吧 我们去吃什么
I know. What should we eat?

331
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,110
白检察官 你喜欢吃炸酱面吗

332
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,650
不 我不喜欢吃炸酱面

你不喜欢吃炸酱面啊
You don't like jjajangmyeon?

334
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,200
-那… -那么
-Then… -Then,

335
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,530
一起去我家吃五花肉 怎么样
what about pork belly at my place? It's been a while.

336
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,950
你喜欢吃五花肉吗
Do you like pork belly?

337
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,620
就算我喜欢 我为什么要去
Even if I did, why would I go there?

338
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,540
我就是问问而已 她怎么了
I was just asking. What's wrong?

339
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,790
走吧 事务长
Let's go, Mr. Sa.

340
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,380
等一下
Hang on a minute.

341
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,680
你真的认为李明浩没有打算偷钱包吗
Do you really think Mr. Lee Myeongho didn't try to steal it?

342
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,430
不会是你觉得他打算偷钱包
You think he did it,

343
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,600
但他的状况又令人同情
but his situation was so pitiful that

344
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,310
所以你才打算帮他的吧
you wanted to help him, didn't you?

345
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,480
白检察官
Ms. Baek,

346
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,190
你不觉得你的问题有些幼稚吗
isn't that question a bit lame?

347
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,570
不管是你还是我 都不能决定事情的真相
Neither you or I can define the truth on our own.

348
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,660
我们只不过是努力地接近真相
All we can do is to try to get close to it.

349
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,950
我觉得这一次
I think that I got

350
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,500
我距离事情的真相稍微更近一些
a little closer to it than you this time.

351
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,540
辛苦了
Good job, though.

352
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,040
久违地吃一顿五花肉配烧酒吧
It has been so long since we had pork belly with soju.

353
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,340
是冷冻肉还是冷鲜肉
Is it frozen or refrigerated?

354
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,670
当然是冷鲜肉了
It's refrigerated, of course.

355
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,010
那你快点给嫂子打电话
Then, hurry up and call your wife.

356
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,510
我刚才上去的时候磕到了膝盖
I hit my knee on my way up here.

357
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,640
是吗
Okay.

358
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,440
昭弥 你还好吗
Somi, are you okay?

359
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,910
昭弥 你能认出妈妈和爸爸来吗
Somi, do your recognize Mommy and Daddy?

360
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,370
昭弥 你以后都不会再痛了
Somi, you won't be sick anymore.

361
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,330
爸爸以后哪儿都不去了 我跟你约定了 好不好
I won't go anywhere from now on. I promise, okay?

362
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,690
因不服如下判决
As it will be an objection to the next case's judgment,

363
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,690
提出上诉
I'd like to appeal this case.

364
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,410
检察官 白玛丽 被告 李明浩
PROSECUTOR: BAEK MARI DEFENDANT: LEE MYEONGHO

365
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,160
不管是你还是我 都不能决定事情的真相
Neither you or I can define the truth on our own.

366
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,120
我们只不过是努力地接近真相
All we can do is to try to get close to it.

367
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,540
我觉得这一次
I think that I got

368
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,750
我距离事情的真相稍微更近一些
a little closer to it than you this time.

369
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,280
一千韩元

370
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,690
我们刚熟悉起来 你就要走了
I'm so sad to see you leave.

371
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
谁说不是啊
I know.

372
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,480
你来的时候正好赶上我们很忙 让你干了那么多活
You came when we were busy, so all you did was work.

373
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,940

You've all worked hard.

374
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,070

这是你的实习纪念品
It's a souvenir for being a probationary judicial officer.

376

这个
Hey.

377
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,790
因不服如下判决提出上诉
I'D LIKE TO APPEAL THIS CASE.

378
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,260
放弃上诉
Withdrawal of appeal.

379
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,890
对检察官来说是一个很艰难的决定
It's a tough decision for a prosecutor to make

380
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,140
因为这代表着要承认自己错了
because it's as if you're admitting that you were wrong.

381
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:43,100
你比任何人都像个检察官了 白玛丽
That was the most prosecutor thing you've done, Baek Mari.

382
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,860
不要忘记你是以何种心态放弃上诉的
Don't forget why you decided to withdraw the appeal.

383
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,690
当你的初心被动摇时 就把它拿出来看看
When you lose focus, look at that.

384
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,320
好的
Okay.

385
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,390
这件衣服有点夸张了吧
Isn't it a bit much?

386
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,850
除了你 谁还能穿得了这种衣服
If not you, who would be able to handle something like this?

387
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,520
我觉得还不错 但因为爷爷的身份有些顾虑
I'm okay with it, but I'm worried about Grandpa.

388
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,230
那你要穿得更显眼一点
That gives you all the more reason to stand out.

389
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,860
戴上这个
All right.

390
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,910
你要我穿成这样去上班？
Go to work like this?

391
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,780
你不知道乔治·克鲁尼的妻子吗
Haven't you seen George Clooney's wife?

392
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,540
她也是律师 但却经常因为穿着而上新闻
She's a lawyer, but she's always in the news for what she's wearing.

393
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,040
还是你穿漂亮点吧 妈妈
Enjoy being in the news, Mom.

394
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,290
-真好看 -你这个丫头
-You look nice. -You brat.

-我来得有些晚了吧 -没有
-Sorry I'm late. -No, not at all.

403
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,300
-你今天怎么这么漂亮啊 -我看起来还不错吗
-Why do you look so pretty today? -Do I look okay?

404
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,470
-当然了 -走吧
-Of course. -Let's go.

405
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,400

我为什么不能在这里实习啊

00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,590
真是的 你真的要这样吗
Darn it. Are you going to be like this?

438
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,670
不能再这样下去了
I can't let this go on any longer,

439
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,510
如果不把拖欠的月租交上就搬走
so either pay the overdue rent or move out.

440
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,760
你可别再给我找什么借口了
You'd better not give me any excuses.

441
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,390
真是的
They're unbelievable.

442
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,430
真是受够他们了
Geez. I'm sick and tired of them.

443
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,310
汝真咖啡馆 律师事务所 二楼
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE LAWYER'S OFFICE, 2F

444
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,030
应该不是这里吧
This can't be right.

445
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,200
汝真咖啡馆

446
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,910
有人吗 没有人吗
Anyone there? Is no one there?

447
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,620
也是 谁会来这里啊 这里应该早就倒闭了
Of course not. Who'd come here? I bet they went out of business long ago.

448
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,960
对啊 这里都倒闭了 我还怎么在这里实习
Since they went out of business, how can I be a probationary employee?

449
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:01,380
看来是爷爷弄错了 就算我想在这里实习也没办法了
Grandpa must've gotten it all wrong. Even if I wanted to work here, I couldn't.

450
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,520
-她走了吗 -走了
-Is she gone? -She's gone.

451
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,560
但是有一个奇怪的女人站在那里
But there's a strange woman there.

452
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,640
-是谁啊 -是赵女士的女儿吗
Who is it? Is it her daughter?

453
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
天啊 要疯了
Oh, my gosh. This is insane.

454
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,570
如果你在那里坚持不了两个月
If you can't last two months there,

455
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,240
就不用回白法律事务所了
don't even think of coming back to Baek.

456
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,330
我相信你 玛丽
I am counting on you, Mari.

457
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,210
这真的是最后一次 爷爷
This is the last time, Grandpa.

458
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
汝真咖啡馆

459
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,710
那个检察官是赵女士的女儿吗
Is that prosecutor Ms. Cho's daughter?

460
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,760
当时那个检察官是赵女士的女儿？
Is the prosecutor from that time Ms. Cho's daughter?

461
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:28,800
藏起来
Hide!

462
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,680
不好意思
Excuse me.

463
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,600
千智勋 代表律师

464
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,900
原来你是赵女士的女儿啊
Oh, you were Ms. Cho's daughter, Ms. Baek.

465
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,990
你好
Hello.

466
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,620
所以说
So,

467
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,710
你不是赵女士的女儿
you're saying that you aren't Ms. Cho's daughter, right?

468
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,130
天啊 刚才吓死我了
My goodness. I got scared for no reason at all.

469
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,470
你看起来没有那么虚弱
You don't look that feeble.

470
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,930
虚弱？
Feeble?

471
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,680
她还挺机灵的
She picks things up quicker than she looks.

472
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,520
不管怎样 这里是你的办公室 对吧
Anyway, this is your office, right?

473
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,690
这里是咖啡馆还是什么啊 办公室怎么是这个样子
Is this a coffee house or an office? What's wrong with this place?

474
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,440
我知道这里很脏乱 还像老式咖啡馆一样
Look, I get that it's dirty and looks like a coffee house.

475
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,900
但你不要瞧不起别人的办公室
But please don't insult someone else's office.

476
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,280
这里对我来说是很珍贵的地方
It's a precious place for me.

477
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,990
我只是照实说而已 你为什忽然生气啊
I said it the way it is. Why are you being so sensitive?

478
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,240
好吧 不管怎么样
All right. Anyway,

479
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,830
了不起的白检察官 为了何事到访寒舍
what brings your high-and-mighty self to our humble office?

480
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,460
你需要一个实习岗位吗
Do you want to work as a probationary employee?

481
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,880
对不起 我的玩笑有些过分
Sorry. My joke went too far.

482
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,180
没错 白检察官 你来这里有什么事啊
Come on, Jihun. Ms. Baek, what brings you here?

483
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,220
你开的玩笑也太过头了
Your joke did go too far.

484
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,060
我…
You see…

485
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,520
-我吧… -请说
-You see. -Yes?

486
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,570
没什么事 应该是导航带错路 我就先走了
Never mind. I think my GPS gave me the wrong directions. Bye.

487
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,160
这不是白检察官的东西吗
Isn't this hers?

488
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,460
给我看看
Let me see.

489
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,960
这是什么啊
What is this?

490
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
喂 你别…
Hey, don't…

491
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,130
你别碰那个
Don't touch that.

492
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,380
别打开
Don't open it!

493
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,050
我说别把它打开
Don't open--

494
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,150
你没事吧 白检察官
Are you okay? Are you okay, Ms. Baek?

495
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,450
你吓坏了吧
It must've been quite a shock.

496
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,530
你没事吧
Are you okay?

497
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,580
我没事
I'm fine.

498
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,790
看来她是来实习的
Oh, she came here to work as a probationary employee.

499
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,010
她的照片修图了 看下巴这里
Gosh, she photoshopped her photo. Look at that jawline.

500
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,760
你们在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

501
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,510
谁说我是来这里实习的
I don't want to be a probationary employee.

502
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,100
纸上写着呢 你是来实习的
It says it there that you want to do that.

503
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,060
真是要疯了
This is insane.

504
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,850
我充分理解你 当然要疯了
Look, I totally understand. This is an insane situation for you.

505
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,360
在这个既脏乱又像老式咖啡馆的 办公室里实习肯定很不容易
It won't be easy to work at such a dirty, coffee house-like place.

506
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,740
即使你想在这里实习 也得经过我的同意
Even if you wanted to work here, I have to let you do that.

507
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,110
但想要得到我的同意很困难
But it won't be easy to get my permission.

508
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,160
你要怎么办啊 白实习
What will you do, Ms. Baek?

509
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,370
我要不要让你在这里实习呢
Should I give you the job or not?

510
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,500
真尴尬
How embarrassing.

511
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,090
-好笑吧 -不好笑 别闹了
-Isn't it funny? -It isn't funny. Stop.

512
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,590
反正你一个人也忙不过来
You can't do this on your own anyway, Mr. Cheon.

513
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:55,090
一起工作的话肯定会更好
It'll be nice to work together.

514
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,220
如果在凌晨接到案子也可以一起分担
If you get a case early in the morning, it'll be better to accept it together.

515
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,640
好像没什么不好
What is there not to like about this?

516
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,810
你们俩是一伙的吧
You two have teamed up.

517
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:04,850
事务长 有什么好的
Mr. Sa. What is good about working together?

518
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,640
她工作干得好才能对我们有帮助
It's only good if she's good at her job.

519
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,440
但上次在法庭上你没看见吗 她工作能力很差
Didn't you see her at court? She's horrible.

520
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,530
看来你对我有些误解
There must have been a misunderstanding.

521
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,690
你知道误解是什么意思吗
You know what "misunderstanding" means, don't you?

522
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,490
知道 你不是真的要在这里实习 对吧
I know. You don't mean it, do you?

523
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,990
我疯了吗 在这种地方实习？
Are you crazy? Why would I want to work here?

524
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,530
而且还是在你手下？
And under you at that?

525
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,620
你看看
You see that?

526
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,750
我说让她在这里实习 但她自己不愿意啊
I said I'd give her the job, but she says she doesn't want it.

527
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,710
那我能怎么办啊
What can I do? Hmm.

528
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,170
出口在那边
The door is over there.

529
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,130
你们打扫一下吧 办公室这样子 谁会来啊
Why don't you clean up? Who would come to an office like this?

530
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,680
你应该把拖欠的月租交上 把办公室也打扫一下
You should pay your overdue rent and clean up this mess, okay?

531
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,470
好的
Okay.

532
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,310
你可以把想说的话都说完再走
Say all you want to say before you go.

533
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,900
那个…
But…

534
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,610
真是的 好吃吗
Come on. Is it good?

535
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,150
就那样吧
I'm just eating it.

536
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,830
他为什么在这里啊
Geez. Why is that guy here?

537
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,200
真是的 爷爷也太过分了
Darn it! This is going too far, Grandpa.

538
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,880
爷爷
Grandpa!

539
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,180
你为什么要这样对我
How could you do that to me?

540
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,840
你怎么现在就回来了
Back already?

541
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,640
怎么了 千律师不让你在那里实习吗
Why? He wouldn't let you work there?

542
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,600
-什么 -真是的
-What? -Gosh.

543
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,520
我没跟那边提前打招呼 就让你过去 虽然有些担心
I was worried as I sent you there without any notice.

544
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,060
但我还以为你自己能够解决这点小事
I thought you'd be able to handle that on your own.

545
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,860
爷爷 不是这样的…
Grandpa, you see--

546
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,990
也是 他在庭审的时候 就已经知道你的实力了
I know. He saw how you were during the trial, so--

547
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,990
不是 是我自己不愿意在那里实习
No. I don't want to work there. Me.

548
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:43,910
为什么不愿意
Why not?

549
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,910
我不想在一个为了几分钱 就帮别人善后的律师手下学习
I don't want to work for someone who picks up after others for chump change.

550
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,040
那你还不是输给了那样的律师
Then, what about you who lost to a lawyer like that?

551
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,710
那个时候 我…
That time, I was…

552
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,040
那场庭审就算是我同样也会输
Even I would have lost that trial

553
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,420
输给那个为了一点钱 就帮别人善后的律师
to that lawyer who picks up after others for chump change.

554
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,970
收多少委托费
How much a lawyer makes

555
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,640
并不代表一名律师的能力
doesn't define the skills of that lawyer.

556
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,220
这我也知道 但是千律师有点奇怪
I know that too, but he's kind of weird.

557
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,600
而且他的办公室也很脏
His office is dirty too.

558
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,350
就待两个月 不会再多了
It's only two months, no more than that.

559
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,560
这样你也干不了吗
You still can't do it?

560
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,530
你为什么想让我去那里实习
Why do you want me to work there so much?

561
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,700
因为我们白法律事务所
That's because…

562
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,200
没有像他一样的律师
he's the kind of lawyer we don't have at Baek.

563
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,920
一号航站楼

564
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,300
天啊 我儿子很辛苦吧
My goodness. My son has been working so hard, hasn't he?

565
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,720
没有
No, I haven't.

566
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,890
怎么没有啊 你看起来那么憔悴
I know you have. Your look so worn out.

567
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,890
我都多大了 你还这样
I'm too old for this.

568
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:52,770
你结婚生子以后 就知道孩子有多可爱了
Get married and have a child. You'll know how cute they are.

569
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,230
对吧 我也该结婚了
I should get married, right?

570
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,850
-当然了 -所以我买回来了
-Of course. -That's why I bought it.

571
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,150
-什么 -等一下
-What? -Hang on.

572
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,240
你看
Ta-da!

573
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,570
我要去和玛丽求婚
I'm going to propose to Mari.

574
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,870
求婚？
Propose?

575
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,280
嗯 是时候和她求婚了
Yes. It's time for me to do it.

576
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,290
她应该会喜欢的吧
This would be good enough, won't it?

577
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,080
-多少钱 -这个？五万美金
-How much was it? -This? 50,000 dollars.

578
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,080
你小子真是的 我不是让你省着点花吗
Come on, son. I told you to be frugal.

579
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,170
这都是投资
It's all an investment.

580
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,750
这算什么投资啊
That isn't investment.

581
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,010
但是一枚戒指值一辆车的钱吗
Anyway, a ring costs as much as a car?

582
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,140
但是这应该比你 赔在股市里的钱要少点吧
I think it would be less than what you lost trading stocks.

583
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,180
你已经知道了？你妈妈也知道吗
Did you know about that? Mom too?

584
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,270
如果妈妈知道 你就不会在这里了
If Mom knew, you wouldn't be here.

585
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,190
但五万美金也有点多啊
Even so, 50,000 dollars is too much.

586
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,980
爸 想要得到像玛丽一样的女人
Dad, if you want to get a woman like Mari,

587

这些钱一定要花
you have to spend this much.

588
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,690
你不是说过
Didn't you say you wanted

589
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,950
想要把白法律事务所 变成白与徐法律事务所吗
to change Baek Law Firm into Baek & Seo Law Firm?

590
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,040
徐民赫 看来你已经长大了
You're all grown up, Minhyeok.

591
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,960
我感觉我还在长 走吧
I think I'm still growing. Let's go.

592
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,380
-你有信心吗 -当然
-Do you think you can do it? -Of course.

593
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,000

谢谢
Thank you.

601
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,530

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,190
喂
Hey.

606
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,560
你这是在干什么
What are you doing right now?

607
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,860
你来了 千智勋律师
You're here, Mr. Cheon Jihun.

608
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,700
我在打扫卫生
I was just cleaning.

609
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,030
你为什么要打扫卫生
Why were you cleaning?

610
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,740
我没法在脏乱的环境里做事
I can't work in a dirty environment.

611
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,580
谁要在脏乱的环境里做事啊
Who's going to work in a dirty environment?

612
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,210
我打算在这里实习
I'd like to work as a probationary employee here.

613
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,170
今天导航没有带错路吗
Did the GPS direct you correctly today?

614
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
你又来了这里
You came by the same office again, you know.

615
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,180
你不是说你没法在这样的 事务所里做事吗
Didn't you say you couldn't work in an office like this?

616
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,520
不久前
You were the one...

617
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,270
你还瞧不起我神圣的办公室
...who insulted my sacred office.

618
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,610
现在又忽然过来 这应该怎么说
Coming here all of a sudden and being like this is so…

619
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,280
太厚脸皮了
awfully shameless.

620
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,780
对于昨天我所做的一切 我很抱歉
Yes. I'm sorry about yesterday.

621
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,370
但是与歉意无关 我确实有点厚脸皮
However, regardless of how sorry I am, I am actually shameless.

622
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:39,290
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

623
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,960
你如此磊落 这让我十分满意
This confidence. I like it very much.

624
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,750
那能麻烦你帮我冲一杯咖啡吗
Then, may I ask you for a cup of coffee, Mari?

625
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,790
深度烘焙咖啡

626
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
谢谢 坐下吧
Thanks. Have a seat.

627
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,690
香气很不错
Hmm, nice aroma.

628
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,150
好烫
Ow, hot.

629
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,480
玛丽 我有些事很好奇 所以想问你一下
Mari, I'm curious of something. Let me ask you.

630
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:15,700
-什么事 -你到底为什么想在这里实习
-Yes? -Why do you really want to work here?

631
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,990
这是因为…
Yes, well… You see.

632
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,450
是因为？
Well?

633
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,580
-其实… -你不会是
-The truth is-- -You haven't been recruited

634
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,870
以在这里实习为条件 被挖到其他律所了吧
elsewhere as long as you worked here temporarily, no?

635
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,420
请你回答
Answer the question.

636
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,850
我在法庭上看到了你全力以赴的样子
After I saw how you did your best during the trial,

637
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,430
就想要在你手下学习
I wanted to learn from you.

638
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,980
所以我不顾羞愧 找到这里来了
That's why I came here to see you even curbing my embarrassment.

639
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,520
但你的表情有些不太好 你现在双唇紧闭啊
But your face speaks otherwise. Your lips are very tight.

640
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,450
好 非常好 我非常满意你这种态度
Good. That's very good. I really like that attitude.

641
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:01,490
但是我告诉你 一个你不能在这里实习的决定性理由
But let me tell you why you cannot work here as a probationary employee.

642
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,250
你不是说过我是个奇怪的律师吗
Didn't you say that I was a weird lawyer?

643
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:08,080
是哪个疯子律师申请国民陪审的
What kind of a lunatic lawyer asks for a jury trial?

644
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,460
你不是说我没有作为律师的品格吗
Didn't you say I lack dignity?

645
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,460
最近奇怪的律师怎么这么多
There are so many weird lawyers that lack dignity.

646
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,510
就算行业不景气 律师也要维持品格啊
Isn't there a certain level of professional standard?

647
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,970
在一个既奇怪 又没有品格的律师手下实习
If you work for a lawyer that is weird and undignified,

648
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,850
是不行的
that's no good.

649
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,190
我什么时候说了
When did I say that?

650
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,990
你昨天在法庭上的时候不是说了吗
Didn't you say that at court yesterday?

651
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,610
我什么时候说了啊
When did I say that?

652
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,410
就那个时候啊
That time.

653
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,910
天啊
Oh, my!

654
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,380
玛丽 欢迎你
Welcome, Mari!

655
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,800
欢迎你 热烈欢迎你
My goodness. You are so welcome here.

656
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,130
事务所怎么变得这么干净了
How did our office become so clean?

657
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,470
-是你打扫了吗 -对
-Did you clean the office? -Yes.

658
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,600
天啊 实习第一天就这样
If this is what you did on your first day,

659
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,720
之后会更不一样吧
I can't wait to see how things will change here.

660
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,230
千律师 你还真是有福气啊
You are so lucky, Mr. Cheon.

661
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,980
我可太羡慕了
I'm so jealous.

662
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,400
我也拜托你了 白实习
Please look after me too, Ms. Baek.

663
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,650
好的
Yes.

664
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,740
事务长 是你选实习律师吗
Mr. Sa. Are you the one who hires the probationary employee?

665
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:20,910
实习什么实习
No way.

666
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,870
你不能在这里实习
You can't work here.

667
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,870
看在打扫卫生的份上 我也要在这里实习
I'm going to work here. I already cleaned the place up.

668
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,700
不行
No.

669
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,290
我就要在这里实习
I will.

670
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,060
是她吧
Is it her?

671
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:53,690
是
It's her.

672
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,550
他们是吃错药了吗
Did something happen to these guys?

673
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,550
怎么这么干净
How did it get so clean?

674
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
唉唷 他们终于听话了
Gosh. They finally listened to me.

675
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:28,390
你是昨天那位姑娘啊 千律师去哪里了
You're the lady from yesterday. Did Mr. Cheon go somewhere?

676
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,810
什么 那个…
Pardon? Well…

677
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,690
怎么回事
What?

678
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,810
刚才我们还…
Ａ moment ago, they were…

679
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,330
刚才他们还在这里 不过不知道现在去哪了
They were here, but I don't know where they went now.

680
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,670
赵女士
Ms. Cho!

681
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,460
好久不见
Long-time no see.

682
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,300
作为房东 你应该下去 看看租户的情况
As the landlord, shouldn't you come down to check on your tenants…

683
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,220
对吧 对吗
I think?

684
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,260
我今天不是来收月租的 你不用害怕
I didn't come here for the rent today, so don't be so scared.

685
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,680
好好干
Do a good job of it.

686
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,520
我们问问千律师吧
Let's formally ask Mr. Cheon.

687
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,110
好啊
Okay.

688
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:22,440
你以为我会害怕吗
-Do you think I'm scared? -Humph.

689
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,910
如果抽到皮牌又抽到光牌 连加三分 分数加倍后
If they had no pi nor gwang, and I said "go" three times,

690
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,780
总分应该是翻六倍还是八倍？
is the score multiplied by six or eight?

691
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,960
为什么要问我这种…
Why are you asking me…

692
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,330
皮牌翻两倍
Two times for no pi cards,

693
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,210
光牌翻两倍
two times for no gwang cards,

694
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:40,920
加三分后再翻倍
and two times for saying "go" three times.

695
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,380
最后应该是六倍还是八倍？
Is the score multiplied by six or eight?

696
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,770
一次就能让头发变直的魔法
STRAIGHTENS YOUR HAIR ALL AT ONCE

697
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,940
快点说啊 律师连这个都不知道吗
Hurry up and tell us. Don't you know that as a lawyer?

698
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:00,520
我当然知道 司法考试里也考了
I know. It was even in the bar exam.

699
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,530
如果抽到皮牌 又抽到光牌
Well, if you won with pi and gwang, and they had none,

700
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,990
连加三分 分数加倍后
and you said "go" three times,

701
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,200
应该是翻六倍…
it would be six times…

702
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,910
看吧 我说对了吧
You see? What did I tell you?

703
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,250
-都说是六倍了 -都说是六倍了
-It's six times. -It's six times.

704
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,420
千律师 你能对你说的话负责任吗
Mr. Cheon, can you take responsibility for those words?

705
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,130
还是翻八倍呢
Or would it be eight times?

706
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,590
我怎么记不清楚了呢
Why can't I remember this clearly?

707
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,680
对了 为了准确一点 我们还是看一下《法典》吧
Oh, that's it. Let's make it clear by checking the law books.

708
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,590
对 准确一点
Yes, let's make it clear.

709
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,640
事务长 把《法典》拿出来
Mr. Sa, can you get the law books?

710
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,350
好的
Okay.

711
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,900
来 让我们看一下
All right. Let's take a look.

712
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:44,190
在哪一页来着
Which article… was it?

713
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,320
在哪一页来着
Which article was it?

714
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:49,200
嗯 在这里
Yes, here it is.

715
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,660
来 让我来读一下
Let me go ahead and read it.

716
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:55,080
如果抽到皮牌又抽到光牌
"If you win with pi and gwang, and the other party has none of them,

717
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,330
加三分后 分数加倍
and you say 'go' three times,

718
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:58,250
在庆尚道是翻六倍
it's six times in Gyeongsang Province,

719
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,040
在其他地区是翻八倍
but in other provinces, it's eight times."

720
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,250
我们现在在首尔 所以是翻八倍
Since we're in Seoul, it's eight times more.

721
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,170
看来是翻八倍
It's eight times.

722
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,340
你看 我都说是我对了
Gosh, you see? I told you.

723
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:08,340
你再看一遍 看看是不是真的 快点
Look at it again. See if it really says that. Come on.

724
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,590
他都说是八倍了啊
He said it's eight times.

725
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:15,260
你倒是给我翻开啊 不是刚才那一页
Open that page again. It wasn't there.

726
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,430
我刚才没看见
I didn't see it.

727
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
真是的
Geez.

728
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,100
快点翻开
Open it!

729
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,650
-没法一下就找到那一页 -嗯
-You can't open it at once. -Okay.

730
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,110
-对 就是这里 -这里？
-Okay. Here it is. -Here?

731
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,150
真是的 我什么都看不清
Geez, I don't know what it's saying.

732
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,160
真的是这样写的吗 你确定？

-是吗 她是检察官吗 -对
-Really? She's a prosecutor? -Yes.

但是你为什么来这里实习啊
Anyway, why did you come here, Ms. Baek?

00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,090
就是这样 谢谢别人的时候就得大声点说
All right! You should say that loudly.

885
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,420
任何时候听到这句话都能让人开心
It's nice to hear that anytime.

886
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:12,760
他可真是高兴
-Look at him eating it up. -It certainly doesn't make me feel bad.

887
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:14,260
确实听起来让人开心
-Look at him eating it up. -It certainly doesn't make me feel bad.

888
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:15,680
真受不了他
He's unbelievable.

889
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,100
建宇 你跟我说一说
Okay, Gunwoo. Why don't you tell me?

890
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,520
你刚才说你爷爷怎么了
What did you say happened to your grandpa?

891
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:27,400
-我爷爷… -嗯
-You see, my grandpa was… -Yes.

892
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,690
有个叔叔对我爷爷…
Some guy did something to my grandpa…

893
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,720
那不是千律师吗
Hey, isn't that Jihun?

894
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,640
喂 千律师 上车吧
Hey, Jihun. Hop in.

895
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,850
事务长 你来得正好 我们得去个地方
I'm glad you're here. We have somewhere to go.

896
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:03,850
-走吧 建宇 -好
-Let's go, Gunwoo. -Okay.

897
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,900
-好 出发吧 -出发了
-Okay. Let's go. -Here we go.

898
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,070
第一洗衣店

899
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,200
出发
Go!

900
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:16,200
你是哪位
Who…

901
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,030
我是千智勋律师
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

902
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,040
什么
Pardon?

903
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,410
你是建宇的爷爷吧 建宇已经把事情都告诉我了
Are you Gunwoo's grandfather? He told me everything.

904
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,210
天啊 没什么事 请回吧
Ah! My goodness. It's nothing. Please leave.

905
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,630
要出大事了 那是我的错
I'll get in trouble. It was my fault.

906
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:34,260
-我可以帮你… -不用了 请回吧
-But I can help you-- -No, please leave.

907
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,800
不好意思
Sorry. I'm sorry.

908
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:39,140
他为什么那样 千律师不是说要帮他吗
What's wrong with him? Mr. Cheon wants to help.

909
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,100
要是保安和业主打官司 谁还会继续用他啊
Who would hire a guard who sues a tenant?

910
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,190
而且他之后 就很难在这里继续工作了
It might be hard for him to work here afterwards.

911
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,400
但他可能要赔上两三个月的工资
But he'd have to spend two to three months of his salary.

912
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,400
刚才我听了一下 也没有证据证明是他划到了车
From what I heard, there was no proof that he scratched the car.

913
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,570
虽然我直接过来不太好 但我还是想要帮助你
I understand how you feel, but I'd like to help you.

914
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,900
没关系
It's all right.

915
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,080
怎么回事啊
What the heck?

916
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,660
这个人怎么回事啊
What's wrong with this guy?

917
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,790
就是那个叔叔
That's him.

918
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:17,630
天啊 这人也太没道德了
Geez. Check out this guy.

919
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:20,640
不能用法律制裁这样停车的人吗
Can't anyone do anything legally when someone parks like that?

920
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,180
不能 他没有破坏道路 停车位也是私有土地
No, he isn't blocking the road and a parking lot is private property.

921
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:27,350
很遗憾 现在还不能依据法律处罚他
Sadly, there isn't anything you can do legally about that yet.

922
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,400
今天打球真是格外不顺
Hey, I was having a hard time hitting the ball today.

923
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,440
真是要疯了
It's driving me nuts.

924
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,980
喂 金万福先生
Hey, Mr. Kim Manbok.

925
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,400
是
Yes, sir!

926
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,240
对 我得和金选手好好学习一下
Yes, I need to take lessons from Mr. Kim again.

927
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,200
他打得真的很好
Yes, he was amazing.

928
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:48,080
咱们下周再去吧 好
Let's go together next week. Sure.

929
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:56,130
这位先生 你停车的方式好像不太对
Sir, you didn't park your car properly.

930
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,880
我先挂了
I need to go.

931
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:04,100
-你说什么 -你停车的技术也太烂了
-What? -You did a lousy job of parking your car.

932
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,020
这位先生 我以前就很好奇
Sir, I've always been curious.

933
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,350
像你这样停车的人 是因为开车还不熟练吗
Do people park the car like this because they aren't good at driving?

934
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,940
还是故意…你跟我说实话
Or, be honest with me,

935
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,780
他们不是故意这样停车的 对吧
they don't park like this on purpose, do they?

936
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,900
对 我就是故意的
Yes, I did it on purpose.

937
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,700
你既然知道 还问什么啊
If you knew, why'd you ask?

938
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,530
你是故意这样停车的啊
Aah. You did it… on purpose.

939
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,200
那我就得这样做
Then, this is what I should do.

940
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,090
喂 你这个疯子 你在干什么呢
Hey, wacko. What are you doing?

941
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,840
我要拍几张照片传到社交媒体上
I'm going to post these on my social media right now.

942
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:40,800
那你马上就会…
Then you're…

943
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,510
喂 趁我好言相向的时候赶快删了
Hey, you'd better delete those.

944
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,220
我让你把照片删了 把手机给我
Delete those. Give me your phone.

945
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,810
不 这是我的手机 我不想给你
No. It's my cell phone. I don't want

946
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,770
你这个疯子 喂 你住在这个小区吗
to. You wacko. Hey, do you live here?

947
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,650
不好意思
Oh, I'm sorry.

948
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,780
我忘了自我介绍
I haven't introduced myself.

949
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,530
我是千智勋律师 这是我的名片
I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law. Here is my business card.

950
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,570
律师？
An attorney?

951
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,080
-你真的是律师吗 -对 我是律师
-For real? -Yes, I am.

952
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:09,540
你说我的委托人划了你的车 所以我就过来了
You claimed that my client scratched your car, so I came to see you.

953
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,920
天啊 真有意思
Gosh, this is interesting, isn't it?

954
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,090
所以
So…

955
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,050
他没有钱赔我修理费
he doesn't have money to fix my car,

956
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,550
但却有钱请律师？
but he has money to hire a lawyer?

957
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,180
不是这样的 请你快走吧
No, sir. Please leave.

958
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,640
-好 -快走吧
-Well. -Please leave.

959
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:26,680
爷爷
Grandpa.

960
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,220
-去那边待着 快点 -爷爷
-Go over there. Right now! -Grandpa.

961
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,440
律师叔叔说会帮你
This lawyer said he'd help you.

962
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:37,770
他说会教训那个折磨你的坏叔叔
He said that he'd teach a lesson to the man who bullies you.

963
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,110
喂 你这个小子
Hey, you little brat.

964
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,160
天啊 现在这是什么情况
Darn. What is going on right now?

965
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,420
你说他划了这里 对吧
So, you're saying he scratched it from here to here?

966
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,380
就是你看到的那样
As you can see.

967
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,220
你干什么啊 真恶心
What the heck are you doing? That's gross.

968
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,590
没什么
No, it isn't.

969
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,180
我只是想确认一下划痕的大小
I'm just trying to establish the exact size of the damage.

970
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,230
你这是要干什么啊
Hey. What the heck?

971
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,280
等一下
One moment.

972
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,200
你干什么
What the heck?

973
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,620
喂
Hey.

974
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:33,120
你这家伙…
Why you…

975
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,540
唉唷 弄好了
Gosh, it's done.

976
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,590
你这是弄的什么啊
Hey. What did you do?

977
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,340
-几乎看不出来 -你这家伙 你在跟我闹着玩吗
-You can hardly see it. -You bastard. Hey, are you joking?

978
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:45,130
你干什么啊 放开我
What are you doing? Let go of me!

979
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,640
快放开他
Let go of him!

980
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:50,890
马上放开他
Let go of him right now!

981
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:52,640
-你是谁啊 -我？
-Who are you? -Me?

982
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,640
我是千智勋律师事务所的事务长
I'm Attorney Cheon Jihun's office manager.

983
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:56,810
-那又怎样 -怎样
-So what? -So?

984
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,520
-你还是处理你该处理的事吧 -好啊
-Just manage his office. -All right.

985
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,900
真是的
Jeez.

986
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,780
你又是谁啊 穿蓝衣服的
Who the heck are you, Blue?

987
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,400
-喂 -怎么了
-Look. -What?

988
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:07,360
是你先瞎胡闹的吧
Aren't you the one who started it?

989
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,740
你有什么证据 能证明是他划了你的车
What proof do you have that this man did this?

990
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:15,160
证据？我的眼睛就是证据
Proof? My eyes are proof.

991
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,210
-原来你的眼睛是证据啊 -对
-Your eyes are proof. -Yes.

992
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:21,170
-来 看着我的手 -好 我看着呢
-All right. Look at this. -Okay, I will look.

993
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:24,340
来 我正看着呢
See? I'm looking.

994
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:27,680
唉唷 你这是干什么啊
Why'd do you that?

995
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:32,010
看我不一下子戳瞎你的眼睛
Why you jerk. I ought to… I ought to poke those eyes out!

996
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:33,810
喂 你还学过武术啊
Do you know any martial arts?

997
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,680
别在我面前嚣张
Don't mess with me, damn it!

998
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:38,150
我一通电话就能把你们都关进监狱
With one phone call, I can lock you all up!

999
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,730
别说那些没用的 我们还是重现一下当时的状况吧
Forget about that. Let's see what exactly happened that day.

1000
01:01:40,810 --> 01:01:42,320
所以
So, you're saying,

1001
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,690
你是从这边推过去的 对吧
you went this way like this, right?

1002
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,780
-你就推到了这边 -对 因为这些车很贵
-You pushed it to the side. -Yes, since they're expensive cars.

1003
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:50,450
你这家伙在糊弄我吗
Are you kidding me?

1004
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:53,700
喂 你那样推过去能刮到车吗
Hey, how can the car get scratched if you push it like that?

1005
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,250
你这家伙把别人当傻瓜啊
Do you think I'm an idiot, bastard?

1006
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:58,210
他是直走把推车推过去的
He went straight, okay?

1007
01:01:59,080 --> 01:01:59,920
直走往前推？
Straight?

1008
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:01,920
你不知道什么是往前推吗
Get it?

1009
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,170
往前推 对吧
So, go straight? Go straight.

1010
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,510
对 现在你明白我的意思了吧
Yes. Are you finally getting what I'm saying?

1011
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:11,390
直接往车那边推
Straight towards the car.

1012
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:13,390
知道了
Got it.

1013
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,430
你在开玩笑吧 喂 快一点
Are you kidding? Hey, go faster.

1014
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,020
向着车 推快一点
Faster towards the car.

1015
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,690
-对 你应该推快一点 -快一点
-Yes, you should go faster. -Faster.

1016
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,480
快一点
Faster, faster, faster.

1017
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:47,760
你…
You…

1018
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,840
你这个疯子
crazy scumbag!

1019
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,890
-你这个疯子 -等一下
-You crazy scumbag. -Look.

1020
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,640
保险杠坏掉了
Your bumper got wrecked.

1021
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,350
你为什么让我推那么快啊
Why did you tell me to go faster?

1022
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:00,190
你这个像疯狗一样的家伙
You total wacko!

1023
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,650
等一下
Hey, wait.

1024
01:03:04,270 --> 01:03:06,780
-去哪儿了 -什么
-Where did it go? -What?

1025
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,150
建宇爷爷划的痕迹完全不见了
The spot where Gunwoo's grandpa scratched has completely disappeared.

1026
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,530
你这个家伙开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

1027
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:15,160
你打算怎么赔偿我的车
What are you going to do about my car?

1028
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,330
今天就是你这个家伙的忌日 你今天死定了
Today is your funeral. You're dead!

1029
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:19,290
等一下
Wait.

1030
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,580
你要干什么
What?

1031
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:25,750
从现在起 这算是一个新的案件
From now, this is a new case,

1032
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,750
所以你就不要再去找建宇和他爷爷了
so it has nothing to do with Gunwoo or his grandfather.

1033
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:32,260
现在开始 你单独和我的律师谈就行
You may speak to my lawyer from now on.

1034
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,640
你说什么
What did you say?

1035
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:36,140
你刚才不是说你是律师吗
Didn't you say that you're a lawyer?

1036
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,010
虽然我也是律师
I am a lawyer,

1037
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,560
但我打算委托别的律师来处理这件事
but I'd like to leave it to another lawyer.

1038
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:44,150
你说什么瞎话啊
What the heck are you saying?

1039
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,620
如果你能把这件事解决好 我就给你实习的机会
If you solve this, you can work with us.

1040
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,740
什么
What?

1041
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:03,620
稍等 千律师
Mr. Cheon.

1042
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:05,290
等一下 千律师
Wait, Mr. Cheon.

1043
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:06,920
稍等一下
Wait.

1044
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,380
喂
Excuse me!

1045
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,460
喂 你这个家伙
Hey, jerk!

1046
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,720
《平价正义》
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

1047
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,670
他太暴躁了 律师怎么能把事情闹得更大呢
A temper? A lawyer shouldn't get so worked up like that.

1048
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,260
我听说他和我们的答案不同
I hear they think differently from people like us.

1049
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:57,760
与其考虑律师应该用法律来解决…
Instead of thinking that a lawyer must use the law…

1050
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:59,680
法律离我们很远 但拳头离我们很近
The law is far, but the fist is near!

1051
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,310
千律师说律师要替他的委托人战斗
Mr. Cheon says that a lawyer fights in their client's stead.

1052
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:05,390
如果你做不到就告诉我 我可以替你做
Tell me if you can't. I can do it instead.

1053
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,520
我也能战斗 我来做
I can fight too. I'll do it.

1054
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,320
我的律师有多么厉害 你会知道的
You'll find out how amazing my lawyer is.
