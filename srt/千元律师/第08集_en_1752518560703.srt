Investigator, did you find anything on what I asked you?

89
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,220
我调查了一下
I looked into it.

90
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,100
跟金允燮议员最后通话的 是一个非法登记的手机号
The number Assemblyman Kim spoke to on the phone was from a burner phone.

91
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,900
你还要继续调查吗
Will you keep investigating?

92
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,270

Who knew Assemblyman Kim Yoonsub would do something like that?

96
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,960
他肯定是害怕了
I guess he was scared.

97
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,580
听说负责这次案件的检察官 也是那个人
Wasn't that guy in charge of his case again?

98
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,920
是叫千智勋吗
Was his name Cheon Jihun?

99
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,630
他们好像叫他瑞草洞疯狗
They say he's the mad dog of Seocho-dong.

109
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,180
检方 请进行反询问
Prosecution, begin your cross-examination.

110
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,470
检方
Prosecution.

111
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,890
好
Oh, right.

112

那个…
Well…

113
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,090
你之前说的你最尊敬的人
The person you said you respected the most before…

114
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,850
就是金允燮议员吗
Was it Assemblyman Kim Yoonsub?

115
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,100
但是
But…

116
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,020
那不是你的错
that wasn't your fault.

117
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,570
不知道这句话能不能帮到你
Though, I don't know if saying that helps at all.

118
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,540
这句话确实帮不上忙
No, it isn't much help.

119
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,580
他是我爸
He was my father.

120
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,400
但是智勋没有放弃
But Jihun didn't give up.

121
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,030
不管怎样 他都努力继续调查下去
He did whatever he could to continue the investigation.

122
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,110
每当这时他都会受到上级的施压
What he got in return each time was pressure from the higher-ups,

123
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,540
但智勋仍在继续孤单地战斗
but he continued his lonely fight.

124
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,290
资金未流向子公司 而流向外部人士

127
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,090

It doesn't matter if it isn't recent.

128
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,590
请把能找到的全部带回来
Bring all of them.

129
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,170
来 干杯
All right, drink up.

130
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,510
我是千智勋检察官 这里需要进行相关调查
I'm Prosecutor Cheon Jihun. We're here for an investigation.

131
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,180
-搜查官 -是
-Investigator. -Yes.

132
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,480
你为什么就是不听呢
Why didn't you listen to me?

133
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,400
我不是告诉过你不要调查那些政客吗
I told you not to poke around politicians.

134
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,900
现在上面都闹翻天了 你打算怎么办
The higher-ups are in a fit. What'll you do about it?

135
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,610
请你诚实回答
Please answer honestly.

136
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,110
你确定吗
Are you sure?

137
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,200
一会儿就好
It won't take long.

138
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,620
我们也要处理重案组的案子
We have the case of the violent crimes delegated too.

139
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,830
-你们是谁 -打扰了
-What is this? -Excuse me!

140
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,540
-快出去 -怎么回事
-Everybody, out! -What's going on?

141
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,900
我知道不管发生什么事 你都不会放弃
I know that you won't give up no matter what.

142
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,240
如果你需要我的帮助就告诉我
If you need my help, tell me.

143
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,080
调查根本进行不下去
I can't seem to continue the investigation.

144
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,670
谢谢你 前辈
Thanks, Yejin.

145
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,470
但是智勋什么都做不了
But there was nothing Jihun could do.

146
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,140
他没能找到那个最后和他爸通话的人
In the end, he couldn't find out the last person his father spoke to.

147
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,560
所以他才放弃做检察官吗
Is that why he left the prosecutors' office?

148
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,310
不是
No.

149
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,820
那是为什么
Then, why?

150
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,700
那个案件不是决定由你来接手了吗
Weren't you going to work on that?

151

-你要好好干 -是

这是你第三次笑
That's your third smile.

156
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,290
两年后

不是帮他违规拿到经营继承权了吗
Why was he unlawfully promoted?

158
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,960
-那说得通吗 -可恶
-Does that make sense? -Darn it!

159
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,670

这不是你打算喝的吗
But weren't you going to have this?

163
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,960
是的 但现在你好像比我更需要它
I was, but it looks like you need it more than me.

我花费了30年的时间
It took 30 years to get those words

169
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,450
才让这家律所站稳脚
inscribed over there.

170
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,210

等一下 我来猜一猜
Wait, let me guess.

173
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,890
但你得给我一点时间
But give me a moment, okay?

174
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,520
好 多长时间都行
Okay. You can take as long as you'd like.

175
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,150
好
All right.

不用管我 你坐下吧 赶快忙你的
No, have a seat. Continue working.

180
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,130
我不是说过 要猜一下你的梦想是什么吗
I said that I'd guess your dream, didn't I?

181

给你 看看你的梦想是不是这个

184
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,820
-白代表 -你不用感谢我
-Mr. Baek. -There's no need to thank me.

185
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,900
这是我之前就在考虑的事情
This was my plan from the start.

186
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,790
我没想到今天就要把这个给你
I didn't think I'd be handing you this today.

187
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,210
但看来我必须现在给你了

是别的公司想要挖走你吗
Did you get an offer from elsewhere?

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,230
不是的
No, sir.

191
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,520

我想要跟某个人一起共事

那个人是绝对不会来这里上班的
He probably wouldn't ever come here.

195
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,830
等一下 为什么
What? Why not?

196
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,170
房子不错吧 房租也十分合适
Isn't it nice? The rent isn't bad either.

197
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,430
要是能再宽敞一点就好了
I'd like it to be a bit more spacious.

198
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,590
因为是两个人一起用
There'll be two of us.

199

My goodness. Long time no see.

203
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,910

-My goodness. -Geez.

204
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,830
天啊 今天我的牌运真是好啊

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,800
该死的 又没抽到
Darn it. I messed up again.

210
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,970
真是的
Seriously.

211
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,470
你可怎么办啊
Too bad for you.

212
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,520
真是可恶
Goodness!

213
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,140
天啊
My, my.

214
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,020
喂 你疯了吧 我的牌值好几分呢
Hey! Have you lost your mind? I was winning by a lot!

215
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,150
那个女人和房屋中介一起过来了
She came with the realtor.

216
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,230
不管怎样 你一定要让她租你的房子
You have to make her move in no matter what, Eulrye.

217
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,190
对啊 房子都空了几年了啊
Yeah. It's been vacant for years.

218
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,570
姐 快笑
Smile, Eulrye.

219
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,030
天啊 你是来看二楼那间房子的吧
Ma'am, you must be here to see the second floor.

220
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,370
你好
Hello.

221
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,830
天啊 你来得正好
Oh, my goodness. I'm so glad you're here.

222
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,120
你一定会喜欢的
You'll absolutely love it.

223
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,630
汝真咖啡馆
YEOJIN COFFEE HOUSE

224
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,720

227
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,060
空间很大 光照也很充足
It's spacious and well-lit.

228
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,980
我很喜欢这里
I like it.

229
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,900
正合你心意吧
Don't you love it?

230
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,900
在这附近 以这样便宜的价格 你绝对找不到像这样的房子
You can't find a place like this around here at this price.

231
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,690
因为是我 才给你算便宜的
You're getting it cheap because of me.

232
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,030
便宜什么啊
Cheap? No one comes around here since the old men in the area are dead.

233
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,490
这附近的老头都死了 也没有人来咖啡馆
Cheap? No one comes around here since the old men in the area are dead.

234
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,450
对啊
That's right.

235
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,660
也没怎么有需要再装修的地方
It doesn't seem like it needs much work.

236
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,790
西红柿一千韩元 买点西红柿吧

你好
Good day.

242

不过
But…

243
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,150
你看起来不像是来这里开咖啡馆的
you don't seem like the type to run a coffee house.

244
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,900
你打算在这里做什么
What are you going to do here?

245
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,110
我要在这里开一家律师事务所
I'm going to open a lawyer's office.

246
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,500
周英
Juyeong.

247
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,430
是这里吗
This is it?

248
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,430
嗯 我打算从这里开始
Yes, I'd like to start in this neighborhood.

249
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,430
等到律所正式开业了 我最先邀请你
When I officially open, you'll be the first to be invited.

250
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,930
好
Mm.

251
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,230
你为什么想离开白法律事务所
Why do you want to leave Law Firm Baek?

252
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,230
我怕你离职后没地方去
Maybe because you won't have a place to go when you leave?

253
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,360
我打算聘用你
I plan on recruiting you.

254
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:18,700
不如你明天提交辞呈 然后来我的律所吧
Why don't you resign tomorrow and join our office?

255
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,740
怎么样
What do you think?

256
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,460
我不会辞去检察官的职务
I won't quit being a prosecutor.

257
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,380
你最近看镜子了吗
Do you look in the mirror these days?

258
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,960
你一天就睡三个小时吗
Do you get at least three hours of sleep a day?

259
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,720
那件事已经过去两年了
It has already been two years.

260
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,970
你没有找到任何线索
You still haven't found anything.

261
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:44,600
你现在应该放下一切 过自己的人生了吧
Shouldn't you stop and live your own life now?

262
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,190
我会自己看着办的

-放在那里就行 -好的

271
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,520
-再往前一点 -怎么那么多东西
-A little bit more. -Why do you have so many?

272
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,400
给你 喝一杯吧
Here, have a drink.

273
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,570
唉唷 你想讨好她啊

-没错 他很用心呢 -他对她真好
-That's right. He's trying hard. -He's being nice to her.

275
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,700
对啊
That's right.

276
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,560
千智勋 检察官

277
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,900
想跟我一起去买鱼的人 举手
Whoever wants to go get fish with me, raise your hand.

278
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,450
那一条好可爱
That one's so cute.

279
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,790
吓死我了
You scared me.

280
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,500
你来了
You're here.

281
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,880
亲爱的 看那条鱼
Look at that one, dear.

282
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,430
它超可爱
That one's so cute.

283
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,510
我要买15条鱼 你也快点挑几条
I'm going to buy 15 of them, so hurry up and pick some.

284
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,650
看那条红色的鱼
Look at that red one.

285
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,360
你仔细看那一条鱼
If you look at that one carefully,

286
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,570
它是黑色的 而且总是形单影只
he's dressed in black and all alone.

287
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,320
为了吸引别的鱼注意它
He's trying to impress the other ones.

288
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:53,250
其实我当时特别抗拒帮崔基泰辩护
Actually, I loathed having to defend Choi Kitae.

289
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,210
所以我才希望你能赢了那场官司
That's why I hoped you'd win.

290
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,170
你的外号可是不畏惧金钱和权力
The mad dog of Seocho-dong

291
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,550
要抓住所有坏人的瑞草洞疯狗
who doesn't care about money or power and catches everyone.

292
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,090
那对我来说象征着自由
That looked so liberating to me.

293
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,520
我也想和你一样 所以才从白法律事务所离职了
I left Law Firm Baek because I wanted to do that too.

294
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:16,150
我计算过了
I have it all planned out.

295
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,940
我可以在今后十年的时间里
I can defend whomever I want without any concern

296
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,230
接手我自己想要进行辩护的案件
for the next ten years or so.

297
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:27,450
这样一来 钱的方面可能有些紧张
My bank account might suffer in the meantime,

298
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,530
但心情应该会很好吧
but I'd be happy, don't you think?

299
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,960
智勋 你呢
What about you, Jihun?

300
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:46,180
你现在已经重获自由了吗
Are you as free as you want to be?

301
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,680
还是…
