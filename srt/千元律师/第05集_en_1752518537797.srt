打扰了
Excuse me.

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,710
请问你有什么事吗
How can I help you?

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,590
我希望你们可以负责一个案件

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,920
这是凶杀案

很抱歉 我们不接 凶杀案这种刑事大案
I'm sorry… We… we don't take on violent cases like murder.

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,510
他绝对不是凶手
I swear he didn't do it.

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,930
他杀了自己的父母啊
He killed his parent.

12
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,180
前所未闻的恶魔

13
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,890
-律师团队全部退出 -白法律事务所？
-All of the lawyers withdraw. -Baek?

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,150
这么大的律所都放弃辩护了
If a huge law firm like that would withdraw from it,

15
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,440
我们为什么要接手
why would we take it on?

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
你为什么要放弃辩护呢
Why did you withdraw from the case?

17
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,190
你知道金敏宰主张无罪吧
You know Mr. Kim is pleading not guilty, don't you?

18
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,610
不是主张 是事实
It's not a claim, it's the truth.

19
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,030
你的双亲去世了 你不难过吗
Both of your parents died. Aren't you sad?

20
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,070
我一定要难过吗
Do I have to be sad?

21
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,330
而且不是双亲 是其中一位吧
It isn't both of them. Isn't it just one of them?

22
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,790
我爸还没被发现 所以他还是失踪状态
My father hasn't been found yet, so he's missing.

23
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,660
那你认为杀死你母亲的人是谁呢
Then Mr. Kim, who do you think did that to your mother?

24
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,000
消失的父亲
My missing father.

25
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,250
他俩平时关系就不好
The two didn't get along.

26
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,840
但我无法相信 所以我对如何为他辩护毫无头绪
So, I couldn't figure out a way to defend Mr. Kim.

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,590
所以你打算怎么证明金敏宰是无辜的
How are you going to prove Mr. Kim Minjae's innocence?

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,300
我们要找到活着的金画家

29
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,260
-什么 -你真的相信他还活着吗
-What? -Do you believe he's alive?

30
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,100
他父亲应该还活着躲在某个地方
The father is alive and probably hiding somewhere.

31
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,970
我们要怎么去找金画家
How are we supposed to find him?

32
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,640
我要去亲眼看看案发现场
I need to see the crime scene in person.

徐民赫 你不是去美国进修了吗
Hey, Minhyeok. I thought you went to America to study.

49
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,410
你怎么会在这里
What are you doing here?

50
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,070
我进修回来了
I went and came back.

51
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,290

00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,040
千律师
Mr. Cheon!

54
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,920

我来调查凶杀案 却碰见了老朋友
I met an old friend in the middle of a murder investigation.

58
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,050

民赫哥
But…

62
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,640
你来这里干什么
why are you here, Minhyeok?

63
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,060
我来调查案发现场
I'm here for a field investigation.

64
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,020
看来我们负责的是同一个案件啊
It looks like we're on the same case.

65
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,270
民赫哥 你来这里干什么？
Why are you here, Minhyeok?

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,480
民赫哥 你来这里干什么？ 白实习 你们认识吗
Why are you here, Minhyeok? Ms. Baek, do you know him?

67
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,900
是的 我们从小关系就很好
Yes. We've known each other since we were young.

68
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,860
千律师 我听说你当检察官的时候 和他关系很好
I heard he's been close to you since the days at the Prosecutors' Office.

69
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,910
不过智勋 你那时候…
Jihun, back then…

70
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,580
-那时候？ -我是说三年前
-Back then? -I mean, three years ago.

71
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,460
-那时候你为什么… -三年前的时候？
-Back then, why-- -Back then, three years ago?

72
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,210
三年前的时候？
Back then, three years ago?

73
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,790
喂 你在三年前…
Hey. Three years ago, you--

74
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,170
算了
It's fine.

75
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,840
没什么 千智勋
Never mind, Cheon Jihun.

76
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,640
我们时隔三年才见 就因为这起案件碰上
I mean, we met after three years and have to work on the same case.

77
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,760
没关系吗
Are you okay with that?

78
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,400
不过你现在还会来调查案发现场
Anyway, you can even do a field investigation now.

79
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,400
看来你作为检察官成长了不少嘛
You've grown a lot as a prosecutor.

80
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,280
你一点也没成长 还和以前一样
And you haven't grown at all, but the same as before.

81
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,280
喂 你的发型很不错
Hey, you got your hair nicely done.

82
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,910
烫得很自然
Your perm looks natural.

83
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,120
这不是烫的
I didn't get a perm.

84
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,870
-是用卷发棒卷的 -是用卷发棒卷的
-He used a curling iron. -A curling iron.

85
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,750
好吧 卷发棒 这一点都不重要
Fine, a curling iron. Why is that so important?

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
卷得很好
It turned out well.

87
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,880
怎么了
Why? What is that face?

88
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,720
你紧张吗
What, are you nervous?

89
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,010
你的表情有些不自然
Your expression gives it away.

90
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,810
老实说 遇到你做我的检察官对手 我很紧张
To be honest, I am very nervous to have met you as the prosecutor.

91
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,360
各位 虽然我现在的心情非常紧张
So everyone, even though I am feeling very nervous,

92
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,150
但我们还是要回去调查
we have to go down to do our investigation.

93
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,620
招呼就打到这里 我们回去吧
Let's end our greetings now and go back down.

94
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,410
他让我很紧张
He makes me very nervous.

95
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,040
十分紧张
He makes me nervous.

96
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,450
等等我
Let's go.

97
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,330
-你居然会在这里碰见朋友 -就是说啊
-I can't believe you met a friend here. -I know.

98
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,040
你吓了我一跳
You startled me.

99
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,050
真是的
Gosh.

100
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,390
好 我们慢慢四处看看吧
Then let's look around slowly.

101
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,890
我和事务长去一楼
Mr. Sa and I will take the first floor.

102
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,560
然后二楼 民赫…
For the second floor, Minhyeok…

103
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,560
和…
and…

104
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,850
白实习 你过来一下
Ms. Baek, come here for a second.

105
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,480
白实习 那个…
Ms. Baek, so…

106
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,490
你和民赫一起上楼
You should go up with Minhyeok

107
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,110
并详细记下他的想法
and make a detailed mental note of what he is thinking.

108
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,620
为什么
Why?

109
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,870
干吗
What?

110
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,670
你现在是让我当间谍吗
Are you telling me to act as a spy?

111
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,390
你干吗呢
What are you doing?

112
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,890
民赫哥 我们一起上二楼吧 你没问题吧
Minhyeok, let's go upstairs together. Are you okay with that?

113
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,310
随便你
As you wish.

114
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,610
千律师 你没有自尊心吗
Mr. Cheon, have you no pride?

115
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,950
你得自己找线索啊
You should find things out on your own.

116
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
你干吗总在意那位检察官
Why do you keep tending to that prosecutor?

117
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,450
我不是在意他 我得这样对他 心里才舒服
I'm not tending to him, but I feel better doing that for him.

118
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,580
你明白我的意思吧
-Ooh. -Do you know what I'm saying?

119
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,040
嗯
Yeah.

120
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,340
好了 那我们走吧
Okay, let's go then.

121
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,390
进来吧
Come in.

122
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,740
你在这里看到我 然后误以为我是金画家 是吧
You saw me from here and mistook me for Artist Kim, didn't you?

123
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,530
是的
Yes.

124
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,410
不过你真的相信 是金画家杀了柳馆长吗
Do you really believe Artist Kim killed Director Yoo?

125
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,790
千律师是这样认为的 说实话我不知道
Mr. Cheon does. I really don't know.

126
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,000
他为什么这么认为
What is the source of Jihun's belief?

127
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,670
等一下
Wait.

128
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,590
你现在是想从我这里套取信息吗
Are you trying to extort intel from me?

129
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,590
你居然说我要套取信息
What? Intel, did you say?

130
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,930
玛丽 任谁看都会认为 我会赢这场官司
Mari, it's obvious to everyone that I will win this case.

131
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,350
你不是见过金敏宰了嘛
You've met Kim Minjae.

132
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,520
警方也很快就会找到金画家的尸体
Artist Kim's body will be found soon.

133
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,560
到时候
When that happens…

134
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,270
不知道千智勋会说些什么
I wonder what Jihun will say then.

135
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,030
老实说我也不知道他在想什么
To be honest, I don't know what Mr. Cheon is thinking.

136
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,110
他本就让人捉摸不透
He is so unpredictable.

137
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,240
你不是比我更了解吗
Don't you know that better than I do?

138
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,410
什么
Me?

139
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,620
我是很了解
I guess I do.

140
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,880
他当检察官的时候
When he was with the prosecution,

141
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,340
全是我一手教出来的
I had to teach him from A to Z.

142
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,630
什么
What?

143
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,210
什么
What?

144
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,300
就是说所有的事情都发生在这里？
So everything happened right here?

145
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,600
按照金敏宰的主张
Like Kim Minjae said,

146
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,770
如果金画家杀死柳馆长后逃走的话…
if Artist Kim killed Director Yoo and ran away…

147
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,190
金画家现在会躲在哪里呢
Where would Artist Kim be hiding now?

148
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
这个嘛
I'm not sure.

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,070
应该逃到了一个只有他知道的地方吧
He probably went to a place only he knows of.

150
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,330
只有他知道的地方？
A place only he knows of?

151
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,700
正在调查 禁止出入
DO NOT CROSS, UNDER INVESTIGATION

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,170
他认为…
He thinks that…

153
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,040
你们看完了吗
Are you done looking?

154
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,170
嗯 差不多 你呢
Yes, roughly. How about you?

155
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,300
目前我还没发现什么特别的
I didn't see anything special.

156
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,640
从现在开始 我要正式开始搜查
I will look more thoroughly from now on.

157
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,270
你不会已经有所发现 却瞒着我吧
You're not hiding something you already found, are you?

158
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,810
你们聊吧 我先走了
Keep talking. I will leave first.

159
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,270
玛丽 需要我送你吗
Mari, do you want a ride?

160
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,440
不用了 民赫哥 你先走吧 我们下次见
No, go ahead. I'll see you next time.

161
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,150
不用吗
Are you sure?

162
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,490
那好吧 下次见
Okay then. See you later.

163
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,950
民赫 你确定没有对我隐瞒什么吗
Minhyeok, are you sure you're not hiding anything?

164
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,410
你到底为什么这样
Why are you acting like this?

165
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,410
千律师 你没有自尊心吗
Mr. Cheon, have you no pride?

166
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,500
你为什么这么在意民赫哥
Why do you keep Minhyeok in check?

167
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,290
不是那样的 他只是…
It's not that, he's just…

168
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,420
事务长 你刚才不是明白了嘛
Mr. Sa, you understood what I told you.

169
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,760
你替我解释吧
Explain to her for me.

170
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,340
这两个人…
Those two…

171
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,640
你明白我的意思吧
You know what I'm saying, right?

172
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,940
他在说什么啊
What is he saying?

173
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,360
第一洗衣店

174
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,370
汝真咖啡馆

175
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,490
辛苦了 白实习
Good work, Ms. Baek.

176
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,200
-辛苦了 我走了 -好 走吧
-Nice work. Good night. -Good night.

177
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,120
千律师 你也回去休息吧
Mr. Cheon, go get some rest.

178
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,500
-辛苦了 回去吧 -好的
-Nice work today. See you later. -Good night.

179
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,170
这车真是…
This old car…

180
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,920
《平价正义》
ONE DOLLAR LAWYER

181
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,170
我会向部长报告
I will brief the chief,

182
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,550
所以请注意一下记者那边
so please take care of the reporters.

183
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,890
好
Yes.

184
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,640
好 我很快就回去 好的
Yes, I will be in soon. Okay.

185
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,350
-你怎么不走了 -我们到学校了
-Why did you stop walking? -We arrived at school.

186
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,270
一同打造我们的未来
EDUCATING OUR FUTURE TOGETHER

187
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,810
抱歉 我真是忙晕了
I'm sorry. Mommy was preoccupied.

188
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,270
你的准备物品呢
What about the school supplies?

189
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,860
运动服 室内鞋的鞋袋和黏土 我都带来了
Gym uniform, slippers pouch, and clay. I brought them all.

190
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,870
我家汝媛真是长大了
My Yeowon is all grown up now.

191
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,490
我可不能这么快长大 我要长得和你一样高
I'm not grown up yet. I want to grow as much as you.

192
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,660
我知道了 今天和朋友们好好玩吧
Okay. Have a good day with your friends.

193
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,170
妈妈 再见
Bye, Mommy.

194
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,630
再见
Bye.

195
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,210
早上好 我来得有点晚了吧
Good morning. Sorry, I'm a bit late.

196
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,550
早上好
Welcome.

197
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,880
这些都是什么
What is all this?

198
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,140
我边看调查记录边整理了一下
I just organized some stuff while looking at the investigation report.

199
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,890
徐检察官昨晚在这里熬了一夜
Mr. Seo spent the night here.

200
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,390
-是吗 -是啊
Is that right?

201
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,560
看来你很认真嘛 是吧
I guess Minhyeok is all in this. Right?

202
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,940
是因为这个案子 还是因为智勋
Is it because of the case, or is it because of Jihun?

203
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
两者都不是
It's neither.

204
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,030
那是因为什么呢
Then what?

205
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,000
检察官努力工作还能有什么原因
What special reasons is there for a prosecutor to work hard?

206
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,630
这就对了
That's what I'm talking about.

207
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,960
你看过之后觉得怎么样
So, how does the case look to you?

208
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,340
我认为我们要继续搜查
Okay, so I think we need to keep investigating,

209
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,350
但除了龙虎山 还要考虑其他地方
but we should consider other locations beside Mt. Yongho.

210
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,140
如果
What if…

211
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,350
他在路上把尸体埋在了某处呢
he buried the body somewhere on the way?

212
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,770
从他路过监控的时间来看
Considering the time he passed the CCTV,

213
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,690
我认为他中途没有 足够的时间停下来埋尸
I don't think he had enough time to make a stop to bury the body.

214
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,740
这里 这座桥怎么样
Here. How about this bridge?

215
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,290
我们进行了水下搜索 但什么也没搜到
We did an underwater search, but nothing was found.

216
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,550
如果尸体漂走了呢
What if the body drifted away?

217
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:15,220
万一他运气好 尸体顺着江漂走了呢
What if he got lucky and it floated away with the flow of the river?

218
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,220
我甚至在考虑 这是一起没有尸体的凶杀案
I am even considering a murder case without the body.

219
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,220
智勋也会咬住这一点不放
Jihun will also focus on this fact.

220
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,980
如果
What if…

221
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,060
像金敏宰的主张一样
As Kim Minjae claimed,

222
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,440
父亲杀害母亲后 消失的可能性…
the likelihood that his father killed his mother and disappeared is…

223
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,450
真的是零吗
really zero probability?

224
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,790
-是的 我认为不可能 -为什么
-I believe it's not possible. -Why not?

225
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,750
周围的人对他们家庭关系的 证词足以证明这一点
The testimony of the people who knew them supports my belief.

226
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,130
还有柳馆长在急诊室留下的死亡信息
There is also the dying message Director Yoo left in the emergency room.

227
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,550
金敏宰…
Kim Minjae…

228
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,760
他肯定是凶手
He's sure to be convicted,

229
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,760
我们现在就差找到金画家的尸体了
as long as we find Artist Kim's body.

230
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,180
是啊
That's true.

231
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,770
可是
But…

232
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,020
智勋为什么要接这个案子呢
why do you think Jihun took this case?

233
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,150
六亿韩元？一幅画值六亿韩元？
Six hundred million? It's 600 million for one painting?

234
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,520
对 六亿韩元
Yes, 600 million.

235
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,490
一幅一个男人撑着伞的风景画而已 这就值六亿韩元吗
A landscape painting with a man with an umbrella costs 600 million won?

236
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,660
唉唷 这个我也能画
My gosh, I could draw this.

237
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,030
你能画吗
You can?

238
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,500
事务长 你懂画吗
Mr. Sa, do you know much about art?

239
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,290
所以这就是他的标志 懂吗
So, this is… Signature.

240
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,300
这被称为标志
It's something called a signature.

241
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,590
你看金画家的风景画时
When you look at Artist Kim's landscapes,

242
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,430
会看到他所有的画中都画了 一个撑着黑伞的男人
all of his paintings have a man with a black umbrella in them.

243
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,600
这就是金画家的标志
This is Artist Kim's signature style.

244
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,850
这是金春吉画家在失踪前
This is the last painting Artist Kim Chungil did in the atelier

245
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,270
在画室画的最后一幅画
before his disappearance.

246
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,150
撑着黑伞的男人不是金画家的标志吗
Apparently, a man with a black umbrella is Artist Kim's signature style.

247
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,320
民赫 等你看完 就把这幅画还给画廊
Minhyeok, return this painting after a careful study.

248
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,030
它很快就会被拍卖
This will go up for auction soon.

249
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,580
这幅画真不错
His work is nice.

250
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,410
这确实值六亿韩元
It looks to be about 600 million won.

251
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,330
千律师 你见过值六千万韩元的画吗
Mr. Cheon, have you ever seen a painting worth 60 million before?

252
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:15,710
要赚六千万韩元的话 我们得接多少案子啊
How many cases would we have to take to earn 60 million won?

253
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:19,970
还是别聊了 我能指望一个千元律师赚到什么钱
I should stop talking. What can I expect from The 1,000-won Lawyer?

254
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,930
你刚才叫我千元律师吗
Did you say 1,000-won Lawyer?

255
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,100
-我… -千元律师？
-I… -The 1,000-won Lawyer?

256
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,310
千元律师 听起来不错
The 1,000-won Lawyer… sounds really good.

257
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,190
千律师 千元律师
Mr. Cheon, The 1,000-won Lawyer.

258
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,860
我们要不要 把事务所的名称改成千元律师
Should I change the office name to The 1,000-won Lawyer?

259
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,240
很不错嘛 千元律师
That sounds nice! The 1,000-won Lawyer.

260
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,490
很好
Good!

261
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,740
-很不错 -嗯
-That sounds nice. -Yes.

262
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,290
让我看看 这是什么
Let's see. What is this?

263
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,200
白玛丽实习律师
PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEE BAEK MARI

264
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,000
这是那时候…
This was when…

265
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,540
-白代表 -嗯
-Mr. Baek. -Yes.

266
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,300
弄好了
-It's done. -Aah.

267
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,380
很抱歉昨晚才联系你
I'm sorry to call you last night.

268
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,090
下次请提前联系我
Please call ahead next time.

269
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,760
白代表 要不是你拜托我 我不会做
If it wasn't for Mr. Baek's request, I wouldn't have been able to do it.

270
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,520
要不是太着急 我也不会亲自跑一趟
It's so urgent that I came in person.

271
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,680
下次我请你喝酒
I'll buy you a drink next time.

272
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:13,440
好 我知道了
Yes, thank you.

273
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,730
-谢谢你 -辛苦了
-Thank you. -Good work.

274
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,190
-慢走 -好
-Take care. -Okay.

275
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,030
听到了吧 人家让你提前联系
Did you hear him? You need to call ahead.

276
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,200
好的
Okay.

277
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,070
要不是爷爷…
My grandpa--

278
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,780
不对 要不是白代表 我可怎么办啊
I mean, Mr. Baek. What would I have done without you?

279
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,870
行了 走吧
It's fine. Let's go.

280
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,620
我们走吧 爷爷
Let's go, Grandpa.

281
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,590
这视频拍的是之前那家法国餐厅
Hey. Isn't this video from that French restaurant the other day?

282
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
对 没错
Yes, it is.

283
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
俗话说马也有一技之长
They say even horses know how to roll over.

284
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
没想到白实习把这拍下来了
Ms. Baek took a video of the meeting.

285
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,600
-是熊 -什么
-It's a bear. -What?

286
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,180
好 是熊
Yes, a bear.

287
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,560
不 是白土蚕
No, it's a slug. A slug.

288
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,770
真羡慕你这么聪明
You must be proud to be so smart.

289
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,610
不过怎么没有声音啊
How come there's no sound?

290
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,070
怎么会没声音呢 我已经调到最大了
Hmm?

291
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,780
怎么会没声音呢 我已经调到最大了
What is wrong with the sound? The volume is at maximum.

292
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,330
看来离得太远 声音没录进去
I guess it didn't pick up any sound because the distance is too far.

293
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,080
事务长 你听到什么了吗
Mr. Sa, did you hear anything?

294
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:21,210
那你呢 我看你听得很认真
How about you, Mr. Cheon? You seemed to listen intently.

295
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,590
别担心 我有办法
Don't worry. I have a way.

296
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,140
什么办法
What way?

297
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,220
事务长 请给我泡杯咖啡
Mr. Sa, please get me a cup of coffee.

298
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,560
好
Okay.

299
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,410
这是你的咖啡
Here's your coffee.

300
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,120
怎么样了
So, what happened?

301
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,160
现在这个 我…
So right now, I…

302
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,840
这香味怎么这么好闻
Why does this smell so good?

303
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,750
你都可以开咖啡店了
You should open a café.

304
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,760
谢谢
Thank you.

305
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,550
我仔细看了一下视频
I took a close look at this,

306
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,430
她们在说这些
and they were saying these things. Mm.

307
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,850
你看看吧
Have a look.

308
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,980
早上好 我来了
Good morning, I'm here.

309
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,320
你在干什么
What are you doing?

310
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
玛丽 你这是干什么
What's wrong with you, Mari?

311
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,660
你刚才发给我的视频
You know, the video you sent me earlier.

312
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,410
声音一点也没录进去
There is no sound at all.

313
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,990
所以呢
So, what?

314
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,790
所以你做错了
So you did it wrong, that's what.

315
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,750
唉唷 干活真不利索
Geez. How clumsy.

316
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,250
别担心 我正在通过她们的唇形 准确地读出她们在说什么
Don't worry. I am reading their lips to figure out what they're saying.

317
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,170
千律师还有这种惊人的才能呢
I didn't know Mr. Cheon has this amazing talent.

318
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,050
给我看看
Let's see.

319
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,430
你不用继续了
You can stop.

320
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,350
什么 为什么
Why?

321
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,810
我边看视频边告诉你原因
I'll explain to you as we watch the video together.

322
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,650
最近一条鱿鱼多少钱
How much is one squid these days?

323
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,150
有点贵
It's expensive.

324
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,440
是吗
Is that so?

325
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,240
一条鱿鱼七千韩元
It's 7,000 won for a squid.

326
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,990
我还想吃炒鱿鱼呢
I wanted to eat stir-fried squid.

327
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,120
你想吃的话 我给你做
If you want some, I'll cook it for you.

328
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,160
你还想吃什么
What else do you want to eat?

329
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,210
炒鳀鱼
Stir-fried anchovies.

330
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,460
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

331
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:35,220
白实习 你怎么这么说 明明每个字都和她们的唇形吻合
What are you talking about, Ms. Baek? The lips appear to be saying that.

332
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,850
你不觉得奇怪吗
That doesn't seem odd to you? You really think they talked about that?

333
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,470
她们就在那里说这些吗
That doesn't seem odd to you? You really think they talked about that?

334
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,600
也有这种可能吧
But they could have.

335
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,810
最近鱿鱼的售价堪比黄金
The price of squid is as high as gold these days.

336
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,900
想吃也吃不到
You can't have it even if you want to.

337
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,190
我明白了
I know.

338
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,450
所以
I think…

339
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,030
鱿鱼这个单词
there is a hidden meaning

340
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,120
隐藏着某种含义
in the word squid.

341
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,290
才不是那个意思
It's not that at all.

342
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,130
给你
Here.

343
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,500
这是什么
What is this?

344
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,670
读唇术
It's about labiomancy.

345
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,220
读…什么 读唇术？
What… Labiomancy?

346
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,550
还有这种东西吗
-Mm. -There is such a thing?

347
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,560
-千律师 你知道这个吧 -嗯 我很了解读唇术
-Mr. Cheon, you know about it, right? -Yes, I know labiomancy well.

348
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,930
所谓读唇术就是在我们的生活中
So, labiomancy is… as we live our lives, we all have to--

349
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,940
互相依靠…
So, labiomancy is… as we live our lives, we all have to--

350
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,770
事务长 你怎么连这个都不知道
Mr. Sa, how can you not know this?

351
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,570
还要我给你讲解吗
Do I have to explain these things to you?

352
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,780
玛丽 你替我讲解一下
Mari, explain to him for me.

353
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,150
好的 事务长
Yes, Mr. Sa.

354
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,910
它不是指某种法术
It's not a law of something.

355
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,950
看唇形读出说话人所说的话
The art of lip-reading

356
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,950
-就叫做读唇术 -就叫做读唇术
-is called labiomancy. -Is called labiomancy.

357
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,620
原来是看唇形的读唇术啊
I see, the lip-reading labiomancy.

358
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:48,420
好 既然已经了解了读唇术 那我们从这里开始看吧
Now that we learned about labiomancy, let's take a look from here.

359
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,590
好
Okay.

360
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,430
你找我有什么事吗
So, what is this about?

361
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,430
我需要些钱
I need some money.

362
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,560
那你为什么来找我
So, why did you want to see me about it?

363
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,560
我没有拿到退职金
It turns out I didn't get my severance pay.

364
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,640
退职金吗
The severance pay?

365
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,810
我计算了一下
I did some calculations

366
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,190
我应该再多拿一些
and it seems like I need to get paid more.

367
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,030
什么
What?

368
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,450
我认为我有资格拿
I think I deserve to be paid more.

369
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,450
如果我不给呢
What if I won't pay you?

370
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,830
那我就告诉警察
Then I will have to tell the police.

371
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,290
你要告诉他们什么
Tell them what?

372
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,460
我知道的事
What I know.

373
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,130
你知道什么
What do you know?

374
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,050
搞什么啊
What is this?

375
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,140
她说了什么
What did she say?

376
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,560
等一下 我们再看一遍
Let's watch it again.

377
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,600
-正好挡住了 -怎么就正好挡住了呢
-She is completely blocking her. -How can she block her?

378
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,900
韩才淑说了什么
What did Han Jaesook say?

379
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,900
我想她正要说对案件至关重要的事
I think she was telling her something critical to the case.

380
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,780
我马上联系韩才淑
I'll contact Ms. Han right away.

381
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,110
我们走吧
Let's go.

382
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,910
去哪里 你要去哪
Where are you going? Where?

383
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,870
去见韩才淑吗
To meet Ms. Han Jaesook?

384
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,080
你见到韩才淑
You're going to meet Ms. Han Jaesook

385
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,370
问她那天打算告诉警察什么
and ask, That day, what were you going to tell the police?

386
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:13,630
你认为她就会说 我要告诉警察这件事
Do you think she will say, That day, I was gonna tell the police…

387
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,630
然后把一切都告诉你吗
-and tell you everything? -Mm-mm.

388
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,010
不 她不会说
Mm-mm.

389
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,380
不 她不会说
No, she won't.

390
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:19,930
是啊
So, you're right.

391
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,600
那我们现在该怎么办
So, what do we do now?

392
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
那样的话…
So…

393
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,270
我们认识的另一个人
The other person we know…

394
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:39,200
不就在这里嘛
is right there.

395
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,700
韩才淑来找过我
Han Jaesook came to see me.

396
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,750
为什么
Why?

397
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,460
如果不给她钱
If I don't give her money,

398
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,340
她就去警察局把她知道的事情说出来
she says she will go to the police and tell them what she knows.

399
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,000
她知道什么
What does she know?

400
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,300
如果我不给呢
What if I won't pay you?

401
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,430
那我就告诉警察
Then I will have to tell the police.

402
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,470
你要告诉他们什么
Tell them what?

403
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,180
我知道的事

404
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,060
你知道什么
What do you know?

405
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,150
你父亲…
Where…

406
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,860
的去向
your father is.

407
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,250
让她告诉警察吧
Let her tell the police.

408
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,210
那你呢
What about you then?

409
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,250
她不会说出来的
She won't be able to tell them.

410
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,090
别担心
Don't worry.

411
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,170
你到底为什么那么做
Why on earth did you do that?

412
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,180
快结束了
It's almost done.

413
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,260
马上就结束了
It'll be over soon.

414
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,270
对不起 姐
I'm sorry, Suyeon.

415
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:34,410
千智勋律师
ATTORNEY CHEON JIHUN

416
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,500
谢谢你接这个案子
Thank you for taking the case.

417
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,540
好
Sure.

418
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
其实
Actually…

419
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,010
我以为你不会接这个案子
I didn't think you would take the case.

420
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,180
因为所有人都认为敏宰是凶手
Everyone thinks Minjae is the killer.

421
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,310
所以才需要律师的存在 不是吗 白实习
That's why you get a lawyer. Isn't that right, Ms. Baek?

422
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:57,850
千律师 你相信敏宰不是凶手吗
Mr. Cheon, do you believe Minjae is not the killer?

423
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
是的 我相信他不是
Yes. I believe he isn't.

424
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:04,280
昨天那位急救患者怎么样了
By the way, what happened to the emergency patient yesterday?

425
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,280
幸好已经渡过危急情况了
Fortunately, she is past the critical state.

426
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,490
看来你在餐厅见病人啊
Do you meet your patients at a restaurant?

427
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,120
我们去餐厅的时候
By coincidence, we went to a restaurant

428
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,040
碰巧在那里看见你了
and coincidentally, we saw you there.

429
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,880
你和韩才淑在一起
You were with Ms. Han Jaesook.

430
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,050
你们在这么贵的地方吃晚饭啊
You had dinner at an expensive place.

431
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,430
对 确实有点贵
Yes, it was quite expensive.

432
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,390
你为什么取消与我们会面 去见韩才淑
Why did you cancel your appointment with us to meet with Ms. Han Jaesook?

433
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,140
我们昨天没谈什么
We didn't talk about much yesterday.

434
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,690
她是因为退职金才来找我的
It was just about her severance pay.

435
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,730
退职金？
Severance pay?

436
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,440
你说的就是 我们通常所说的那种退职金吗
Are you talking about the severance pay that people normally talk about?

437
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,030
对 没错 她可能觉得不够
Yes, you're right. She must've thought it wasn't enough.

438
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,410
问我能不能再给她一些
She asked me if I could give her some more.

439
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,450
她拿退职金当借口 要对警察说些什么…
Did she use the severance pay as an excuse to go to the police--

440
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,330
唉唷
Gosh.

441
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,910
这里有虫子
There are bugs here.

442
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,330
我们来谈点别的吧
Let's talk about something else.

443
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,840
我看了你们的家庭关系
I reviewed your family situation.

444
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,630
你母亲在五年前再婚了
Your mother seems to have remarried five years ago.

445
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,300
对 因为我妈再婚 敏宰才成了我的弟弟
Yes. Minjae became my brother through her marriage.

446
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,930
金敏宰并非你的亲弟弟 你相信他所有的话吗
He isn't even your real brother. Do you believe everything he says?

447
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,350
他连虫子也杀不了
He can't even kill a bug.

448
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,680
那会是金敏宰的真实面目吗
Is that Mr. Kim Minjae's true self?

449
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,810
对 我很了解他
Yes. I know Minjae very well.

450
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,190
那他说你父亲杀害母亲后逃跑了
Then do you believe him when he says that your father killed her

451
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,900
这你也全部相信吗
and ran away?

452
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:33,320
是的 我相信他
Yes. I believe him.

453
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,830
他们经常吵架
They argued a lot.

454
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,250
每当他们大声争吵时 总会有一个人受伤
When they were screaming at each other, either of them always got hurt.

455
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,130
我和敏宰都希望他们干脆离婚算了
Both Minjae and I hoped they would just get divorced.

456
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,840
那样的话 就不会发生这种事了
If they did, this wouldn't have happened.

457
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,010
那你母亲…
Then why did your mother…

458
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,090
为什么会在生命的 最后一刻说出那种话呢
say that in the last moment of her life?

459
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,640
秀妍 是敏宰…
Suyeon, Minjae…

460
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,480
如果真是她老公刺伤了她
If it was her husband who stabbed her,

461
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,030
那为什么她会提到金敏宰的名字呢
why did your mother say Mr. Kim Minjae's name?

462
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,780
我也想知道这是为什么
I'm curious about that too.

463
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,450
千律师 请你查明真相吧
I hope you will find out, Mr. Cheon.

464
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,370
只要我爸出现
If my father is found,

465
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,290
就能证明敏宰的清白
you will be able to prove Minjae's innocence.

466
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,330
好 你别太担心 我们会找到你父亲
Yes, please don't worry. We will find your father.

467
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,880
到时候我们再谈吧
We will talk again after that.

468
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,720
白实习
Ms. Baek.

469
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,760
你刚才到底在干什么
What were you doing?

470
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,270
我们可是金敏宰的辩护人
We are Mr. Kim Minjae's attorneys.

471
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,230
你怎么能一直问带有攻击性的问题呢
Why did you keep asking aggressive questions?

472
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,480
可该问的也得问啊
But we have to ask things we need to know.

473
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,520
不过你哪里不舒服吗 怎么一直咳嗽
By the way, is there something wrong? Why did you keep coughing?

474
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,150
你是在担心我吗
Are you worried about me?

475
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,030
什么
What?

476
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,790
总之你到底打算怎么找到他父亲
Anyway, how will you find the father?

477
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,500
那么多警察至今都没能找到他
All those police officers have not been able to find him yet.

478
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,170
在案发现场有一个唯一的目击者
There was a sole witness at the time of the incident.

479
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,500
韩才淑吗
Ms. Han Jaesook?

480
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,970
她去逛早市 很晚才回来啊
Ms. Han Jaesook went to the dawn market and came back late.

481
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,300
你好好想想
Think, will you?

482
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,600
好 所以那个目击者是谁
Then who is that sole witness?

483
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,280
可疑
It's strange.

484
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,450
十分可疑
It's strange.

485
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:39,780
对 肯定很可疑
Yes, it must be strange.

486
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,410
-什么 -怎么了
-What? -What?

487
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,080
千律师 你相信金秀妍所说的一切吗
So, do you believe everything Ms. Kim Suyeon told us?

488
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,630
她说她父亲杀害母亲后逃跑了
She says her father killed her mother and ran away.

489
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,460
金敏宰和金秀妍都有点可疑
Both Kim Minjae and Kim Suyeon, something is fishy with them.

490
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,050
他们是有些可疑
Something must be fishy with them.

491
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,140
所以我们去找目击者吧
So let's go find the witness.

492
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,350
请说出您的目的地
Please state your destination.

493
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,930
永远画廊
Gallery Yeongwon.

494
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,520
为您导航到永远画廊
Directions to Gallery Yeongwon.

495
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,100
我们去这里吧
Let's go there.

496
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,150
你说要去见目击者 我们去这里干吗
I thought we were going to meet the witness. Why go there?

497
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,520
我们去找画
To get the painting.

498
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,610
什么画
What painting?

499
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,740
金画家画的最后一幅画
Artist Kim's last painting.

500
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,200
难道唯一的目击者…
You can't be serious. Do you mean the last witness was…

501
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,160
对 没错 就是那幅画
Yes, you're right. It was the painting.

502
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,910
那幅画一直挂在那间画室里
That painting must've been in that atelier the whole time.

503
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,750
它肯定从头到尾 目睹了那里发生的事情
It would've witnessed what happened from the beginning to the end.

504
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,550
-千律师 -什么
-Mr. Cheon. -Yes?

505
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:35,260
你找到画后打算怎么办
What if we find the painting?

506
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,510
我找到画后要问问它
We will find the painting and ask…

507
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,930
我们要追查什么
what we have to chase.

508
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,480
-我们走吧 -无法识别
-Let's go. -Command not recognized.

509
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,810
-我们走吧 -我无法理解
-Let's go. -I did not understand.

510
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
-嗯 -我没有听懂
-Okay. -I did not get that.

511
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,360
我是金敏宰的辩护人
I am Mr. Kim Minjae's lawyer.

512
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,120
你们想看金春吉画家 画的最后那幅画？
Did you say you wanted to see Artist Kim Chungil's last painting?

513
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,700
对 没错
Yes, that's right.

514
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:10,000
这可怎么办 因为拍卖会在即 它被送到拍卖行了
I'm sorry. The painting was sent to the auctioneer to be auctioned soon.

515
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
拍卖？
An auction?

516
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,000
人们对这幅画很感兴趣
There is a huge interest in the painting.

517
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,220
毕竟这是金画家的遗作 人们不感兴趣才奇怪
It's not surprising, now that it is Artist Kim's posthumous work.

518
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,510
你一定很震惊吧
You must've been shocked to see something like this happen to one of your artists.

519
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,470
你的上司发生这种事
You must've been shocked to see something like this happen to one of your artists.

520
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,020
对 我到现在还无法相信
Yes. I still can't believe it.

521
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,600
金春吉画家和柳熙珠馆长 是怎么认识的
How did you meet Artist Kim Chungil and Director Yoo Heeju?

522
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,940
柳馆长以前 会四处寻找有才华的新晋画家
Director Yoo used to go around searching for talented new artists.

523
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,450
后来她偶然看到了金画家的画
And she happened upon one of Artist Kim's paintings.

524
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:45,910
在这个圈子 并不是只要画作好就能卖高价
This field doesn't necessarily put the highest price on the best work.

525
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,250
而是会根据 谁给作品赋予了怎样的故事
It depends on who gives what kind of narrative to the work

526
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,920
来决定是值一百万韩元还是一亿韩元
to determine whether it is worth a million won or 100 million won.

527
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,090
然后他们很快就结婚了
Soon afterward, they got married.

528
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,210
这对他俩来说是双赢
It was a win-win situation for both.

529
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,550
至少在那件事发生之前
At least before that incident happened.

530
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,390
真的没有办法看到那幅画吗
Is there any way to see that painting?

531
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,270
倒是有一个办法
There is one way.

532
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,900
你在拍卖会上拍下来就行 虽然有点贵
You can buy it at the auction. It will be a little expensive, though.

533
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,450
他们刚才来过了
They were just here.

534
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,200
不会有事吧
Nothing will happen, right?

535
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,000
怎么会有事呢
Why would anything happen?

536
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,580
那天我就不该在那里睡一晚 真麻烦
I shouldn't have slept over that night. Things got inconvenient.

537
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,210
他们也来找我了 我挂了
They came to me now. Hang up.

538
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,640
他是朴记者 对吧
That's Reporter Park, right?

539
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,060
久仰大名
I heard a lot about you.

540
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,390
你因报导金春吉画家的 独家采访而闻名
You're famous for getting an exclusive with Artist Kim Chungil.

541
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,440
对 只有我能采访到他
Yes. Only I could interview him.

542
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,980
你有什么秘诀吗
Is there a secret to that?

543
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,940
艺术也是生意
Art is business too.

544
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,030
当有钱人聚在一起时会谈论艺术
When rich people get together, they talk about art.

545
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,200
-当艺术家们聚在一起时… -他们会谈论金钱
-When the artists get together-- -They talk about money.

546
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,950
你很了解嘛
You know very well.

547
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,660
很讽刺吧
Isn't it ironic?

548
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,950
所以必须有人把他们介绍给有钱人
So, somebody has to introduce them to the rich people.

549
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,790
就是说你以介绍有钱人给他为条件
So it was under the condition of introducing them,

550
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,750
获得了他的独家采访权
that you were able to get an exclusive interview with him.

551
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,960
这是一部分原因
That's a part of it.

552
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,800
金画家不太喜欢见人
Artist Kim didn't like meeting people much.

553
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,380
金画家 相比你以前的画作 和现存的画作
Compared to your previous piece and your body of work,

554
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,680
这幅画的画风很粗犷
this piece has a rough texture.

555
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,600
我想问这是否反映了你的情绪
I would like to ask you if this is a reflection of your own state of mind.

556
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,730
是的
Yes, right.

557
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,770
我从来没有见过那么努力画画的人
I have never seen anyone work so hard on his painting.

558
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,020
一旦画家达到那种地位 多少都会放松一些
When you reach that status, you could take it a bit easy.

559
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,280
难道不是因为钱吗
Wasn't it because of money?

560
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,490
他家很富丽堂皇
His house was very impressive.

561
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,530
他对钱不感兴趣
He had no interest in money.

562
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,990
他大约三年前才搬到那里
He moved there about three years ago.

563
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,950
金画家非常喜欢他家附近的湖
Artist Kim really liked the lake near the house.

564
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,420
他搬家之前就经常去那个湖边画画
He used to visit the lake often to paint it even before he moved there.

565
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,830
湖？
The lake?

566
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,050
对 就是金画家画的 最后那幅画里的湖
Yes. The very lake that is in his last painting.

567
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:14,850
那你最后一次看到那幅画是什么时候
When was the last time you saw his last painting?

568
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:18,520
大事不好了 柳馆长…
It's terrible, the Director is…

569
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
那幅画
The painting.

570
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,110
-什么 -那幅画
-What? -The painting!

571
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,540
大家都很可疑
Everyone is suspicious.

572
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,910
他们在隐瞒着什么
They are hiding something.

573
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,830
我也知道
Who doesn't know that?

574
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,840
你别跟我说话 我正在推理
Don't talk to me. I am in the middle of deducing.

575
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,800
你把这些都带回来了吗
Did you bring all of those back?

576
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,220
其实我重新回到那栋房子时 看到了一些东西
To be honest, I saw something when I went back to the house.

577
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,840
你看到什么了
What did you see?

578
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,810
白实习 这幅画…
Ms. Baek, this painting here…

579
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,850
没有能亲眼看到它的办法吗
Is there any way to see it in person?

580
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,310
真是的 你干吗从刚才开始就一直这样
Gosh, why do you keep saying that?

581
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,360
居然说那幅画是目击者 一定要看到它
Saying the painting is the witness and we have to see it in person…

582
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,230
看到那幅画就能知道凶手是谁吗
Will the painting tell us who the killer is?

583
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,320
是的 能知道 你有能帮忙的熟人吗
Yes, it will. Do you know anyone who can help?

584
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:11,030
没有
No, I don't.

585
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,120
我们怎么弄到手啊 那幅画那么贵
How can I get it? She said it was very expensive.

586
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,580
-你不认识有钱人吗 -不认识
-Do you know anyone rich? -No, I don't.

587
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,370
搞什么 他们是干什么的 怎么和赵女士在一起
Who are those people talking to Ms. Cho?

588
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,710
谢谢你
Thank you.

589
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,750
我也会上电视吗
Will I be on TV too?

590
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,630
是的 很有可能
Yes, probably.

591
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,470
那太好了
That would be great.

这可是第一次
This is a first.

601
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,670
就算是天上的星星 我也给你摘下来
I would get you a star from the sky.

602
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,210
不过那个有点贵
But it will be a little expensive.

603
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,300
就算再贵也只是一幅画
Even if it's expensive, it's just a painting.

604
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,420
它能比我的大楼贵吗
Would it cost more than my building?

605
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,430
大不了卖掉一栋
I'll just sell one of them.

606
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:16,300
只要为了我家玛丽 我就没有做不到的事
There's nothing I couldn't do for you, Mari.

607
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,850
妈 你那么爱我吗
Do you love me that much?

608
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,020
你竟然不知道？
Didn't you know?

609
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,140
如果有人敢惹你哭 我会杀了他
If any jerk makes you cry, I will kill him.

610
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,940
杀什么杀啊
What do you mean, kill him?

611
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
总之我知道了 再见
I have to go. Bye.

612
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,160
我能吃粒这个再开始吗
Can I… have this before we do it?

613
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,790
-好的 -谢谢
-Yes. -Thank you.

614
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,170
我有点紧张
It's for my nerves.

615
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,340
千律师怎么那样
What's wrong with him?

616
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,220
你知道他最讨厌哪一天吗
Do you know which day Mr. Cheon hates the most?

617
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,340
不知道 他输掉官司的那天？
No. Is it the day he loses a trial?

618
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,760
不 是中秋节和春节
No. It's Chuseok and New Year's Day.

619
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,470
-什么 -那两天这个节目停播
-What? -UI is not on TV on those days.

620
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,310
他是这节目的忠实观众
He's a super fan.

621
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,560
你哪里不舒服吗
Are you feeling ill?

622
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:08,570
什么
What?

623
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,610
我以为你哪里不舒服
I thought you might feel ill.

624
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,610
没有
No.

625
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,990
我感觉很好
No, I feel fine.

626
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,120
你刚才问我什么
What was the question?

627
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,200
秀妍 是敏宰…
Suyeon, Minjae…

628
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,080
你认为她为什么这么说
Why do you think she said that?

629
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,830
是的 她说秀妍 是敏宰…
Yes, so when she said Suyeon, Minjae…

630
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,250
是他母亲这么说的吗
Did the mother say that? Her mother?

631
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,300
什么
What?

632
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,010
这期节目什么时候播出
When does this go on the air?

633
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,550
马上就播 因为是紧急编排的节目表 所以我们没有时间
Right away. It's a rushed programming so we don't have time.

634
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,550
所以…
So…

635
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,310
好 我们开始吧
Shall we try again?

636
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,140
好 我知道了
Yes. So…

637
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,890
被送往急诊室的柳熙珠馆长
Director Yoo Heeju, who was brought

638
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:49,150
说了秀妍 是敏宰…吗
to the ER said, Suyeon, Minjae… Is that what the mom said?

639
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,860
那个
The…

640
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,400
节目主持人不来吗
The host of the show… isn't coming?

641
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,110
我是主持人的忠实粉丝
I'm a big fan of the host.

642
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,490
他会以书面形式回答
He will give his response in writing.

643
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:00,490
-他最好出镜才… -带上零食 在路上吃吧
-It's better to have footage-- -Here, buy something to eat on the way.

644
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,530
不用了
Wait, no.

645
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,340
给你
Here you go.

646
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,060
你怎么这么紧张 这可不像你
Why were you so nervous? That wasn't like you.

647
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,270
谁紧张了 我没紧张
Who was nervous? I wasn't nervous.

648
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:28,650
那你的腿还抖得那么厉害
Was that why your legs were shaking so much?

649
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,110
我只是故作紧张 我装得很像吧
I was acting like I was nervous. Wasn't I good?

650
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,650
我是故意不接受采访的
I didn't do the interview on purpose.

651
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,320
为什么不接受 你可是忠实粉丝
Why didn't you? You are a true fan.

652
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,360
白实习 你想想看
Hmm. Think about it, Ms. Baek.

653
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,780
我出演这个节目并出名的话 当然对我有好处
Being on UI and becoming famous would be good for me.

654
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:45,410
但公私要分明啊 我们可是…
But we have to separate business and pleasure, because we are…

655
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,500
律师
attorneys.

656
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,750
不是吗
Isn't that right?

657
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,590
白实习？是吧
Ms. Baek? Isn't that right?

658
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,090
你端杯水过来干吗
Why did you bring the water?

659
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,130
你紧张了吗 喝吧
Did you get nervous? Drink it.

660
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,600
-刚才说的那幅画 -嗯
-Remember that painting? -Yes.

661
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,100
我想我能弄到它
I think I may be able to get it.

662
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,900
真的吗 怎么弄到
Really? How?

663
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,860
我不是炫耀
I don't want to brag,

664
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:17,610
但我有熟人
but I know someone.

665
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,860
白实习 你是富豪吗
Ms. Baek, are you rich?

666
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,610
什么
What?

667
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:25,450
白实习 你是富豪吧
Ms. Baek, you are rich, right?

668
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,960
埃斯特塔

669
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:05,620
不过你什么时候开始对画感兴趣了
Since when were you interested in art?

670
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,160
并不是我感兴趣
I'm not the one who's interested.

671
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,080
什么 这是什么意思
What? What do you mean?

672
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:15,590
就是有一个我想把他鼻子打扁的人
There is someone who I want to crush.

673
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,760
这就是大家期待已久的那幅画作
This is the work that many people we're waiting for.

674
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,720
-是那个吗 -嗯
-Is that the one? -Yes.

起拍价为一亿韩元 每次叫价的增幅为一千万韩元
We will start at 100 million won. The bidding unit will go up by 10 million.

676
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,440
有人出一亿韩元吗

以前是两亿到三亿韩元
It was 200 to 300 million before.

681

有人超过三亿韩元吗

685
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,040
-四亿韩元 -这位先生出价四亿韩元

00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,540
叫价五亿韩元 好 五亿韩元
It's 500 million. Five hundred million…

688
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,750
没关系吗
Will it be okay?

689
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,590
-当然没关系 -有人超过五亿韩元吗 五亿韩元
-Of course, it's okay. -Do we have more? It's 500 million.

You need to call more than 700 million won to bid.

692
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:11,850

这可是你的生日礼物 不能让别人拍走
It's my Mari's birthday present. I can't have some other jerks take it.

竟敢抢我家玛丽的生日礼物
How dare he snatch Mari's birthday present?

705
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,800
-妈 -成交
-Mom. -The painting is sold.

706
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,260
真是的 你拦我干吗
Hey. Why did you stop me?

707
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:51,760
算了 不要勉强
It's fine. Don't go overboard.

708
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,060
你不是说想要它做你的生日礼物嘛
I thought you wanted it for your birthday.

709
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:55,480
一定会有办法的
There's got to be another way.

710
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,890
这是什么意思
What are you talking about?

711
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,770
说来话长
It's a long story.

712
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,110
金敏宰 如果如你所说
As you said,

713
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,610
你父亲刺伤母亲后躲起来的话
if your father stabbed your mother and disappeared,

714
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,240
他会去哪里呢
where would he be?

715
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,240
我也不知道
I don't know.

716
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,620
到目前为止找不到他的任何生活迹象
We are not finding any evidence yet.

717
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,370
你父亲有可以藏身的地方吗
Is there someplace your father would go to hide?

718
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,380
检察官 这得你们去找啊
You, as the prosecutor, should find that.

719
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,010
如果你们找不到他
If you don't find him,

720
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,840
我会被释放吗
am I going to get released?

721
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,720
即使仅凭间接证据
Even with circumstantial evidence,

722
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,810
我们也能证明你的罪行
we can prove your crime.

723
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,020
是吗
Is that right?

724
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,640
可是
But…

725
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,020
为什么你看起来 那么焦急地想找到我爸呢
Why do you look so desperate to find my father?

726
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,490
是不是间接证据不足
Perhaps you don't have enough circumstantial evidence?

727
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:03,420
-搜查官 -是
-Investigator. -Yes?

728
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,380
这是什么
What is this?

729
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,550
这是安装在金画家后院的 监控拍到的录像
It's the footage from the CCTV of Artist Kim's backyard.

730
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,310
因为是在远处拍的 所以什么也看不到
It was shot from far away, so we can't see anything.

731
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,920
我最后一次看到他 是在案发当晚 他走在一条小路上
I LAST SAW HIM WALKING DOWN A SIDE PATH ON THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT.

732
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,590
他穿着登山服
HE WAS IN A HIKING OUTFIT.

733
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,510
-搜查官 -是
-Investigator. -Yes?

734
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,300
明天提审金敏宰
I want to talk to Kim Minjae tomorrow.

735
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:54,890
好的 徐检察官
Yes, Mr. Seo.

736
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,370
事情好像开始有点不对劲了
Something isn't quite right.

737
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,790
不是吗 白实习
Don't you think so, Ms. Baek?

738
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,210
就是说啊
I know.

739
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,790
那个…
So…

740
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,920
-千律师？ -金敏宰
-Mr. Cheon? -Kim Minjae.

741
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:32,930
尽管被指控为凶手 但他却表现得十分冷静 是吧
Despite being accused as the killer, he seems very calm.

742
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,640
是的
Right.

743
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,600
金秀妍说她和韩才淑见面 谈的是退职金的事
Kim Suyeon said that she met Han Jaesook and talked about severance pay.

744
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,180
但看起来她好像受到了威胁
But it looked like she was being threatened.

745
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,230
韩才淑有什么可以威胁到金秀妍呢
What could Han Jaesook threaten Kim Suyeon with?

746
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,600
这个嘛
I'm not sure.

747
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:47,900
千律师 最后那幅画…
Mr. Cheon, the last painting--

748
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,570
对 最后那幅画 每次提到它的时候
Right, the last painting. Each time the last painting was mentioned,

749
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:54,110
朴记者和策展人都讳莫如深
Reporter Park and the curator were acting rather passive.

750
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,490
很明显他们在隐瞒什么
It's obvious that they are hiding something.

751
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,080
他俩平时关系就不好
The two didn't get along.

752
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,460
他们经常吵架
They argued a lot.

753
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:05,920
每当他们大声争吵时 总会有一个人受伤
When they were screaming at each other, either one of them always got hurt.

754
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,550
千律师 我们到此为止吧
Mr. Cheon… Let's stop.

755
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,470
我的脑子抽筋了
My brain is cramping up.

756
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,090
有人吗
Anyone there?

757
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:17,510
这是给千智勋的快递
I have a delivery for Mr. Cheon Jihun.

758
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,100
好的 我就是千智勋
I am Cheon Jihun.

759
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,520
-请在这里签名 -好
-Sign here, please. -Sure.

760
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,480
好 你们忙吧
Have a nice day.

761
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,900
各位 我想我终于
Everyone, I think I finally…

762
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,700
解开谜题了
solved the mystery.

763
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,000
当我重新回到那栋房子时 我发现了这个
When I returned to the house, I found this.

764
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:49,630
那是什么
What is that?

765
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,340
一幅已经消失的画 曾经挂在那里的痕迹
The trace of where a disappeared painting used to hang.

766
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:03,310
但是
But…

767
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:07,060
曾经挂在那里的那幅画
the size of the painting that was hanging there

768
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,860
和金画家画的最后那幅画
and the size of Artist Kim's last painting

769
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,070
它们的尺寸
were exactly…

770
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:13,400
完全一致
identical.

771
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,240
那么你是说之前挂在墙上的那幅画
Then are you saying that the painting that was hanging

772
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,700
被换成了金画家画的最后那幅画吗
was switched with Artist Kim's last painting?

773
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,330
你的思维也太跳跃了吧
I think that is a huge assumption.

774
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,210
也有可能碰巧一致吧
They could've been the same size.

775
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,210
所以我带来了这个 你们看看
So I brought this. Take a look at this.

776
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,380
湖水背景和撑着黑伞的男人
The lake was and the man with a black umbrella

777
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,260
根据专家的说法 这两者的作画时间至少相隔三年
were painted at least three years apart according to an expert.

778
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,050
金画家是在案发当天画的最后那幅画
The last time Artist Kim painted was the day of the incident.

779
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,970
可背景至少是三年前画的
But the background was painted at least three years ago.

780
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,810
你们不觉得奇怪吗
Isn't that strange?

781
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:49,980
这是怎么回事
What's going on?

782
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,730
如果是接下来这种情况 那就合理了
It would be possible if this happened.

783
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,610
画
Something…

784
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,280
出了什么问题
happened to the painting.

785
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:02,200
于是为了掩盖它 就在已经完成的画上
To cover it up, on top of an already finished painting…

786
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,000
画了一个撑着黑伞的男人
someone painted the man with a black umbrella.

787
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,080
画黑伞的人…
The one who painted the man with a black umbrella…

788
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,790
不对 能画出黑伞的人
No. The one who can paint the man with a black umbrella

789
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,840
只有一个人啊
is only one person.

790
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,130
对 就是金画家自己
Yes, Artist Kim himself.

791
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:43,200
检察官 我们是第一次见呢
You are a prosecutor I haven't seen it before.

792
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,580
我叫徐民赫
My name is Seo Minhyeok.

793
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,040
我是金敏宰
I'm Kim Minjae.

794
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,120
太远了
That's too far.

795
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,500
靠近点
Here.

796
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,380
你们调查得顺利吗
Is the investigation going well?

797
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:02,220
这就是我叫你过来的原因 我有个疑问
That's why I called you here. I have a question.

798
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,470
是什么
What is it?

799
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,010
等一下
Hold on.

800
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,560
在案发当天
On the day of the incident,

801
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,280
你最后一次见到 你父亲金画家的这部分陈述里
there's a part where you say you saw your father for the last time.

802
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:23,280
你说你看见他走在一条小路上
You said you saw him walk down a side path.

803
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:27,030
对 我看见他穿着登山服出门了
Yes, I saw him in his hiking outfit.

804
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,160
是吗
Is that right?

805
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:30,830
是的
Yes.

806
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,420
这可怎么办
But there's a problem.

807
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,000
我想你那天看不见你父亲
I don't think you could've seen your father that day.

808
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,260
为什么
Why?

809
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,640
你仔细看房子后面的小路
Look carefully at the side path at the back of the house.

810
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:55,560
那天小路上的路灯坏了
On that night, the lights were broken in the area of the side path.

811
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,610
你能看到这里很黑吧
Can you see how dark it was?

812
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,920
我工作了一整晚 你大清早就把我带到这里来吗
I worked all night. Why did you bring me here so early?

813
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,800
警察不是已经搜过这里了嘛
The police already searched the area.

814
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,220
调查记录只是记录 我们得亲眼确认一下
The reports are just reports. We have to check with our own eyes.

815
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,390
要么你就安静地跟着我 要么你就回去
You can follow me quietly or you can go back.

816
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:54,210
这里好像不是一条路
I don't think that's a path.

817
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,250
是 我知道
Yes, I know.

818
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,580
如果他沿着这条路往上走 警察不可能发现不了
If I kept going up this way, the police would've found me.

819
00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,960
如果我是金画家
If I was Artist Kim…

820
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,800
我想我会走这条路
I would've taken this path.

821
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,360
我爸…
My father…

822
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:30,160
他总穿登山服
My father always wore a hiking outfit.

823
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,460
那天晚上我也喝醉了
I was drunk that night too.

824
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,670
也许我看错了
Maybe I was wrong.

825
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:45,050
我像是在撒谎吗
Does it sound like a lie?

826
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,130
我们等着瞧就知道了
I guess we'll find out.

827
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,180
我才刚刚开始
I'm just getting started.

828
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,850
请进
Yes.

829
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,560
唉唷
Oh, goodness.

830
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,060
咖啡来了
Here's your coffee.

831
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,770
唉唷 谢谢
Thank you.

832
00:53:57,850 --> 00:53:59,400
每人喝一杯
Take a cup each.

833
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,150
-谢谢 -不客气
-Thank you. -Sure.

834
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,360
喝吧
Drink.

835
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:13,740
我不想要咖啡
I don't want coffee.

836
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,870
我能拜托你别的事吗
Can you do something else for me?

837
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:33,720
你认为这也是作秀吗
Do you think that's for show too?

838
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:35,260
这个嘛
Not sure.

839
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,640
如果是作秀的话 他做得很像样
If it's for show, he's doing a great job.

840
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,400
通常在押犯会开口要自己想吃的东西
Normally you ask what you want to eat.

841
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,650
我还是第一次见到有人提这种要求
I've never seen anyone ask for that.

842
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,480
这是他洗泡泡浴时听的音乐 是吧
Is it the same music he was listening to while taking a bubble bath?

843
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,070
是的
Yes.

844
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,990
他简直是在说我就是凶手
It's like he's saying, I'm the culprit.

845
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,950
这是最后那幅画里的湖
It's the lake in the last painting.

846
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,280
对
Yes.

847
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:25,790
但看起来这里 不是一个可以藏身的地方
But I don't think it's a place anyone can hide.

848
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,240
今天就到这里吧 辛苦了
Let's wrap it up for today. Thanks for your cooperation.

849
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,870
既然你让我听音乐
Because you let me listen to the music…

850
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,330
那我也送你一份礼物吧
Should I give you a gift?

851
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,750
礼物吗
A gift?

852
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,460
-对 -什么礼物
-Yes. -What could that gift be?

853
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:14,510
我看不出你现在能给我什么
I don't see anything you can give me.

854
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,890
我妈是我杀的
I'm the one who killed my mom.

855
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:35,070
这算礼物 对吧
It's a gift, isn't it?

856
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,370
他承认了？
He confessed?

857
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,960
是的
Yup.

858
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,920
他突然在这个时候承认了
He confessed all of a sudden at this point.

859
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,630
为什么呢
Why?

860
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,260
因为我证明了 他看到他父亲走向小路的供词
Because I proved that his testimony about seeing his father on the side path

861
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,600
是在说谎
was a lie.

862
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,930
所以说为什么
But why?

863
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:07,940
就像你说的那样 他全部放弃了
He gave up, as you said.

864
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,060
只有我感到奇怪吗
Am I strange?

865
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,940
哪里奇怪
What's strange?

866
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,110
我们还没有找到凶器
We don't have the murder weapon yet.

867
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,570
也没有找到金画家的尸体
And we haven't found Artist Kim's body either.

868
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,240
但仅仅因为我们发现 他的一个证词作假 他就承认了？
But he confessed because we found out that one of his testimonies was a lie?

869
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:22,620
你不觉得奇怪吗
Isn't it strange?

870
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:25,120
这样看来 确实有点奇怪
Now that you mention it, it does seem a bit strange.

871
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,580
他会不会只是做给我们看
Maybe this is just for the show.

872
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,830
应该不是
I don't think so.

873
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,880
其中一定有原因
There must be a reason.

874
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,050
枫津湖
PUNGJIN LAKE

875
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,830
喂？民赫哥
Hi, Minhyeok.

876
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:11,960
嗯
Yes.

877
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,210
什么
What?

878
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,100
金画家非常喜欢他家附近的湖
Artist Kim really liked the lake near the house.

879
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:36,570
他搬家之前就经常去那个湖边画画
He used to visit the lake often to paint it even before he moved there.

880
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,990
2020年4月的枫津湖
PUNGJIN LAKE IN APRIL, 2020

881
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:46,870
枫津湖
PUNGJIN LAKE

882
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,430
我的想法…
What could I be…

883
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:08,350
是什么呢
thinking?

884
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:13,690
千智勋律师
Attorney Cheon Jihun.

885
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:36,250
我们这样真的可以吗
Can we really do this?

886
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,300
谁会在乎 他们都家破人亡了
Who would care? The whole family fell apart.

887
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:42,840
我们不拿才是傻子
You'd be stupid not to take these.

888
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:47,470
大婶 金画家的画都放在哪里
Where are the other paintings of Artist Kim?

889
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:50,100
我问你在哪里
Where are they?

890
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:56,190
楼上有一间储藏室
There is a storage room upstairs.

891
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,870
人的贪婪真是没有止境 是吧
A person's greed is so… Isn't it?

892
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:15,660
你是谁
Who are you?

893
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,670
你好 我是金敏宰的律师
Yes, I'm Mr. Kim Minjae's lawyer.

894
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,340
你是韩才淑吧
You're Ms. Han Jaesook, right?

895
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,930
我在那家法国餐厅见过你
I saw you at that French restaurant.

896
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,680
-当时你和金秀妍在一起 -什么
-You were with Ms. Kim Suyeon. -What?

897
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,760
你们在聊退职金的事
You were talking to her about your severance pay.

898
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,850
那时我听不清你在说什么 所以不知道
I couldn't hear what you were saying then.

899
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:38,060
但我仔细一想
But when I thought about it,

900
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:41,610
你似乎知道金画家在哪里
you seemed to know where Artist Kim was.

901
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,570
什么
What?

902
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,650
金画家现在在哪
Where is Artist Kim right now?

903
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:54,910
你不回答也没关系 我发现金画家在哪里了
You don't have to answer me. I found out where Artist Kim is.

904
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,670
3836号 有人探视
No. 3836, you have a visitor.

905
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:35,240
我在等检察官
I was waiting for the prosecutor.

906
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,540
可来的人却是你
But my lawyer is here.

907
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:45,000
你在等检察官吗
You were waiting for the prosecutor?

908
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,670
对
Yes.

909
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,180
我昨天承认了
I confessed yesterday…

910
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:56,310
我杀了我妈
that I killed my mother.

911
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:59,850
看来你还没有听说啊
I guess you haven't heard yet.

912
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,900
我想了想 确实是我做错了
When I thought about it, I realized it was my fault.

913
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:07,280
看来…
For a while…

914
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,490
我当时疯了
I think I was crazy.

915
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,780
我正在深刻反省
I am very remorseful.

916
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,290
我完全没有看出来你在反省
You don't seem to be.

917
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:20,370
不过你一点也不感到惊讶呢
You don't seem to be surprised either.

918
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,130
你是我的律师吗
Are you my lawyer?

919
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,010
不过你来干什么
So, why are you here?

920
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:39,980
我去你父亲失踪的 房子后面的小路看了看
I went down the path behind the house where your father supposedly disappeared.

921
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,480
我走了很长一段时间
I walked for a long time

922
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:49,230
发现了画里的那片湖
and found the lake in the painting.

923
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,200
我爸很喜欢那里
My father liked that spot.

924
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:56,660
包括那条小路和那片湖
The path and the lake.

925
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,370
你父亲也是你杀的吗
Did you kill your father too?

926
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:14,550
这是什么意思
What are you saying?

927
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,600
案发当天在现场发现的 你父亲画的最后那幅画
Your father's last painting that was found at the scene of the murder…

928
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,180
被换掉了
was changed.

929
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,940
那幅画出了点问题
Something happened to the painting

930
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:31,280
而为了掩盖它就把它换掉了
and it was changed to cover that.

931
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:32,610
为什么
Why…

932
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,610
要把它…
did it…

933
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:40,370
掩盖起来呢
have to be covered?

934
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:44,540
你为什么要问我
Why do you ask me?

935
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:46,330
因为那是你画的
Because you drew it.

金春吉画家已经死了？
Artist Kim Chungil is dead?

938
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:11,630
对 现在检方应该在搜寻他的尸体
Yes. The prosecution is probably looking for the body now.

Things are coming together too easily.

我们确实从来没有遇上过这样的事情
I've never seen it unfold like this before.

941
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,420
他竟然亲自上交犯罪凶器
He personally presented the murder weapon.

942
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,510
那个可能是伪造的证据
The evidence could've been fabricated.

943
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,300
那你可以找出证据证明它是伪造的
Then you should bring the evidence that it's been fabricated.

944
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:22,470
-这幅画不错啊 -千律师
-This is a nice painting. -Mr. Cheon.

945
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:24,760
千智勋律师是个什么样的人啊
What is Mr. Cheon like?

946
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,930
你就告诉我他当检察官时怎么样吧
Tell me how he was as a prosecutor.

是白法律事务所 我们怎么办
It's Mr. Baek's firm. What do we do?

951
01:06:36,150 --> 01:06:38,030
我们又得和老头们较量一番了
I guess we have to go another round with the old men.

952
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,490
原来她是对方的律师啊
She was their lawyer.

953

Were you playing with me?

湖水背景和撑着黑伞的男人

958
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:58,130
根据专家的说法 这两者的作画时间至少相隔三年
were painted at least three years apart, according to an expert.

959
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,050
这是怎么回事
What happened?

960
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:06,770
其实我回来的时候
To tell you the truth, Artist Kim had already disappeared

961
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,810
金画家已经不见了
by the time I came back.

962
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:12,560
我想是金画家在敏宰的画上
I think Artist Kim painted

963
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:17,190
画了一个撑着黑伞的男人
the man with a black umbrella on what Minjae had painted.

964
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:19,070
抱歉
I'm sorry.

965
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:22,240
我本来没想骗你
I didn't mean to deceive you.

966
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,200
原来湖水背景是敏宰画的啊
So, the painting of the lake was done by Minjae.

967
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,250
是的
-Yes. -Mm.

968
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:31,750
不对啊
I don't think so.

969
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,460
金敏宰不可能画出这幅画
Mr. Kim Minjae couldn't have painted this picture.

970
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,510
他搬到这里 第一次看到这片湖时
When Mr. Kim Minjae moved here and saw the lake for the first time,

971
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:41,340
这幅画里的房子
the building that is in this painting

972
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:43,430
已经坍塌 不存在了
had already been torn down and wasn't there.

973
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,050
是啊
Yes…

974
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,850
没错 是我一时搞错了
You're right. I was confused for a second.

975
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,480
那幅画不是敏宰画的
That painting wasn't done by Minjae,

976
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:53,600
而是金画家画的
but by Artist Kim.

977
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:57,020
这也不对啊
I don't think so.

978
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,610
如果这幅画是金春吉画家画的风景画
If this was a landscape of Artist Kim Chungil,

979
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:04,070
那么撑着黑伞的男人作为他的标志
then his signature style of the man with a black umbrella

980
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,950
他应该早就画上去了
should've been already painted.

981
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:08,080
这种情况怎么样
How about this?

982
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:10,200
如果金画家的画
The one who painted Artist Kim's paintings

983
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,250
不是他画的
is not Artist Kim himself.

984
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:17,090
如果撑着黑伞的男人
What if the man with a black umbrella

985
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:19,050
是其他画家的标志呢
is someone else's signature?

986
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:22,550
韩才淑
Ms. Han Jaesook.
