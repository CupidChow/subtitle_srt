没有
No.

9
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,400
虽然智勋竭尽了全力 但是没有抓到
Jihun did his best, but he couldn't catch him.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,520
那千律师
Mr. Cheon…

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,650
后来怎么样了
What happened to Mr. Cheon?

12
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,980
前辈 我要离开检察厅
Yejin, I am going to leave the prosecution.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,700
为什么 如果你想继续调查 李律师或你父亲的案子

你不是应该留下来吗
wouldn't it be better if you stayed?

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,160
所以我才要离开
That's why I am leaving.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,750
如果我留在检察厅 盯着我的人实在太多了
There are too many eyes watching for me to stay in the prosecution.

LEGAL FEE: 1,000 WON

21
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,740
我想了很久
I thought about it for a long time.

22
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,530
为什么是一千韩元
Why was it 1,000 won?

23
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,830
有人吗
Anyone there?

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,340
我之前向那位女律师 咨询了一起案子
I asked the lady lawyer to take on my case before,

25
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,920
但是她没有联系我
but I never heard back from her.

26
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,140
但是委托费真的是一千韩元吗
By the way, is the legal fee really 1,000 won?

27
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,100
对

Then…

33
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,500
千律师…
Mr. Cheon has…

34
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
就接管了事务所？

36
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
你怎么了
What's wrong?

37
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,060
不过民赫哥为什么要那样对千律师
Then why is Minhyeok acting like that towards Mr. Cheon?

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,980
民赫以前很喜欢智勋
So, Minhyeok used to like Jihun a lot.

39
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,150
经常跟在他左右
I mean, he looked up to him. Mm.

40
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,070
后来智勋突然说要离开
And then Jihun announced that he was leaving suddenly.

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,400
所以他就很伤心
So, he was disappointed.

42
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,320
民赫哥什么都不知道 真是的
Minhyeok doesn't know anything!

43
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,740
喂 你怎么了
Hey, why are you so worked up?

44
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,950
别喝了
Stop that.

45
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,540
我真是搞不懂你为什么难过
I have no idea why you're suffering.

46
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,170
-我来了 -你…
-I'm here. -Why…

48
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,010
-前辈 你要先走… -嗯

49
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,980
汝媛在等我 我先走了
Yeowon is waiting. I have to go.

50
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,670
好 怎么了

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,800

你喝了很多酒吗
Did you drink a lot?

66
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,500
-我心里就是这么想的 -原来如此
-That's just how I feel. -I see.

罗艺珍怎么变得这么小了
Did Na Yejin shrink this small?

125
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,680
你认识我妈妈吗
Do you know my mom?

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,600
你怎么回事 你真的不记得我了吗

罗检察官家的保姆好像生病了
I think her nanny is sick.

135
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,000
她不能把汝媛独自留在家里
She couldn't leave Yeowon home alone.

136
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,830
所以罗检察官让我们帮忙看着她
Ms. Na asked us to watch her.

137
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,090

144
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,110
汝媛 你今天要看看 你妈妈工作的样子吗
Yeowon, do you want to see your mom working today?

145
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,990

二手车？
A used car?

156
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,680
不知道他会不会又跑去哪里挨宰
I hope he's not going to go somewhere and get ripped off.

157
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,890
真让人担心
I'm worried.

158
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:10,810
我感觉他打听得挺仔细
He seemed to be quite thorough.

159
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,440
需要我帮你冲杯咖啡吗
Shall I make some coffee for you?

160
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,780
不用 我自己冲
No. I will make my own coffee.

161
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,950
不
No.

162
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,040
我给你冲
I will make it for you.

163
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,290
等一下 停下
Wait, stop.

164
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,710
停下
Stop. Stop.

165
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,680
得由我来冲
I have to make it.

166
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,340
为什么
Why?

167
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,430
就是有些原因
There's a reason.

168
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,890
唉唷
Oops.

169
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,320
香味果然很好闻
The aroma is wonderful.

170
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,410
好闻到没必要去咖啡厅了吗
No need to go to a café?

171
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,660
真可惜
That's too bad.

172
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,330
如果我给你冲的话 肯定会更香
If I made it for you, it would've been even more fragrant.

173
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,000
玛丽
Mari.

174
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,000
你老实说吧 你为什么对我这样
Tell me truthfully. Why are you acting like this to me?

175
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,090
什么
Hmm? What do you mean?

176
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,800
很肉麻
It's creepy.

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,670
而且今天你过于亲切了
And you are overly kind today.

178
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,550
这就对了 你左边的眉毛和嘴唇
That's right. Your left eyebrow and lips

179
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,680
像蚯蚓一样蠕动
are wiggling like a worm.

180
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,350
这种表情才适合你
That's the kind of expression that suits you.

181
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,020
多漂亮啊
How pretty is that?

182
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,270
对 就是这样
Yes. That's it.

183
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,070
第一洗衣店

184
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,240
这辆车从来没有出过事故 这些部件也都没换过
It's never been in an accident. None of these parts were changed.

185
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,660
-这是我的第一辆车 -那好吧
-It's my first car, I'm not sure. -Well, then.

186
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,290
而且你开过就会知道 它没有出过事故 也没有被淹过…
Because you don't look up those things. You can search for accident history…

187
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,960
荷藕
YEONGEUN

188
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,130
喂？
Hello?

189
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,960
我刚到卖场门口
I just arrived in front of the building.

190
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,300
开到里面去吗 好 我知道了
Should I pull in? Okay.

191
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,240
喂？
Hello?

192
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,200
-荷藕？-荷藕
-Yeongeun? -Ah, Yeongeun!

193
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,710
-荷藕 -对 你好
-Yeongeun. -Yes, Hello.

194
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,460
你好
Yes, hello.

195
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,590
你的衣服…
Your clothes are…

196
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,590
是的 我以前在汽车修理厂工作过
Yes. I used to work at an auto shop before.

197
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,050
原来如此
I see.

198
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,680
这有油污
There's an oil stain.

199
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,560
你不会想拍视频发到网上吧
By the way, you're not posting a video online, are you?

200
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,810
视频？
Tube? A what tube?

201
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,600
没什么 我们走吧
It's nothing. Come with me.

202
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:00,560
不过真的是网站上标的那个价格吧
Anyway, is it the same price as it was mentioned on the website?

203
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,530
唉唷 你以前经常被骗吗 我们只会依法销售
Have you been swindled a lot? We strictly follow the law in our sales.

204
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,570
好 我在那个圈子工作
I see. I work in that field.

205
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,490
那个圈子？
In that field?

206
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,740
我在律师事务所工作
I work at a law office.

207
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,490
担任事务长
As an office manager.

208
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,700
你不用担心
You don't have to worry about anything.

209
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,870
法官 检察官和律师 他们都从我们这里买二手车
Judges, prosecutors, lawyers. They all buy used cars from us.

210
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,670
-是吗 -是的
-Is that right? -Yes.

211
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,550
这车很好开
This drives great!

212
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
怎么样
How was it?

213
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,890
我真的很喜欢 是真的
I really like it. Really.

214
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,480
那样的话…
So then…

215
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,270
这是什么
-What is this? -Hmm.

216
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,770
我漏掉了一些问题
Something was left out.

217
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,900
漏掉问题？
Left out?

218
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,610
这辆车的发动机会发生爆震 你开的时候没听到吗
There is a knocking in the engine. Did you hear it while driving?

219
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,820
什么
What?

220
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,990
你听听发动机的声音
Listen to the engine.

221
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,500
我好像听到了
I hear it all of a sudden.

222
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,960
-有声音吧 -我听到了
-Don't you? -I can hear it.

223
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,460
如果发动机因爆震出现故障的话 要花几百万韩元维修
If the engine breaks down because of it, you'll lose a few million.

224
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,830
我…
But--

225
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,300
这车的悬架也松了
The suspension is loose too.

226
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,920
什么
What?

227
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,130
-天啊 -不然车不可能晃成这样
-No. -Look. The car shouldn't shake like this.

228
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,800
-悬架吗 -对
-The suspension? -Yes.

229
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,810
卖家刚才说这车没有任何问题 就是一辆展车啊
They said there was nothing wrong and it was a vehicle in good condition.

230
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,390
你这种内行人应该更清楚 悬架松了真的会出大事
You should know better. If you lose the suspension, it's the end.

231
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,520
可是卖家刚刚说没事
But… they said it was fine.

232
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,230
这就是一辆展车
They said it was just a display car.

233
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,070
他们会把一辆正常的展车放在这里吗
Would they keep it sitting here if it was in good condition?

234
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,320
这辆车好像还漏油
I think there is an oil leak as well.

235
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,030
-漏油？-你过来看看
-Oil? -Take a look here.

236
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
天啊
No.

237
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,030
天啊 真的漏油
It really is leaking.

238
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:39,120
可是卖家刚才明明说没事
They said it was okay.

239
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,040
客人 我觉得你像我的表哥 我才跟你说这些
Sir, I am telling you this because you remind me of my older cousin.

240
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,330
我比你大吗
Am I older?

241
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,250
我是说你像他
You remind me of my older cousin.

242
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,460
这样啊
I see.

243
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,010
我们卖场有和这辆车类似的车型
There is a similar model on our lot.

244
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,050
你要不要看一下
Would you like to see that one?

245
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,100
真的很感谢你对我坦诚相告
I thank you for being honest.

246
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,060
好 我要看看
Yes. I will take a look.

247
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,190
这个人俗称车王
Nickname, Car King.

248
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,940
首尔的荷藕市场 富川的加里二手车
Seoul's Yeongeun Market, Bucheon's Gary Old Car,

249
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,820
城南的城南汽车 坡州的帕拉利等
Seongnam's Furious Motors, Paju's Parrari and more.

250
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,820
他是这些在各地猖獗地 实施二手车交易诈骗的车行头目
The nickname belongs to the boss of used car scammers

251
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,330
这是他的绰号
that are prevalent in these areas.

252
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,750
我们怀疑 他还是某个二手车卖场的老板
We suspect that he also owns a used car lot himself.

253
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,170
他们是离散型组织 所以我们之前 就算采取措施也无法扫荡他们
They aren't a single organization and we couldn't root them out so far.

254
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,880
但我认为我们只要抓到他 就能把他们一网打尽
If we catch this guy, we can get them all with a single blow.

255
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,670
什么是离散型组织
What is a single organization?

256
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,050
就算我们抓到了他们的头目
Let's say we get the head.

257
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,850
你打算怎么把其他人串联起来
How are you going to rope the others in?

258
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,310
在这些车行中有一家车行
Apparently, one of these businesses

259
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,810
在每个月底都会上缴现金
pays a cash bribe at the end of every month.

260
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,810
他们每个月更换一次公司
The company changes every month

261
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,230
并且他们中间的洗钱过程十分复杂
and it has a complicated money laundering process,

262
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,940
所以我们很难追踪
so it is not easy to track it. However,

263
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,030
但据线人透露 一个月内应该会浮现出轮廓
according to an informant, we will get a better picture within a month.

264
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,280
线人？你有线人？
An informant? You have a source?

265
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,700
那人信得过吗
Is he trustworthy?

266
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,660
是的 信得过
Yes, he is.

267
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,490
你是说可以在一个月内 取得成果 是吧
You say we can make some progress within a month, right?

268
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,790
好 进行吧
Good. Let's go forward with it.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,960
好的
Yes, sir.

270
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,000
接下来进行下一个议案
We will begin the next agenda.

271
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,550
好 现在只要签名就行了
Here, all you have to do is sign the papers.

272
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,050
不过这比我来之前看的那辆要贵
But this is more expensive than the one I saw before coming.

273
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,340
刚才那辆车
The other car you saw is

274
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,100
是一辆展车 所以售价要略低于市价
a display car so it's priced a little lower than the market price.

275
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,970
这辆车没有任何问题 还很干净
This one has no issues and it's clean.

276
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,350
你要是买这台车 绝对是赚到了
If you buy this, you're definitely getting a deal.

277
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,400
好 包括车辆过户手续费在内 总共是这些
So, this includes car sales service fees.

278
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,900
如果你现金不够的话 可以分期付款
If you don't have enough cash, we can provide financing.

279
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,160
不过分期付款还要收手续费
But we do charge financing charges.

280
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,030
你交现金直接提车不是更好吗
So, wouldn't it be better to pay in cash?

281
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,250
好 我知道了
Yes, I will.

282
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,670
我要签合同
I will go ahead with the contract.

283
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
-这是正确的选择 -是的
-Good choice! -Yes!

284
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,850
是啊 我买得好
Yes, it was a good purchase.

285
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,680
我买得很便宜 小俊妈妈也会喜欢的
I bought it at a good price, so Jun's mom will be happy too.

286
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,810
小俊 我们下次再买变形机器人吧
Jun, we will have to buy the transforming robot next time!

287
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,360
跑起来吧
Let's drive!

288
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,030
怎么了 怎么回事
Huh?

289
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,320
怎么了 怎么回事
What's wrong with it?

290
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,820
这车怎么了
What's happening?

291
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,250
你是维修工吧
Are you the mechanic?

292
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,210
请看一下这辆车
Please take a look at this.

293
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,420
这车是不是有问题 它在冒烟
There must be something wrong with the car. It's smoking.

294
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,630
怎么会这样
What's wrong with it?

295
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,600
我是这辆车的车主
I am the owner of this car.

296
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,640
我今天刚买的车就这样了
I bought this car today and this happened.

297
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,600
我是这辆车的车主
I am the owner of this car!

298
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,150
我今天刚买的车 车就这样了
I bought this car today and this happened!

299
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,570
我是这辆车的车主
I am the owner of this car.

300
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,910
真是的 怎么会这样
Geez. How can this be?

301
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,000
白实习 怎么样 很好吃吧
How was it, Ms. Baek? Wasn't it pretty good?

302
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,250
超级好吃
It was very good. It's better than most must-eat places.

303
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,920
这比很多美食店做的都好吃
It was very good. It's better than most must-eat places.

304
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,580
嗯 没错
You're right.

305
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,460
-食物… -等一下
-The food-- -Wait!

306
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,710
我来收拾
I will clear the table.

307
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,890
-我来收拾… -不用
-I will clear-- -No, wait.

308
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,890
你这是干吗
What's wrong?

309
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,560
我来收拾
I'll do it.

310
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,230
你到底为什么这样
What's wrong with you?

311
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,480
为什么这样
Why are you being like this?

312
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,490
从昨晚开始 你看着我的眼神就很奇怪
You look at me all weirdly since last night.

313
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:42,200
今天我上班时你还对我说欢迎 还把手搭在我的肩膀上
When I came in today, you were like, "Welcome," and touch my shoulder.

314
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,870
你为什么对我这么好
Why are you so nice to me?

315
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,950
就是这种眼神 你的眼神很奇怪
That look. That look is weird.

316
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,290
怎么了
What?

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,540
白实习 你坐下
Ms. Baek, sit down.

318
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,250
我看出来了
Mm. I got the clue.

319
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,050
白实习 你老实说
Ms. Baek, be honest.

320
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,720
你在这里实习后 发现你可以从我这里学到很多
After working here, you feel like you can learn a lot from me.

321
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,800
而你实习结束后 也没有地方可去
And when you leave this office, you won't have anywhere to go.

322
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,350
所以你为了继续留在这里
So, you are trying to stay put.

323
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,390
就拍我的马屁 对吧
So, you're kissing up to me, aren't you?

324
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,150
我怎么会没有地方可去 才不是这样
I have plenty of places to go! It's not like that.

325
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,440
不是什么啊
It doesn't look like it's not.

326
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,400
你骗得了别人 可骗不了我
You can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me.

327
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,360
我的眼睛可是很尖的
I have the quickest wit, you see.

328
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,160
我可不吃阿谀奉承这一套
I am not easily swayed by brownnosing.

329
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,830
我只看能力
I only look at skills. Skills, okay?

330
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,830
我没想到你是这种人 你可真坏
I didn't think you were like this, but you're a bad person.

331
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,540
真会算计
You are very calculating.

332
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,790
你这人太糟糕了
A very bad person.

333
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,250
你居然玩弄人心
You play with people's hearts.

334
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,540
-真的不是这样 -打住
-I said it's not like that. -Stop!

335
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,460
停 到此为止 行了 就到这里
Stop.

336
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,630
停 到此为止 行了 就到这里
No more. Finished. The end.

337
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,760
不过事务长怎么还不来 真让人担心
What's taking Mr. Sa so long? I'm getting worried.

338
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,270
真的不是这样
It isn't like that.

339
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,490
我是刚才买车的人
I am the person who just bought a car.

340
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,360
车抛锚了
The car broke down!

341
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,780
我想退掉这辆车
I want to get a refund!

342
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,160
请给我退货
Give me back my money!

343
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,670
是这位想要退货吗
Does he want a refund?

344
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,000
是的 老板
Yes, sir.

345
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,170
客人 车现在在哪里
Sir, where is the vehicle right now?

346
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,880
车坏了 我没办法开过来
It broke down so I couldn't bring it!

347
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,890
我说 你因自己的过错把车弄坏了 还要退货？
I mean, you broke the car by your own fault and you want a refund.

348
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,810
这样不对吧
Don't you think that is wrong?

349
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:35,060
那辆车一开始就是坏的
It was broken, to begin with!

350
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,230
你们就不应该卖那种车
Isn't that right? You shouldn't have sold the car!

351
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,020
不管我怎么想都认为这样不对
No matter how much I think about it, this is wrong.

352
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,150
这样不对
This is wrong! It's wrong!

353
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,820
请给我退货 好吗
Give me a refund, please?

354
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,200
求你给我退货吧
Please give me a refund.

355
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,500
客人
Sir.

356
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,210
别退车 退掉你的人生怎么样
How about a refund on your life, instead of the refund on the car?

357
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,180
什么
What?

358
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,460
对 是有钱人了
Yes, we are rich, aren't we?

359
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,470
我要上次跟你说过的玩具
Dad, I want the toy I told you about last time.

360
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,190
搞什么 他今天也没来吗
What's going on?

361
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,480
搞什么 他今天也没来吗
He's not here today either? Is he making himself a used car?

362
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,270
他是在造二手车吗
He's not here today either? Is he making himself a used car?

363
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
他到底去哪了 真让人担心
Where is he? I'm worried.

364
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,240
感觉有点奇怪 是吧
It doesn't seem right, does it? He's not answering his phone either.

365
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,950
他也不接电话
It doesn't seem right, does it? He's not answering his phone either.

366
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,460

事务长 停下
Stop right there.

372
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,290
事务长
Mr. Sa.

373
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,760
你去看二手车 怎么一直联系不上
Why is it so hard to get a hold of you? I thought you went to buy a used car.

374
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,550
你跟我说说看 我猜你出了什么问题
Tell me everything. I suspect something is wrong.

375
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,060
你都听说了？
You heard everything?

376
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,600
听说什么 从现在开始我要听你说
I heard nothing. I have to hear it from you now.

377
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,690
-什么 -什么
-What? -What?

378
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,940
你就放心告诉我吧
Lay it all on me.

379
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,190
因为我站在你这边
I am… on your side.

380
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,160
千律师 我该怎么办
Mr. Cheon. What should I do?

381
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,200
我该怎么办
What should I do?

382
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,030
真是的
Really…

383
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,870
我该怎么办 我不知道了
What should I do? I don't know.

384
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,000
所以你看到这个之后就过去了 是吧
So you went there after seeing this?

385
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,710
对 价格很便宜嘛
Yes. The price was so cheap.

386
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,800
便宜？真是让人受不了
Cheap? You are so frustrating.

387
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,970
事务长 你好好想一下
Mr. Sa, think about it.

388
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,680
这世上怎么会有又便宜又好的车啊
Where on earth is there a cheap car that's good?

389
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
我也问过了
I asked about it too.

390
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,390
卖家说这辆展车到期了 所以才拿出来卖
They said they brought an expired display vehicle.

391
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,270
那不就是他们的手法吗
That's their thing.

392
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,560
他们把一辆正常的车 以便宜的价格挂到网上
They post a good car at a cheap price and lure people in.

393
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,440
只要把人们引诱过去
They post a good car at a cheap price and lure people in.

394
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,280
他们就换一辆别的车 并以高价出售
And when you go, they show you another car and sell it for much more.

395
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,030
对 这是展车
That's right. "It's a display vehicle."

396
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,030
对 这是展车
"It's cheap because we got it from a court auction or a public sale."

397
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,990
便宜是因为我们是从法院拍卖 或公开拍卖中拍到的
"It's cheap because we got it from a court auction or a public sale."

398
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,780
他们说这些话先引诱你过去
They say these things to get you to come.

399
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,040
要是车真的那么好 他们为什么不自己留着开
If it were so great, they'd be driving it.

400
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,460
白实习 我刚才解释得和你一模一样
Ms. Baek, I just explained the same thing to him.

401
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,090
你上一边待着
Why don't you sit this one out?

402
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,920
是啊
Yeah.

403
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,340
走吧
Let's go.

404
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,930
什么 去哪里
What? Where?

405
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,550
去退货
To get a refund.

406
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,390
退货？他们会给我退手续费吗
A refund? Would they do it so easily?

407
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,810
不会退 我们得让他们给你退
No, they wouldn't. We have to make them give you a refund.

408
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,270
白实习 你不去吗
Ms. Baek, aren't you coming?

409
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,690
你不是让我上一边待着嘛
You told me to sit this one out.

410
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,570
白实习 你也一起去吧
Let's go together.

411
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,610
这段时间…
It's been a while…

412
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,030
你不是没怎么出镜嘛
since you got to show yourself.

413
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,880
等等我
Wait for me.

414
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,760
我也没怎么出镜
I wasn't on much either.

415
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,650
办公室好像在那边 你记得确切位置在哪里吗
The office seems to be over there. Do you remember the exact location?

416
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,450
-我不知道 -什么
-I don't know. -What?

417
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,950
他们说办公室里人太多
They said the office was too crowded.

418
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,080
我也是在别的地方见的他们老板
I met the owner at a different location.

419
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,960
事务长 你知道他们网站上的电话号码吧
Mr. Sa, do you know the phone number on their website?

420
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,750
-嗯 -电话号码是多少
-Yes. -What is that number?

421
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,340
等一下
Hold on.

422
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,970
你是给我打电话的那位吧
Are you the one who called?

423
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,760
对 是我没错
Yes. It was me.

424
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,430
你之前了解过二手车吗
Did you look into a few used cars?

425
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,980
我之前到处了解过
I did look here and there.

426
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,810
但老实说 我不太懂车
To be honest, I don't know much about cars.

427
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,480
这也是我第一次买二手车
It's my first time buying a used car too.

428
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,740
那你来对了
Then you came to the right place.

429
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,450
你真的是抓住了一个好机会
You are lucky.

430
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,990
你要试驾吗
Would you like a test drive?

431
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,700
试驾？
A test drive?

432
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,410
我知道了
Okay.

433
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,370
一眼看上去就觉得他们很可疑
Even at a glance they look suspicious.

434
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,430
怎么样
How was it?

435
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,930
你得迅速做出决定
You want to make a quick decision.

436
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,100
昨天也有客人看过这辆车
Another customer looked at this car yesterday.

437
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,150
我很喜欢这辆车 我就要它了
I like this car. I will take it.

438
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,150
你做决定还是要慎重一点
Ah, you should be a bit more prudent.

439
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,190
不 你不是说昨天也有人看过吗
No. You said someone looked at it yesterday.

440
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,030
如果我犹豫不决 被那个人抢了怎么办
What if he takes it while I hesitate?

441
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:03,450
我要买这辆车 我很喜欢它
I will take this car. I like it.

442
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,740
那样的话
If that's the case…

443
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,990
你别看 那个…
No. So…

444
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,410
有件事我忘了告诉你
Well, there is something I forgot to tell you.

445
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,910
是什么
What is it?

446
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,370
这辆车的发动机会发生爆震
This car has an engine knocking.

447
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,880
爆…爆震是什么
Knock… Knocking? What is that?

448
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,880
看来你开车的时候没听到啊
I guess you didn't hear it when you were driving.

449
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,710
就是发动机发出的声音 你把耳朵贴在发动机上听一下
It's the sound from the engine. Put your ear to the engine and listen.

450
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,760
好
Okay.

451
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,260
有声音吧
Do you hear it?

452
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,100
真奇怪 有声音从这里传出来
That's weird. There is sound coming from here.

453
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,260
就是说啊
I know.

454
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,560
声音？
A sound?

455
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,270
好奇怪 从发动机里…
It's weird. From the engine…

456
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,320
-传出这种声音 -是啊
-A sound like this is coming. -Oh, no.

457
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,950
不过…
But, I…

458
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,280
我很喜欢这种声音
I really like this sound.

459
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,740
这车调音了吗 我特别喜欢这种声音
Did you tune it up? I really like this sound.

460
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,330
不是 这不是调音 这叫爆震
No, it's not like a tune-up. It's called knocking.

461
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,210
如果发动机因此出现故障的话 要花几百万韩元维修
If the engine breaks down because of it, you'll lose a few million.

462
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,840
什么 要花几百万韩元？
What? Lose a few million?

463
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,300
这辆车才多少钱 居然要花几百万韩元维修
How can I lose a few million? This car isn't worth that much.

464
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,420
这么荒唐的事 你告诉我的…
That is totally ridiculous. What…

465
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,550
原因
is the reason you're telling me

466
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,220
我突然想到了
comes to me all of a sudden.

467
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,850
你们老实说
Be honest.

468
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,930
你们这样做…
You're trying to…

469
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,100
是为了卖给昨天来的那个人吧
-sell it to that person from yesterday. -No, that's not it.

470
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,600
不 不是那样的 这辆车…
-sell it to that person from yesterday. -No, that's not it.

471
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,070
不 不是那样的 这辆车…
This is… Look at this.

472
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,440
悬架也松了 你看
The suspension is loose too. Look.

473
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,450
不然车不可能晃成这样
The car shouldn't shake like this.

474
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,870
原来如此 这是因为悬架松了啊
I see. The suspension is loose.

475
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,500
如果悬架松了
If the suspension is loose,

476
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,380
我就把它修紧
I will tighten it up. I will take this car. Give me this car.

477
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,970
我要这辆车 给我这辆
I will tighten it up. I will take this car. Give me this car.

478
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,300
我并不是想把这辆车卖给别人
I am not trying to sell this car to another person.

479
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,640
这辆车的转向油泵还漏油
The steering pump on this car is leaking too.

480
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,770
-你看 漏油了 -你看看
-Look. There's oil here. -Look at that.

481
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,390
油泵漏油的话 我把它堵上就行
If the oil pump is leaking, I'll plug it up.

482

我要买这辆车
I will buy this car.

483
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,610
光把它堵上哪能行 它漏了这么多
Plugging it up won't do. Look, there is a puddle.

484
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,070
漏得多擦擦就行 请给我这辆车
I can clean up the puddle. Give me this car.

485
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,450
客人 我呢
Look, sir. I am telling you this…

486
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,120
觉得你像我哥 我才跟你说这些
because you remind me of my brother.

487
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,410
我像你哥吗
I'm like your brother? Me?

488
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,370
-感觉上 -这样啊 感觉上
-Just your image. -I see, my image.

489
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,830
我们卖场有和这辆车类似的其他车型
There is another model on our lot that is similar to this one.

490
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,250
我不想看
I don't want to see it.

491
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,590
我要买这辆车 请给我这辆
I will buy this one. Give me this car.

492
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,550
你看 现在它停在那里都会掉轮胎
Look at that! The tire just came off.

493
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,050
以前只会在开起来的时候掉
It only comes off when you're driving.

494
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,850
唉唷 现在连卖也不能卖了
Gosh, I can't even sell it now.

495
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,720
-轮胎掉了啊 -对
-The tire came off. -I know!

这种复古的感性
Such a retro look.

497

我比你想象的要年轻
I am younger than you think.

00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,450
是吧 他太年轻了
Right, he's too young.

555

Being young is not a privilege!

557
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,040

I'm sorry I was informal with you because you were young.

Do you want to get the refund for just Mr. Sa's car and leave?

572
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,640
那其他人呢 其他人也要拿到退款啊
What about other people? We should get a refund for everyone.

573
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,020
怎么拿
How?

她想成为二手车的销售 多赚点钱

比起这家伙 她更是个人才
She's more fun than this guy.

607
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,660
尽全力做吧 好吗
Do your best. Okay?

608
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,990
金植 你多教教他们
Geumsik, show them the ropes.

609
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,040
好 我知道了
Yes, boss.

610
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:15,170
-好 大哥 谢谢… -谢谢你 大哥
-Yes, boss. Thank-- -Thank you, boss!

611
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,790
真是的
My gosh.

612
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,300
二手车交易喜好度第一
NUMBER 1 DEALER OF USED CARS!

613
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,100
喂 这可是五百万韩元 你好好干
Hey, it's worth five million won. Do it right.

614
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,520
我真的检查过了
I checked it, I swear.

615
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,660
在首尔买二手车就来 荷藕
SEOUL USED CARS YEONGEUN

616
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,280
你在东张西望什么
What are you looking around for?

617
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:52,450
既然我来了 就得了解一下气氛
Since I'm here, I should take in the atmosphere.

618
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,500
这里的气氛没什么可了解的
There's nothing to take in here.

619
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,500
我们的工作很简单
Our job is simple.

620
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,330
如果客户看到虚假商品后过来
Let's say the customer comes in after seeing a fake ad.

621
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,250
我们就用各种方式让他们放弃那辆车
We make them forget that car by using the regular repertoire,

622
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,090
然后以高价卖给他们另一辆
then sell them another car for a higher price.

623
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:06,340
-很简单吧 -是很简单
-Isn't it simple? -It sure is.

624
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,260
给你 这是我为你准备的
Here. I prepared this for you.

625
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,350
这是什么
What is this?

626
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,600
你把其中几条背下来就行
You just have to memorize a few things.

627
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,520
这有点…
It's…

628
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,190
这里 这部分很重要
This part here is important.

629
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,560
-这部分啊 -对
-Oh, this. -Yeah.

630
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:22,770
这里…
This part is…

631
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,110
唉唷 等一下 洗手间在哪里
My stomach. Where is the bathroom?

632
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:30,240
-就在走廊尽头 -是吗 我去一下
-At the end of the hall. -Is that so? Okay…

633
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,340
荷藕市场
YEONGEUN MARKET

634
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,820
喂 我们缺一亿韩元
Look, we're missing 100 million won.

635
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,700
你确定把他们的口袋都掏空了吗
Are you sure you emptied their pockets?

636
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,870
你去把他们的口袋 和内衣都翻过来看看
Not just their pockets, we even searched their underpants.

637
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,080
我要疯了
This is driving me crazy.

638
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,040
其他地区的人肯定都凑够了
The guys in the other region must've met the quota.

639
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,380
那从富川那边借点不行吗
Then can we borrow from the Bucheon area?

640
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,000
臭小子 我可是有自尊心的
I have my pride, punk.

641
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,300
到明天为止在网上撒满诱饵
Post a lot of bait on the internet by tomorrow.

642
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,840
无论如何都要凑到一亿韩元
Come up with 100 million somehow.

643
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,180
好 我知道了
Yes, we will.

644
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,930
喂 你在那里干什么
Hey, what are you doing over there?

645
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,390
你是谁
Who are you?

646
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,020
我在接受荷藕市场 新员工培训的时候迷路…
I got lost during the Yeongeun Market new employee training--

647
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,060
抱歉
I'm very sorry.

648
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,860
他是实习生 我想他走错路了
He's a trainee. I think he came down the wrong hall.

649
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,860
-你不能来这边 -我没找到洗手间
-You can't be here. -I couldn't find the bathroom.

650
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,690
对不起
I'm very sorry.

651
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,740
小心一点
Watch out.

652
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,570
洗手间在哪里
Where is the bathroom?

653
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,030
我都告诉你在走廊尽头了
I told you it's at the end of the hall.

654
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,320
真是吓死我了
You had me so scared.

655
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,660
所以说要时刻盯紧新人
This is why you can never take your eyes off of the newbies.

656
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:59,790
那个地方你不能去 洗手间在这里
This is where you can't go. The bathroom is over here.

657
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,620
不过金植 我问你一件事
But Geumsik, let me ask you something.

658
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,290
我们这样做可以吗
Can we… do this?

659
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,000
-什么 -就是…
-Do what? -You know.

660
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,800
就是我们做的事
Like this…

661
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,760
我的意思是我们可以 耍小聪明卖二手车吗
I mean, can we sell used cars in such a clever way?

662
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,430
当然 你得更加努力
Of course. You have to work hard. Or else you'll miss your chance.

663
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,930
否则别人会抢先下手
Of course. You have to work hard. Or else you'll miss your chance.

664
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,680
你不会良心不安吗
Don't you feel guilty?

665
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,140
良心？看来你没读过调查问卷啊
Feel guilty? I guess she didn't read the survey.

666
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,350
只要给十亿韩元
I mean, for a billion won,

667
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,690
和我同龄的二十多岁的年轻人当中
more than half the kids in their early twenties

668
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,940
有一半以上愿意代替罪犯坐牢
are willing to go to jail on behalf of a criminal.

669
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,360
这不是因为人们善良
That's not because people are good,

670
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,570
而是因为他们没有遇到 像我们这样的赚钱机会
but because they didn't have the chance to make money like we did.

671
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,280
社会就是这样 金钱是万能的
The world revolves around money.

672
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,160
所以你们才来这里赚钱
And that's why you both are here, to make money.

673
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,700
-是吧 -是
-Isn't that right? -Yes.

674
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,540
我们为什么来这里
Why are we here?

675
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,080
-当然是来赚钱的 对 -对
-We're here to make money. -Exactly.

676
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:48,000
对 所以你们要努力 不要提良心之类的
Then you should work hard and forget about your conscience.

677
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,210
不过你不怕被抓吗
But aren't you afraid you could get caught?

678
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,550
就算被抓住 也没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

679
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,550
你知道我们老板现在去哪里了吗
Do you know where our boss is right now?

680
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,590
他去哪里了
Where is he?

681
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,140
他去检察厅接受调查了
He's getting investigated by a prosecutor.

682
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,270
什么 我不知道
What? I have no idea.

683
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,400
我不知道你在说什么 真是的
I don't know what you're talking about. Jeez.

684
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,030
你上面的人是谁
Who is above you?

685
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,450
上面没有人啊
There is no one up there.

686
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,620
我上面还能有谁 我就是老板
Who could be above me? I'm the boss.

687
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,750
在座的各位关系都很好嘛 全部以兄弟相称
You are all close friends here.

688
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,380
唉唷 我都没注意到你们都在这里
Hello, you guys are all here.

689
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,460
-你好 -你好
-Hi. -Hello.

690
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,010
我们确实彼此来往都认识
Yes, I do see them once in a while.

691
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,180
难道你不认识隔壁的检察官吗
Don't you know the prosecutor next door?

692
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,890
那这个呢
What about this, then?

693
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:45,640
这是两个月前在你们公司买车的 受害者的取款记录
It's the withdrawal record of a victim who bought a car from you two months ago.

694
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,520
十年车龄的车堪比新车的售价 这合理吗
Does it make sense that a 10-year-old car costs the price of a new car?

695
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,650
唉唷 这些家伙真的…
These guys…

696
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,780
销售技巧太棒了
They've got great skills.

697
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,120
你看 并不是只有美食店才有秘方
Listen. Must-eat restaurants aren't the only ones with secret know-how.

698
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:09,460
我们这行也有诀窍 你看这个
There is know-how in this business too. See?

699
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,090
你那是诈骗啊
That's what you call a scam.

700
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,380
怎么是诈骗呢
Scam?

701
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,550
有法律条文规定
Is there a legal clause

702
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,510
十年车龄的车不能卖新车的价格吗
that says you can't sell a 10-year-old car for the price of a new car?

703
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,640
你们把正常的车以低价挂在网上
You post an ad for a good car for cheap,

704
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,890
然后用各种借口 换一辆车高价卖给消费者
and you sell a different car for more by giving excuses about this and that.

705
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:26,730
这是虚假买卖
That's fraud.

706
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,940
我们出售二手车确实赚了一点钱
We did make a little profit by selling used cars.

707
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,650
但我们从来没有发布过虚假商品
But I have never posted a fraudulent ad.

708
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,690
如果你有证据就把证据拿来
If you have evidence, let me see it.

709
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:39,410
你挨个去找那些主张自己受骗的人
Find each and every person who claims to be swindled.

710
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:42,870
把合同整整齐齐地收集好 并全部拿过来的话…
Collect every contract and bring them.

711
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,660
不 就算你拿来了
No, even if you bring them,

712
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:50,170
那些合同也不是我让他们签的
those contracts weren't made because I told them to.

713
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,790
都是我手底下的人 为了牟利而犯了法
The ones who work for me broke the law to make more profit.

714
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,260
我怎么一一管理他们啊
How am I supposed to manage every single one of them?

715
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,630
我一定会抓住你
I will get you no matter what.

716
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,510
好 你抓吧
Yes, please do.

717
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,300
你不要太费力气
Don't exhaust yourself.

718
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,140
你得留点力气回家看孩子啊
You need to leave some strength for raising your kid.

719
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,270
最重要的是眼神
The most important thing is your eyes.

720
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,480
那种能让客户信赖和相信你的眼神
The eyes that make the customers trust you.

721
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,320
好 各位 吃点东西再继续吧
Everyone, let's take a break and have this.

722
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,410
-这是什么 -这个吗
-What is this? -This?

723
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,870
时间这么晚了 我们还学诈…
Well, it's getting late, and for frau--

724
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,910
为了努力学习的大家
And for all of us who are studying so hard,

725
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,620
我买了炖鸡
I brought braised spicy chicken for everyone!

726
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,800
太好吃了
This is so good.

727
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,850
这是炖鸡还是意大利面呢
Is this braised chicken or spaghetti?

728
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,180
是炖鸡 还是意大利面呢
Braised chicken or spaghetti?

729
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,430
不管是什么 只要基础食材好就好吃
Whatever it is, it's good as the basic ingredients are good.

730
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,850
人也必须有基础才行
A person is the same.

731
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,810
你背过基础知识了吗
Did you memorize the basics?

732
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,070
你背过了吗
Did you memorize them?

733
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,280
-我背过了 -她说背过了
I did.

734
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,490
好
-She did. -Okay.

735
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:01,490
老板 你回来了
Boss, you're back.

736
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,490
-你回来了 老板 -老板
Are you back, boss?

737
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,450
这是智勋哥买的 真的很好吃 你尝尝吧
Hun brought this and it's so good. Would you like to have some?

738
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,540
你们吃吧 我现在没有胃口
Go ahead and eat. I have no appetite right now.

739
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,000
那个检方的调查怎么样了
What happened to the investigation at the prosecutor's office?

740
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,010
你现在资历深了嘛 还会问候我了
Geumsik, you are moving up in the ranks. You even ask me how I'm doing.

741
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,560
对不起 我只是担心你
I was just… worried.

742
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,520
看看你的业绩
Look at your sales.

743
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,940
你认为我是为了这点业绩 才养活并培养你的吗
Do you think I fed and raised you for these lousy results?

744
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,980
对不起
I'm sorry.

745
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,530
如果你真的担心 就赚钱回来
If you're really worried, bring in some money.

746
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,610
是
Yes, sir.

747
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
老板 12点半…
Sir, at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow--

748
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,910
臭小子
Shut up.

749
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,410
这种事情在别的地方说
Say those things elsewhere, okay?

750
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:51,750
-对不起 大哥 -小心一点
-I'm sorry, boss. -Let's be careful.

751
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,500
是
Yes.

752
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,330
你们这些新人也努力吧
Our newbies, you should work hard too.

753
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:56,960
那样你们才能像前辈们一样赚很多钱
So you make a lot like your seniors.

754
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,840
-是 我知道了 -我知道了
-Yes, boss! -Yes, boss!

755
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,800
-你们吃吧 -请慢走
-Keep eating. -Have a good night.

756
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,340
-请慢走 -请一定要记住小勋
-Good night. -Please remember Hun!

757
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,930
律师事务所 二楼
LAWYER'S OFFICE, 2F

758
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,060
真是太恶劣了
He's a nasty one.

759
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,060
千律师 事务长 你们看这个
Mr. Cheon, Mr. Sa, take a look at this.

760
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,820
有很多受害者的留言
There are lots of comments by victims.

761
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,440
还有这种手法
There is this kind of fraud too. I would fall for this too.

762
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,820
这种连我也会上当
There is this kind of fraud too. I would fall for this too.

763
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,910
这种程度的话 我也会上当
Ah, if it's this bad, even I would fall for it.

764
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,330
事务长 你已经上当了
Mr. Sa, you fell for it already.

765
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:34,620
荷藕的老板比我想象中还要恶劣
This head of Yeongeun is worse than I thought.

766
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,920
我想他不只经营这一个商社
This market is not the only one he has. He seems to be a middleman.

767
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,750
他应该处于腰部位置
This market is not the only one he has. He seems to be a middleman.

768
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,340
什么腰部位置
Hmm. Middleman for what?

769
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:43,300
我看到他们在准备现金
I saw them preparing cash.

770
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,050
那些钱应该是上缴给他们头目的
It's probably the bribe they were paying the head above.

771
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,010
到明天为止 无论如何都要凑到一亿韩元
Do whatever you can to make 100 million by tomorrow.

772
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:54,430
他们可不是一般的社区混混 这是全国性的组织
These aren't neighborhood bullies. They're a nationwide organization.

773
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,900
荷藕的老板应该是 负责首尔地区的头目
The leader of Yeongeun seems to be the head of the Seoul region.

774
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,520
那我们该怎么办
Then what do we do?

775
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,690
如果我们背叛他 他会剁掉我们的手指吗
If we betray him, he will cut off our fingers like…

776
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,070
千律师 我们拿回我的钱后就收手吧
Mr. Cheon, why don't we quit after getting my money back?

777
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,070
我不要
I don't want to.

778
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,580
千律师
Mr. Cheon.

779
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,700
你已经不是检察官了 打算怎么办
You're no longer a prosecutor. What'll you do?

780
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,000
因为我不是检察官
Mm, since I'm not a prosecutor,

781
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,920
所以我们得把检察官叫过来
I would have to call… a prosecutor.

782
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,900
前辈 你不下班吗
Yejin, aren't you going home?

783
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,810
嗯 我再看一会儿这个
Yeah, after I read this a little more.

784
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,780
汝媛应该在等你
I think Yeowon will be waiting.

785
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,240
汝媛吗 没关系 她和保姆在一起
Yeowon? She's okay. She's with her nanny.

786
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,160
这是你给汝媛的
From Yejin, to Yeowon.

787
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,960
这是我给汝媛的
From Minhyeok, to Yeowon.

788
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,550
-这是什么 -不是说明天是汝媛的生日嘛
-What is this? -You said tomorrow is Yeonwon's birthday.

789
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,880
赶紧回家吧
Go home.

790
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,760
唉唷 回家吧
Go home already.

791
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,550
我来看这些并在明天之前整理出来
I will review this and take notes by tomorrow.

792
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,140
你明天看过之后再判断吧
And you will read it tomorrow and make a decision.

793
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:18,100
下班
Dismissed.

794
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,480
谢谢你
Thanks.

795
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,860
大家停下手里的活
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

796
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,990
现在有一桩关系到 我们荷藕市场生死存亡的买卖
We have a deal that could make or break the fate of Yeongeun Market.

797
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,500
谁能用这辆车 在30分钟内赚到一亿韩元
Who can make 100 million in 30 minutes with this?

798
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,870
没有人吗
Is there no one?

799
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,630
我可以
I can do it.

800
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,930
新人吗
Newbie?

801
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,680
我会在这盘炖鸡凉掉之前回来
I will come back before this braised chicken cools.

802
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,650
你是来看二手车的吧
Are you here for a used car?

803
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,610
二手车交易要靠气势
A used car is a war of nerves. A used car is a war of nerves.

804
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,240
二手车…
A used…

805
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:13,700
民赫？
Min… Minhyeok?

806
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,280
智勋？
Jihun?

807
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,080
民赫 你怎么在这里
Minhyeok, why are you here?

808
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,700
我吗 我来买车
Me? I'm here to buy a car.

809
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:20,580
那你在这里做什么
But what are you doing here?

810
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:23,420
我吗 在这里二手车要靠气势…
Me? Here, a used car is a war of nerves…

811
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,080
他们好像认识
It looks like he knows him.

812
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:26,540
其实
Actually,

813
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,380
我拖欠的事务所房租有点多
my office rent is quite overdue.

814
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,970
我会偶尔兼职做销售
Every once in a while, I worked on the side at a dealer.

815
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,600
真的吗
Really?

816
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,890
我想过总有一天会遇到认识的人
I thought I would meet someone I knew eventually,

817
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,770
但真的遇到了 我还觉得挺丢人的
but it's very embarrassing… now that I actually meet one.

818
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:43,730
喂 这有什么好丢人的
What is there to be embarrassed about?

819
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,020
因为需要钱而做兼职有什么好丢人的
There's nothing embarrassing about working side jobs for money.

820
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,280
喂 快点让我看看车 车在哪里
Hey, hurry up and show me the car. Where is it?

821
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,490
好 那我们走吧 车在那边
Let's go then. Over there.

822
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,820
不过你从什么时候开始在这里工作的
When did you start working here?

823
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,780
有一段时间了
It's been a while.

824
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,450
但这并不重要
But that's not what's important.

825
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,130
怎么样
What do you think?

826
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,720
喂 我太喜欢这辆车了 我要买它
I really like this one. I'll take it.

827
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,180
好 那么合同…
Okay, then let's sign--

828
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,680
这是什么 我漏掉了一部分
What is this? Something was left out.

829
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:21,560
-漏掉？-嗯
-Left out? -Yes.

830
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,980
这辆车的发动机会发生爆震
This car apparently has a knocking in the engine.

831
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,020
你没有听到吗
Didn't you hear it?

832
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,480
我什么也没有听到啊
I didn't hear anything.

833
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,030
你把耳朵贴在发动机上
Put your ear to the engine.

834
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,610
听到了吧
You can hear it, right?

835
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,660
有奇怪的声音传出来
There's a weird noise.

836
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:41,490
是啊 你再听一下
I know. Listen to it again.

837
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,790
天啊 是从正中间发出来的声音
Oh, my! There's a sound coming from the center.

838
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,590
对 正是那个部分 民赫
That's right. That is exactly the spot, Minhyeok.

839
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,800
真是的 这帮家伙 是从哪里搞来这种车的
Darn it, where'd they get this car--

840
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,970
好 民赫
Okay, Minhyeok.

841
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,220
这里有一辆类似这辆车的好车
There is a nice car that is similar to this one.

842
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,970
去看看那辆车怎么样
How about looking at that one?

843
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,080
请在灯亮时出发
DRIVE WHEN THE LIGHT COMES ON

844
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,600
民赫 这车太适合你了
Minhyeok, this suits you so well.

845
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,220
说到这辆车 就是这里
This car has this thing right here.

846
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,810
它的翅膀是亮点
These wings are its special point.

847
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,480
是啊
I agree.

848
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,360
虽然车里看起来不怎么样 但感觉能飞奔起来
It may not look like it, but I think it could fly.

849
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,780
如果我没有碰见你
If I didn't run into you here,

850
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,240
我肯定会买刚才那辆徒有其表
I could have bought the car that looks good on the outside,

851
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,410
还会发出这种声音的车了
but makes a weird sound.

852
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,530
是啊 如果你买了 那就撞大运了
If you did, you would've been lucky.

853
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:04,160
-撞什么 -撞坏了
-Luck what? -Luck!

854
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,870
你这家伙 你的人生差点完蛋
You would have been out of luck, silly.

855
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,920
总之谢谢你
Anyway, thanks. Thanks to you, I got a good car.

856
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,670
托你的福 我买到一辆好车
Anyway, thanks. Thanks to you, I got a good car.

857
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:16,590
还有你不要因为拖欠太多房租 就在这里工作太久
Don't work here for too long, even though you have overdue rent.

858
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,260
你得踏实做好你的本职工作 知道了吧
You should stick to your day job. Okay?

859
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,800
好 谢谢你
Thanks.

860
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,970
那我也给你一个忠告
If I were to offer you some advice,

861
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:25,640
你得开慢点 因为…
you should drive slow because…

862
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,310
你可能会飞起来
you could take off!

863
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,020
我知道了 谢谢你
Okay, thanks. I'm going. Keep working.

864
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:35,270
我走了 你忙吧
Okay, thanks. I'm going. Keep working.

865
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,400
这就是我
That's me.

866
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,490
-开慢点 -慢一点
-Drive slow! -Slowly.

867
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,790
慢一点
Slowly!

868
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,410
你可能会飞起来 走…
You could take off! Bye…

869
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:51,960
走好 民赫
Bye, Minhyeok.

870
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,040
大哥
Jihun.

871
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:54,710
喂 新人
Hey, newbie.

872
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:57,130
给你
Here you go.

873
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:08,180
你这家伙真是个人才
This guy is something else.

874
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,390
多亏了你 我们凑够了要上缴的钱
We filled the bribe quota, thanks to you.

875
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,190
谢谢
Thank you.

876
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,810
我们走吧
Let's go!

877
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,860
走吧
Let's go!

878
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,490
我送你们去死
Let's go, to get you guys.

879
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,170
我顺利买到了
-I bought the car. -Mm.

880
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,250
不过你知道我看见谁了吗
Do you know who I ran into?

881
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,590
-谁 -千智勋
-Who? -Cheon Jihun.

882
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,390
他可能最近日子不好过 居然在这里做销售
I guess he's having a hard time. He was working as a salesman here.

883
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:54,400
喂？智勋
Hi, Jihun.

884
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,190
喂？前辈 是我 我想和你商量一件事
Yejin, it's me. I wanted to discuss something with you.

885
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,480
不 差不多
No. It's something similar.

886
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,110
但这件事十分重要
But it's very important.

887
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,530
好 我试验一下再给你打电话
Let me experiment with this and call you back.

888
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,260
就是这个
This is the one.

889
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,430
不过多亏了他 我买得很顺利
Thanks to him, I got a good one.

890
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:26,970
-罗检察官 -出现了吗
-Ms. Na. -Did you find it?

891
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:27,890
出现了
We found it.

892
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:31,270
-什么出现了 -你买车的钱
-Find what? -The money for your car.

893
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,430
把门关上
Close the door.

894
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:35,730
车钱？
The money for my car?

895
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,020
辛苦了 民赫
Good work, Minhyeok.

896
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,270
辛苦什么
What did I do?

897
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,150
你辛苦了
You did well.

898
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:22,360
卫星定位追踪

899
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,320
罗检察官
Ms. Na.

900
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,280
出发
Let's go.

901
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,970
所以你是说这个红点就是那些车
So, you're saying this red dot is those cars.

902
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:53,640
-对 -但我们为什么要跟踪他们
