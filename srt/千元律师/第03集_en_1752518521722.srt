5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,550
你是从这边推过去的 对吧
So, you're saying, you went this way like this.

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,550
你就推到了这边
You pushed it to the side.

7
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:16,010
对 因为这些车很贵
-Yes, since they're expensive cars. -Are you kidding me?

8
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:16,880
你这家伙在糊弄我吗
-Yes, since they're expensive cars. -Are you kidding me?

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,640
喂 你那样推过去能刮到车吗
Hey, how can the car get scratched if you push it like that?

10
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,970
往前推
Go straight.

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,020
他是直走把推车推过去的
He went straight, okay?

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,220
直走往前推？
Straight?

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,890
你不知道什么是往前推吗
Get it?

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,770
往前推 对吧
-So, go straight? Go straight. -Mm.

15
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,150
对
Yes.

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,030
现在你明白我的意思了吧
Are you finally getting what I'm saying?

17
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,400
直接往车那边推
Mm, straight towards the car.

18
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,490
知道了
Got it.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,700
喂 快一点
Hey, go faster.

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,280
向着车 推快一点
Faster towards the car.

21
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,160
-对 你应该推快一点 -快一点
-Yes, you should go faster. -Faster.

22
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,620
快一点
Faster, faster, faster.

23
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,470
你这个疯子
You... crazy scumbag!

24
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:00,220
-你这个疯子 -等一下
-You crazy scumbag. -Look.

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,510
保险杠坏掉了
Your bumper got wrecked.

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,850
你为什么让我推那么快啊
Why did you tell me to go faster?

27
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,640
你这个像疯狗一样的家伙
You total wacko!

28
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,690
-等一下 -什么
-Hey, wait. -What?

29
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,270
建宇爷爷划的痕迹完全不见了
The spot where Gunwoo's grandpa scratched has completely disappeared.

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,770
你这个家伙开什么玩笑
Are you kidding me?

31
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,320
你打算怎么赔偿我的车
What are you going to do about my car?

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,650
你今天死定了
Today is your funeral. You're dead!

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,110
等一下
Wait.

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,410
你要干什么
What?

35
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,530
从现在起 这算是一个新的案件
From now, this is a new case,

36
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,620
所以你就不要再去找建宇和他爷爷了
so it has nothing to do with Gunwoo or his grandfather.

37
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,120
现在开始 你单独和我的律师谈就行
You may speak to my lawyer from now on.

38
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,540
你刚才不是说你是律师吗
Didn't you say that you're a lawyer?

39
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,290
虽然我也是律师
I am a lawyer,

40
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,040
但我打算委托别的律师来处理这件事
but I'd like to leave it to another lawyer.

41
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,140
如果你能把这件事解决好 我就给你实习的机会
If you solve this, you can work with us.

42
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,470
什么
What?

43
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,230
稍等 千律师
Mr. Cheon.

44
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,980
等一下 千律师
Wait, Mr. Cheon.

45
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,570
稍等一下
Wait.

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,110
喂
Excuse me!

47
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,570
喂 你这个家伙
Hey, jerk!

48
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
家伙？
Jerk?

49
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,240
你不能就这么走
You can't leave like this.

50
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,950
怎么 你处理不了吗
Why? You can't handle it?

51
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,370
这不是我能不能处理的问题
It's not about whether I can or can't.

52
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,710
你搞成这样 想让我们怎么办
What do you want us to do with this mess?

53
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,380
-如果你处理不了 那就算了 -等一下
-Never mind if you can't handle it. -Wait.

54
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,840
你到底要不要做
Will you work with us or not?

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,800
我做
I will.

56
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,090
好 那就拜托你了
Okay, I appreciate it.

57
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,640
你忙吧
Good luck.

58
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,860
我给你五天时间
I will give you exactly five days.

59
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,610
如果你不能在五天之内解决的话
If you can't resolve this in five days,

60
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,450
你们就死定了
you're all dead.

61
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,950
明白了吗
Okay?

62
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,910
是的 我明白了 千永裴专务
Yes. I understand, Executive Director Cheon Yeongbae.

63
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,160
车明集团 千永裴

64
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,420
白实习
Ms. Baek.

65
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,710
来杯热可可
Hot chocolate.

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,670
很烫 垫上这个
It's very hot. Here, use this.

67
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,300
谢谢
Thank you.

68
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,050
怎么样 没有解决办法吗
Do you have any idea how we can resolve this?

69
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,640
不管用什么方法都试试吧
We will have to try something.

70
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,930
好 我会从旁帮你
Sure. I will help you.

71
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,060
我们一起找的话 应该能找到解决办法
If we put our heads together, we should be able to find a way.

72
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,690
我倒是有办法
There are ways.

73
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,070
我们可以检查一下刮痕部分的油漆 是否真的蹭到推车上了
We could have checked if the paint on the scratched part is on the wagon.

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,280
对啊
That's right.

75
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,200
这辆车有可能在别的地方被刮了
The car could have been scratched from somewhere else.

76
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:27,910
没错
That's right.

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,540
我们本来只要检查一下 就能轻而易举地解决这件事
Had we checked for that, we could have resolved it much easier.

78
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,870
没错
That's right.

79
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,920
砰 哐当
Thud! Crash!

80
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,290
你这个疯子
You crazy scumbag!

81
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,340
砰 哐当 这家伙真是的
Thud! Crash! Why, that lunatic.

82
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,590
千律师到底为什么要撞上去
Why did Mr. Cheon crash the wagon into the car?

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,140
他太暴燥了 律师怎么能把事情闹得更大呢
A temper? A lawyer shouldn't get so worked up like that.

84
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,230
好好干
Do a good job of it.

85
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,860
如果你能把这件事解决好 我就给你实习的机会
If you solve this, you can work with us.

86
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,540
不过事务长 这里都只收一千韩元吗
Mr. Sa. Is everything for 1,000 won here?

87
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,540
对 就只收一千韩元
Yes, it's all 1,000 won here.

88
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,670
所以大家才称呼千律师 为千元律师
That's why people call Mr. Cheon, "One Dollar Lawyer."

89
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
-千元律师？-对
-One Dollar Lawyer? -Yes.

90
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,840
因为他的律师费只有一千韩元
Because his legal fee is only 1,000 won.

91
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,340
只收一千韩元律师费 这像话吗
Does it make sense to only get paid 1,000 won for legal fees?

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,600
确实不像话
No, it doesn't make sense.

93
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,180
那能怎么办 千律师决定只收一千韩元律师费
But what are you going to do? Mr. Cheon decided on it.

94
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,060
为什么 有什么特殊原因吗
Why? Is there a particular reason for it?

95
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,190
这个嘛
You know what?

96
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,440
我想是因为我
I think it was because of me.

97
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,530
这样啊 难道你…
Oh, then does that mean...

98
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,820
没错
That's correct.

99
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,700
我是千律师的第一个委托人
I was Mr. Cheon's first client.

100
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,580
原来如此
Aah.

101
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,240
如果你想知道的话 以后问千律师吧
If you want to know more, ask Mr. Cheon later.

102
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,880
他去哪了 居然闯下这么大的祸就走
Where is he? He made such a mess of things.

103
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,710
千智勋 代表律师
CHIEF COUNSEL, CHEON JIHUN

104
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,800
17
Seventeen.

105
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,050
17？
Seventeen?

106
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,970
好
Okay.

107
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,600
你可是答应我 如果我赢了就接我的案子
If I win, you promised to take my case.

108
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,390
你还是先赢我吧 官司不是问题
Don't worry about the trial, and focus on your game.

109
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,890
不过我一直叫你来 你都不来
I asked you many times to visit me, but you never did.

110
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,100
今天是什么风把你吹来了
I wonder why you're here all of a sudden?

111
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,610
我有我的原因
Well, I have my reasons.

112
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,400
这局我赢定了
It looks like I won this round.

113
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,990
你一定要信守承诺
You better keep your promise.

114
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,450
毛会长 别再说话了 该你了
Chairman. Stop talking and keep playing, please.

115
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,870
30…
Thirty...

116
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,540
7…
...seven...

117
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,290
不 是38
is wrong, it's 38.

118
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,680
没有吧 你真没有啊
No? You don't have it.

119
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,140
我就知道
I knew it.

120
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,940
38 完成
Thirty-eight, bingo.

121
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,940
什么 这么快吗
What, already?

122
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,650
你是不是在耍诈
Are you using a dirty trick?

123
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,230
你竟然说我耍诈 这话太过分了
What do you mean, a dirty trick? That's a bit harsh.

124
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,150
你看看
Look at this.

125
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,740
毛会长 我可是千智勋 千智勋律师
Chairman. It's me, Cheon Jihun. Attorney Cheon Jihun.

126
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,370
我们再来一局
I want to play one more round.

127
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,660
好
Sure.

128
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,240
唉唷 到时间了
Oh, no, look at the time.

129
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,250
唉唷 抱歉 我下次再来
Goodness, I'm sorry. I will come back next time.

130
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,960
你这么快就要走了吗
Do you have to go already?

131
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,550
等你从拘留所转到监狱的时候我再来
I will come back when you move from the detention center to prison.

132
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,210
你简直是在咒我
Watch what you say. Why don't you curse me?

133
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,180
那些家伙收那么贵的律师费 到底都在干什么
My lawyers are useless. They just take my money.

134
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,600
你真的不接我的案子吗
You really don't want to take my case?

135
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,640
对 我说过 只要你玩宾果游戏赢过我 我就接
No. I told you I'll take the case if you beat me at Bingo.

136
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,730
你多练习一下吧
So, practice your bingo game.

137
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,310
这游戏有那么难吗
Is bingo that hard?

138
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,310
你怎么玩得这么烂
Why are you... so bad at bingo?

139
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,620
他去做探视皇帝的兼职了？
He's at a part-time job having "an audience with the emperor?"

140
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,370
那不就是去探视犯人 陪他们玩 然后收钱吗
Isn't that getting paid for visiting and spending time with someone in jail?

141
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,410
那样才能交房租啊
That's how we can pay rent.

142
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,660
他竟然还装作一副正义凛然的样子
And he was acting so virtuous.

143
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,170
他还做什么
What else does he do?

144
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,290
做很多事
This and that.

145
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,800
我去接见客户时 从离开办公室到回到办公室
I charge from the time I leave my office to the time I get back to my office.

146
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,140
都要算时间 这一点你知道吗
I charge from the time I leave my office to the time I get back to my office.

147
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,260
都要算时间 这一点你知道吗
You know that, don't you?

148
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,220
当然
Of course.

149
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,350
我来回是两个小时
It took two hours to commute.

150
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,730
探视是两个小时
I spent two hours with the client.

151
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,900
我的费用是每小时一百万韩元 所以总共是四百万韩元
My fees are one million won per hour, so that's four million won.

总共410万韩元
So, it will be 4,100,000 won.

154
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,740

180
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,180
那种小律师事务所 会和千专务扯上什么关系
What would that small law office have to do with him?

181
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,600
真是的 不是说要对我保密吗
I thought it was a secret.

182
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,310
我对你哪有秘密啊
I don't keep anything from you.

183
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,810
听起来不像是好事
It doesn't sound like anything good.

184
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,070
我们要不要帮她
Should we help her?

185
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,240
不用 那我就没必要 把她送到那里去了

我撞得好
I did well by crashing his car, yes.

205
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,170
我就说我看人很准吧
I am such a good judge of character.

206
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,250
怎么样 你想出计划了吗
So, were you able to come up with a plan?

207
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,380
没有
No.

208
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,390
我还在想
I'm still thinking about it.

209
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,050
还在想？
Thinking?

210
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,640
你还在脑子里不停地想吗
You're still working it out in your head?

211
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,560
等你想好了 就告诉我
Let me know when you're done thinking.

212
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,440
毕竟我在培训实习生嘛
I'm the lawyer training a probationary employee.

213
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
好的
Yes.

214
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
给你
Here you go.

215
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,240
我能看见
I can see you.

216
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,790
所以呢
So, what?

217
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,790
你搞得我无话可说
I have no nothing to say.

218
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,640
好 你在纽约过得愉快吗
So, did you enjoy your time in New York?

219

是的 托你的福 我学到了很多

220
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
这怎么是托我的福
What is there to thank me?

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,600
你是凭自己的本事去的
You went on your own merit.

222
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,980
不是
Not at all.

223
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,860
都是托你的福
It was all thanks to you, Mr. Baek.

224
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,190
重要的是心意 不是吗
It's the heart that matters. The heart.

225
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,360
多亏了你为他操心
Because of your moral support,

226
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,030
我家民赫才能顺利地完成进修回国
Minhyeok was able to finish his training without a hitch.

227
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,450
没错 全靠你为我费心 我才能学成归来
That's right. I was able to do well because of your care and attention.

228
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,870
白代表 这都是托你的福
Thanks to you, Mr. Baek.

229
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,250
好 就当是托我的福吧
Fine, I will take the credit then.

230
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,340
你看着他 心里一定很踏实吧
You must be so proud of Minhyeok.

231
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,710
是啊
Yes, I am.

232
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,170
我这么说不是因为他是我的儿子 但无论谁嫁给他
I don't say this because he's my son,

233
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,340
我这么说不是因为他是我的儿子 但无论谁嫁给他
but whoever marries him will be a lucky girl.

234
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,970
都是撞了大运
but whoever marries him will be a lucky girl.

235
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,020
爸 我现在还不想结婚
Dad, I'm not ready to get married yet.

236
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,890
我告诉过你 工作对我来说更重要
I told you work is more important to me.

237
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,730
我…
I will...

238
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:23,030
会在检察厅向着更高的地方前进
work for an even loftier purpose at the Prosecutor's Office.

239
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,110
这就是这家伙的问题所在
This is what worries me about him.

240
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,410
他得赶紧遇到一个好女孩 才能改变想法
I hope he meets a good woman so that he changes his mind.

241
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,160
没关系
There's nothing wrong with it.

242
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,950
他现在正是拼事业的时候
Now is the time to devote yourself to work.

243
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,210
什么
What?

244
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,750
不过一旦他有了喜欢的人 还是要让他马上结婚
Gosh. But I would marry him off as soon as he found anyone he liked.

245
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,630
我家玛丽…
My Mari...

246
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,550
我也得让她快点结婚 真让人担心
should find someone soon. I'm worried.

247
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,300
你不必为此担心
You don't need to worry about that!

248
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,060
什么
What?

249
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,520
玛丽会自己看着办的
Mari is very capable of taking care of herself.

250
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,320
不过我怎么没看到她呢
Where is she anyway?

251
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,740
玛丽是我的孙女 更应该凭实力进来
Mari is my granddaughter so she needs to come on her own merits.

252
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,610
我让她去别的地方了
I sent her somewhere.

253
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,030
哪里
Where?

254
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,630
搜索 人权
SEARCH: HUMAN RIGHTS

255
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,920
完成一行宾果
One bingo, one side.

256
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,550
怎么了 你看什么
What is it? What are you looking at?

257
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,180
我在工作
I'm working.

258
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,140
完成两行宾果
Two bingo, one side.

259
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,460
好 我们从案件概要开始吧
Good, let's start with the outline of the incident.

260
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,300
枫津泰银公寓的保安金万福
The incident occurred when the security guard Kim Manbok

261
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,880
刮伤了公寓业主千永裴的汽车 因此发生了这起案件
scratched the car of Cheon Yeongbae, a resident of Pungjin Taeeun Apartments.

262
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,260
错 不对
Nope, that's not it.

263
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,300
对于是否刮到 事实关系并不清楚
It's not clear whether it was scratched or not.

264
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,970
你怎么能确定刮到了呢
So, how can you be sure?

265
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,930
这正是我要说的
That's exactly what I'm saying.

266
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,770
到底有没有刮到 还没等我们确认事实关系
Whether it was scratched or not couldn't be determined,

267
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,270
千某就当着所有人的面
thanks to a certain Mr. Cheon so-and-so

268
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,690
推着手推车撞上去了
who crashed a wagon into the car in front of everyone.

269
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,690
对 就是这个
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

270
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,950
事实关系很明确
Those facts are crystal clear.

271
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,280
实习的时候办这种案件比较好
This is a great case for a probationary employee.

272
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,330
清晰的案件 很好
A clear-cut case, I like it.

273
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,870
你是为了我才撞上去的吗
So, you crashed it for me?

274
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,750
对 我是为了测试你是否有资格 来我们事务所实习
Sure. It is a test to see if you are qualified to join my practice.

275
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,670
才故意撞上去的 你很感激我吧
I crashed it on purpose. Aren't you grateful?

276
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,710
好 就当是这样吧
Let's say I am.

277
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,630
第一种解决方案是
First proposal,

278
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,260
支付五百万韩元 立即修好汽车
we pay five million won to get the car fixed right away.

279
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,470
真是的 如果我要自掏腰包修车的话
Well, if I was going to pay out of pocket,

280
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,430
还请你做我的律师干吗 对吧
I wouldn't have hired you as my lawyer. Don't you think so?

281
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:00,600
而且打死我也没那么多钱
And I don't have that kind of money.

282
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,890
-你一个律师连五百万韩元都没有吗 -我连五十万韩元也没有
-A lawyer doesn't have five million? -I don't even have 500,000.

283
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,940
你还挺自豪啊
-Are you proud of that? -I am. I have righteousness and integrity.

284
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,440
是挺自豪的 我很清正廉洁
-Are you proud of that? -I am. I have righteousness and integrity.

285
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,820
-你太幼稚了 -我很幼稚吗
-That's so immature. -Is it?

286
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,940
你干吗像小孩子一样幼稚
Why are you being so immature?

287
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,740
玛丽正在绞尽脑汁找办法呢
Mari is trying to find a solution.

288
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:15,030
你安静点 听她说吧
Be quiet, and let's listen to her.

289
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,740
请继续吧
Please continue.

290
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,580
第二种解决方案
Second proposal,

291
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,830
如果不能用金钱达成和解的话
if it can't be resolved with money,

292
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,370
那就要受到刑事处罚
he will be criminally prosecuted.

293
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,710
如果没有钱 那就得拘留 当然我说的是千某
If Mr. Cheon so-and-so doesn't pay up, he should serve time.

294
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,960
我也想那样 但我不能被拘留
I wish I could, but I can't.

295
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,550
这又是为什么 如果没有钱 那就用自由来交换
Why not? If you don't have money, you should pay with your time.

296
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,680
如果我进去了 你在哪里实习呢
If I go to prison, where would you get your training?

297
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,350
而且通常初犯不会被拘留
Besides, a first-time offender usually doesn't serve any time.

298
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,900
第三种
Third,

299
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,820
衷心祈祷有另一个 更疯狂的人去撞他的车
We should give a heartfelt prayer for someone even crazier to hit his car.

300
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:55,950
-长得真像 -眼睛长得很像
-That looks like her. -It's the eyes that look alike.

301
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,410
真有意思
That was funny.

302
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,620
干得不错
Nice try.

303
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,990
我让你寻找解决办法
I told you to find solutions,

304
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,410
但我看到的只有对指导律师的敌意
but all I see is animosity towards the mentoring lawyer.

305
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,460
玛丽 我很失望 你还有别的吗
Mari, this is disappointing. Don't you have anything else?

306
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,790
那么
Well then,

307
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,210
我还有最后一个解决方案
I do have the last suggestion.

308
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,880
我可以期待一下最后的解决方案吗
Can I expect your last suggestion to be any better?

309
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,380
前面的那些可不怎么样
Your earlier ones were not good.

310
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:17,930
当然
Of course.

311
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,390
你会很喜欢的
I think you'll like it very much.

312
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,520
是什么呢 是什么会让我很喜欢呢
What is it? What could be so good?

313
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,440
她走过来干吗
Why is she coming closer?

314
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,980
她把脸靠得这么近干吗
Why is she putting her face so close to mine?

315
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,490
你不知道社交距离限制还没有解除吗
Don't you know we still need to socially distance ourselves?

316
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,990
我把一千韩元还给你
I will give you your 1,000 won back.

317
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,000
真痛快
Damn. That felt good.

318
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,500
你要还给我吗 那实习呢
Giving it back? What about your training?

319
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,340
反正律师事务所这么多 实习嘛 我会看着办的
There are other law offices. I'll take care of myself.

320
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,430
你还是担心你自己吧
You should worry about yourself.

321
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,140
千永裴可不好对付
I don't think Cheon Yeongbae will go easy.

322
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,520
事务长 我们改天一起喝杯烧酒吧
Mr. Sa, let's get together for soju some time.

323
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,230
不要带自大的千某
Without the righteous Mr. Cheon so-and-so.

324
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,350
他应该要忙着处理这个案子
Mr. Cheon so-and-so will be busy working on this case.

325
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,440
-那么再见 -嗯 慢走
-Farewell. -Goodbye.

326
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,070
等一下 这可不行
Wait, that's not right.

327
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,070
你真是的 千律师 玛丽
Come on, Mr. Cheon. Mari!

328
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,650
你不想在这里实习了吗
Don't you want to be a probationary employee?

329
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,070
喂
Hey--

330
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,040
玛丽 喝点乳酸菌饮料
Have a yogurt drink, Mari.

331
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,750
干杯
Cheers.

332
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
家营超市
HOMERUN MART

333
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,550
玛丽 正如你所说 这种情况任谁看都会觉得荒唐
As you said, this doesn't make sense to anyone.

334
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,390
不管怎么想 我都觉得这件事我解决不了
I don't think it was something I could resolve.

335
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,560
而最重要的是 我感觉这里不适合我
Moreover, I don't think it's the right place for me.

336
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,520
当然还有很多更大更好的律师事务所
Of course, there are many law offices that are bigger and better.

337
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,900
但其他事务所 会像我们这样有这么多工作吗
But I wonder if other offices have as much work as we do.

338
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,860
我听说律师们希望能接各种案件
I heard lawyers want to see as many cases as they can.

339
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,900
确实是这样
That's true.

340
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,240
虽然千律师的行为看似鲁莽
Although it looks like Mr. Cheon acts recklessly,

341
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,950
但稀奇的是 到目前为止 他没有一件案件是解决不了的
oddly, there wasn't a single case he couldn't resolve so far.

342
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,700
那这次的事他也能解决吗
So, do you think he can resolve this case too?

343
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,920
虽然他有点讨人厌 但如果是他的话 应该可以
Sometimes it's hard to stand him, but he probably will.

344
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,750
天啊 他还真是讨人厌
Gosh. I really can't stand him.

345
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,420
但他撞车也太过分了
Still, he went too far by crashing into the car.

346
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,260
所以我曾经问过他
I... once asked him

347
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,510
为什么要做到这个地步
why he takes things so far.

348
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,230
我们有权在安全的情况下工作
We have the right to work without dying.

349
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:31,480
补充安全人员

355
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,760
千律师
Mr. Cheon!

356
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,260
-你还好吗 -你没事吧
-Are you okay? -Are you okay?

357
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,470
是 我没事
Yes, I'm fine.

358
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,020
你到底为什么要做到这个地步
Why are you doing this?

359
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,480
你是我的委托人啊
You are my client.

360
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,900
-血 -什么
-Blood. -What?

361
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,110
-血 -什么
-Blood. -What?

362
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,440
血
Blood.

363
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,980
血？
Blood?

364
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,740
你们这些家伙
You bastards!

365
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,240
-你们这些家伙 -别这样
-You bastards! -Don't do this!

366
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,950
-放开我 你们死定了 -别过去
-Let me go! You're all dead. -Don't do this!

367
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,790
补充安全人员
Recruit more safety personnel!

368
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,000
千律师说
Mr. Cheon says that

369
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,130
律师要替他的委托人战斗
a lawyer fights in their client's stead.

370
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,720
我不理解为什么律师要做到这种地步
I don't understand why a lawyer should go that far.

371
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,760
虽然我也不理解
I don't understand him either,

372
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,640
但我想这就是千律师吧
but I think that's who he is.

373
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,310
所以我决定就这样接受
So, I just decided to accept it.

374
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,190
千律师 你想怎么活就怎么活吧
"Mr. Cheon, do as you want."

375
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,280
随心所欲地活吧
"Live however you want."

376
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,160
玛丽 虽然你可能不会再来了
I'm not doing a good job convincing you.

377
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,700
但不管怎样 你再考虑一下吧
Anyway, please give it more thought.

378
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,990
肯定会有办法的
I'm sure there is a way.

379
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,200
我没办法给你确切的答复 抱歉
I can't promise you anything. I'm sorry.

380
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,580
谢谢你的饮料 我走了
Thanks for the drink. I'm off.

381
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,710
白实习 你懂我的心吧
Ms. Baek, you know how I feel, right?

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,300
我还不是实习生
I'm not a probationary employee yet.

383
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,340
在我的心里 你已经是了
To me, you already are.

384
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,050
白实习 爱你哟
Ms. Baek, I love you!

385
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,240
很好
That's good.

386
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,240
爷爷
Grandpa.

387
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,280
嗯 你来啦
Look, my Mari is here.

388
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,570
很累吧
Was it hard?

389
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,740
当然了 可是你让我去那里的
Of course, it was, thanks to you.

390
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,420
你应该饿了 快去坐下
I'm sure you're hungry. Grab a seat.

391
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,380
实习工作还做得惯吗
Ah.

392
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,470
实习工作还做得惯吗
So, how is the training going?

393
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,260
-我刚刚辞职不干了 -什么
-I just quit. -What?

394
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,720
他说我得通过测试才会接受我
He said he'll accept me if I pass the test.

395
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,180
所以我就辞职了
So, I just called it quits.

396
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,390
是什么样的测试
What kind of test was it?

397
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,400
就是有一个测试
I can't explain it.

398
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,980
恐怕你去了也解决不了
Even you couldn't have solved it, Grandpa.

399
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,280
是吗
Is that so?

400
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,690
那可真是…
That's really...

401
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,610
你笑什么
Why are you laughing?

402
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,910
我想让你去那里是对的
I think I sent you to the right place.

403
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,950
才不是 那个地方真的很奇怪
Not the right place, but a really strange place.

404
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,000
真该让你看到那个场面
You should have seen it, Grandpa.

405
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,830
玛丽
Mari.

406
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,460
我听说
I hear he thinks

407
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,550
他和我们的答案不同
differently from people like us.

408
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,310
对他来说 一加一不等于二
To him, one plus one isn't necessarily two.

409
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,930
你听谁说的
Who told you that?

410
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,600
从我朋友那里
Who? From a friend.

411
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:05,570
所以你才会觉得他奇怪
That is probably why you thought he was strange.

412
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,990
你在庭审时也看到了
You saw him during the trial.

413
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,320
他是怎么赢你的
Think about how he beat you.

414
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,370
他身上
I am sure...

415
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,910
肯定有值得你学习的地方
you can learn from him.

416
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,080
没有
I don't have anything.

417
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,750
没有？
Nothing?

418
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,630
那当时你连想都没想就撞上去了吗
Then you crashed into the car without any plans?

419
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,300
我本来以为白玛丽能解决 但她没有解决 就这么走了
I thought Ms. Baek could take care of it. But she quit without doing that.

420
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,670
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

421
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,510
就是说你把你也解决不了的事 交给玛丽了吗
You gave Mari something even you can't resolve?

422
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,260
我能解决 只要我思考一下 就能想到解决办法
I can resolve it because I will get an idea if I think about it.

423
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,350
是吗 是什么
Yeah? What is it?

424
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,480
我们…
Shall we...

425
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,110
先等玛丽回来吧
wait until Mari comes back?

426
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,950
总之如果玛丽不回来 你就等着瞧吧
See what happens if Mari doesn't come back.

427
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,910
如果她不回来 我也不来了
If she doesn't, I won't come back either!

428
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,910
明天见
See you tomorrow.

429
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,330
我知道了
Okay.

430
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,830
她会回来的
She will be back.

民赫哥 你有时间吗
Minhyeok, are you busy?

455
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,380
我有件事要问你
I have something to ask you too.

456
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,880
玛丽 你也想我了啊
Mari, you missed me too.

457
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,090
你肯定会想我
Of course, you did.

458
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,340
我们进展得比我想象中要快
Things are moving faster than I expected.

459

唉唷 这颗钻石好耀眼
Oh, my eyes!

460
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,010
唉唷 这颗钻石好耀眼
A diamond!

461
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,640
深海中的钻石
A diamond from the deep sea

462
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,730
勇敢地滑翔
Bravely slidin'

463
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,890
是 客人？
Yes, customer?

464
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,230
-我在朝她挥手 -这样啊
-I was waving to her. -I see.

465
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,150
我在这里
Over here.

466
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,150
民赫哥 你真的一点都没变
Minhyeok, you haven't changed a bit.

467
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,160
我们都两年没见了
I think it's been two years.

468
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,660
因为我对你的心意没有改变
It's because my love for you hasn't changed.

469
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,670
成为我的人吧 我想拥有你
Be mine. I want you.

470
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,380
民赫哥
Minhyeok.

471
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,010
我还是老样子吗 是吗
You said I look the same? Do I?

472
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,930
不过你怎么知道我回来了
How did you know I was back?

473
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,520
爷爷告诉我的
Grandpa told me.

474
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,150
我怕你忙 所以本想晚点联系你
I figured you were busy so I was going to call you later.

475
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,480
-民赫哥 -怎么了
-Minhyeok. -Yes?

476
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:15,980
你认识千智勋检察官吧
Did you know Prosecutor Cheon Jihun?

477
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,190
智勋？你是说那个智勋吗
Jihun? Do you mean that Jihun?

478
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,450
嗯 听说你们一起工作过
Yes. Didn't you work with him?

479
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,820
你怎么突然提起那家伙了
Why do you bring that jerk up?

480
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,660
-那家伙？-我们以前很熟
-That jerk? -We were close.

481
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,250
自从他辞职不干检察官 我已经很久没见过他了
I haven't seen him since he left the Prosecutors' Office.

482
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,580
他又闯祸了 是吧
Did he cause trouble again?

483
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,080
他那时候也闯祸吗
Was he a troublemaker too then?

484
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,080
别提了 小心点 别跟他扯上关系
Don't even start. Be careful, don't get involved.

485
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,670
爷爷让我在那里实习
Grandpa wants me to get trained there.

486
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,630
天啊 那家伙完全是个人渣
He's totally trash.

487
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,760
-什么 -你去那里的话 会很辛苦
-What? -You will struggle if you go there.

488
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,100
等一下 我给你介绍其他地方
Hold on, let me find you another place.

489
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,260
没关系
That's okay.

490
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,680
我觉得有关系 你会很累
It's not okay with me. You'll have a hard time.

491
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,310
算了 没关系 我自己会处理
It's really okay. I'm fine. I will take care of myself.

492
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,270
我和别人约好了
I have a promise to keep.

493
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,610
是吗 那你需要帮忙的话 就告诉我
Is that right? Then tell me if you need anything.

494
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,820
好 我该走了
I will. I should get going.

495
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,990
嗯 快去吧
Okay, be on your way.

496
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:03,990
你说什么 等一下
What? Wait a minute.

497
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,160
玛丽 我们时隔两年才见面
Mari, we've seen each other in two years.

498
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,330
你没有什么问题要问我吗
Don't you have any questions for me?

499
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,080
没有啊
Not really.

500
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,420
也是 毕竟我们每天都联系
I guess it's because we talked to each other regularly.

501
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:17,000
-我会再联系你 -好 随时欢迎
-Right. I'll call you. -Sure, any time.

502
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,090
再见
Bye.

503
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,630
真是的
Shoot.

504
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,690
我认识的人说…
This person I know said...

505
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,900
-怎么了 -唉唷 吓死我了
-What is it? -Geez! You shocked me.

506
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,280
-怎么了 -是赵女士
-Why? -It's Ms. Cho.

507
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,280
那里…
There's that...

508
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,030
你看 办公室干净了 她就总是来
See what I mean?

509
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,740
你看 办公室干净了 她就总是来
She keeps coming because the office is clean.

510
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,540
她收拾那么干净干吗
Why'd she have to clean up?

511
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,750
她是来收房租的吗
Is she here for the rent?

512
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,210
对了 你上次不是去做探监兼职了嘛
Hey. You did that part-time visitor job.

513
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,880
给我吧
Give it up.

514
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,220
喂 英淑 你别站在那里晃得我头晕 坐下吧
Yeongsuk, don't just stand there. Have a seat.

515
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,720
姐 我站着是因为我腰疼
Eulrye. I'm standing because my back hurts.

516
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,890
气氛怎么这样
Something feels different.

517
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,560
所以说年龄是藏不住的
I know, you can't hide your age.

518
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,940
怎么会呢 我还以为你们只比我大几岁
I thought you were only a few years older than me.

519
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,860
真的吗 天啊
Really? Oh, my.

520
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,240
你们来啦
You're back.

521
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,240
千律师来啦
Mr. Cheon, you here?

522
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,410
你好 赵女士
Hello, Ms. Cho.

523
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,460
我这次试着想办法筹钱
I tried to come up with some money this time.

524
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,590
但那笔钱太臭了
But that money smelled so foul.

525
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,710
我知道 就是说 你没筹到钱交房租 对吧
I understand. You're saying you don't have the rent, right?

526
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,180
你遇到什么开心的事了吗
Something got you in a good mood?

527
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,390
你说你是实习律师 是吧
Probationary employee, was it? You sure hired a good one.

528
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,600
你真是雇了个好员工
Probationary employee, was it? You sure hired a good one.

529
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,270
我今天看在这姑娘的面子上 就这么算了
I'm giving you more time because of this young lady.

530
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,770
你是怎么雇到 这么善良又漂亮的实习生的
Where did you find a probationary worker so sweet and pretty?

531
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,980
走吧 我们还得干活
Let's go back to work.

532
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,940
我们走吧
Let's go.

533
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,320
你必须在下个月之前筹到钱
You have to pay by next month.

534
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,110
-好 -谢谢你的茶
-Yes. -Thanks for the tea.

535
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,530
我会再来的
I'll be back.

536
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,410
好 下次再来玩
Yes. Come back again.

537
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
慢走
Take care.

538
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,910
她怎么心情这么好
Why is she in such a good mood?

539
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,790
白实习一定很亲切和气 才会让赵女士笑个不停
Ms. Baek must've been so nice that Ms. Cho can't stop smiling like that.

540
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,920
你不是说不来了吗 怎么又来了
I thought you weren't coming back. Why are you here?

541
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,920
因为事务长
Because of Mr. Sa.

542
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,550
我很高兴你回来
I'm glad you're back.

543
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,180
对了
Oh.

544
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,390
这钱给你
Here you go.

545
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,600
收下吧
Take it.

546
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,730
拜托你了
I'm in your care.

547
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,330
打扰一下
Excuse me.

548
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,660
请问这里是千智勋律师事务所吗
Is this the law office of Attorney Cheon Jihun?

549
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,790
对 你有什么事吗
Yes, it is. How can we help you?

550
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,420
金泰坤
Mr. Kim Taegon.

551
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,960
我就是…
Let me...

552
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,640
玛丽 你靠边站
Mari, you need to step aside.

553
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,350
你还不是实习生呢
You're not hired yet.

554
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,270
很高兴认识你 我是千智勋
Nice to meet you, I'm Cheon Jihun.

555
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,020
事情是
So,

556
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,940
我的雇主…
there is a person I work for.

557
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,990
喝杯水吧
Here's a glass of water.

558
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,110
你就当我们都站在你这边 放心说吧
Consider all of us on your side and speak freely.

559
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:39,450
我是一名司机
I work as a driver.

560
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,420
儿童保护区
CHILDREN SAFETY ZONE

561
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,130
他的性子很急
He has such a temper.

562
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,800
只要我稍微开慢一点 他就会朝我扔水瓶
He throws water bottles at me if I drive slowly even a bit.

563
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,560
只要他一不顺心 就会发火
He gets worked up if he's not happy.

564
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,150
他践踏别人是常事
He walks all over me every day.

565
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,110
尽管我努力想要做好
I try my best to do well.

566
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,530
但每当公司发生事情的时候 他就会找茬
But when something goes wrong at the office,

567
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,820
但每当公司发生事情的时候 他就会找茬
he will find any reason to take it out on me.

568
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,280
拿我出气
he will find any reason to take it out on me.

569
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,910
虽然这样的事情有很多
There are so many instances,

570
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,080
但最让我难以忍受的是
but the hardest thing to cope is

571
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,040
他威胁我说
the way he threatens me...

572
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,800
要让我失业
to keep me out of work.

573
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
他朝你扔水瓶是无可辩驳的暴力行为
Throwing a bottle at you is clear-cut battery.

574
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,140
而且如果他在你开车时 朝你的后脑勺扔的话
If he threw it at the back of your head while you were driving,

575
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,760
我们还可以告他使用特殊暴力
we can charge him with special violence.

576
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,930
针对特殊暴力 即使受害人同意和解 加害人也会受到刑事处罚
It is subject to criminal punishment even if the victim settles.

577
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,980
你有没有受伤
Were you hurt anywhere?

578
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,400
这种程度没关系
Oh, this is nothing.

579
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,150
不过你还是去开一份诊断书吧
Either way, let's get a doctor's note.

580
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,030
能用的子弹越多越好
It is best to have as much ammo as we can.

581
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,150
如果情况属实 我想我们可以直接起诉
If this is true, I think we can proceed with a lawsuit.

582
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,200
即便如此 我们也不能仓促起诉
But we shouldn't rush into a lawsuit.

583
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,910
他的被害事实明确 当然要起诉
It's clear that he was victimized. Of course, we have to sue him.

584
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,080
可就算起诉 最多也只能判他罚款或缓刑
But the most that can come out of a suit will be a fine or probation.

585
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,840
那种人会把这放在眼里吗
That won't even phase that kind of person. Hmm.

586
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,590
这只会让金泰坤的处境更艰难
And that will put Mr. Kim Taegon in a tough position.

587
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,050
对 我觉得起诉有点…
I agree. A lawsuit will be rather...

588
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,720
金泰坤 你希望我们怎么帮你
Mr. Kim Taegon, how can we help you?

589
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,140
你不想再被侮辱
You don't want to be treated badly,

590
00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:24,430
但还想继续工作 对吧
but you want to keep working. Am I right?

591
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,350
对 我确实想这样
Yes. That would be ideal.

592
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
但是
But...

593
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,650
这可能吗
would it be possible?

594
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,480
可能 这可是我们事务所的专长
It is. That is our specialty.

595
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,950
千律师很擅长解决这种问题
Mr. Cheon is an expert on these sorts of issues.

596
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,070
法律离我们很远 但拳头离我们很近
The law is far but the fist is near!

597
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
他的意思是握紧拳头喊声加油
You make a fist to cheer like this, and say "Let's go!"

598
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,120
然后充满干劲地开始工作
You make a fist to cheer like this, and say "Let's go!"

599

607
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,100
请稍等
Just a moment.

608
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,730

不过他对校友倒是挺宽容的

Mr. Cheon Yeongbae!

698
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,360
不管我怎么想都觉得生气 所以就来了
I came because I just couldn't take it anymore even thinking about it.

699
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,270

00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,950
到底是有多生气
It's so infuriating

703
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,660
才会让我的实习生 忍不住火气找到这里来
that my probationary employee had to come in person.

704
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,410
是吧 玛丽 你很生气吗
Isn't that right, Mari? Are you very angry?

705

你来找我的原因
The reason you came

708
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,750
是为了合起伙来耍我吗
was so that the two of you could mock me?

709
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
什么 怎么会呢 我…
Mock you? I was just--

710
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,840
玛丽 你忍一忍
Stand back, Mari.

711
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,380

712
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,930
-我… -玛丽 你忍一忍
-So I was just-- -Stand back, Mari.

713
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,430
这是男人之间的事
This is between men.

714
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,640
你这是干吗啊
Why are you doing this?

715
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,520
当初
In the first place!

716
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,690
如果你没有污蔑金万福刮伤你的车
Had you not falsely accused Mr. Kim Manbok for scratching your car,

717
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,730
我就不必找到这里来 对不对 玛丽
I wouldn't have to come all the way here. Isn't that right, Mari?

718
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,730
什么
What?

719
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,570
是啊 好
I see. Okay.

720
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:32,570
那老头没刮伤我的车
That old man didn't scratch my car.

721
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,280
我仔细一想
I thought about it long and hard.

722
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,620
那道划痕 是我在别的地方刮的 我搞错了
I think I mistook a scratch from some other place.

723
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,330
什么
What?

724
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,000
你搞错了？
You were mistaken?

725
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,040
不过不管是不是我搞错了 你们有证据吗
Whether it was a mistake or not, I wonder if there is proof.

726
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,540
我试探了几句
When I raised my voice a little,

727
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,880
金万福那老头就看起来要承认了
that old man seemed to agree with me.

728
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,220
对
You're right.

729
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,680
没有证据
There is no proof.

730
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,390
但是你不应该这样做
But you shouldn't do this.

731
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,890
那你能怎么办呢
But what are you gonna do?

732
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,730
所有人都看到你撞我的车了
Everyone saw you crash the wagon into my car.

733
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,570
该怎么办呢
What should I do about...

734
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,650
抱歉
I'm sorry.

735
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,030

你说过让我和你的律师谈
You told me to talk to your lawyer.

738
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:19,830
说吧 你打算怎么解决
So tell me, how will you resolve this?

739
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,500
好 那个…
Well...

740
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,790

745
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,920
你说完 我们再相亲
Tell me what you're going to do.

746
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,470
前…
Mr...

747
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,720
前辈个屁 前辈就该有前辈的样子
Forget that we went to the same school!

748
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,310
别给学校抹黑
You're an embarrassment to our alma mater!

749
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,310
都是因为你污蔑别人刮伤你的车
This whole mess is your fault for falsely accusing someone

750
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,440
才会挑起这场事端 你这家伙
for scratching your car, man!

751
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,650
-该死 -搞什么鬼
-Damn it! -What the heck?

752
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,690
她在说什么 你是我的学妹吗
What is she saying? We went to the same school?

753
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,780
你竟敢那样跟我说话
How dare you talk to me like that?

754
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,030
-喂 -她…是
-Hey! -She is... Yes?

755
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,330
-我要告你们两个 -好
-You two, get ready to be sued. -Yeah.

756
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,830
你们得尝尝被告的滋味
You need to be sued.

757
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,910
千永裴
Mr. Cheon Yeongbae,

758
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,830
你告我们吧
go ahead and sue us.

759
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,710
我的律师有多么厉害
You'll find out how amazing...

760
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,300
你会知道的
my lawyer is.

761
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,810
玛丽 等一下
Mari, wait a minute.

762
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,190
就算你再怎么生气 也不能发这么大火啊 是吧
Even if you were mad, you totally lost your cool.

763
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,570
够了 你来这里干什么
I don't care. Why are you here?

764
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,280
我吗 还能干什么 我和你一样…
Why do you think? Because of the same reason as you--

765
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,490
玛丽
Mari.

766
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,540
你来这里的原因究竟是什么呢
What was the reason you were here for?

767
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,830
千律师说
Mr. Cheon says that

768
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:53,000
律师要替他的委托人战斗
a lawyer fights in their client's stead.

769
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:58,090
好 我知道了 如果你处理不了就告诉我
It's okay. Tell me if you can't.

770
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,470
我可以替你解决
I can do it instead.

771
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:05,720
我也能战斗 我来处理
I can fight too. I'll do it.

772
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,900
来 建宇
All right, Gunwoo.

773
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,700
吃饭吧
Let's eat.

774
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,660
给
Here.

775
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,870
他是坏人吧
Isn't he a bad guy?

776
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,620
爷爷 他欺负你啊
He's giving you a hard time.

777
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,420
没错
Yes.

778
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,920
他是坏人
He's a bad guy.

779
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,460
你好
You're here.

780
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,500
姐姐
Mari.

781
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,550
等一下
Wait.

782
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,390
我想把这个给你
I wanted to give you this.

783
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,010
什么
Excuse me?

784
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,520
我心里实在是过意不去
I don't feel comfortable.

785
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,180
如果我早点赔偿的话 就不会发生这种事了
If I had paid for the damages, things wouldn't have gone this far.

786
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,270
我四处筹到些钱
I got the money from here and there.

787
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,230
虽然不够 但请拿这些钱去解决吧
It's not enough, but resolve it with this money.

788
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,980
姐姐 这是我给你的
Mari. This is from me.

789
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:03,950
我有这个就够了
This is more than enough.

790
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,880
所有的保安都讨厌他
All of the security guards hate him.

791
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,550
也赔过他不少钱
We ended up paying him a hefty sum as well.

792
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,890
所有人都不愿意来这个岗亭工作
Nobody wants to work here.

793
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,770
所以我这个老头才能在这里工作
That's why an old man like me can work here.

794
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,390
从某个角度来说 也多亏了他
So in some ways, I work here thanks to that person.

795
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,900
你打算一直被他刁难 还要忍着他吗
But you have to put up with so much.

796
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,440
唉唷 赚钱哪有那么容易
Goodness. It's not easy to make money.

797
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,270
这点委屈当然要忍受
That much trouble is expected.

798
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:43,530
不过我还是挺喜欢这里的
I liked working here.

799
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,030
有很多好人 我也越来越喜欢他们了
There are nice residents here and I grew attached to them.

800
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,290
爷爷
Grandpa!

801
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,590
嗯 建宇
Hey, Gunwoo!

802
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,360
姐姐
Mari!

803
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,780
你不喜欢棒棒糖吗
Don't you like lollipops?

804
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,990
我不是不喜欢
It's not that I don't like them, but...

805
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,620
给你
Here you go.

806
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:40,210
这也是糖吗
Is this candy too?

807
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,800
这是我喜欢的糖 你尝尝看
It's something I like. Try it.

808
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,630
不过怎么这么贵
Why is it so expensive?

809
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,010
你得尝点好东西 才会萌生想要成功的念头
You need to taste nice things so you get the drive to succeed.

810
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,640
并对你爷爷尽孝
And be good to your grandpa.

811
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,980
我现在才七岁
I'm only seven years old.

812
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,650
成功是没有年龄限制的
There's no age limit to success.

813
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,280
-明白了吧 -明白了
-You got that? -Okay.

814
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,860
不过这笔钱够我和爷爷奶奶 好好吃一顿五花肉了
But with this money, Grandpa, Grandma, and I can have tons of pork belly.

815
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,240
给你 这是牛肉
Here. It's beef.

816
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:14,620
和爷爷奶奶烤着吃吧
Have it with your grandparents.

817
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,540
我该怎么跟奶奶说呢
What do I tell Grandma?

818
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,330
你就说这是律师姐姐给的
Tell her it's from the lawyer lady.

819
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:20,250
让她不要担心 振作起来
Tell her not to worry and cheer up.

820
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,250
谢谢你
Thank you.

821
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,300
回去吧
Go home.

822
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:28,430
姐姐
Mari.

823
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,060
好
Okay.

824
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,520
我要疯了
I'm losing it.

825
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:51,820
你在智勋的事务所实习？
You're training at Jihun's office?

826
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,160
-是的 -为什么
-Yes. -Why?

827
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,330
我不该问为什么吗
Maybe I shouldn't ask why.

828
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,170
是啊 这主意不错
Either way, it's not a bad idea.

829
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,130
既然要学 跟着智勋学挺好的
It will be good to learn from Jihun.

830
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,420
好像不是这样吧
I don't know about that.

831
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:10,590
他当检察官的时候也这么鲁莽吗
Was he that reckless as a prosecutor too?

832
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,390
他又闯祸了吗
Did he cause trouble again?

833
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,060
真是一模一样
It's the same.

834
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,850
-一模一样 -什么
-You ask that too. -What's the same?

835
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,180
民赫哥也先问他是不是闯祸了
Minhyeok asked if he caused trouble too.

836
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,810
他检察官时期的故事太多了
There are too many stories about Jihun as a prosecutor.

837
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,480
我以后再告诉你 有趣的事太多了
I'll tell you later. There are some fun stories.

838
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,320
所以他又闯什么祸了
So, what did he do this time?

839
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,450
是这样的
So...

840
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,080
什么 撞别人的车？
What? He crashed into a car?

841
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,450
天啊 确实是他的作风
Wow, that's so like Jihun.

842
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,410
你觉得我能解决吗
Do you think I can resolve it?

843
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,830
先解决撞车的事
Take care of the car damages,

844
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,750
再帮建宇爷爷保住工作
let Gunwoo's grandfather keep his job,

845
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,130
让那家伙不能再欺负他不就行了吗
and stop the guy harassing him. Isn't it all you have to do?

846
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,470
还挺有意思的
That sounds fun.

847
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,300
-前辈 -干吗
-Yejin. -What?

848
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,680
好吧
Okay, fine.

849
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,600
就算我把撞车的事解决了
Let's say I somehow take care of the car damages.

850
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:01,140
那种人能在一夜之间改变吗 他这辈子都是这么活过来的
But how can he change overnight? He lived like that all his life.

851
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,350
让他重新做人不就行了
Make a new man out of him then.

852
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,770
-什么 -很简单
-What? -It's simple.

853
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,820
千永裴改过自新计划
The Cheon Yeongbae Reform Project.

854
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,030
白玛丽
Baek Mari.

855
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:14,620
你不要想得太复杂 否则简单的事也会变得复杂
Don't think too hard about it. It only complicates things.

856
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,450
改过自新计划？
A reform project?

857
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,580
千智勋律师 你在哪
ATTORNEY CHEON JIHUN WHERE ARE YOU

858
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,530
你找我干吗
Why did you call me?

859
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,650
你来啦
You're here.

860
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,620
怎么样 你想到解决办法了吗
Have you come up with a solution?

861
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,780
我还在想
I'm still thinking.

862
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,120
你叫我过来就是为了这个吗
Is that why you called me?

863
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,250
事务长说
Mr. Sa told me

864
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,750
到目前为止 你没有一件案件是解决不了的
that there wasn't a single case you weren't able to resolve.

865
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,880
换做你的话 这个案子也能解决吧
You can resolve this case too, right?

866
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,890
当然 不过总听别人夸我 我都听腻了
Yes. But I'm getting tired of the praise.

867
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,510
我现在很认真
I'm being serious.

868
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:23,730
玛丽 解决事情的方式
Mari, there are many ways

869
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,270
有很多种
to resolve a case.

870
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,440
有些人会用一个简单的道歉
Some people will try to cover it up

871
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,900
来平息事端
with a simple apology.

872
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,370
也有些人只尝试用法律来解决问题
Some people will try to deal with it only using the law.

873
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,540
但来找我们的人并不是来了解法律的
But the people don't come to us to learn about the law.

874
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,870
而是来寻求帮助的
They come because they need help.

875
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:54,720
与其抱着律师就必须用法律 来解决问题的想法
Instead of thinking that a lawyer must use the law,

876
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,220
我希望你想一想
I want you to think

877
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:01,810
你能实现的最理想的办法
about the most ideal way that you are comfortable with.

878
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,810
这是我给你的作业
That's my homework for you.

879
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:14,570
该死
Shoot.

880
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,210
你明白我的意思吧
Did you understand what I meant?

881
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:30,790
是的
Yes.

882
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,800
律师事务所 二楼
OFFICE OF LAW, 2F

883
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,380
明天见
See you tomorrow.

884
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,440
你来啦
Oh, you're here.

885
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,400
玛丽 你来得真早啊
Mari, you're here early.

886
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:50,730
早上好
Good morning.

887
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,150
我想到了一个主意
I had an idea.

888
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,190
主意？
An idea?

889
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,780
你找到解决办法了吗
Did you find the solution?

890
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,240
应该是吧
Hmm. Probably.

891
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,240
虽然我不知道这个办法对不对
But I'm not sure if it's the right way.

892
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:04,240
事务长 你能帮我吗
Mr. Sa, can you help me?

893
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,200
我吗
Me?

894
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:15,550
毛会长 你这么喜欢玩宾果游戏吗
Chairman, why do you like bingo so much?

895
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,300
我玩这个是因为喜欢吗
I don't play it because I like it.

896
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,510
是你说只有我赢了 你才接我的案子
You said you'd take my case if I beat you.

897
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:22,260
所以我不是说你当初要活得善良点嘛
I told you to live an honest life to begin with.

898
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,800
我以后会活得很善良
I will from now on.

899
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,810
真的吗
Really?

900
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,770
嗯 你看着吧
Yes. Watch me.

901
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:32,230
17
Seventeen.

902
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,490
当日

903
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,330
今天就到时间了
Today is D-Day.

904
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,540
你们死定了
They're both dead.

905
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,250
这些人在干吗 发生什么事了吗
What are they doing here? Did something happen?

906
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,460
千永裴专务
Mr. Cheon Yeongbae!

907
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,050
有人向电视台爆料
Someone gave the station a tip.

908
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,550
爆料？
A tip?

909
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,470
-你怎么会这样做 -这是真的吗

你竟敢在背后捅我一刀
How dare you stab me in the back?

914
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,980
修理费太贵了 所以我很担心
I was so worried about the repair cost.

915

但车主反而说 他把车停错了地方 是他的错

940
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,560
没错 贵族义务
That's right, "Noblesse Oblige."

941
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:36,690
不错嘛
This is great.

942
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,860
我对车明集团改变看法了
I VIEW THE CHAMYEONG GROUP DIFFERENTLY NOW

943
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,070
让我想想
Let's see.

944
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,110
我以后得活得善良点吗
Do I have to be good from now on? Hmm?

945
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,320
不可能 凭什么
No way. Why should I?

946
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,700

Why didn't you tell me today was the chairman's trial?

952
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,090
他不让任何人去 因为这样显得不好
He didn't want anyone to come because it didn't look good.

953
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,050

我怎么能忘记你呢 我们的关系可不一般

00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,420
我又不能把那笔钱带进坟墓
It's not like I can take that money to my grave with me.

989

点一样就行
Just order one.

1016
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,300

毛会长 他们是车明建设的员工

00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,320
严格来说 这不是你亲自所为
Technically speaking, you didn't do it personally.

1035
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,360
而是你的下属
But one of your deputies,

1036
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,950
千永裴专务干的
Executive Director Cheon Yeongbae did.

1037
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,830
你这混…
You jerk--

1038
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,670
-不是那样的… -闭嘴 安静点
-What happened was-- -Shut up. Be quiet.

1039
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:52,250

1040
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,050
对不起
I'm sorry.

1041
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,220
千律师 你想要什么

向他们郑重道歉 并给予合理的补偿
A sincere apology, a just compensation,

1043
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:02,470
还有制定防止 再次发生类似事件的对策
and preventative measures to ensure it doesn't happen again.

1044
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:05,140
又不是我干的 你却让我补偿他们
Do I have to pay for something I didn't do?

1045
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:07,640
对 我完全理解你
Yes. I completely understand.

1046
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:10,400
这不是你干的
This is not something you did personally.

1047
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,230
却让你满足他们的所有要求 可能会让你觉得不公平
It may feel unfair to you to meet all of their demands.

1048
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,110
所以我有一个提议
So, I will propose something.

我们就撤回所有要求 干脆利落地走人

但如果我赢了

你就必须满足他们的所有要求

1057

Let's play.

1062
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,400
-去准备吧 -是
-Get it ready -Yes, sir.

1063
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,730
你疯了 你是不是疯了
You're crazy. Are you crazy?

1064
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,530
-怎么了 -宾果游戏？这像话吗
-Why? -Bingo? Does that make any sense?

1065
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,450
你说他是替委托人战斗的律师
You said he fights in his client's stead.

1066
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,960
还说这是他的理念
You said that was this lawyer's philosophy.

1067
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,210
替委托人战斗确实是我的理念
Fighting for the client is my philosophy. That is correct.

1068
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:17,880
这种理念与宾果游戏有什么关系
What does that philosophy have anything to do with bingo?

1069
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:19,510
白玛丽
Mari,

1070
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,550
如果我们拿着这里的所有资料 把他们告上法庭会怎么样
what will happen if we take all of these cases to court?

1071
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,470
我们判断清楚这属于民事案件
You have to decide carefully whether it's a civil or a criminal case.

1072
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,760
还是刑事案件后 就去战斗啊
You have to decide carefully whether it's a civil or a criminal case.

1073
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:27,930
还是刑事案件后 就去战斗啊
Then fight it out.

1074
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,350
如果我们去战斗 总有一天会赢
We may eventually win if we fight.

1075
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:33,520
可那一天具体是什么时候呢
But when exactly is that?

1076
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,690
什么
What?

1077
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:37,270
他们会更换律师 并以各种借口进行二审
They will change lawyers and make excuses to go to second trial,

1078
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,280
这样又会浪费几个月
wasting a few months.

1079
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,530
那在这期间 这里的职员都在做什么呢
What will these people be doing in the meantime?

1080
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,700
他们应该在上班吧
They will be working at this company.

1081
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,700
在谁的手底下呢
Under who?

1082
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:51,500
就在千永裴专务的手底下
Under Executive Director Cheon Yeongbae.

1083
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,210
可是如果你输了游戏怎么办
But what if you lose the game?

1084
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,380
你把这么重要的事情交给运气吗
Why would you leave something this important to luck?

1085
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:06,430
如果我看人的眼光没错的话 那就不是靠运气
If I am a good judge of character, it won't be just luck.

1086
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,390
宾果游戏的技巧
"The Skills of Bingo."

1087
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,350
好
Let's do this!

1088
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:17,940
好
Let's do this!

1089
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,990
没错 很好
That's right, let's do this.

1090
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:29,410
毛会长 你不能被他的奸诈之言所骗
Chairman, you shouldn't fall for his wicked tongue.

1091
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,740
我知道
I know.

1092
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,450
所以不要理他…
So, ignore him--

1093
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:33,830
所以
So,

1094
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:36,540
如果你没有做错事 我们根本不会走到这一步
if you didn't screw up, we wouldn't be here at all.

1095
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:37,540
难道不是吗
Am I wrong?

1096
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,710
对不起
I'm sorry.

1097
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,800
把我送进牢房的人就是千律师
Attorney Cheon is the one who sent me to jail.

1098
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:44,420
-什么 -他当时是检察官
-What? -He was the prosecutor then.

1099
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,640
总之他十分厉害
He was relentless.

1100
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,600
我没有信心在法庭上赢他
I have no confidence to win against him in court.

1101
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,730
事情搞成这样不是因为你的错吗
We are doing this because you messed up.

1102
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,060
你能赢他吧
You can win, can't you?

1103
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:56,650
能
Yes.

1104
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,440
我可是千永裴
I am Cheon Yeongbae.

1105
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,730
千万的千 永远的永 代表朴素的裴
Cheon for sky, Yeong for clear Bae for multiples.

1106
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:03,990
我会赌上我的姓名打败他
I will do my name proud and beat him.

1107
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,410
如果逃避不了 那就享受吧
If you can't avoid it, enjoy it!

1108
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,710
关乎命运的宾果游戏时间到了
Time for Bingo of Fate!

1109
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:23,840
好 蓝色的贵宾犬代表千智勋律师

1113

先连成线的人获胜

1115
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:49,700
千永裴专务 请选择喊数字的人

1125
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:30,780
喊数字的人看不到板子上的数字
The number callers can't see the numbers on the board,

1126
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,030
你们随机喊出 1到25之间的数字就可以
and will call out random numbers between 1 and 25.

1127
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:45,500
关乎命运的宾果游戏现在开始

1132
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,180

1133
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,390
10
Ten.

1134
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:01,600
21

看到了吧 再有一个数 你们就死了
Did you see? One more and you're all dead.

1145
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,770
千永裴 我也对你说一句吧
Mr. Cheon Yeongbae, allow me to say something.

1146
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:48,400
专务是一个让你承担责任的职位
An executive director is one who takes responsibilities,

1147
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:50,990
而不是让你折磨下属的
not someone who torments those who work under him.

1148
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,410
你利用专务的职务之便
Using your position as an executive director

1149
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:56,910
折磨下属
to bully your subordinates

1150
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:00,040
这显然是违法的
is clearly against the law.

1151
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,500
不是吗 玛丽
Isn't that right, Mari?

1152
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:06,130
什么
What?

1153
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,840
怎么了
What?

1154
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,090
《劳动基准法》第76条第2项规定
Article 76, Section 2 of the Labor Standards Act.

1155
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,090
雇用者或劳动者
"Employers or workers must not use

1156
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,680
不得利用职场地位或关系等优势
their superior position or relationship

1157
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,140
超出适当的工作范围
to inflict physical or mental pain on other workers

1158
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:19,930
给其他劳动者带来 身体或精神上的痛苦

or to aggravate the working environment

1160
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,640
或使工作环境恶化
beyond the proper scope for work."

1161
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,530
可是七 六 二之中 是哪一个呢
Between seven, six, and two, which one is it?

1162
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,490
干吗呢 快说数字
What are you waiting for? Call the number!

1163
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,370
七 六 二
Seven, six, two...

1164
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,040
二？
Two?

1165
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,710
拦住了
He blocked it.

1166
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:50,090
太棒了
That's good.

1167
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,340
-六 -该死
-Six. -Darn.

1168
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:57,390
毛会长
Chairman.

1169
01:04:58,390 --> 01:04:59,430
六
Six.

1170
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,940
并且你无缘无故
Also, without reason,

1171
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,610
威胁要解雇他们
you threatened to fire them.

1172
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,150
这显然也是违法的
This is clearly illegal.

1173
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:12,900
不是吗 玛丽
Isn't it, Mari?

1174
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,490
《劳动基准法》第23条 关于解雇等的限制
Article 23 of the Labor Standards Act. Proposal of dismissal, etc.

1175
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:17,570
当然 23
Absolutely. 23.

1176
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:27,330
15
Fifteen.

1177
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:28,920
来吧
That's it!

1178
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,090
连起来了 毛会长
That was a good call, Chairman.

1179
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:33,000
我要逆转
We will overturn this.

1180
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,630
我们快赢了 还有戏
We're almost there. We're still alive.

1181
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:41,720
这个可不行
Not this one.

1182
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:51,560
法律工作者是有道德和良心的
Because of the legal professional's ethics and conscience,

1183
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:52,730
我看到这样的事情 不能坐视不管 千永裴
Because of the legal professional's ethics and conscience,

1184
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,730
我看到这样的事情 不能坐视不管 千永裴
I can't get past this, Mr. Cheon Yeongbae.

1185
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,820
要我借给你吗
Would you like to borrow it?

1186
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:57,820
我想你会需要它
You may need it.

1187
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:00,160
我想你比我更需要它
I think you need it more than I do.

1188
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:01,910
第108页
Page 108.

1189
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:07,330
我要赌上法律工作者的道德和良心
In the name of the legal professional's ethics and conscience,

1190
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,420
让你受到惩处
I will punish you.

1191
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:18,720
八
Eight.

1192
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:37,490
完成
Bingo!

1193
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,950
你完了
You're finished.

1194
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,370
千永裴
Cheon Yeongbae.

1195
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,210
你被解雇了
You're fired.

1196
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:15,360
-谢谢 -辛苦了
-Thank you. -Good work.

1197
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,320
-干杯 -干杯
-Cheers! -Cheers!

1198
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,660
千律师 我一直都相信你
Mr. Cheon, I had complete trust in you.

1199
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:30,410
你怎么会想到这种方法 太厉害了
How did you come up with it? You're amazing.

1200
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,460
不要夸我厉害 因为我本来就是这样的人
Don't say I'm amazing. That's just who I am.

1201
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,590
如果我当时不记得法律条款怎么办
What would you have done if I couldn't remember the legal clauses?

1202
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,510
还能怎么办 你就不用来实习了
You would've been dropped as the probationary employee.

1203
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:44,010
千律师 你别再提实习的事了
Let's stop with that talk, Mr. Cheon.

1204
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:48,640
你也看到了 白实习是怎么解决建宇爷爷的事
You saw how Ms. Baek handled the case of Gunwoo's grandfather.

1205
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:49,640
好
Sure.

1206
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:53,650
玛丽 我来直接问你吧
Mari, let me ask you directly.

1207
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,770
你给你解决问题的方式打几分
How would you grade your problem-solving methods?

1208
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:01,150
这个嘛
Well...

1209
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,400
70分
-Seventy points? -Oh.

1210
01:08:04,410 --> 01:08:05,410
70分？
Seventy points?

1211
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:09,200
你确实挺有良心的
How humble of you.

1212
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:12,080
可是怎么办呢 我们事务所的实习生合格线是85分
It's a shame because our cutoff line is 85.

1213
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:15,040
很可惜你以15分之差被淘汰了
You did not pass by a difference of 15 points.

1214
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,750
什么 这是什么意思 合格线？
What do you mean, a cutoff line?

1215
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,250
你没跟我说过啊
You never told me that.

1216
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:22,510
不过你这次很好地
But you were sensitive to Gunwoo's feelings,

1217
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,800
照顾到了建宇的情绪 加上5分
so that's five additional points.

1218
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,760
而且你还清楚地记得法律条款
And you still remember the legal clauses.

1219
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,310
再加上10分 总共85分
Another 10 points, for a total of 85 points.

1220
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:32,600
正好在合格线上
You just made it...

1221
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,690

还是要恭喜你 白实习

1223

虽然千律师嘴上这么说
Mr. Cheon talks like this on the outside,

1224
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:42,240
但他心里十分欢迎你

千律师
Where would Mr. Cheon find...

1227
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:50,120
你去哪里找像我这样 既漂亮又聪明的实习生

1228
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,830
我倒是能看出来你聪明

我都没发现
I had no idea.

1235
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:20,060
漂亮的白实习 欢迎你
