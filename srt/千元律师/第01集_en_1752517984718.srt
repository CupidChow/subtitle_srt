153
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,630
30天无利息 马上来贷款吧
"NO INTEREST FOR 30 DAYS LOANS RIGHT AWAY"

154
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,000
没人在吗
Are they here?

155
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,800
有人吗
Is anyone here?

156
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,960
有人吗
Is anyone--

157
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,430
搞什么 他们去哪儿了
What's going on? Where are they?

158
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,220
你怎么来这种地方收钱
Do these people owe you money?

159
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,510
就是有这么一回事
Something like that.

160
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,680
我们这样随便闯进 别人的办公室没关系吗
Can we barge into other people's offices like this?

161
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,270
我们是来收钱的 坐下吧
We're here to get paid. Just have a seat.

162
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,480
门开着 他们应该很快就会回来
The door was unlocked. They should be back soon.

163
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,980
-好吧 -随便坐吧
-Okay. -Make yourself comfortable.

164
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,320
不过我们等人的时候要干点什么呢
But what should we do while we wait?

165
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,950
中餐馆 快速送达 德华苑
CHINESE DELIVERY DEOKHWAWON

166
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,340
-是那里 对吧 -对
-Is that the place? -Yes.

167
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,700
你为什么这么喜欢炸酱面
Why do you like jjajangmyeon so much?

168
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,160
就是喜欢 因为我爸 我小时候都没怎么吃过
Because my dad wouldn't let me have it when I was young.

169
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,580
你看起来可不像家境贫寒的人
Hey. You don't look like you grew up poor.

170
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,920
你干吗突然搞得这么煽情
Why the sob story?

171
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,050
不要倒酱汁 糖醋肉要蘸着吃
Don't pour the sauce. Dip the meat in it instead.

172
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,260
好吧 蘸着吃
Okay, we'll dip it in the sauce.

173
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,690
你好 你们有什么事吗
Hi. What can we do for you?

174
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,900
是你们吗
Are you the guys?

175
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,230
检察…
Prosecution... Oh, we are just...

176
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,860
那个 我们是来收钱的
Prosecution... Oh, we are just...

177
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,740
那个 我们是来收钱的
We're here to get some late payments.

178
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,910
不是那个意思 就只是单纯来收钱而已…
Not that kind of "get paid," but to purely receive money...

179
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,410
这也不对
That sounds bad too.

180
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,290
这不是我们的办公室
This is not our office.

181
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,710
你把嘴里的东西咽下去再说话
Geez. Could you talk after you swallow the food?

182
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,760
喂
Excuse me.

183
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,380
真好吃
This tastes good.

184
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,560
你知道别人怎么称呼你这种人吗
Do you know what they call people like you?

185
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,360
你知道别人怎么称呼你这种人吗
Do you know what they call people like you?

186
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
小区里的混混
A neighborhood bully.

187
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,870
喂 你干吗把我的炸酱面扣到桌子上
Hey! Why did you dump my bowl?

188
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,790
我还想拌饭吃呢
I was going to mix some rice in the sauce!

189
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,800
我说过这不是我们的办公室
I told you it's not our office!

190
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,010
这不是…搞得我口齿不清
This is not... I can't even talk.

191
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,470
这不是我们的办公室
It's not our office!

192
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,930
什么 那你早点说啊
What? You should have told me then.

193
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,560
我是检察院的人
I'm from the prosecutor's office.

194
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,350
如你们所见 我们来执行扣押搜查
As you can see, I'm here for search and seizure.

195
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:57,730
好
I see.

196
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,270
你们执行吧
Go ahead and seize.

197
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,190
好的
All right, then.

198
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,400
-从里面开始吧 -好
-Let's start from the inside. -Okay.

199
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,740
我们别碍事了 走吧
Let's just go.

200
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,030
-我们不走 -为什么
-We will stay. -Why?

201
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,450
你需要现金吗 日贷 月贷

202
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,750
如果这些家伙被捕 我们就拿不到钱
If these guys are arrested, we won't get paid.

203
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,040
不是因为她害你没能吃完炸酱面？
It's not because you couldn't finish your jjajangmyeon?

204
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,790
不管怎样
Either way.

205
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,420
等一下 暂停
Wait. Time out!

206
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,010
我在执行搜查令
I am executing a warrant.

207
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,970
我知道 不过你怎么这么急
I know, but what's the hurry?

208
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,810
既然你有搜查令 那得给我时间看一下啊
If you have a warrant, you should take time to look around.

209
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,350
很抱歉我刚才扣翻了你的炸酱面
I'm sorry for flipping your bowl.

210
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,060
我们别起冲突就这么了结吧
Let's end this without any hitches.

211
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,560
反正这又不是你们的办公室
You said this wasn't your office anyway.

212
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,570
但我们是同一个…该怎么说呢
But we are in the same... How do you say it?

213
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,110
-工种 -从事同一个工种
-Line of work. -We're in the same line of work.

214
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,860
我们暂时帮他们盯着办公室
We were watching their office.

215
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,910
让我看看
Let's have a look-see.

216
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,750
搜查令
A search and seizure warrant.

217
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,830
没错
That's right.

218
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,840
取证原因 场所…
The reason for verification. Location--

219
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,380
-看来你经验蛮多的嘛 -确实不少
-You must have a lot of experience. -Yes, quite a bit.

220
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,510
高于法定最高利率时 因违反《利息限制法》
A rate higher than the statutory maximum violates the Interest Restriction Act,

221
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:09,880
最高可处三年有期徒刑 或三千万韩元罚款
A rate higher than the statutory maximum violates the Interest Restriction Act,

222
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,140
最高可处三年有期徒刑 或三千万韩元罚款
punishable by up to three years in jail or a fine of 30 million won.

223
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,640
-就这些吗 -什么
-Is that all? -What?

224
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,560
只要他们请位好律师 就能争取到缓刑
If you get a good lawyer, they could get probation.

225
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
虽然不知道他们会请多么厉害的律师
I don't know how good their lawyer is,

226
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,480
好 那我们拭目以待吧
but we'll see.

227
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,570
应该也不需要那么厉害的律师
I don't think you need that good of a lawyer.

228
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,570
你现在的态度 会让你在以后接受调查时十分不利
Your attitude now will cost you when you are being interviewed later.

229
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,530
你不是说这不是你们的办公室吗
I thought this wasn't your office!

230
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,960
没事
It's fine.

231
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,040
千律师 我们别妨碍他们
Hey, let's not bother her.

232
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,000
我们走吧
Let's go.

233
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,640
只要您信任我们 我们就会为您提供低利率
TRUST OUR LOW-INTEREST RATE

234
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
只要您信任我们 我们就会为您提供低利率

235
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,230
监察官
Prosecator!

236
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
唉唷 监察官
Gosh, Prosecator.

237
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,900
你怎么又来了
Why are you here again?

238
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,950
我们可是每天凭良心过日子的小市民
We are hardworking, honest citizens.

239
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,240
好久不见 火鸡
Long time no see, Fire Chicken.

240
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,410
你最近还在放高利贷吗
Are you still in the personal loan business?

241
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,290
我叫火熊 不叫火鸡
It's not Fire Chicken but Fire Bear.

242
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,830
还有监察官 现在谁还这么老土用高利贷这个词啊
And the personal loan is such an outdated term.

243
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,000
监察官 你跟着我念
-Repeat after me, Prosecator. -Mm.

244
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,420
贷款经纪人
Loan broker.

245
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,840
那你也跟着我念
You repeat after me.

246
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,170
-不是监察官 而是检察官 -监察官
-Prosecutor, not "prosecator." -Prosecator.

247
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,260
-念一下米 -肉
-Say, "rice." -Lice.

248
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,300
算了
Forget it.

249
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,100
看看这个
What is this?

250
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,520
你最近活得挺滋润嘛
Hey. Is business good these days?

251
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,440
一点也不滋润 也就勉强糊口
It's not good at all. We barely make a living.

252
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
是吗 勉强糊口吗
Making a living, huh?

253
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,110
喂 那我们一起混口饭吃吧
Let's help each other to make a living.

254
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,940
那边那位女士
That lady over there.

255
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,280
那位正盯着我们的女士 她是检察官
The lady who's glaring at us. She's the prosecutor.

256
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,160
我辞职不干检察官了 你还不知道吧
I quit prosecution. Did you know that?

257
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,200
什么
What?

258
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,330
不过那位检察官带搜查令来了
But that prosecutor brought a warrant.

259
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,870
扣押搜查令
A search and seizure warrant.

260
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,670
等一下 住手
Wait. Stop!

261
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,050
我试过了 行不通
I tried that. It doesn't work.

262
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,300
你现在又不是检察官了
You're not a prosecutor anymore.

263
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,090
检察官 你这是干什么 我做错什么了
Why are you doing this? I didn't do anything wrong.

264
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,720
我们很快就会发传票给你 你要出席
You'll be summoned soon. Make sure you attend.

265
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,640
什么
What?

266
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,440
喂 火…你过来一下
Hey, Fire... Come over here, Fire.

267
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,190
过来
Come here.

268
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,110
我知道怎么把他们送走
I know how to send them away.

269
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,980
-真的吗 -嗯
-Really? -Sure.

270
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,780
不过你得先请律师
You need to hire a lawyer first.

271
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,490
律师？哪有律师啊
Lawyer? Where am I going to find a lawyer?

272
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,280
你好 我是千智勋律师
Hello. I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

273
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,490
那你不是检察官 而是律师了？
So you're a lawyer, not a prosecator?

274
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,460
但问题是我的律师费很贵
The problem is that my legal fees are very expensive.

275
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,960
多少钱
How much is it?

276
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,130
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

277
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,180
怎么 你不愿意吗 如果这次被抓进去 你三年都见不到阳光
No? If you go to jail, you won't see daylight for three years.

278
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,850
你给我打个八折吧
Can you give me a 20% discount?

279
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,310
事务长 没办法了 就让他在监狱里蹲三年吧
Mr. Sa, I guess he's going to rot in jail for three years.

280
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,270
我们走吧
Let's go.

281
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,440
唉唷 我们千律师可厉害了
Gosh, you have no idea how good he is.

282
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,520
千律师 打九折怎么样
Mr. Cheon! How about 10%?

283
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:18,280
检察官 再给我看一下搜查令
Prosecutor, may I see the warrant again?

284
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,490
什么
Why?

285
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,200
我想检查一下是否有遗漏
I want to see if it's missing anything.

286
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,540
让我看看 遗漏的…
Let's see. What's missing?

287
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,590
遗漏的部分…
What could be...

288
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,840
遗漏了什么呢
missing on this warrant?

289
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,630
不可能有遗漏
It's not missing anything.

290
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,760
你快点看完还给我 我本来就够忙了
Please give it back. I don't have all day.

291
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,010
好 我知道了 等一下
I understand. Hang on.

292
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,520
五 四 三 二
Five, four, three, two.

293
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,650
检察官 这可不行
Prosecutor. This won't do.

294
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,150
什么不行
What do you mean?

295
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,030
难道你要妨碍我执行搜查令吗
Are you interfering with the execution of this warrant?

296
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,160
不是妨碍 而是要帮你正确执行
I'm not interfering. I would like to help you do it right.

297
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,450
韩国检察官不是应该依法行使职权吗
A prosecutor must follow the law.

298
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,910
你是说我没有依法行使吗
Are you saying I didn't?

299
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,200
你来晚了
You came late.

300
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,620
这张搜查令让你在白天 执行扣押搜查 而你来晚了
It was to be executed during daytime.

301
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,830
你看
Look here, darling.

302
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,090
夜间执行这栏写着不适用
It says, "Night execution not applicable."

303
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,130
今天首尔地区的日落时间是7点
Today's time for sunset in the Seoul region is 19:00.

304
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,760
而现在是…
And right now,

305
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,930
7点1分
it's 19:01.

306
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,520
你应该早来一分钟 真可惜
What a shame. You should have come a minute sooner.

307
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,980
首尔堵车堵得很厉害吧
The traffic in Seoul is so bad.

308
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,570
是啊 你回去的路上肯定特别堵
It is. Your way back to the office will be terribly congested.

309
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,780
你们这样做 严格来说是在妨碍执行公务
What you're doing is technically an obstruction of justice.

310
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,030
下次我不会妨碍你执行公务
I won't obstruct justice next time.

311
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,280
请写好搜查令再来 检察官
Make sure you bring the right warrant.

312
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,330
检察官 外面应该堵车堵得很厉害
The traffic is pretty bad now, Prosecutor.

313
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,590
-我们走吧 -走吧
-Let's go. -Let's go.

314
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,670
是
Yes.

315
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,130
谢谢
Thank you.

316
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,030
真是的
Come on.

317
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,700
没错吧
Do you see any errors?

318
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,580
那个 我…
But...

319
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,490
那个什么 你这家伙
But what? What is it?

320
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,830
可是三千万韩元 变成一亿韩元也太过分了
But it's a bit much that 30 million won became 100 million won.

321
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,050
你说什么 大声点 让我听清楚
I can't hear what you're saying. Say it clearly so I can hear.

322
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,300
喂 你还钱还晚了
Hey. You were late with payments.

323
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,220
你知道我损失了多少吗
Do you know how much that cost me?

324
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,390
把这些全算进去 我真的算你很便宜了
This is peanuts compared to that, you know.

325
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,810
你这家伙 我真想给你一拳
You are starting to piss me off.

326
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,730
喂 火鸡 你重新算一遍
Hey, Fire Chicken. Run the number again.

327
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,900
你在训狗吗
Are you kidding me now? Are you?

328
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,070
听着 即使算上千百次 结果也一样
Listen. The numbers won't change even if we run it a thousand times.

329
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,030
是吗
Really?

330
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,570
那我来一次性推翻你算千百次的结果
Let me change the numbers in one try.

331
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,950
我来敲一下你的计算器
Give me your calculator.

332
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,830
即使你算上千百次 结果也一样
You can try it a thousand times, but it won't change the numbers.

333
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,670
算得正好
This is exactly right.

334
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,840
千智勋律师 你算得很准嘛
You are very precise, Attorney Cheon Jihun.

335
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,140
不过最后的三万韩元是什么啊
But what is the 30,000 won at the end?

336
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,970
-买炸酱面的钱 -什么
-It's the price for jjajangmyeon. -Huh?

337
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,350
为了让你容易理解 我再给你算一遍
Let me explain it to you again so you can understand.

338
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,520
你仔细看
Listen carefully.

339
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,810
预付款是五百万韩元
The retainer was 5 million won.

340
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,730
加上我对扣押搜查的 应对及申辩是五千万韩元
Plus, the search and seizure response and defense were 50 million won.

341
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,360
还有与检察官面谈是四千万韩元
Plus, an interview with the prosecutor was another 40 million won.

342
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,820
再加上日后的应对及咨询 是五百万韩元
Plus, countermeasures and consultation was 5 million won.

343
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,740
最后加上三万韩元餐费
Lastly, the food expense was 30,000.

344
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,660
总共是…
So the total...

345
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,370
一亿零三万韩元
comes out to 100,030,000 won.

346
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,250
这是干什么 真是的
Gosh. Let's be serious now.

347
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,170
你就帮了一点小忙
That was a small favor.

348
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,590
一点小忙？
Small favor?

349
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,640
这可不是你这种把三千万韩元 变成一亿韩元的人该说的话
It was no small feat to turn 30 million into 100 million.

350
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,850
我对你一忍再忍
You are crossing the line here.

351
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,270
-你真是… -好可怕 我真的很怕你们这样
You're scaring me.

352
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,100
事务长 你有刚才那位检察官的名片吧
Mr. Sa, do you still have the business card of that prosecutor?

353
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,690
名片吗 我当然有
Her business card? Of course, I have it.

354
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,400
火熊 你和我有很多不为人知的回忆
Fire Bear, you and I go way back.

355
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,610
要我把这些回忆告诉检察官吗
Shall we go down memory lane in front of that prosecutor?

356
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,460
你没有信封吗
Do you have an envelope?

357
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,790
-要什么信封啊 -给你
-I don't have envelopes. -Here you go.

358
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,670
-谢谢 -你这家伙疯了吗
-Thank you. -Are you crazy, bastard?

359
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,670
-金亿洙 -是

360
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,720

364
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,450

Let's go, then.

How can I repay you?

369
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,920
虽然这钱不多
This is not much,

370
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,430
但你就当是我的心意 收下吧
but accept it as a token of my appreciation.

371
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,680
放进去吧 我之前收的一千韩元足够了
Please keep it. The 1,000 won you gave me is enough.

372
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,350
可是…
But still...

373
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,520
从现在起不要再见那些坏蛋了
Don't get roped in with those guys again.

374

00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,360
你一口 我一口…
and one for you, one for me--

454
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,240
这是该在孩子面前说的话吗
What are you saying in front of a kid?

455
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,040
大叔 我爸什么时候来
Mister. When is my daddy coming back?

456
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,160
他跟你说了吗
Did he tell you?

457
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,630
-那个… -昭弥
-Right, it's-- -Somi.

458
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,880
他保证只要你按时吃药 好好吃饭 身体变健康的话
If you take your medicine, eat well, and get healthy,

459
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,340
他很快就会来
he promises he will come soon.

460
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,470
说谎 你在骗我
That's a lie. You're pulling my leg.

461
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,050
我没有骗你
I'm not pulling your leg.

462
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,680
大叔 那你能向我保证吗
Can you promise me then?

463
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,150
昭弥
Somi.

464
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,450
妈
Mommy.

465
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,000
我在附近的夜宵店工作
I work at a nearby diner that sells night snacks.

466
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,130
我一直在找能在 昭弥睡觉时工作的地方
I can work while Somi sleeps.

467
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,800
真是太辛苦了
It must be hard for you.

468
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,090
你老公得赶紧回来才行
I hope your husband returns soon.

469
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,840
他说他不会再偷了
He said he was done.

470
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,930
他说这次真的不会再偷了
He said he was done for good.

471
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,520
我去渔船上干活赚钱 你好好照顾昭弥
I'll work on a fishing boat. Take care of Somi until I come back.

472
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,940
你真的是去船上干活吗
Are you really working on a boat?

473
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:11,830
他说不会再偷了 还用石头砸了自己的手
He smashed his hand with a rock to show that he quit pickpocketing.

474
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,080
他绝对不会再偷了
I'm sure he didn't do it.

475
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,210
原来是这样啊
So, he did.

476
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,920
他说想以后面对昭弥时问心无愧
He wanted Somi to be proud of him.

477
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,290
原来是这样啊
So, he did.

478
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,220
如果他早点上船 就不会发生这种事了
Had he gotten on the boat sooner, this wouldn't have happened.

479
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,050
没有人相信他
No one believes him.

480
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,760
我找了很多律师 他们都让我先交预付款
Every lawyer I went to see wants a retainer up front.

481
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,770
还说这案子不会被判无罪 让他请求宽大处理
They say he won't be acquitted so he should ask for leniency.

482
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,690
千律师 昭弥爸爸真的是被冤枉的
Mr. Cheon. My husband is falsely accused.

483
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,240
抱歉 我接个电话
I'm sorry, I have to take this call.

484
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,530
你接吧
Go ahead.

485
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,490
喂
Hello?

486
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,120
好 我知道了
Yes, I will.

487
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,910
昭弥妈妈
Ma'am.

488
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,540
我去见见你老公
I will meet your husband.

489
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:03,090
真的非常感谢你
Thank you so much.

490
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,300
你刚才很帅
That was cool.

491
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,800
他们的故事太可怜了
Their story is so sad.

492
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,220
那你以后别抱怨我只收一千韩元
Then don't complain that I only charge 1,000 won.

493
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,640
我知道了
Okay.

494
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,350
能不能就拜托你这一次
Can I ask for an exemption this once?

495
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,430
不能再这样了
It's not possible any longer.

496
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:22,560
这是医院的政策 所以没办法再体谅你了
It's the hospital policy. I'm afraid I can't help you.

497
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,070
我会想方设法筹齐医药费的
I will come up with the money.

498
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,860
你们必须在这个月底把病房腾出来
She has to leave by the end of this month.

499
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
我们也真的很抱歉
We're very sorry about this.

500
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
抱歉
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,620
医药费多少钱
How much is the bill?

502
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,340
多少钱 我来付
How much is it? I'll pay the bills.

503
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,470
这个嘛
Well...

504
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:59,430
总共是1300万8128韩元
The total is 13,008,128 won.

505
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,440
-一千三百万韩元？-对
-Thirteen thousand? -Yes.

506
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,940
本人负担的费用是1225万8593韩元
Copay is 12,258,593 won

507
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,570
特诊费是74万9535韩元
and 749,535 won for elective care.

508
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,030
你要一次性付清吗
Would you like to pay in full?

509
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,210
别担心 昭弥的医药费由我来负责
Don't worry. I'll take care of Somi's medical bills.

510
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,720
谢谢
Thank you.

511
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,350
谢谢你
Thank you...

512
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,860
我真是疯了
I was out of my mind.

513
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,820
我为什么那么说
Why did I say that?

514
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,570
你拦着我啊 你怎么不拦着我
Why didn't you stop me?

515
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,280
一共多少钱
"How much is it?"

516
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,410
昭弥的医药费由我来负责
"I'll take care of Somi's medical bills."

517
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,080
好话都让你说了 干吗要我帮你想办法
You were acting the hero. Why are you asking for my help?

518
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,910
我真是要疯了
I'm such an idiot.

519
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,750
千律师
Mr. Cheon!

520
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,580
你也有一定的责任
You are partially responsible.

521
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,250
-什么责任 -我一开始并不这样
-Why? -I wasn't like this at first.

522
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,760
我就是跟着你才会被传染的
I got it from you.

523
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,010
怎么办 就这一次不行吗
Can't you do something?

524
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,300
救救我
Help me out.

525
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,970
我想负责李明浩案件的 检察官可以帮我们
I think the prosecutor in charge of Lee Myeongho's case can help us.

526
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,520
检察官？
The prosecutor?

527
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,270
很快就要开庭了 你要继续这样嘴硬下去吗
You'll stand trial soon. Are you still claiming innocent?

528
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:32,530
我不是嘴硬 我真的只是扶了他而已
I really am innocent. I was only helping him up.

529
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,820
有前科的人就不能帮助别人吗
Even an ex-con can help a person.

530
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:41,620
李明浩
Mr. Lee Myeongho.

531
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,250
你得表现出反省的态度 才能得到宽大处理
You need to show remorse to get leniency.

532
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,080
你有四次同类前科
You have four identical convictions

533
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,550
而且你出狱仅仅两个月就又被抓了
and this is another offense within two months of release.

534
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,510
这种情况会加重处罚 重刑是无法避免的
You will likely get a heavy penalty as a repeat offense.

535
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,640
你也得想想你的家人啊
Think of your family.

536
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,050
你有老婆和女儿啊
It says you have a daughter and a wife.

537
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,930
好 我们重新开始
So, let's start from the top.

538
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,350
在你眼里
In your eyes,

539
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,110
我就是个小偷吧
I look like a pickpocket.

540
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,520
不
No.

541
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,610
你在任何人眼里都是这样
You look like that in everybody's eyes.

542
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,860
而且谁知道呢
Besides, it is possible

543
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:21,580
也许你没想偷
you don't remember

544
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,750
可你的手却不知不觉地先伸出去了
that your hands moved before you knew it.

545
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,680
-好吃吗 -嗯 爸爸你能来 我真的特别开心
-Is it good? -Yes. I'm so happy you're here.

546
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,720
你得赶紧好起来 明年就该上小学了
Get better, so you can go to elementary school next year.

547
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,690
原来你忘了我的年龄啊
You forgot my age.

548
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,060
没关系
That's okay.

549
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,270
那今年的生日
Then be here for my birthday this year.

550
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,570
你陪我一起过吧
Then be here for my birthday this year.

551
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,970
我出狱后找不到工作
I couldn't get a job after being released from jail.

552
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,730
而且没钱支付女儿的医药费 所以不得已犯了罪
Inevitably, I committed a crime to pay for my daughter's hospital bill.

553
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,520
白玛丽
Baek Mari.

554
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,020
你成为真正的检察官了
You're a legitimate prosecutor.

555
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,860
既然他交了检讨书
I submitted his letter of apology,

556
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,530
那我可以要求最低量刑吧
so can I ask for the minimum sentence?

557
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,200
对了 根据《刑法》的规定 加重处罚的盗窃惯犯未遂犯
By the way, he's not eligible for pardon under the Criminal Act

558
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,990
不能获得犯罪未遂时的减刑
because of his habitual theft.

559
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,950
这样啊 我还告诉他会宽大处理呢
Oh, no. I told him we would be lenient.

560
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,160
你写一下起诉书
Submit a petition for appeal.

561
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,420
量刑就和判断 是否有罪一样棘手 所以要慎重
Weight of offense is tricky like judging guilty or innocent, so be thorough.

562
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,670
-好的 -那个非法贷款案呢
-Yes. -What about the illegal loan case?

563
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,550
受害人全部撤诉了
All of the victims dropped the charges.

564
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,300
是吗 真快啊
Is that right? That was quick.

565
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,090
白实习 你有一个包裹
Ms. Baek, you have a package.

566
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,480
什么 这本书…
What? This book...

567
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,060
《法律工作者的道德和良心》
LEGAL PROFESSIONALS' ETHICS AND CONSCIENCE

568
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,860
期待你的首次胜诉 徐民赫赠
I'm looking forward to your first win. From Seo Minhyeok.

569
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,700
和平 改造
PEACE, REHABILITATION

570
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:24,910
千智勋律师事务所
CHEON JIHUN LAW OFFICE

571
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,410
你要帮我？
So, you want to help me?

572
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,500
不 我还没有决定
I haven't decided yet.

573
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
千智勋 律师
ATTORNEY CHEON JIHUN

574
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,840
你也不相信我
You don't believe me either.

575
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,460
谁会轻易相信一个有四次前科的小偷
Who would believe a four-time convicted pickpocket?

576
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,220
你的手怎么了
What's wrong with your hand?

577
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,520
如果你用右手 肯定不会被抓
If you used the right hand, you wouldn't have been caught.

578
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,770
我真的没偷
I really didn't do it.

579
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:57,690
李明浩 不管你再怎么辩解 这也只是你的主张
Mr. Lee Myeongho. That is only your assertion.

580
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,360
没有人知道真相 不是吗
No one knows the truth.

581
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,860
那我该怎么办
What do I have to do then?

582
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,570
人们对我说
People told me

583
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,030
换作别人 这件事会当一场误会了事
it would be a misunderstanding for other people,

584
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,740
所以谁让我犯罪了
but not for me so I'm guilty.

585
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,290
是啊 这话说得没错
Right. That's not completely wrong.

586
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,710
你到底来这干吗的
Why are you here?

587
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,840
我见到昭弥了
I met Somi.

588
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,140
我家昭弥还好吗
Is she okay?

589
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,100
是的 她会好的
Yes, she will be.

590
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,190
千律师
Mr. Cheon,

591
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,570
我该怎么办
what do I have to do?

592
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,860
检察官让我写一份检讨书 请求宽大处理
The prosecutor tells me to write a letter of apology and ask for leniency.

593
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:51,160
事实上 我什么也做不了
In fact, there's nothing else I can do.

594
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,830
求你帮帮我
Please help me.

595
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:04,090
大叔 那你能向我保证吗
Can you promise me then?

596
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,720
你可向我保证了
You promised.

597
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,700
李明浩 你说你没偷
Mr. Lee Myeongho, you say you didn't do it.

598
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,580
你能以你女儿的名义向我保证吗
Can you swear on your daughter?

599
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,170
可以 我真的可以向你保证
Yes. I swear on my daughter.

600
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,880
好 我知道了 我来帮你
Very well. I will help you.

601
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,920
昭弥很想念你

唉唷 你留胡子干吗
Geez. What's with that beard?

621
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,020
我喝醉了 差点摔倒
So, I almost fell down because I was drunk.

622
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,730
这小子假装扶我 然后把手伸进了我的口袋
This punk pretended to help me then put his hand in my pocket.

623
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,530
我一下子就抓住他了
So, I caught him red-handed!

624
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,530
我因为闹肚子在后面排队
I was in line to use the restroom.

625
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,410
他在前面差点摔倒 我是为了帮他才扶他的
He almost fell so I caught him.

626
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:17,700
是真的
It's true.

627
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,540
我要疯了
I can't believe this.

628
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,710
简直难以置信 喂
Unbelievable. Hey.

629
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,500
你竟敢说谎
How dare you tell a lie?

630
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,920
喂 你把墨镜摘下来
Hey. Take off your sunglasses.

631
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,920
摘下来 你这小子
Take them off, bastard!

632
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,130
我可以摘掉墨镜
I can take them off,

633
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,680
可我又不是你家的小子 你干吗一直叫我小子 你这小子
but I'm not a bastard, so why do you keep calling me bastard, you bastard?

634
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,890
什么
What?

635
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,720
-你这… -安静点 你们当这是什么地方
-You little-- -Be quiet. Remember where you are.

636
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,430
姓名
Name?

637
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,190
姓名？我可以告诉你姓名
Name? I can tell you my name...

638
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,650
-姓名… -真是的 我说了我没偷

你们为什么这么对我
Why are you harassing me?

640
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,320
-真是的 你在干什么 -我没偷
-Seriously. What are you doing? -I didn't do it!

641
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,610
-坐下 你给我坐下 -我没干那种事
-Sit down. Sit! -It wasn't me.

642
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,780
椅子在那边 你让我怎么坐
The chair is over there. How can I sit down?

643
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,280
-我没偷 -你在干什么
-I didn't do it. -What are you doing?

644
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,490
-他简直是无赖 -请坐下
-He's a total lunatic. -Have a seat.

645
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,290
辛苦了 我们是千智勋律师事务所的
Hello, we are from the law office of Attorney Cheon Jihun.

I'm Cheon Jihun, attorney-at-law.

649
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,140
你好
Hello.

650
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,260
你好
Hi.

651
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,470
-不过我真没偷 你这小子 -是
-I really didn't do it, bastard. -Okay.

652
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,520
我是不是出来得太容易了
That was too easy.

653
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,230
唉唷 你现在满意了吧
Geez. Are you satisfied now?

654
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,070
千律师
Excuse me, Mr. Cheon?

655
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,690
这是我的名片 记得联系我
This is my card. Give me a call.

656
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,910
-好 -慢走
-Yes. -Take care.

657
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,990
值得信赖的警察 安全的国家
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, A SAFE COUNTRY

658
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,790
对律师 他们说是误会把我放了
A lawyer gets off the hook and a four-time convict gets arrested.

659
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,370
而有四次前科的人就被拘留了
A lawyer gets off the hook and a four-time convict gets arrested.

660
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,540
这太不公平了
It's so unfair.

661
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,250
任谁都会这么想
Anyone would think that.

662
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,090
任谁都会这么想吗
For anyone?

663
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,590
是啊 你要不要问问路上的行人
You could ask anyone off the street.

664
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,260
是啊 让我们问问 人们是不是都这么想吧
Right. Let's ask anyone off the street.

665
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,970
这主意不错
That's a great idea.

666
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,240
白实习 你回来了
Ms. Baek, you're back.

667
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,490
前辈 国民陪审是怎么回事
What do you mean, a jury trial?

668
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,990
被告已经认罪并提交了检讨书
The defendant confessed and wrote a letter of apology.

669
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,540
是哪个疯子律师申请国民陪审的
What kind of a lunatic lawyer asks for a jury trial?

670
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,000
最近奇怪的律师怎么这么多
There are so many weird lawyers.

671
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,420
就算行业不景气 律师也要维持品格啊
Isn't there a certain level of professional standard?

672
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,340
那个律师到底是谁
Who is the lawyer?

673
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,770
我就是那个疯子律师
Yes, I am that lunatic lawyer.

674
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,070
什么
What?

675
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,500
唉唷 你不是那时候的那位检察官嘛
Gosh. Aren't you that prosecutor?

676
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,000
你说的那个人是智勋吗
Was that Jihun?

677
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,920
这位是千智勋律师
This is Attorney Cheon Jihun.

678
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,260
他在几年前是我的同事
He was a coworker until a few years ago.

679
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,510
这位是白玛丽实习检察官 打个招呼吧
And this is Ms. Baek Mari. Say hi.

680
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,140
见到你很高兴 我们又见面了
Nice to see you again.

681
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,770
你好 我是白玛丽
Hello, I'm Baek Mari.

682
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,810
你还是实习检察官啊
You are still a probationary judicial officer.

683
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,070
你作为实习检察官相当有魄力嘛
She's very tenacious for a probationary judicial officer.

684
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:43,240
干吗 她是研修院最后一期
She's in the last class of the training institute.

685
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,990
最令人期待的人
She's the ace of the class.

686
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,120
你把这个案子
What is your intention

687
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,750
变成国民陪审是想怎样
to turn this case into a jury trial?

688
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,960
难道你要主张他无罪吗
Are you going to plead innocent?

689
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:54,750
对
Yes.

690
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,590
我说
Look.

691
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,260
被告已经认罪并希望得到宽大处理
The defendant confessed to the crime and asked for leniency.

692
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,350
你要推翻吗
Why is a lawyer changing his plea?

693
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,720
检讨书 尊敬的检察官 我叫李明浩
LETTER OF APOLOGY MY NAME IS LEE MYEONGHO

694
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,600
我出狱仅仅两个月就又犯罪了
I COMMITTED A CRIME WITHIN TWO MONTHS OF MY RELEASE

695
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,440
-前辈 -智勋
-This is crazy. -Jihun.

696
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,070
这有点过分了
You shouldn't do that.

697
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,040
我的委托人拜托我把它撕了
My client asked me to tear it up.

698
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,910
给你…还是我拿走吧
Here... I'll take it.

699
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,170
我真是无法理解
I don't understand.

700
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,340
你这么做真是为了你的委托人吗
Are you really doing this for your client?

701
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,720
如果被告推翻供词
If the defendant denies his confession,

702
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,590
这个案子会不会更棘手
it may be harder to prove your case.

703
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,470
我知道 但我会处理的 前辈
I know, but I'll take care of it.

704
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,350
你当然会的 千智勋律师
Of course, you will, Attorney Cheon Jihun.

705
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:56,350
如果他推翻供词 坚持自己无罪 那就不会得到宽大处理
He won't get leniency if he rescinds and insists on his innocence.

706
00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:58,730
宽大处理？
Leniency?

707
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,400
你从没想过被告是无辜的吗
Did you ever think the defendant may be innocent?

708
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,440
如果他是无辜的 我就不会起诉他
If he was innocent, I wouldn't have charged him.

709
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,950
难道他被起诉了就不能被判无罪吗
It's not that you want a guilty verdict because you charged him?

710
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,870
任何律师都不能推翻事实
No lawyer can change the truth.

711
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,830
如果你所知道的事实是错的呢
What if the truth you believe is wrong?

712
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,000
你们去法庭上吵吧
Do the fighting at court.

713
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,170
托你们的福 我很期待这场公审
I'm looking forward to the trial.

714
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,930
是啊 前辈 我也十分期待
Yes, Yejin. I'm looking forward to it too.

715
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,510
白实习呢 你也期待吗
What about you, young probationary judicial officer?

716
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:43,070
我会作为检察官站在法庭上 而不是实习检察官
I will be there as a prosecutor, not a probationary judicial officer.

717
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:47,200
从现在起请把我当成你的检察官对手 千智勋律师
Please address me as the prosecutor from now on, Attorney Cheon Jihun.

718
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,660
好 我知道了 白玛丽检察官 我会这样做的
Very well, Prosecutor Baek Mari. I will do that.

719
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,490
那我们审判时…
Then we will see you at...

720
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,580
唉唷 你还看书啊
Oh, my, you're reading a book.

721
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,040
这本书可厚了
This is very thick.

722
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,080
要我借给你吗 我想你会需要它
Would you like to borrow it? You may need it.

723
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,000
我吗
Me?

724
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,500
我想你比我更需要它
I think you need it more than I do.

725
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,050
第108页
Page 108.

726
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,680
-前辈 我走了 -再见
-I'm off, Yejin. -Bye.

727
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:27,110
被告有两名辩护人为其辩护
"A defendant has two advocates. The prosecutor before the indictment

728
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,450
分别是起诉前的检察官 和起诉后的律师
and the attorney after the indictment."

729
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,820
被告有两名辩护人为其辩护

730
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,500
前辈 你也知道吗
Did you know this too?

731
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,670
当然 但是明明知道 做起来却很难
Yes. But it's easier said than done.

732
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,250
千律师当检察官的时候也没能做到
Attorney Cheon couldn't do that as a prosecutor either.

733
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,230
他以前真的是检察官吗
Was he really a prosecutor?

734
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,560
是啊
Yes.

735
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,570
他以擅长调查而出名
He was famous for being a good investigator.

736
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,820
更因不听命令而出名
He was even more famous for being a rebel.

737
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:13,450
不管对手是谁 他从不退缩
He never backed down, no matter who he was against.

738
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:17,120
那他为什么不干了
Why did he leave the prosecution?

739
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,000
你在美国的最后一场诉讼赢了吗
How was your last trial in America? Did you win?

740
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,670
嗯 胜诉
Yes, we won.

741
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,460
刑量呢
What about the sentence?

742
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:29,960
和我们要求的量刑一样 150年
Just as we asked for, 150 years.

743
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,510
这在韩国连想都不敢想
That would be impossible here.

744
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:35,430
因为这里会合算刑量
It's the sum of the sentences.

745
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,600
这说明其罪行严重 这种象征意义更大
There's symbolic significance too.

746
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,180
对了 民赫哥 谢谢你的书
By the way, thanks for the book.

747
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:43,100
书绝版了 我一直没买到
I couldn't get it because it was out of print.

748
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:44,230
不用谢
It was nothing.

749
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,060
你对首次公审有信心吗
Are you confident about the first trial?

750
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,530
我的对手是一个奇怪的律师
There's a crazy lawyer.

751
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,400
被告已经认罪并提交了检讨书
The defendant confessed to the crime and submitted a letter of apology.

752
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:55,780
辩护律师却要求进行国民陪审
The lawyer asked for a jury trial.

753
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,120
你说的是那起盗窃未遂案吧
Are you talking about the attempted theft case?

754
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,240
对
Yes.

755
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,960
虽然在美国 陪审员会被律师的诡辩影响
In America, sometimes a lawyer can sway the jury.

756
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,880
但在韩国 认为被告人有罪的倾向仍然很高
But the defendants are generally perceived as guilty in Korea.

757
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,750
而且那个人不是有四次前科吗
Isn't he a four-time convict?

758
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,050
所以很难翻盘
It would be hard to flip.

759
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:09,960
是吧
Right?

760
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:10,880
当然了
Yes.

761
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:13,470
总是有这样的律师
There's always that one lawyer.

762
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,010
明明没有能力
They're not even competent,

763
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:17,510
却怂恿委托人 让事情变得更复杂
and they persuade the client to complicate things even more.

764
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,720
就是啊 我感觉这次也会这样
Exactly. I think he's going to do that.

765
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,020
那个律师是谁
Who is the lawyer?

766
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,560
民赫哥
Minhyeok,

767
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,070
如果他并不是一个奇怪的律师呢
what if he's not a crazy lawyer?

768
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,200
你说什么
What?

769
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,870
没什么 我再打给你
It's nothing. I'll call you again.

770
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,830
他在干什么
What is he doing?

771
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,000
他在这里待了几个小时了？
How many hours has he been here?

772
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:15,440
李明浩涉嫌盗窃案
LEE MYEONGHO ATTEMPTED THEFT CASE

773
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,960
早上好…
Good morning...

774
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,980
这次是一个非常重要的问题
This time, it's a very important question.

775
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,780
你喜欢民哲…
You like Mincheol, but...

776
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,490
我想问的是 这是友情 还是爱情
So let me ask you, is it love or friendship?

777
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,360
-是友情 -为什么
-Friendship. -Why?

778
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,280
因为友情指的是朋友啊
Because friendship is for friends.

779
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:03,620
真没意思 我们走吧
I'm bored, let's go.

780
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,500
友情指的是朋友
Friendship is for friends.

781
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:11,040
友情指的是朋友 这句话说得好
Friendship is for friends. That's deep.

782
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,920
是啊 友情是人生必不可少的部分
Yes, friendship is what makes a life.

783
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:14,500
你在干什么
-What are you doing? -Nothing much.

784
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,000
没什么
-What are you doing? -Nothing much.

785
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,130
这次要进行国民陪审 选择陪审员很重要
Since we'll be doing a jury trial, jury selection is important.

786
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,130
所以我在思考应该问什么问题
So I'm thinking about what questions I should ask.

787
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,640
对了 你了解一下MBTI就行
Right. You should look at the Myers-Brigg Type Indicator.

788
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:24,760
迈尔斯布里格斯性格分类法
The MBTI.

789
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:25,930
那是什么
What is that?

790
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,980
MBTI就是性格测试
It's a personality type test.

791
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,730
还有这种东西吗
Ah, they have something like that?

792
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,650
可是这种问题能在法庭上问吗
Can I ask the question in court, though?

793
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,570
你的MBTI类型是什么
What is your type?

794
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,360
我的类型就是正常啊
My type is "Normal."

795
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:38,900
我的类型就是正常啊
I'm healthy.

796
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,070
我不是很可靠嘛
I'm healthy.

797
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,030
那我不用测试 应该也属于正常类型
I bet I'm normal too. I don't need the test.

798
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,330
是吧
Right?

799
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,410
这是什么
What is that?

800
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:49,790
小俊去幼儿园的时候没带便当 我打算给他送过去
Jun left his lunch at home so I'm bringing it to him.

801
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:52,710
那正好 我得去个地方 你送我一程吧
Great. I need to go somewhere. Can you drive me?

802
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:54,460
-好 -你在路上把我放下就行
-Okay. -You can drop me off on the way.

803
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:58,710
在国民陪审中
In a jury trial,

804
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,050
了解陪审员的倾向很重要
it's important to know the jury's tendencies.

805
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,050
对于有四次盗窃前科的被告 比起主张宽恕他的人
It's better to have more people who would punish a four-time convict

806
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:07,720
认为应该处罚他的人越多
than those who are more forgiving.

807
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,520
你胜诉的几率就越高
Your chances of winning would go up.

808
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,100
可是我该如何得知呢
But how do you find out the tendencies?

809
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,480
他们在政治上属于进步派还是保守派
Whether they are politically progressive or conservative,

810
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,190
以及他们的经济地位如何 如果你能掌握这些
what economic status they are in, if you could find those things out,

811
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:23,530
就能更加轻易地看出 哪些陪审员会站在检察官这边
you will be able to tell who would side with the prosecution.

812
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,030
你提问试试
Give it a try.

813
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,380
一号陪审员候选人
Jury Candidate No. 1,

814
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,460
你同意缩短兵役期限吗
do you agree with shortening the military service term?

815
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,170
是的 我同意
Yes, I agree.

816
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,720
不对
Wrong.

817
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,930
你这样问的话
If you ask that question,

818
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,430
对方的律师也会马上知道 陪审员是一个什么样的人
the other side will also know what type of juror he will be.

819
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:54,600
你必须制定出自己很清楚
You have to come up with questions that are clear to you,

820
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,610
却让对方摸不着头脑的问题
but confusing to the other side.

821
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,400
这是选择陪审员的关键
That's the key to jury selection.

822
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,320
白玛丽
Baek Mari.

823
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:06,780
这是你实习期的最后一次审判 你一定要赢

824
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,910

Of course, I will.

825
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,410
不过千律师
Mr. Cheon.

826
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,880
你认为李明浩的案子能赢吗
Do you think you can win Lee Myeongho's case?

827
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,630
这取决于陪审员们如何判断
It depends on how the jury rules.

828
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,930
陪审员们会相信李明浩吗
Would the jury believe Lee Myeongho?

829
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:26,300
肯定不信
Probably not.

830
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,220
什么 那怎么办
What do we do then?

831
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,720
该怎么办呢
What should we do?

832
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,730
你别开玩笑了 快告诉我
Stop playing around and tell me.

833
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,060
《刑法》的第一原则是
The first principle of Criminal Law is,

834
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:39,690
存疑时应作出有利于被告的裁决
"When in doubt, rule in favor of the defendant."

835
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,480
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

836
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:42,740
就是有这条原则
It means what it says.

837
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:45,240
-事务长 在那里右转 -好
-Make a right turn there. -Okay.

838

841

842
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,210

878
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:52,570
人在生活中
In life,

879
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,400
会有重要的饭局

880

有时会把饭局安排在中餐馆 对吧
And some of those meals could take place at a Chinese restaurant.

881
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:00,240
对 没错
Of course.

882
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:02,870
30号陪审员候选人 你在这种饭局上
At such meals, would you eat

883
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,290
糖醋肉是蘸酱汁吃 还是浇了酱汁再吃

884
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,540
审判长
Your Honor.

885
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,000
什么
Yes?

886
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,420
这问题多少有些儿戏
The questions are too playful.

887
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,920
我同意
Agreed.

888
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,760
辩护人 请注意
Please watch it, counsel.

889
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,800
那我换一个？你不喜欢我的问题吗
Should I ask something else? You don't seem to like my question.

890
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:22,970

那如果有人擅自
Then, what would you do

899
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,830
把酱汁浇上去 你会怎么办 会生气吗
if someone just poured the sauce all over? Would you be mad?

900
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,000
虽然会生气 但也没办法嘛
I would be annoyed, but I wouldn't do anything.

903
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,930
可事务长每次都浇着吃
but the office manager always pours it all over.

904
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:03,850
-审判长 -请讲
-Your Honor. -Go ahead.

905
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,220
辩护人…
The defense counsel is...

906
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,440
太吵了
too chatty.

907
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,230
同意
Agreed.

908
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,190
辩护人 请注意
Please watch it, counsel.

909
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:15,690
抱歉
I apologize.

910
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:19,450
那我向下一位候选人提问
I will ask the next candidate.

911
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,490
怎么这么久
It's taking a long time.

912
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:41,090
这是什么
What is this?

913
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,390
现在开始对被告李明浩
The jury trial for Defendant Lee Myeongho

914
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:47,980
违反《特定犯罪加重处罚等 相关法律》的案件
on the violation of the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes

915
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,520
进行国民陪审
will now begin.

916
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:53,610
本陪审团郑重宣誓 在此次审判中
We, the jury, do solemnly swear

917
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,820
将公正地评估事实
to justly evaluate the facts

918
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,990
并根据本庭所阐述的法律和证据
and to render a verdict

919
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:02,570
作出公证真实的裁议
according to the evidence and law presented by this court.

920
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,160
被告在首尔站男洗手间内
The defendant was arrested

921
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,830
企图盗窃一名醉酒行人的钱包
on the charges of attempted theft against a drunk individual

922
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:11,040
最终因盗窃未遂被捕
inside a men's restroom at Seoul Station.

923
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:14,040
被告有四次盗窃前科
The defendant's been convicted on identical charges four times.

924
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:17,300
并且案件发生在他出狱两个月后
In addition, the incident occurred two months after his release.

925
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,920
这两点无法忽视 因此我方提起公诉
Therefore, charges have been pressed.

926
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,510
检方的公诉内容是否属实
Does the defense agree with the allegation?

927
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,930
被告否认这一指控
The defendant denies the allegation.

928
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:28,390
被告
The defendant...

929
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,270
并不是想偷钱包
was not trying to steal a wallet.

930
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:34,310
他只是搀扶了一下 因喝醉而即将摔倒的行人
He was trying to help a drunk man from falling down.

931
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,400
检方 请讲
Prosecution, go ahead.

932
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:42,570
我方申请案发现场的 那位行人出庭作证
The prosecution requests as a witness, the man who was present at the scene.

933
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:43,990
证人席
WITNESS

934
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,870
证人 案发当时发生了什么事
Sir. What happened at the time of the incident?

935
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,580
这事我记得很清楚
I remember it clearly.

936
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,340
当时我正在洗手间小便
I was urinating in the restroom.

937
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:57,840
-你没事吧 -我感觉有人从后面
Oh, my! Are you okay?

938
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,960
-你没事吧 -我感觉有人从后面
I felt someone putting his hand in my pocket from the back.

939
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,260
把手伸进了我左边的口袋
I felt someone putting his hand in my pocket from the back.

940
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,800
所以我就抓住他了
-What are you doing? -So I caught him.

941
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,680
这里有小偷
There's a pickpocket here!

942
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,140
我到警察局一看
I found out at the police station

943
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,970
发现他犯案不是一两次了
that it wasn't his first time.

944
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,220
这不是很明显嘛
There was no doubt.

945
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,350
被告席 辩护人席

946
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:12,770
我问完了
That will be all.

947
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,850
辩护人 请进行反询问
The defense counsel may cross-examine.

948
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:17,230
好的
Yes, Your Honor.

949
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:19,480
证人
Witness.

950
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:23,320
你在案发时
At the time of the incident,

951
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:24,860
处于醉酒状态 对吧
weren't you drunk?

952
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,780
所以呢
So, what?

953
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,740
你在接受警方调查时
According to the police report,

954
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:33,330
说你喝了两杯啤酒
you testified that you had two glasses of beer.

955
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:34,870
对
Yes.

956
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,790
你确定是两杯啤酒吗
Did you just have two glasses of beer?

957
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,090
没掺烧酒吗
Did you mix soju with it?

958
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,800
-没有 -一滴也没有吗
-No. -Not even a drop?

959
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:45,050
我不记得了
I don't remember.

960
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:48,510
你不记得了
You don't remember...

961
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:50,720
你平时不喝烧啤吗
Don't you usually drink somaek?

962
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,720
顺便说一句 我也喜欢这样喝
I love somaek too.

963
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,230
-我反对 -同意
-Objection. -Sustained.

964
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,980
请提与本案有关的问题
Please stick to the questions that pertain to the case.

965
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,150
我是要印证证词的可信度
I am trying to establish credibility.

966
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,740
证人在案发前后的记忆是否准确呢
Would the witness accurately remember the facts before and after the incident?

967
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:06,280
所以我准备了一段监控录像
So, I brought a CCTV clip.

968
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:15,120
请看录像
Please take a look.

969
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,540
在那里 我们可以看到 证人一行人所坐的桌子
There, we can see the table where the witness and his party were seated.

970
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,130
他们究竟在干什么呢
But what was happening there?

971
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,300
你在干什么
What were you doing?

972
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:29,930
你正把烧酒和啤酒混在一起 对吧
You were making somaek. Right?

973
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,310
混完后 你分给了你的同伴
You made it and passed it around to your friends.

974
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:38,400
你也喝了吗
Did you drink it too? Did you drink it?

975
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,820
你大喝特喝…
You chugged--

976
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,070
抱歉 你也喝了
I apologize, you took a drink.

977
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:50,450
审判长
Your Honor,

978
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:54,200
辩护人正在亵渎神圣的法庭
the defense counsel is desecrating this courtroom.

979
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,540
辩护人 请你注意
Please watch your tone, counsel.

980
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,960
我知道了
I will, Your Honor.

981
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,960
证人 你说你喝了两杯啤酒
You claimed you had two glasses of beer,

982
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,170
但事实证明不是两杯啤酒
but we now see that you had more.

983
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,880
你承认你的记忆有可能是错的吗
Do you agree that your memory could be wrong?

984
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,630
那是因为我喝醉了
That was because I was drunk.

985
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,550
你有可能会产生错觉 这是可能的
It's possible to be mistaken. It is possible.

986
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,350
如果是这样的话
Then please tell me, would it be possible

987
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,640
被告是为了扶住站不稳的你 才抱住你的
that the defendant was indeed trying to help you,

988
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,520
而你却误认为他要偷你的钱包
but you mistook him for a pickpocket

989
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,730
是不是有这种可能性呢
while being drunk?

990
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,990
证人 没有人会因为你产生错觉 而对你不利
Sir. There will be no harm or disadvantage against you

991
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:30,860
或造成伤害
just because you were mistaken.

992
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,450
但是你的证词
But the defendant's life is at stake

993
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,160
关系到被告的人生
based on your testimony.

994
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,250
被告席
DEFENDANT

995
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,840
辩护人正在进行诱导性询问
The defense is leading the witness.

996
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,800
根据《刑事诉讼法》 在进行反询问时允许诱导性询问
Under the Criminal Procedure Act, it is permitted in cross-examination.

997
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:49,800
你不知道吗
Didn't you know?

998
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,100
但是审判长 现在存在 辩护人扭曲证人记忆
Your Honor, but there is a risk of confusion

999
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:56,720
或混淆其记忆的风险
or distorting the memory of the witness.

1000
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,270
同意
Agreed.

1001
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,650
证人 请你再仔细想一下
Sir. Please think it over.

1002
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:07,070
被告明确说到 是你即将要摔倒
The defendant clearly says he caught you from falling down

1003
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,450
他是为了扶你才抱住你的
when you lost your balance.

1004
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,830
就算你是律师
Even if it's your job,

1005
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,790
也得为值得辩护的人辩护啊
think about who you're defending.

1006
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,670
那个人可是有四次盗窃前科
That man is a pickpocket with four convictions!

1007
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,710
证人
The witness will only answer the question that was asked.

1008
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,250
请只回答所问的问题
The witness will only answer the question that was asked.

1009
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,510
-是他在胡说八道 -证人
-It was a stupid question. -Witness!

1010
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,130
问题是什么来着
What was the question?

1011
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,760
看来你的记忆力平时也不怎么好啊
I guess your memory is not that good during the day either.

1012
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:38,680
-辩护人 -好 我承认 我问完了
-Defense counsel. -I acknowledge. That will be all.

1013
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,520
检方 请进行反询问
The prosecution will now cross-examine.

1014
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:50,610
那家伙是谁
Who is that guy?

1015
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,570
那是被告的律师
That's the defendant's attorney.

1016
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,330
被告主张他本是想要
The defendant claims he was helping the witness

1017
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,620
搀扶喝醉的证人
who was drunk from falling down.

1018
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,540
被告的话究竟有多少可信度呢
Let's see how credible his testimony is.

1019
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:08,380
现在大家看到的是被告在高中辍学前
What we can see is the defendant's student record

1020
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:08,670
学生时期的学生档案
What we can see is the defendant's student record

1021
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,760
学生时期的学生档案
up to the point he dropped out of high school.

1022
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,590
但是大家可以看到这十年间 他有一个问题不断被指出来
There is a consistent comment throughout his ten years of school.

1023
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:19,760
他经常偷朋友的东西
"He frequently steals from his friends."

1024
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:22,020
手脚不干净
"He has a bad habit of stealing."

1025
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:23,640
盗窃成性
"He steals."

1026
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:29,320
正如大家所看到的 被告从小就有偷东西的习惯
As you can see, his habit of stealing started from a young age.

1027
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:33,400
长大成人后 他作为一个 有四次盗窃前科的前科犯
Even as an adult, he lived a life of a thief

1028
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,070
数次被送进监狱
that sent him to jail four times.

1029
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:39,120
被告这样的人不是觊觎 喝醉的受害人的钱包
I ask the jury to consider the defendant's credibility,

1030
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:41,290
而是想要搀扶受害人的这种说法
when he claimed

1031
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:45,370
请大家判断一下 这究竟有多少可信度呢
that he was helping a drunk man, not stealing his wallet.

1032
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,380
检察官说得对
The prosecutor is right.

1033
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:56,510
但律师的话也有道理 不是吗
But doesn't the defense attorney have a good point?

1034
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,180
不 他有四次盗窃前科的话
No. If he is a four-time convicted pickpocket,

1035
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:01,720
就算他不想偷 手也会自动伸过去吧
his hands would act without even thinking.

1036
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:04,310
盗窃这种习惯一辈子也改不掉
That kind of habit can't be cured.

1037
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:07,020
那我们也要再看看
But we should wait and see.

1038
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,730
庭审还没有结束呢
The trial isn't over yet.

1039
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,610
唉唷 还有什么可看的
My gosh. There is nothing more to see.

1040
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:13,190
这显而易见嘛
It's obvious.

1041
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,040
对不起 我活成这个样子
I'm sorry. The choices I made in life brought me here.

1042
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,410
他们宁愿相信醉汉的话
They would believe a drunk man

1043
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,670
也不会相信前科犯的话
over an ex-convict.

1044
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,630
也是 换做我也不相信
I would do the same too.

1045
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,260
昭弥妈妈
SOMI'S MOM

1046
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:37,930
千律师 昭弥晕倒了
Mr. Cheon. Somi just fainted.

1047
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:39,890
我去医院看她动手术
We're on our way to the hospital for her surgery.

1048
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:45,930
李明浩
Mr. Lee,

1049
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,610
别人是否相信你并不重要
it's not important whether the others believe you or not.

1050
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:53,480
你做了什么
You know what you did,

1051
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:55,530
你自己是最清楚的
better than anyone.

1052
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,740
让我们把氛围扭转过来吧
