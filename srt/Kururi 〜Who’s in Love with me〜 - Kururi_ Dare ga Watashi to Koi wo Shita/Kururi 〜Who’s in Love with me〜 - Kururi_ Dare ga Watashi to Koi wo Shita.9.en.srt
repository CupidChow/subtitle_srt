1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,950
<i>Makoto loses her memories after a nighttime fall among the cherry blossoms raining down.</i>

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,970
<i>She searches for her love and herself</i>

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:14,310
<i>with a man's ring as her guide.</i>

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,790
<i>As she navigates her amnesia, three men come into her life.</i>

5
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:20,670
<i>One claims to be her ex,</i>

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,950
<i>another her friend,</i>

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,840
<i>and another her destiny.</i>

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,990
<i>With their help, Makoto-chan believes in herself and begins to move forward.</i>

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,790
<i>However, as her memories slowly return,</i>

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,420
<i>Makoto begins to have doubts about these three.</i>

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,420
<i>What's wrong?</i>

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,580
<i>We hadn't met before I lost my memories, had we?</i>

13
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,650
<i>Why ask?</i>

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,920
<i>I'm not really your friend.</i>

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,040
<i>What secrets do they hold?</i>

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,960
<i>Who is the man behind the ring?</i>

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,320
<i>I can't remember whom this ring was for.</i>

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,530
<i>Given my situation, should I really be falling in love?</i>

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,700
<i>But you've already fallen for someone, haven't you?</i>

20
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,510
<i>Even while you were with me, wasn’t he the one on your mind all along?</i>

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,680
Welcome.
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,340
Sorry, I'm not here to buy flowers.
<i>[Episode 9]</i>

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,010
I just wanted to see you.

24
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,390
I was worried since I hadn't heard from you since last time.

25
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,940
Sorry for not getting in touch.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,990
- I was having trouble choosing a nice date spot.
- Pardon?

27
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,560
You asked me to think of where I'd want to go for our date.

28
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,840
But you know me; I never had any hobbies.

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,560
So I'm kind of stumped.

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,010
I did consider stuff like going to the movies or a museum, but...

31
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,400
I'd rather spend our time talking to each other, not in silence.

32
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,860
Then I became more stuck.

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,000
You put that much thought into it?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wait, were you joking?

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,300
No, but you didn’t have to take it so seriously.

36
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,050
I would have preferred if you had contacted me.

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,110
Sorry.

38
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,520
How about we start our day walking around?

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,860
We can think of places to go as we walk.

40
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,230
Sure.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,760
- Oh?
- Yes?

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,550
Where's your ring on a necklace?

43
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,920
I'm fine without that ring now.

44
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,450
I feel bad for my past self and for the person the ring was meant for.

45
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,460
But the current me doesn’t need it.

46
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,680
Is that so?

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,110
Yes.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,400
I almost forgot.

49
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,000
- Scented candles?
- Yes.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,790
I've been wanting to sell scented candles made with dried flowers,

51
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,360
and seeing your flower ring boxes inspired me to start the project.

52
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,550
- May I get your help?
- Sure.

53
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,020
So... scented candles.

54
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,060
Give me your thoughts on these scents.

55
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,800
- That's more interesting to you than flowers, right?
- Yes.

56
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,220
That smells good.

57
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,440
And not appetizing, right?

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Hey.

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,240
Smell these candles and tell me what you think.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,550
I will do that.

61
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,700
I like this one.

62
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,120
We now offer a new variety of ring boxes.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,150
Please pick whichever color you'd like.

64
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,610
They're all so pretty!

65
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,360
Which one should I get?

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,090
- They seem to be a hit.
- Yes.

67
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,990
By the way, Kotaro-kun dropped off dried flowers the other day.

68
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,210
- Yes, I heard.
- Is that so?

69
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,020
Thank you again for turning my ring into a necklace.

70
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,760
- Of course.
- It served as my good-luck charm, but...

71
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,730
Then we will contact you once the box is complete.

72
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,830
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,290
I can't wait!

74
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,930
Thank you, please come again.

75
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,500
How many does that make?

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,870
She was the fourth.

77
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,250
The fourth what?

78
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:47,900
Every time that man visits, he gets a pair of rings with a different girl.

79
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:50,190
- And she was the fourth.
- What?

80
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,410
I'm actually impressed that he brings all the girls to our store.

81
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,680
You could say we have his trust.

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,010
As professionals who cooperate with his lies?

83
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,910
In a way, we’re lying out of kindness.

84
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,270
Wait, isn't our lie cruel?

85
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,710
There are varied lies,

86
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,100
and some are necessary in our profession.

87
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,990
A necessary lie?

88
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,010
In any case, we never know what others are going through.

89
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:28,280
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ❤️‍🔥 The Challengers of Love❤️‍🔥 Team</i>

90
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,050
<i>I'm sorry. I've never seen you in that way before.</i>

91
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,680
<i>You're free to think of flowers however you want,</i>

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,880
<i>but please come here when you find them pretty, since it is a flower shop.</i>

93
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,380
I see. So you got rejected properly

94
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,890
Good job! You did really well.

95
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,530
Well, personally, I'm happy enough to remain as Ogata's friend.

96
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,210
That was an awesome expression! You looked cooler than ever.

97
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,040
Is that supposed to make me feel better?

98
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,790
But I'll be fine.

99
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll continue to be there for her, as a friend.

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,260
The issue now is what happens if her memories return.

101
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,610
I suppose you're hoping they do.

102
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,610
I don't mind either way,

103
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,320
although I'd like her to remember sharing her cup noodles with me.

104
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,780
All right. Let's eat ramen.

105
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,550
We don't serve any here so I'll Uber some.

106
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,880
Is that even allowed?

107
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,950
No, but I can at least treat you to cup noodles.

108
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,690
Please don't tarnish my memories.

109
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,050
"Tarnish"? How rude.

110
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:56,550
In any case, my priority is seeing Makoto-chan find happiness.

111
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,390
Before she lost her memories, I'd barely spoken a word to her.

112
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,830
Is that right?

113
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,570
She mistook my room for hers the day she left the hospital.

114
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,380
She was searching her phone for clues of herself,

115
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,690
and she couldn't even decide what outfit was "normal" for her.

116
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,560
At first, I hoped she would regain her memories soon.

117
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,000
But now, I'm not too certain,

118
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,010
though maybe it's best she remembers, for her safety.

119
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,730
"For her safety"?

120
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,980
The other day, she recalled something about being stalked.

121
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,360
What?

122
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,420
She's safe now.

123
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:44,010
But it would be better if she knew, in case something happens.

124
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,250
A stalker...

125
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,570
This is starting to really hurt.

126
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,440
It hurts!

127
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,330
Darn it!

128
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,790
What are you doing?

129
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,580
I was wondering if they'd have a scent.

130
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,510
A delicious scent, maybe?

131
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,060
Those are edible flowers, after all.

132
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,930
- Wait, seriously?
- Yes.

133
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,580
But don't eat those. Edible ones need to be properly cultivated.

134
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,300
I won't.

135
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,440
I didn't realize there were so many edible flowers though.

136
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,150
- It's okay.
- Sorry?

137
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:10,430
Come by even if you don’t find the flowers pretty or aren’t buying anything.

138
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,110
Okay.

139
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,610
<i>It smells melancholic, but also quite good.</i>

140
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,050
Honestly, I didn't think they smelled particularly good.

141
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:40,670
But if I ever find flowers pretty,

142
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,450
I might enjoy the changing seasons even more.

143
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,320
I guess.

144
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,120
Then I'll look forward to it.

145
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,270
Are you jealous? I’ve still got my first experience to look forward to.

146
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,130
I admit, I am.

147
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,010
I knew it.

148
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,740
- Shall we get going?
- Sure.

149
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,900
Something smells good.

150
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,930
- Crepes?
- No, it's waffles.

151
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,450
Can you tell the difference by how they smell?

152
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,140
Of course, I can.

153
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,700
- What is it?
- There was a bug.

154
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,460
Even as a florist, are you scared of bugs?

155
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,450
I'm not scared; I just don't like them.

156
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,430
Sounds rough. Flowers have plenty of bugs around them, right?

157
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:38,020
It's not rough at all.

158
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:44,960
Which are you eyeing? The strawberry or this one?

159
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,600
The plain? I'm thinking chocolate or custard.

160
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,480
Sounds good.

161
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,040
- Here you go.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

162
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,180
<i>Let's eat.</i>

163
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,350
- This is really good.
- So is mine.

164
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,070
- You have cream all over your face.
- No, I don't.

165
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,170
So do you.

166
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,010
So good!

167
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:10,630
Are you still eating?

168
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,010
Try this one, too.

169
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,670
I already had some.

170
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,700
I want you to have another. It's really good.

171
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,550
Still good.

172
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,630
Right?

173
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:27,200
So you prefer to share the food you like.

174
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,380
Yes, because I want to share the joy too.

175
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,780
Then I'll have another.

176
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,520
Hey!

177
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,890
Delicious.

178
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,620
- How's yours?
- It's just okay.

179
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,050
- Thanks.
- Hey!

180
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,850
You're stuffing yourself.

181
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,740
<i>Maybe add this sauce.</i>

182
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,200
<i>Okay, even better.</i>

183
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
- This is so cute.
- Looks just like you.

184
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,070
- No, like you.
- How?

185
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,520
Flower shaped... sugar?

186
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,330
- Did you make this too?
- Of course not.

187
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,640
It's cute.

188
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,430
I wanted a ring.

189
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,550
Is that so?

190
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,360
This is good.

191
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,400
- It really suits you.
- It's cute. It looks nice.

192
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,850
It's cute.

193
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,030
I found something that would suit you.

194
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,990
Really? Let's check it out.

195
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,100
I appreciate the gift, but why an umbrella? It's not raining.

196
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,210
- I just wanted to get it for you.
- But why?

197
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,810
I just felt like it.

198
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,480
If you say so. Thanks.

199
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,280
Want something to drink?

200
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,610
Sure. I'll pay, as thanks for the umbrella.

201
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,640
I'm not letting a younger, amnesiac, gluttonous artisan trainee treat me.

202
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,960
Must you call me "gluttonous"?

203
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:58,260
- Is anything okay?
- I'll take an iced latte with low fat milk and extra sugar.

204
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,150
"Low fat"... okay.

205
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,560
Could I get an iced latte with... This.

206
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,230
- This low...
- Low fat milk?

207
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,980
<i>Would you like to join us for coffee?</i>

208
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,870
<i>"Love makes even faults look charming."</i>

209
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,690
- Here's your drink.
- Thanks.

210
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,550
- Oh, a ladybug!
- What?

211
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,290
- Did I step on it?
- Looks like it flew away.

212
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,720
The receptionist at the clinic I visit is my doctor's younger sister.

213
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,840
Her name is Chigusa-san, and she is really charming. And she said...

214
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,240
What?

215
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,900
- Sensei?
- What?

216
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,670
That's my doctor I just mentioned.

217
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,230
- Sensei.
- Ogata-san?

218
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,360
- Is everything all right?
- Actually, Chigusa-san has gone missing.

219
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,140
I was keeping a careful eye on her,

220
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,800
but she may have forgotten her way here.

221
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,020
- We'd like to help find her.
- Oh, no.

222
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,580
It's fine; she has my number for emergencies.

223
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,160
I'm certain she's nearby.

224
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,850
Let's look for her together.

225
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,360
- But...
- Do you have a picture of her?

226
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,050
Do you know places she may visit?

227
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,700
Thank you.

228
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,200
Here... h-here is a picture of her.

229
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,280
Chigusa-san has early-onset dementia.

230
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't think she will recognize me,

231
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,680
even if I walk by.

232
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,200
Let's split up to cover more ground. I'll go this way.

233
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,270
- Have you seen this woman?
- No.

234
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,260
I see. Thank you.

235
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,980
Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?

236
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,590
Chigusa...

237
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,290
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

238
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,760
Have you seen this woman?

239
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,580
Excuse me. I'm currently searching for someone.

240
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,680
Excuse me, have you seen this woman by any chance?

241
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,890
Here you go.

242
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,370
- Here...
- Excuse me. I'm actually looking for someone.

243
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,490
Have you seen this woman around the area?

244
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,910
Thank you.

245
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,280
Excuse me. Have you seen this woman by any chance?

246
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,650
I can't say I have.

247
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,140
I see. Thank you.

248
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,020
Did you find her?

249
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,400
Kotaro-san?

250
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,220
Oh my...

251
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,470
Where is my wallet?

252
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,930
Sorry. Just a moment.

253
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,040
Chigusa-san.

254
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,690
Have you forgotten your wallet?

255
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,410
It seems like it, yes.

256
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,650
Were you hoping to buy some flowers?

257
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,950
Yes. They were to be a gift.

258
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,300
May I ask whom they are for?

259
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,690
They're for someone I love.

260
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,780
I want to wish for their happiness.

261
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,100
I see.

262
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,530
I wonder what suits this occasion.

263
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,370
- Pardon?
- If you don't mind, may I help pick your gift?

264
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,550
I actually quite like flowers.

265
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,230
He's truly knowledgeable about them.

266
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,070
I see. Then I would appreciate your expertise.

267
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:36,800
Were there any colors or specific flower varieties you had in mind?

268
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,140
Then how about we pick something to do with you, Chigusa-san.

269
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,760
- Me?
- Yes.

270
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
For example, because your name is "Chigusa-san"...

271
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,890
Let's see.

272
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,820
You could get a bold, lush green bouquet ("Gusa" is grass, herb).

273
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,320
"A bold, lush green bouquet"?

274
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,110
I'm flattered.

275
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,610
How about this flower, for example?

276
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,620
Although it's green, this is a hydrangea.

277
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,330
You also mentioned this was for someone you loved, yes?

278
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,170
In that case, I recommend these Bouvardias.

279
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,340
Thank you.

280
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,600
Chigusa-san!

281
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,190
Chigusa-san! Gosh!

282
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,800
Thank goodness.

283
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,730
Thank goodness you're okay.

284
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,530
I apologize for the trouble. Thank you so much.

285
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,190
Of course.

286
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,560
Goodness, you look absolutely exhausted.

287
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,950
Where have you been, Dear?

288
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:52,410
I wanted to buy some flowers,

289
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,530
but I had forgotten my wallet.

290
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,450
Today is our anniversary, remember?

291
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,330
Yes, it is.

292
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,130
Let's put these up when we return home.

293
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:20,270
Taro-san, I was so lucky to run into your acquaintances at the florist.

294
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,560
Are you two married?

295
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,420
Yes, for 16 years now.

296
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,010
Don't tell me you forgot, Dear.

297
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,160
Of course not.

298
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,010
For you.

299
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,450
Let me be the gift-giver every once in a while.

300
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,880
Aren't they beautiful?

301
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:04,940
We picked these flowers from my name, "Chigusa."

302
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:15,020
They are bold, lush green flowers.

303
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,430
Chigusa-san...

304
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,410
Chigusa...

305
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,280
What's the matter, Taro-san?

306
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,410
Taro-san?

307
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,640
Did my present move you to tears?

308
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,160
My goodness...

309
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,470
Everything will be okay.

310
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,170
You're okay, my dear.

311
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,050
Thank you both for everything.

312
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,450
- How much was this?
- Please, it's all right.

313
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,540
Let it be an anniversary gift from us both.

314
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Oh, I couldn't.

315
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,650
We’d love to gift it to you. It's your sixteenth wedding anniversary, isn't it?

316
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,400
It's actually our twenty-ninth.

317
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,220
It seems she's regressed quite a few years.

318
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,410
Please enjoy the rest of your anniversary with the flowers.

319
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,430
Ogata-san...

320
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,300
I'll gladly accept this generous gift.

321
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,060
Chigusa-san, they've given this to us as a gift.

322
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,900
Oh goodness, thank you so much.

323
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,980
Of course. It's the least I could do for Sensei.

324
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,510
We're happy we could give you a gift.

325
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,280
Thank you again, truly.

326
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,770
- Shall we get going, Chigusa-san?
- Yes.

327
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,180
Have a good day, you both.

328
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,180
- What beautiful flowers.
- Indeed.

329
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,070
How about we also buy ourselves a cake?

330
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,170
Sounds wonderful.

331
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,150
<i>That was beautiful.</i>

332
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,920
<i>The bouquet was absolutely amazing.</i>

333
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,590
It was nothing.

334
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,910
Thank you. I'm really happy for them.

335
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:57,000
Sensei once told me not to blame myself,

336
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,550
even if I had forgotten those important to me.

337
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,830
He said he wouldn't mind being forgotten,

338
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:13,460
so long as his special someone was happy and well.

339
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,310
He was glad to be the forgotten one and not the other way around.

340
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,180
So he was speaking about himself.

341
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:35,040
Or... or he's trying to convince himself and isn't being true to himself.

342
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,270
He must have been so hurt when he was forgotten.

343
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,330
He was really happy today,

344
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,840
yet here I am...

345
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,280
Makoto?

346
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,000
Thanks for the umbrella. I'll treasure it.

347
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,770
I'll use it only around the neighborhood so I don't lose it.

348
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,360
An umbrella is to be used.

349
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,530
If you lose it, I'll buy you another.

350
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,250
- Thanks.
- Okay.

351
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,940
Don't forget to lock up

352
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,060
and no staying up too late.

353
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,030
No more snacking either.

354
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,920
I know, I know.

355
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,980
Well, good night.

356
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,640
Good night.

357
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,810
- Welcome.
<i>- Welcome.</i>

358
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,470
- Makoto-chan!
- Mio-chan?

359
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,480
Kotaro directed us to your shop.

360
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,040
Did he now?

361
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,620
Yes! Because I love rings.

362
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,040
Oh, that’s right!

363
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,720
May I browse a bit while I'm here?

364
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,420
Of course. Take your time.

365
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,150
Why do you like rings, Mio-chan?

366
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,790
It's because they're cute,

367
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:27,080
and they let you show your love.

368
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,040
That's true.

369
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,210
Do you make rings here?

370
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,500
We do. You put it on the stick

371
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,520
and hammer it, like this.

372
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,130
That's amazing!

373
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,900
<i>Thank you. Bye.</i>

374
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,020
Welcome.

375
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,810
Kotaro-san.

376
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,120
Welcome. Is that...

377
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,360
I intended to just browse, but I ended up buying something.

378
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,810
- And no telling Daddy, right?
- Right.

379
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,640
Mio-chan, can you lie to Daddy?

380
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,350
Yes! This is meant to help Mommy and Daddy get along.

381
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,660
"To help Mommy and Daddy get along"?

382
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:45,640
But if he finds out, will they not get along?

383
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,820
I'm not sure.

384
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,410
You might have to tell him the truth eventually.

385
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,160
But Mommy is lying because she loves Daddy, right?

386
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,000
But I think people should give flowers to those they love.

387
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,630
I think so, too.

388
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,290
<i>[Ritsu - One new message]</i>

389
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,600
<i>[My ankle was twisted badly. Won't you come visit?]</i>

390
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,860
Ritsu...

391
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,080
<i>Maybe I'm getting anxious.</i>

392
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,520
<i>I have plenty that I want to say, but maybe not today.</i>

393
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:43,630
So you really do own a company.

394
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:47,890
- Finally impressed?
- I've always been impressed by your work.

395
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,370
"My work"?

396
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,420
Hey, I thought your ankle was hurt badly.

397
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,380
It was, but you blew all that pain away.

398
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,310
Oh, right, here's a little something.

399
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,420
Thanks.

400
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,590
How has it been going with Asahi since then?

401
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,810
Nothing has changed. We're still friends.

402
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,020
He's my closest male friend.

403
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,810
I see.

404
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,980
So he was rejected.

405
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,620
Ritsu...

406
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,330
I'm sorry. That’s because it affects me, too.

407
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,400
- Ritsu, listen...
- Don't decide right now.

408
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,060
Please don’t make a decision about me yet.

409
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,950
Please don't make final decisions on important matters.

410
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,730
But I need to decide, including important matters.

411
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,560
I have to go on as I am now.

412
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,900
If you do so, you might make mistakes.

413
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,840
Makoto-san, what happened to your ring?

414
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,550
I don't see your necklace.

415
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,580
I decided to take it off.

416
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,020
Does that mean you're choosing to forget the person it was for?

417
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,230
No, not for now.

418
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,960
I suppose you wouldn't.

419
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:47,160
He could be waiting for you to get in touch with him.

420
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,200
That hurts!

421
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:11,500
I want her to hold on to the ring a little longer.

422
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,780
<i>Don't decide right now.</i>

423
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,830
<i>Please don’t make a decision about me yet.</i>

424
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,270
<i>Please don't make final decisions on important matters.</i>

425
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,430
<i>Ogata-san.</i>

426
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,600
<i>Here, this is for you.</i>

427
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,260
<i>Thank you.</i>

428
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,990
<i>Sorry, "being closest among our peers" was actually a lie.</i>

429
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:14,230
<i>We were just co-workers. We barely even spoke.</i>

430
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,440
What does it mean?

431
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,850
<i>I'm sorry. I've never seen you in that way before.</i>

432
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,190
What was that?

433
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,210
<i>Wait!</i>

434
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,040
I don't understand.

435
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,280
- Hello there.
- Hello.

436
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,010
- I'm here to check in.
- Sure.

437
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,200
That's a beautiful ring.

438
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,960
Isn't it?

439
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,380
Very.

440
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,140
<i>I showed you something embarrassing, but thank you for helping me.</i>

441
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,850
It’s my pleasure. I’m glad it went smoothly.

442
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,210
How is Chigusa-san?

443
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,060
As you may have noticed,

444
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:29,440
she believes that I am her older brother due to her dementia.

445
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,590
<i>- I see.
- Please take care.</i>

446
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:38,280
Although she recalled who I was the other day, I am now back to being her "older brother."

447
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:44,240
Would I misremember things in a similar way?

448
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,350
In your case, I don't believe so.

449
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:55,980
However, memories can be deceptive, whether or not you have amnesia.

450
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,150
"Memories can be deceptive"?

451
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,810
Your memories can bend the reality of a situation

452
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:07,310
depending on your mental state and circumstances at the time.

453
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,100
Did anything happen?

454
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:15,090
Several memories I've recalled don't align with what I've been told.

455
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,440
I understand.

456
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,190
In my current ambiguous state,

457
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,520
I wonder if I can make important decisions properly.

458
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:32,220
Ogata-san, there is no right or wrong to how you feel.

459
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:38,540
What you're feeling right now is real, at the very least.

460
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,400
What I'm feeling...

461
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,290
Oh, yes, please give my thanks to that man as well.

462
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,760
Chigusa's bouquet is still in full bloom in our home.

463
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,370
We are so incredibly grateful for what he has done.

464
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,570
My feelings...

465
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,410
♫ <i>The sound stopped; the color changed</i> ♫

466
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,180
♫ <i>It was blank, beyond my memory</i> ♫

467
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,580
♫ <i>It's like a drama; my heart is beating</i> ♫

468
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,660
♫ <i>I wonder</i> ♫

469
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,120
♫ <i>Retracing my footsteps</i> ♫

470
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,270
<i>In other words, why not give this new you a chance?</i>

471
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:49,210
♫ <i>I put on an act of a people-pleaser</i> ♫

472
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,810
♫ <i>The sparkle is over the other side of the mist</i> ♫

♫ <i>Will surely come. I want to gaze</i> ♫

477
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,980
Kotaro-san.

478
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,810
Great timing.

479
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:17,170
I tried ordering some edible flowers.

480
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:20,710
♫ <i>The nuanced colors</i> ♫

481
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:24,840
- For me?
- Who else would be happy to get edible flowers?

482
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:29,410
♫ <i>With your honest palette</i> ♫

483
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,570
I'm so happy.

484
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,250
I'm truly happy.

485
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,320
It made me want to go on a date.

486
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,800
♫ <i>The sound stopped</i> ♫

487
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,240
I don’t care where, as long as we’re together.

488
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,890
♫ <i>Pieces of memory like a puzzle. Someone called</i> ♫

489
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,230
How about a place with edible flowers?

490
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,300
Sure. Let's go.

491
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,810
I think a botanical garden has them.

492
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,280
Okay.

493
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,800
Listen.

494
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:23,230
I'll be with you whether or not you have your memories.

495
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:33,160
If you feel you're hurting someone you've forgotten, then I'm just as guilty.

496
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,450
You're not the only one at fault.

497
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:43,250
If they’re happy as long as you're happy,

498
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,600
I’ll put a smile on your face.

499
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,680
Even if it's a lie,

500
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,360
I'll pretend to be fooled and make you smile.

501
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,430
To tell you the...

502
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,150
- It's a bit sweet.
- Really?

503
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,880
You're right.

504
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,040
Makoto?

505
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,220
I'm sorry. My head...

506
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,400
Are you all right, Makoto?

507
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,630
Yes, maybe it’s because I ran here.

508
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,620
I'll walk you back.

509
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,280
You're working, aren't you? I'll be fine.

510
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,100
- But...
- I'll see you later.

511
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,840
What was that just now?

512
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,160
<i>We celebrate five years since opening.</i>

513
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,840
<i>Is this edible?</i>

514
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,750
<i>I suppose if you try hard enough.</i>

515
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,490
<i>Good luck.</i>

516
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,210
The first time we met...

517
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,830
<i>Evening.</i>

518
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,720
- <i>Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.</i>

519
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,640
<i>My personality was as flat as I thought it was.</i>

520
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,590
Wait, what about my memory of having the ring made?

521
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:53,250
Wait, how much have I remembered?

522
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,790
<i>Wow, it's so beautiful.</i>

523
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,230
<i>Thanks for the flowers, Ritsu.</i>

524
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,130
<i>Of course. They're for our first anniversary.</i>

525
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,390
- <i>Are you happy?
- Yes, thank you.</i>

526
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,820
<i>I might actually enjoy goldfish scooping.</i>

527
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,160
<i>The Tokyo Tower sure is beautiful.</i>

528
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,570
<i>I like you.</i>

529
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,680
<i>I like you, too.</i>

530
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:54,660
I was dating Ritsu.

531
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:05,040
I can recall only up to last Christmas.

532
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,690
Then what about Kotaro-san?

533
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,350
<i>Ex-boyfriend, to be exact.</i>

534
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,180
<i>I wonder what I was passionate about. Would you know?</i>

535
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,090
<i>Sorry.</i>

536
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:26,050
<i>You must have already told me this when we were dating.</i>

537
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,090
<i>How did I react back then?</i>

538
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,570
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

539
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,820
<i>Why did we break up?</i>

540
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,300
- <i>I was dumped.
- Why?</i>

541
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,540
<i>Because you were two-timing me.</i>

542
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,390
Why? Kotaro-san.

543
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,850
He lied.

544
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:48,110
<i>I'll be with you whether or not you have your memories.</i>

545
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,520
<i>I'll put a smile on your face.</i>

546
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,530
What's the truth?
