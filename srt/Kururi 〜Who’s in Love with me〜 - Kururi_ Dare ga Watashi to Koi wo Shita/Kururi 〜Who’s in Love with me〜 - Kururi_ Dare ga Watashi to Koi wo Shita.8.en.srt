00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,870
When Makoto Ogata finds herself with no memory to her name,

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,890
she sets on searching for her love and herself

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,580
using one men's-sized ring as her guide.

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,060
As she navigates her amnesia, three men come into her life.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,110
One claims to be her ex. Another, her friend. And another, her destiny.

6
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:30,180
With their help, Makoto decides to finally put her past behind her.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,990
Love may even be in the cards.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:39,420
However, as her memories slowly return, Makoto begins to have her doubts about these three.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,580
Who is the man behind her ring?

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,340
What secrets do her three acquaintances hold?

11
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,350
What's wrong?

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,040
Someone is tailing me.

13
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,980
Huh? But yesterday, I was...

14
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,890
Thanks for walking me back.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,350
Sure. Will you be okay?

16
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,650
I'll be fine. Night.

17
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,360
Yeah.

18
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,190
O-Oh, it was only the wind.

19
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,230
I guess it's getting gusty out there.

20
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,410
Should I stay for a bit?

21
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,120
Huh?

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,100
I could use a cup of instant coffee.

23
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,640
- There.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,170
I think I remembered that incident you mentioned before.

25
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,430
One time, before your fall, you came running into my store at night.

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,600
You said someone was following you.

27
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,100
How much could you recall?

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,560
Do you know who was after you?

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,710
I only remember running into the store, nothing else.

30
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,920
I should've heard you out back then.

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,010
It's not...

32
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,200
Here, I'll see if I have something to eat.

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,060
Or was my coffee nasty enough to kill your appetite?

34
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,970
No.

35
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,280
It certainly tastes like instant coffee.

36
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,900
I'll head out once you fall asleep.

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,440
Huh?

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,070
I mean...

39
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,020
Huh, I wonder why my eyelids are drooping.

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,660

41

My apologies.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,330
I won't lose to some "nice guy".

44
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:02,030

45
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,130
What the...

46

47
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,200
Sorry, I didn't realize you'd stay the night.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,220
Thanks. I slept like an absolute log.

49
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,760
You could've left at any time though.

50
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,970
I couldn't leave your door unlocked. That'd be extra dangerous.

51
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,790
I'm sorry for freaking out yesterday.

52
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:42,410
I didn't just remember running into your store. I felt the fear again, too.

53
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,170
Oh, but I'm totally fine now. I promise.

54
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,270
Alright. Then I'll head out.

55
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,580
- Thanks again.
- Sure. If anything happens...

56
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,960
Or even if there's nothing, reach out.

57
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,000
I will.

58
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,740

61

62

If you can make a hoop, I'll give you a reward.

Hey, have you met up with Mr. Kotaro recently?

79
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,370
Yeah. I had him teach me how to play basketball.

80
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,600
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

You should join us next time.

Mr. Kotaro's a good teacher.

You're good friends with him, right?

Ogata, to tell you the truth...

It's back on.

87
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,360
Thanks a million, Asahi.

88

It's fine. I get asked to change bulbs at the office too.

89
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,240
As expected of Mr. Nice Guy. Your kindness knows no bounds.

90
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,990
That's not exactly it though.

91
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,660
It's not that I'm kind to everyone because I'm benevolent.

92
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,210
I'm just trying to avoid the stress it'd cause me, if I knew I hurt someone.

93

That's why I spread my goodwill thin, for my own sake.

94
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,740
I'd still call that kindness.

95
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,810
I don't enjoy being called a "nice guy" who's "kind to everyone".

96
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,500
Ogata. You're the one I want to treat with care.

97
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:19,410
I want to be kind to you, always.

98

Changing a bulb or two for you is nothing.

Mom's so proud of him...

107

But not only that, the Kotaro asked you out on a date?

So why are you feeling stumped?

110

I mean, I get it. I'd be stumped too.

111
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,460
Do you think I'm allowed to fall in love now?

112
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,950
What?

113
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,720
I can't remember who this ring was for, let alone anything else.

114
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,850
Given my situation, should I really be falling in love?

115
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,490
Because I'm scared I'll find someone, then remember they're not the one.

116
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,820
So that's what you're worried about.

117
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,090
Well, I can't give any advice on that front.

118
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:44,130
But hey, both Asahi and Kotaro asked you out knowing full well your circumstances.

119
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,680
Same goes for that Ritsu, too.

120

I'm sure it took them all a bit of courage to take initiative.

- Courage?
- Yeah.

So why not savor that love,

123
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:03,170
and enjoy the feeling of pining for someone, instead of letting your past bog you down?

When Makoto got into her accident, you were having a flower viewing party in the area, weren't you?

So you won't deny it either.

141

00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,260
As you can see, we all tend to forget things.

179
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,840
But just because you've forgotten,

180
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,610
does not mean you never consumed those nutrients.

181
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:12,840
Your experiences are what make you who you are now.

182
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,600
It doesn't mean it never happened...

183
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,020
I see.

184
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,930
- Thank you, Dr. Iguchi.
- I should be thanking you, Ms. Ogata.

185
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,530
You are treating Ms. Chigusa no differently from before.

186
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:32,960
- Of course.
- With early onset dementia,

187
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,970
she will only continue to forget.

188
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:42,250
Although some memories may return, it will only be brief.

189
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,150
- Take care.
- Thank you.

190

I'm sorry.

193
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,990
I was just thinking you always have the brightest smile.

194
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,410
Why thank you.

195
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,100
Ms. Chigusa. Could I ask you a question, as someone with more life experience?

196
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,750
A question?

197
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,640
Yes. What would you do, when you're unsure of the decision you should make?

198
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,130
The one I should make?

199
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,390
- Never mind, it's nothing.
- Well...

200
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:35,160
I simply hope to make the most of every day I wake up to.

201
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,550
And to do that, I've learned to accept the person I am that day.

202
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,660
To accept who I am...

203
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,230
Does that suffice as an answer?

204
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,750
Yes. Thank you.

You've come a long way since your first day though.

208
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,150
I put that ring on a chain so you could keep it on you, but remember.

209
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,550
A chain is never a shackle. Alright?

Yes, ma'am.

- No, not him.

220
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,170
Not him, which means with Asahi?

221
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,080
Didn't expect him to make the first move.

222
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,530
Sometimes you're a bit too perceptive, Ritsu.

223
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,920
- So, where are you two going?
- Ritsu.

224
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,100
Fine, fine. Asahi was a coworker of yours, right?

225
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,360
Yup. We apparently got along especially well.

226
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,450
I wonder if that's true.

Guys who are amicable to everyone

230
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:55,960
would never get especially close with one female coworker. It would be too risky.

231
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,330
Don't say stuff like that.

232
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,990

237

If Asahi wasn't actually a friend...

238
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,570
I'd start doubting everyone. Asahi really is a good guy, after all.

239
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,850
Fair point.

Ms. Ogata has been studying up on colors.

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,570
- Huh? Why?
- That's my line.

353
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,480
- You surprised me.
- I just happened to be in the area.

354
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,240
As if.

355
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,260
Say, do you recall working with a lady named Ms. Matsu -

356
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,820
Ogata.

357
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,560
Look at that.

358
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,340
I've got a message from Ms. Matsunaga. See you two around.

359
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,540
Ms. Matsunaga?

360
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,480
- The ocean!
- Someone please, stop my son!

361
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,800
I'm sorry about him! Thank you so much.

362
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,760
I told you not to go running, didn't I?

363
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,410
- Ouch...
- Are you okay?

364
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:39,600
- I'm fine.
- Is it broken?

365
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,160
Of course not. I just twisted it.

366
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,600
See you.

367
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,450
So it does hurt.

368
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,550
I'll be fine.

369
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,380
- What?
- I'll carry you to the road.

370
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,000
You shouldn't put pressure on it. Now hop on.

371
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,710
- I'll be fine.
- We can't just leave you here.

372
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,420
Ritsu.

373
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,180
Ugh...

374
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,650
This is why I hate kids.

375
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,890
You helped with the balloon though?

376
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,660
I hate kids that run. And only kids that run.

377
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,620
- I'll go grab our things.
- Thanks.

378
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,430
This is just the worst.

379
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,580
My leg hurts, and I'm making you look good.

380
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,460
I look so lame.

381
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,950
It's too bad, since you came to pester us despite your busy schedule.

382
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,150
Asahi.

383
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,770
Should I go buy a compress?

384
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,370
It's fine, I'll buy something cold for the swelling.

385
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,110
Thanks.

386
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,200
Wait here.

387
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,500
Is your ankle starting to swell?

388
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,900
No, it's fine.

389
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,290
That guy really is a nice person.

390
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,700
Honestly, it's a bit worrying.

391
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,090
That's Asahi for you.

392
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,070
Say, do you know a Ms. Matsunaga? She works at MONDO Beverage.

393
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,540
Ms. Matsunaga? Yeah.

394
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,760
Wait, you know her? How?

395
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,510
She worked for someone I know.

396
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,720
I see.

397
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,960
And according to her...

398
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,240
Asahi.

399
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,090
Sorry, what about her?

400
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:10,430
No, I just hear she's a hard worker.

401
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:14,150
Really? So she's always been like that.

402
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,500
Use this to cool your ankle. You should get to a hospital, too.

403
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:22,000
Thanks.

404
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,740
I'll go hail a taxi.

405
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,020
I take it all back.

406
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,780
You're not just some nice guy. You're a stupidly nice guy, and a worthy opponent.

407
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,050
Don't betray Ms. Makoto's trust, okay?

408
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,670
This place is seriously delicious.

409
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,100
I used to help negotiate beer sales with them.

410
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:08,800
Here's your platter!

411
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,970
Wow!

412
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:14,380
We owe plenty to Mr. Asahi here.

413
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,480
So here's a little extra, on the house.

414
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

415
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,290
Enjoy!

416
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:25,010
- This is a lot.
- Right? Better start digging in.

417
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,860
Yum.

418
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,350
- Asahi, you're "you", wherever you go.
- Huh?

419
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,960
I'll try some chicken, too.

420
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,880
Here's your sashimi mountain. Ain't it a beauty?

421
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,590
- Sir, we didn't...
- I told you, on the house.

422
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,180
- Say, you're Ms. Ogata, right?
- Yes.

423
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,560
You're so different, I almost didn't recognize you.

424
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,090
Don't act like you forgot. We were a thing back in the day.

425
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,530
Just pulling your leg!

426
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:15,220
Ms. Ogata visited once, remember? When she was still learning the ropes?

427
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,920
Yes, you're right. You were in the area.

428
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,380
- Oh, I see.
- In any case, you two enjoy yourselves.

429
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,470
- Please come again.
- Welcome!

430
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,230
Apparently, those windows will remain painted for a year.

431
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:41,170
- Really?
- We should go see them again.

432
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,670
Yeah.

433
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,570
Sorry.

434
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,200
It's fine.

435
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,930
This is probably the sort of situation where I shouldn't have let go, huh?

436
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,960
Asahi.

437
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,570
I made sure to stay aware of you all day today.

438
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:28,360
I thought about love, and how I feel about you, too.

439
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,800
Yeah.

440
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,900
I was reminded of how truly kind you are, Asahi.

441
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,250
It isn't easy, being kind to everyone. It requires a strong heart.

442
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,980
I felt comfortable with you.

443
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,860
Asahi, I...

444
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:56,170
I love you, Ogata.

445
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,150
I've liked you, since before you lost your memories.

446
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,350
But...

447
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,420
I like the person you've become even more.

448
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:16,260
You went and quit, despite my efforts to stop you from doing so.

449
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,820
You even became a jeweler, after I'd introduced you to a job.

450
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:28,020
But that's exactly why you're sparkling now, more than ever.

451
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,010
Asahi...

452
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,680
Back in Izu, you pretended to be my girlfriend.

453
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,600
After your reunion, you had to wear that uniform.

454
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,450
Today, you got paint on your face.

455
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,030
And I wish...

456
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:50,640
I wish I could monopolize all those aspects of you to myself.

457
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,210
Sorry.

458
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,280
I thought so.

459
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,150
No. What I mean is, I don't know if I'm allowed to love right now.

460
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,380
And personally, I don't think I am.

461
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,450
Because you've lost your memories?

462
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,630
I know that uncle was joking at the restaurant, but I still felt my heart clench.

463
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:24,220
I keep wondering what I'll do if the person behind this ring ever appears.

464
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:30,010
What if I fall in love, only to recall memories of someone else?

465
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't mind staying, until you do remember.

466
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,630
I don't even mind if you end up two-timing me.

467
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,080
Or three, or four-timing me.

468
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,020
- Asahi...
- That puts you in a fix, right?

469
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,110
And I'm not surprised. After all, you're not telling the entire truth.

470
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,510
Huh?

471
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,000
I'll be honest with you, so I want you to be honest with me too.

472
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,450
Ogata.

473
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:12,990
I'm... not really your friend.

474
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:23,070
I'm sorry. We didn't "get along especially well" at all.

475
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,820
We're just coworkers.

476
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,470
We barely even spoke.

477
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,050
You're kidding...

478
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,380
I fell in love with you that day we worked overtime together.

479
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,080
When you shared your cup noodles.

480
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,280
Just give it a bite.

481
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,650
I want more people to know how good this is.

482
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,990
Back then, you kept your distance from everyone.

483
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:48,510
Myself included, of course.

484
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,240
That day, an older coworker of ours blamed their mistake on me.

485
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,740
No one stood up for me, or even pretended to help.

486
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,030
But despite it being completely out of character for you, Ogata...

487
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:12,520
Ms. Ogata. You were the only one who stayed.

488
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,280
I had been watching you ever since.

489
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,540
So when I heard you lost your memories due to an accident,

490
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,700
I volunteered to go see you, on behalf of our team.

491
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,090
Is that why...

492
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,810
Ms. Ogata!

493
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,770
- Yum!
- Ms. Ogata...

494
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:43,980
Ogata, you and I got along especially well, even among our peers.

495
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,410
So you were...

496
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,060
Sorry.

497
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,050
I'm really, really sorry.

498
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,070
This must put you off. I'm playing completely dirty.

499
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,730
I'm seriously the worst.

500
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,550
But when I saw you, I just... had to speak to you.

501
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,000
And a friend would have the excuse to be close.

502
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,570
I got close, but I wanted to get closer. I got greedy.

503
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,950
This is my whole truth.

504
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:39,460
So you don't need to hold back either.

505
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:45,050
You say it's about the ring, and not being allowed to fall in love.

506
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,720
But really, you've already fallen for someone else, haven't you?

507
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,380
They were on your mind, even when you were with me today.

508
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:04,020
Even so, I had lots of fun.

509
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,980
I'd always wanted to try painting with you.

510
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,440
I'm sorry for deceiving you.

511
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,580
Please just forget about me. The sooner the better.

512
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,890
Sorry.

513
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,300
I probably won't forget the time we were friends.

514
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,760
Not until the day I die.

515
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,210
Well...

516
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,200
It was nice knowing you, Ms. Ogata.

517
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,430
I'm so put off.

518
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,940
Sorry.

519
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,810
It's seriously off-putting, you know?

520
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,650
I can't believe you would call me, "Ms. Ogata".

521
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,480
Just call me Ogata. We're friends, aren't we?

522
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,160
You know I'm lacking in that department.

523
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,490
If you decide to just up and leave,

524
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:38,340
no one will know I'm good at crane games.

525
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,740
No one will know the story behind my favorite picture book.

526
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,780
No one will know how pretty the Izu ocean was.

527
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:50,060
No one would know how I felt, the first time I made an actual ring.

528
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,800
To be honest...

529
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,340
To be honest,

530
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:06,040
I want to yank this necklace off of me.

531
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,060
I want it off.

532
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:17,800
I'm only telling you this because you're my best friend, Asahi.

533
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,000
Don't go ending our friendship on your terms.

534
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,790
Ogata...

535
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,640
A new day, huh?

536
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,380
- Welcome.
- Sorry, I'm not here to buy flowers.

537
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,180
I just wanted to see you.

538
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,700
[Lies]

539
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,860
How much have I remembered?
[All lies come to light...]

540
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,110
What's the truth?
[All lies come to light...]
