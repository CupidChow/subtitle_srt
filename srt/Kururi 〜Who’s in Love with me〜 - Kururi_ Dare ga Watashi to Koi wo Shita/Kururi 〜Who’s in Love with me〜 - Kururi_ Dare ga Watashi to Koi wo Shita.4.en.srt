1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,450
Did you just remember something?

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,130
No, nothing. Sorry.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,070
I was apparently going to give this to someone as a gift.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,220
Maybe it is fate.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,100
Where could he be?

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,650
Would you pursue a relationship, even though you've forgotten him?

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,220
If I ran into him, I think I'd fall in love with him again.

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,760
I want to fall for this person again.

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,330
[Yuriko]

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,500
Let's do this.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,660
Hello?

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,410
Makoto?

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,090
Hello?

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,280
Yes, this is Makoto speaking.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,980
And...

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,390
Sorry, this is Dad.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,850
- "Dad".
- Mom's out right now.

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,380
She forgot her phone again.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,190
Which means this "Yuriko" is my mother.

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,290
You should come home once in a while.

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,910
Right, I will.

22
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,870
Not during Golden Week* though. We'll be out as a family.
[T/N: a holiday period from April 29th to May 5th]

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,230
Maybe sometime afterwards?

24
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,960
They're vacationing as "family", without me.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,840
Last time you saw Genta, he was in preschool.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,100
At this rate, he'll forget you.

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,410
He's the one you're related to, so come visit once in a while.

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,710
The one I'm...

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,510
At any rate, no pressure. I'll leave that up to you.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,990
Did you need your mother for something?

31
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,000
Not really, I was just calling to check in.

32
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,740
Enjoy your vacation.

33
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,050
My father...

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,710
Golden Week...

35
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:53,250
Right, Children's Day* is coming up.
[T/N: a holiday celebrated on May 5th]

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,650
It's actually my birthday today.

37
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:57,510
My, happy birthday!

38
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,620
The ring is a gift from my boyfriend.

39
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,280
That's lovely.

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,740
Allow me to check the fit.

41
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,680
- Thank you.
- Let us see...

42
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,720
- How does that look?
- It's beautiful! Right?

43
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,530
I'm glad you like it.

44
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,760
We'll call your name once we've finished wrapping the ring.

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,080
- Thank you.
- Of course.

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,680
Many customers come in for their birthdays, don't they?

47
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,270
Cakes, flowers, and jewelry are the big three of birthday presents after all.

48
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,680
Birthdays are a day for celebrating your very existence.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,770
The celebration itself is another expression of love.

50
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:44,230
Oh? Are you crushing on someone, Ms. Anri?

51
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,140
I don't mean exclusively in a romantic way. It can be platonic, and between family as well.

52
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,200
I suppose so...

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,300
I mean, it's nice that we get to be a part of that, as jewelers.

54
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,820
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

55
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,850
Aw come on, give me a cuter smile.

56
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,740
I am a regular.

57
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,730
Welcome.

58
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,880
What should I get today?

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,750
Maybe a diamond ring...

60
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,060
- In that case, I would recommend this ring here.
- Thank you for waiting.

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,530
I've wrapped your ring like this. Does that look okay?

62
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,030
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

63
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,880
Could I see this ring here?

64
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,420
Certainly.

65
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,430
Here you go.

66
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,240
Let's go on a date.

67
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,230
Huh?

68
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,640
I want to get to know you, and I want you to get to know me, too.

69
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,590
You can't like, nor dislike a person without knowing them, right?

70
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,950
So before you judge, it's only fair you get to know me first.

71
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,360
Pretty please?

72
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,790
I suppose...

73
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,820
Seriously? Then are you free the 5th? It's Children's Day.

74
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,910
That day, I'm...

75
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,760
- Does this place not give Golden Week off?
- Hey!

76
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,450
You can take the 5th off.

77
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,950
What? But...

78
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,550
Hayase gets the 6th off, and that's that.

79
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,780
Lucky me.

80
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,730
Great! Leave the planning to me.

81
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,090
And I'll take this ring, please.

82
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,690
Right.

83
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,120
Birthday date, secured.

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,830
The 5th... that's my birthday.

85
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,110
[Let us celebrate your birthdays or anniversaries.]

86
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,520
Could I get a reservation for a window seat for two, on the 5th?

87
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,270
Yes, thank you.

88
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,620
- Evening.
- Good evening.

89
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,680
- On you way back from work?
- Yes.

90
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
- You won't be stopping in today?
- Well...

91
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,590
The boss has been unusually off his game recently.

92
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,790
Hey there.

93
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,130
Are you tossing those?

94
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,190
Yeah. They're on the verge of wilting.

95
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,640
I can't sell flowers past their peak.

96
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:29,760
I try to cut the waste by using them for dried arrangements, but sometimes I have no choice.

97
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,280
- But they're in bloom.
- The colors have gone bad.

98
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,090
Even this purple one?

99
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,430
It's turned from Iris, to Kakitsubata* colored.
[T/N: Iris laevigata, or the Japanese Iris]

100
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,850
So a deeper purple?

101
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,650
The world is more colorful than a 12-set of colored pencils, you know.

102
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,010
But purples are just purple.

103
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,380
I don't know what color "Iris" is.

104
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,070
Cherry, Dianthus, and Peony colored.

105
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,140
Many Japanese colors come from the names of flowers.

106
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,750
In a word, they're all pink though.

107
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,490
This color is "Wilt".

108
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,210
I didn't realize dried flowers got a color as well.

109
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,540
- You still have deliveries to make?
- No, I have a customer on their way.

110
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,960
Cakes, flowers, and jewelry.

111
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,420
- Apparently those are the big three of birthday presents.
- Right.

112
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,800
I wonder if I've ever received flowers on my birthday before.

113
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,960
I guess not, huh?

114
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,240
You said you didn't need material objects.

115
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,040
So I preferred memories over physical things.

116
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:07,160
Do parents no longer celebrate their children's birthdays when they grow up?

117
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:12,250
I don't think many parents send flowers to their kids, that's for sure.

118
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,770
Right. If we forget our own age with each passing year,

119
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,830
I can't expect parents to remember their kid's birthdays either.

120
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,820
Is everything...

121
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,160
[Yuki Asahi - One new message]

122
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,990
[Are you free anytime during Golden Week?]

123
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,280
[Sorry, I have work.]

124
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,640
What was that?

125
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,710
Nothing. I see work's keeping you busy, with your hands as dry as they are.

126
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,480
Sorry, did I catch you in a bad mood?

127
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,010
You're more curt than you usually are.

128
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:04,230
Florists are busy this time of year. You going anywhere Golden Week?

129
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,590
What's with that sudden topic change? You're definitely not interested anyways.

130
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,060
I am.

131
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,650
You are?

132
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,300
Well, I'm going out for a day.

133
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,680
With Asahi?

134
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,570
No...

135
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,050
Then the blondie?

136
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,610
Well, feel free to go wherever, with whomever you please.

137
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,610
What's that supposed to imply?

138
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,070
Sir, your customer has arrived.

139
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,920
I'm terribly sorry I'm late.

140
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,170
No worries. We appreciate your patronage each year.

141
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,620
- Your bouquet.
- Thank you.

142
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:52,070
Giving the missus flowers for her birthday ensures a harmonic household for the rest of the year.

143
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,530
- A single bouquet holds you over an entire year?
- Ai.

144
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:00,650
It sure does. This one memory gives me leeway the other 364 days.

145
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,550
The memory of a birthday...

146
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,950
There was one year I forgot,

147
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,870
and she still holds it against me, especially when we fight.

148
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,400
It's as if you don't even exist when people forget to celebrate.

149
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,270
I thought so. That's why today's a special day.

150
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,780
Orange flowers are nice. You've got an eye for this.

151
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,870
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

152
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,760
- That will be 4,400 yen.
- Alright.

153
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,990
- By card, please.
- Of course.

154
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,370
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

155
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,080
Thank you, come again.

156
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,540
I guess he doesn't remember, despite being my ex and all.

157
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,230
Or I guess he doesn't, because he's my ex.

158
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,000
Will you celebrate my birthday?

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
[Kururi ~Who's in Love with me~]

160
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,010
So you didn't speak with this "Yuriko"?

161
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,510
Nope. When I called the "Yuriko" that was in my contacts,
[Episode 4]

162
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,540
I was able to confirm she was my mother. But...
[Episode 4]

163
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,460
But?

164
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,840
I don't think I'm related to my father by blood.

165
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,860
The boy who answered the first time, is most likely a younger brother of mine from my mother's remarriage.

166
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,950
Hence the different last names.

167
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,700
It sure is terrifying to learn who I am.

168
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,090
Maybe I was an absolute psycho.

169
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,450
I wouldn't say that.

170
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,730
I'm scared of myself.

171
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,430
I can't, for the life of me, figure out who I was.

172

Makoto...

173
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,810
I don't want to lose my job, or my wonderful new friend either.

174
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,840
Not to mention the hot boyfriend you're about to score.

175
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,400
That Kotaro is the handsome fellow who runs the local flower shop, right?

176
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,080
How do you two know each other?

177
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,430
What a go-getter!

178
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,620
No, no! He seems to be my ex.

179
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,510
Your what?

180
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,900
I wonder why I was dating him though.

181
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,820
Why not? Seems like a great guy.

182
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,810
But that explains the competition I witnessed.

183
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,230
So that other dude must be a friend.

184
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,750
How could you tell?

185
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,150
I work in the service industry, it's a trade skill.

186
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:40,310
But with your memory loss, you don't know your taste in men. How exhilarating.

187
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,360
Don't have fun with my amnesia.

188
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
Sorry. Anyways, you should post on Instagram or something.

189
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,570
Someone new might reach out.

190
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,080
But what to post?

191
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,000
Just snap a shot of something that you like, or think is pretty.

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,820
Something that I like, or think is pretty?

You won't take a picture? This dessert is a course meal exclusive.

195
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,480
I don't want to upload glitzy photos.

196
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,400
Because it feels like you're showing off?

197
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,460
Yup. It'll only attract hate. There's really no point.

198
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,740
I really like that part about her.

199
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,070
You still have work to do?

200
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,010
- Yeah.
- That's unusual. I almost never see you cramming.

Well... I'm going someplace memorable.

204
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,530
Sounds nice.

205
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,360
- Makoto!
- Mio!

206
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,800
- Good afternoon.
- Hello there.

207
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,370
Are you going to the flower shop?

208
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,420
Not today.

209
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,170
That's a cute ring.

210
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,120
I know, right?

211
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,830
Makoto, you're going to make rings?

212
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,040
Yeah, I'm working hard to learn.

213
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,760
Oh yeah, it's coming up.

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,710
Right! You must be looking forward to that.

216
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,800
- Then I'll see you around?
- See you!

217
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,220
What did you do today?

218
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,940
- We played banana tag.
- Banana tag?

219
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,830

220
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:18,200
I have no pictures from the 5th last year.

221
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,540
Thank you.

222
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,980
That ring looked wonderful on you, miss.

223
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,140
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

224
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,770
What stone is this?

225
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,620
- The darker green?
- No, the lighter one.

226
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,190
The lighter green is...

227
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:44,380
- That would be a tourmaline.
- Thank you.

228
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,730
My apologies.

229
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,670
It's a beautiful stone, yes?

230
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,120
Sure, one's a darker green, while the other is lighter.

231
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,360
But remember, this is an emerald, while this is tourmaline.

232
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,080
Sorry. Looks like I need to study up on gemstones, too...

233
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
I won't deny studying is important.

234
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:09,810
But if you are to become a jeweler, I want you to truly see how beautiful things are, indeed, beautiful.

235
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,220
What do you mean?

236
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:20,030
Ms. Ogata, what sorts of things do you find beautiful? Be it rings, gemstones - anything.

237
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm not entirely sure myself.

238
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,190
As far as I can tell,

239
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,490
it seems I had no interest in indulgent, material objects.

240
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,180
My room was sparse, without any decorations or flowers,

241
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,370
and my entire closet was a monotone hue.

242
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,080
Maybe I didn't know anything outside a 12-set colored pencil palette.

243
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,510
Why that lifestyle choice?

244
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,150
Maybe it was my personality?

245
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,220
I'm not too sure either.

246
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,990
And still you came to us, to make a ring.

247
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,490
Yes, I did.

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,180

Now let's close up for the day.

- Could you sweep the floors?
- Yes, ma'am.

252
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,120
You've never given breaks over Golden Week before.

253
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,830
Birthdays ought to be a day off.

Looking forward to today!

Thanks for waiting.

No, you look cute.

I thought you might enjoy it.

274
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,640
I might actually enjoy goldfish scooping.

275
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,310
Why's that?

276
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,400
Because sometimes, I just want to indulge in "pointless" activities.

- Did you have fun?
- I did. But why goldfish scooping?

291
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,800
Sometimes, it's nice to indulge in something pointless.

292
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,080
- Pointless?
- Yeah.

293
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,800
I mean, is there any point in catching goldfish, only to set them free?

294
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,670
Touché.

295
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,700
Especially since it seems like you wouldn't normally indulge.

How could you tell?

297
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,720
That's apparently how I was before.

298
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,080
My room was all about the minimalist aesthetic.

You look so put off.

301
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,590
I need to introduce myself, too.

302
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,050
I was born January 16th, and I'm currently 23 years old.

303
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,580
My family lives close by in Shibuya, but I've moved out.

304
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,710
Let me guess. You're a rich kid?

305
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,460
Something like that.

306
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,480
My family manages tenants, fixes buildings, and more.

307
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,500
To generalize, they do real estate.

308
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,970
And as their only son, I grew up without knowing much struggle.

309
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,630
Then what about your company now?

310
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,570
My company has nothing to do with my family.

311
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,540
If anything, my parents are super against it.

312
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,630
But I wanted to try managing my own company,

313
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,030
so I began a startup in college, and have been running it for three years now.

314
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:58,950
- Were you always interested in app development?
- Not really.

315
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,230
Actually, I wasn't interested in it at all.

316
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,730
The prospect just seemed to have the highest chance of success, given my skillset and resources.

317
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,270
That's amazing.

318
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:14,780
I'm the older one, but you're far more of an adult than I am.

319
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,240
I wanted a certain person to notice me.

320
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,950
A certain person?

321
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,770
An incredibly smart adult.

322
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:31,440
I wanted to prove to them, that I didn't need my parents' influence.

323
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,080
That there were merits to staying with me.

324
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,650
Merits?

325
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:42,210
Though I'll admit, coming from a good family, I did have a fair share of connections.

326
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:47,060
Even so, I'm sure starting up a company came with its fair share of struggles.

327
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,310
Stop that. A good-looking rich kid can't boast about "struggles". It'll only attract hate.

328
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,270
There's no use pointing it out.

329
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,690
Maybe, but...

330
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,780
Ritsu, are you actually a bit of a shy kid?

331
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,720
Maybe you just don't want other people to see you struggle.

332
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,440
Sorry, I'm acting like I really know you.

333
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,910
But you do. You totally do.

334
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,840

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,250

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,870
Wow. Just, wow.

351
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,420
You can't even see where the koi are.

352
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,270
Wow, yeah.

353
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,210
There are so many of them.

354
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,200
Wow!

355
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,310
It's all so amazing.

356
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,130
- Sort of feels like a dream.
- Yeah.

357
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,770
I've never experienced something like this before.

358
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,500
Mr. Kotaro!

359
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,410
Welcome, Mio. Since it's Children's Day today, your flower is on the house.

360
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,830
Yay!

361
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,780
Did Makoto come over today?

362
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,170
No, I think she has work.

363
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:14,480
That's too bad. She was looking forward to Children's Day, too!

364
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,780
Mommy told me birthdays are like "Children's Day" for adults.

365
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,940
Birthdays are?

366
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,880
I've told her it's the one day adults get to celebrate like kids.

367
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,850
That's why Mommy doesn't do chores on her birthday, like a kid.

368
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,280
Isn't that right?

369
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,760
I wonder if I've ever received flowers on my birthday before.

370
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,040
Adults get to be kids on their birthdays, and be super happy, right?

371
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,690
Right.

372
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:48,350
- Make sure your mommy ends up super happy too, Mio.
- I will!

373
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,980
Hey!

374
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,030
Come on, don't pretend like you're asleep...

375
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,970
He's like a kid.

376
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,180
I wonder what color that is...

377
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,680
- Bye bye.
- Good bye!

378
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,960
Thank you, and take care.

379
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,520
What? It's Makoto's birthday today?

380
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,640
Yes. I had hoped to casually celebrate with her.

381
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,630
She seemed pretty busy with work during Golden Week after all.

382
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,820
"Casually celebrate".

383
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,450
I assumed you two must really be good friends,

384
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,370
since she uploaded a photo of this cafe's coffee on Instagram.

385
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,650
So you came here, hoping I would invite her over?

386
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,100
Asahi. If you like her so much, go see her yourself.

387
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,970
- What?
- It's super obvious.

388
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,040
To everyone except the girl herself, unfortunately.

389
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,680
Saying "Happy Birthday" in person would make her way happier than any like on Instagram.

390
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:32,780
Things might get awkward if I presume, and misjudge though.

391
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,690
She might even think I'm persistent, or a stalker.

392
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:40,630
We're good friends right now.

393
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,180
Booking her on her birthday is a bit much...

394
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,400
You've asked her availability, checked her Instagram,

395
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,640
taken the appropriate distance... You're a gentleman of our modern era.

396
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,120
I understand wanting to cherish your crush.

397
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,990
But you should make sure to cherish their feelings too.

398
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,300
- Huh?
- You love them, simply for existing.

399
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:08,350
You're essentially admitting to them, that they're the most important person in your life.

400
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,180
Makoto feels anxious about her past, and her future.

401
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,180
She has no confidence in herself.

402
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,640
She isn't able to acknowledge who she is.

403
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,380
So why not be a bit much on your crush's birthday?

404
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,320
Ms. Kae, are you a sage?

405
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,550
Dilly-dally any longer, and a dandy man will whisk her away.

406
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,740
A dandy man?

407
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,310
While you're busy being polite,

408
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,260
this gallant man will slide in, and smoothly grasp her hand.

409
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,960
Her hand...

410
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,200
Now, onwards!

411
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,240
The Tokyo Tower sure is beautiful.

412
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,530
Did you remember something?

413
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,560
Nope. I still know the Tokyo Tower though.

414
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,400
So you don't remember, but you know.

415
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,790
Seems like it.

416
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,970
I wonder how that works?

417
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,890
I'm sort of glad to hear that.

418
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,780
Why?

419
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,220
Oh... because I also like the Tokyo Tower.

420
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,000
- You do?
- Yeah.

421
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,530
There aren't many who dislike it, right?

422
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,650
I'm glad we spent the day together,

423
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,820
and ended it here, at the Tokyo Tower.

424
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,010
I've been looking forward to this part all day.

425
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,290
Really? Are you actually enjoying yourself?

426
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm enjoying myself too much, even.

427
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,830
I'm so glad I worked my butt off.

Wait, seriously?

430
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,420
Work must have drained you.

431
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,850
Not in the slightest.

432
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,250
Although it's a bit late, this is where the real festivities begin.

433
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,570
We'll enjoy dinner with window seats of the Tower, and -

434

Somewhat.

445
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,440
You should head back to the office.

00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,220
Was today your birthday, Ms. Makoto?

525
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,610
- Y-Yeah.
- You should've said something.

526
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,580
Thank you for spending such an important day with me.

527
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

528
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:30,340
Are you making a delivery, Mr. Florist?

529
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,310
I see.

530
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:39,160
And you are...

531
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,950
Me?

532
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,880
- That's my line. Who are you?
- Me?

533
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,440
- Erm...
- Well, I'm heading home.

534
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,500
- Huh?
- Want to catch a ride back?

535
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,200
Well...

536
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,230
I'd like a ride. Could I join Ogata?

537
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,620
In any case, it's late. Students should head on home.

538
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,470
I'm not a student.

539
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,430
Sorry.

540
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,420
- Hello?
- Did you find her?

541
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,570
If you did, come back with Makoto. The boss said I could use the place until morning.

542
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,400
I certainly found her, but...

543
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,210
I found too many people.

544
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:28,720
Huh?

545
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,950
Isn't this a bit too cramped?

546
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,590
- Someone should ride passenger.
- Then I'll...

547
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,800
It's fine, I'll go up front.

548
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,750
Don't be rude, I can at least bake a pizza.

549
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,520
- Here.
- Honestly, it looks pretty good to me.

550
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,520
- And there you go.
- Thank you.

551
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,070
Now let's give this another go. Happy Birthday, Makoto!

552
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,980
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

553
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,320
Thank you. I didn't think anyone would celebrate.

554
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,440
Even if you've forgotten, everyone you know will still remember.

555
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,650
But...

556
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,030
I don't think you were a psycho.

557
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,080
No one would be here if you were.

558
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,010
I'm more surprised by this new face. Who are you?

559
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,140
Ritsu Itagaki. I was on a date with Ms. Makoto all day today.

560
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,420
- A date?
- Well...

561
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,020
- I fell in love with her at first sight.
- At first sight?

562
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,480
So you don't know a thing about her.

563
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,270
That's why we promised to get familiar with each other.

564
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,990
Right, Ms. Makoto?

565
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,380
If anything, I'd say our date was a success.

566
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:57,420
He's not wrong, but he's also not right.

567
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,350
Folks, there's another single and ready-to-mingle gal right here!

568
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,850
How did you meet Ms. Makoto, miss?

569
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,170
Oh? You wanna know?

570
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:09,860
- Asahi knows, doesn't he?
- Huh?

571
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,250
When did you two become friends?

572
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,630
We're not exactly friends.

573
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,820
- Hey, I'm the one who hooked up this -
- Ah! Enough about that.

574
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,180
-What?
- Don't tell her.

575
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,440
Oh? So you've learned to be bashful, eh?

576
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,160
Just drop it, please.

577
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,370
Right, I almost forgot the cake.

578
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,300
Does everyone like sweet things? I hope so.

579
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:34,000
- Hm?
- No. Just thinking about how it's Children's Day.

580
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,030
Apparently, birthdays are "Children's Day" for adults.

581
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,790
Seems like my parents forgot mine either way.

582
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,120
I'll have to take a picture.

583
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,750
The colors have gotten less vibrant.

584
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:58,310
I'm sure it'd be beautiful, even if it was "Wilt" colored.

585
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,800
It can be that 13th colored pencil.

586
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,160
Ogata.

587
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,420
- Yeah?
- Come get cake.

588
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:16,310
They all look delicious.

589
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,240
There's mille-feuille and strawberry shortcake. Which one do you prefer?

590
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,100
Mille-feuille or shortcake, which one do you want?

591
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,880
Which of us do you prefer?

592
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:36,520
Makoto, who is it you truly prefer?

593
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,610
I...

594
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,770
I...

595
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,790
Ogata?

596
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:56,040
It's not fair when her ex-boyfriend comes in swinging.

597
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:01,560
I'd even call that immature. I mean, you're her ex.

598
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,020
Why did you two break up anyways?

599
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,460
Do you regret that choice after all this time?

600
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,030
Or maybe you're just getting back at her?

601
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,370
Say...

602
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,950
That whole "love at first sight" thing is a lie, right?

603
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:37,120
I've stopped at nothing to get my hands on the things and people I truly want.

604
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,240
I might even remember more once I meet her.

605
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,190
Mother...

606
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:43,470
I like you, even if your memories never come back.

607
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,110
I remember.
