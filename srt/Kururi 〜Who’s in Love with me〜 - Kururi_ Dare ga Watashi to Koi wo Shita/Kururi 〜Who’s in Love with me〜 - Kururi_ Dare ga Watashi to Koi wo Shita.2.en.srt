00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,650
Did you just fall for me a bit?

353
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,680
I just felt a smidge of respect for you.

354
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,910
If you can find happiness at that job, then I won't butt in.

355
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,700
Just reach out if anything goes awry, yeah?

356
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,680
Sorry, could you give me a moment?

357
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,700
[Yuki Asahi - One unread message]

358
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,370
[Glad to hear the interview went well!]

359
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,450
[Yeah.]

360
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:12,380
- Welcome back.
- Sorry about that.

361
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,840
- Ms. Makoto.
- Huh?

362
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,980
Here's to our first date.

363
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,720
Huh? You didn't like roses?

364
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,640
No, I'm grateful for the gift.

365
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,200
But if I'm being honest, I have no interest in flowers.

366
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,130
I can only identify roses and dandelions.

367
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,300
And recently marguerite's, too.

368
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,690
I see. Because of your memory loss?

369
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,410
No, it seems I've always been disinterested in flowers.

370
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,860
- What?
- Sorry.

371
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,970
Since honesty is apparently both a strength and weakness of mine,

372
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,350
I thought it'd be insincere to pretend.

373
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,980
Pretend? Then what was that about liking kids?

374
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,710
No, I mean... never mind.

375
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,590
Just come to love me and the roses, bit by bit.

376
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,940
Thanks for treating me to dinner.

377
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,060
Let me think about your job offer a bit more.

378
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,020
- Sure.
- I appreciate the flowers, too.

379
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,710
- Then I'll see you.
- See you.

380
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,210
Bye for now.

381
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,210
Weird...

382
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:12,780
[Makoto Ogata]

383
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,010
Makoto? You alright in there? Open up!

384
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,850
Makoto!

385
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,390
What happened? Is everything alright in there?

386
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,690
- I just knocked a bowl over...
- What?

387
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,520
Is someone in there? Answer me.

388
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,500
- I swear -
- No, I just knocked over a bowl.

389
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,180
I couldn't see it when I was carrying the flowers...

390
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,450
What, that's all?

391
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,060
I-I thought there was an emergency. My heart almost stopped.

392
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,020
Why?

393
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,990
Because of your loud-as-hell scream.

394
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,930
I'm going home.

395
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:38,110
Make sure you close up. And don't let guys in, especially at night.

396
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,310
And if you don't have a vase, put your flowers in a bottle, not a bowl.

397
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,270
And when you put them in a container...

398
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,600
You might want to prune these stems.

399
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,550
Pruning means to -

400
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,230
Slow down. Why are you here?

401
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,020
Did you like roses?

402
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,290
No, they were a gift.

403
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:04,280
You know that blondie?

404
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,650
- And you know Ritsu?
- He bought these roses from us.

405
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:09,630
Huh? Why?

406
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,980
Beats me.

407
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,420
Maybe it's because I'm your ex?

408
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,680
Yikes, I did mention that to him.

409
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,950
I really don't have a vase though.

410
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,640
I wonder if I have an empty plastic bottle? Nope, I've got nothing.

411
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,170
I can take these roses off your hands.

412
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,950
Really? Please do. Will you resell them?

413
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,460
Right, you wouldn't do that.

414
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,970
You must really like flowers.

415
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,940
You've turned your number one passion into a job. Lucky guy.

416
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,440
I like flowers, but I wouldn't rank it first among my passions.

417
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,350
What else are you passionate about?

418
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:46,970
- Basketball.
- Like, you wanted to play for a team?

419
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,350
Right. But you can see how that went.

420
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,990
Still, that's amazing.

421
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:56,040
You have more than one passion? Sounds like a happy life to me.

422
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,020
I wonder what I was passionate about.

423
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,540
Would you know?

424
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,020
Sorry.

425
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,690
I see.

426
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,260
This individual might though.

427
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,100
Welcome.

428
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,780
That's not true.

429
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,970
- Really?
- Yes.

430
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,880
These rings are my favorite.

431
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,800
When we first came to pick ours out together...

432
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,650
- I appreciate your patience, ma'am.
- Of course.

433
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,540
How does that size feel?

434
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,430
- It's perfect.
- Nothing's loose?

435
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,930
It's absolutely beautiful.

436
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,620
May I wear this home?

437
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,910
Of course. Thank you.

438
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,970
- Thank you for visiting. Come again.
- Come again.

439
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,030
May I help you, ma'am?

440
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:24,450
I believe I bought this ring at your shop here,

441
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,680
and I had some questions about that.

442
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,740
What questions, exactly?

443
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,620
You see, I've lost all my memories.

444
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,940
Ms. Ogata, yes?

445
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,240
I remember your visit quite vividly.

446
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,590
Really?

447
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,490
Yes. You said the ring was for someone you loved dearly.

448
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,810
I said that, about this?

449
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:51,040
Yes. Our store specializes in designing rings based on our customer's requests.

450
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,480
You were especially satisfied with your completed ring, Ms. Ogata.

451
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,140
If I may be presumptuous, you looked quite happy indeed.

452
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,340
I looked happy? Me, Makoto Ogata?

453
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,030
That was how it looked to me, yes.

454
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,030
I've never had someone tell me I looked happy before.

455
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,800
Did I describe this person I loved in any detail?

456
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,080
No, not particularly.

457
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,190
I apologize for the questions.

458
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,700
I'm truly glad I dropped by your shop.

459
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,060
If there's one thing I can believe now, it's the happiness I felt upon seeing this ring be actualized.

460
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,040
This really has become my good luck charm.

461
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,840
If I may make a suggestion...

462
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,620
Thank you.

463
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,350
- Welcome.
- I'm not here to buy a flower.

464
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,740
I know.

465
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:23,000
- Is this a dry flower arrangement?
- Yeah. They've gotten popular recently.

466
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,030
Are these my roses?

467
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:31,000
Wow, I didn't realize they looked like this when dried.

468
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,660
There's so many of them.

469
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,750
Want to join me?

470
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,670
Go on. Out.

471
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,030
Ai, watch the shop for me.

472
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,680
- Of course. See you later.
- See you.

473
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,010
Flowers?

474
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,380
I don't really get it, but go wild.

475
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,080
Thank you. Then if you'll excuse us.

476
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,840
This is...

477
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,990
The path to the preschool is under construction.

478
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,660
- Here?
- Thanks.

479
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,510
- Could I get some over here as well?
- Sure.

480
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,430
Here.

481
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,250
- Can you grab the green one next?
- Got it.

482
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,000
- Oh my...
- How beautiful.

483
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,530
Here.

484
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,240
- Should I place this here?
- Yeah, looks good.

485
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,490
- Maybe shift the angle this way a bit?
- Roger that.

486
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,360
A bit further down.

487
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,550
- Here?
- Perfect.

488
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,270
- Could I get another green?
- Sure.

489
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,040
- I'll tape this side up.
- Great.

490
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,800
Looking good, it's really giving this place some color.

491
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,070
- What a smile.
- Yeah, I'm glad they like it.

492
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,780
I'm talking about you, Mr. Kotaro.

493
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,630
You look happy.

494
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:52,160
I guess I am.

495
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,500
I get it now.

496
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,920
It's not just the flowers you're passionate about.

497
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,950
Speaking of being happy, that blondie...

498
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,860
You mean Ritsu?

499
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,660
Yeah. He looked happy when he bought that huge bouquet too.

500
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,750
If I'm being honest, I have no interest in flowers.

501
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,920
Can I take this one for myself?

502
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,150
The whole bundle was a bit much, but just this.

503
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,000
Go ahead.

504
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,810
Mio's coming. We have to hurry.

505
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:41,090
- This one goes over here, right?
- It's fine, I'll get that.

506
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,690
She should see our completed work.

507
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,000
I'll handle this side, so you finish up over there.

508
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,820
Alright.

509
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,520
- I forgot I can't handle high places.
- What?

510
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,220
- No, no, no. I can't!
- Makoto, calm down!

511
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,000
I guess bumping your head again won't just bring those memories back, huh?

512
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,110
First things first, try not to die.

513
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,860
I just got excited thinking about Mio's reaction.

514
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,530
Totally forgot about my fear of heights.

515
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,700
Being hasty is definitely another weakness of mine.

516
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,110
Weaknesses, huh?

517
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,740
Thanks.

518
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,730
- Hello?
- Sorry.

519
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:05,710
I'll be declining the offer from Fukumaru Soy Sauce.

520
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,290
I'm really sorry about this.

521
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,200
- Don't worry, I'll inform the company of my decision.
- Why the change of heart?

522
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,550
I don't know if this position will suit me,

523
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,120
or if I'll like the job at all, but...

524
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,030
My resume, ma'am.

525
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,200
I want to work here. Please make me your apprentice.

526
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,580
Come again?

527
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,960
I believe you would be considered a ring artisan of sorts?

528
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,020
And I want to one day design and make rings from the ground up, like you do.

529
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,720
You wish to become an artisan? Why?

530
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:50,080
Flowers, rings, and things like that aren't necessary to survive.

531
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,160
They're luxuries that serve no use in our daily lives.

532
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,100
I suppose so.

533
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,320
But they're meant to make people happy. To make them smile.

534
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,180
They're bought, to convey feelings of love and affection.

535
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,930
I only have that feeling to my name, and nothing more.

536
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:16,860
But it's the reason I've been able to be as cheery as I seem.

537
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:20,060
Knowing that I love someone is enough.

538
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:26,150
Having that sort of happy past or memory

539
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:31,460
makes a person able to go on, even in their darkest hours.

540
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,470
That's why this ring has become a good luck charm of mine.

541
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,160
I want to help make those feelings take shape for others.

542
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,010
This job is entirely necessary. It makes people as happy as soy sauce does.

543
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,770
Soy sauce?

544
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,990
I know my reasons aren't very convincing.

545
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,080
But I want to do this.

546
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,890
I just, want to do this.

547
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:58,030
Is that not enough?

548
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:06,680
No, I suppose not. I need to describe my strengths, and your companies merits, and...

549
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,820
We usually work five days a week.

550
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,300
Your hands will get dirty, but are you okay with that?

551
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,840
Yes. Thank you!

552
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,360
I'll be in your care.

553
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,620
Sir, I apologize for keeping you.

554
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,220
Oh, Ms. Matsunaga.

555
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,070
What was it you wanted to discuss? Did I not pay enough?

556
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,110
Thank you, by the way. I'm glad I entrusted this job to you.

557
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,400
Your timing was impeccable, really.

558
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,500
I quit.

559
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,970
Thank you for everything. Farewell.

560
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,850
Ms. Ogata.

561
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,520
[M.M - One unread message]

562
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,590
Already?
[She left the office at 4:58 PM.]

563
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,560
Alright, gather 'round.

564
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,330
When I give the signal, it's go time.

565
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,780
Thanks.

566
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,610
I'm not a fan of heights...

567
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:32,170
Hide the ladder, hurry!

568
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,210
- Right!
- Knock it down!

569
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,160
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

570
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,030
Ready, and...

571
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,030
- Come on!
- You can do it!

572
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:56,780
Miss. Could you grab that bug-catching net for me?

573
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,010
Sure.

574
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:01,990
I played the role of a younger guy who helps kids perfectly.

575
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:04,310
Not to mention the dog that just happened to be around.

576
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:09,800
I just know she was charmed by my all-embracing kindness.

577
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,580
I don't entirely get it, but I am glad I was of use.

578
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,070
As such, I will be returning this to you.

579
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,340
Why?

580
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,280
My contract was renewed due to Ms. Ogata's resignation.

581
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,660
I honestly didn't think she'd quit.

582
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,160
The real Ms. Makoto wouldn't do something so stupid.

583
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,990
Stupid?

584
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,480
So you know this "real" Ms. Ogata?

585
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,310
While I do not know your end goal,

586
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:54,660
I only ask that you do not put Ms. Ogata in harm's way.

587
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,650
Then if you'll excuse me.

588
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:07,110
Harms way? I only want to make her happy.

589
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,870
[Makoto (makoto_o99)]

590
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,940
[While I appreciate your offer, I will have to decline. Thank you again.]

591
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,030
[I have the rose hanging on my wall.]

592
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,730
I call this, Operation Cinderella.

593
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:34,320
- The ring fits perfectly on my ring finger.
- Mine as well.

594
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,510
Maybe it is fate.

595
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,320
There's someone important I've forgotten in my life.

596
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,100
Let me be your first customer.

597
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,640
This stinks of a lie.

598
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,110
Not every guy sidles up to you with good intentions, alright?
