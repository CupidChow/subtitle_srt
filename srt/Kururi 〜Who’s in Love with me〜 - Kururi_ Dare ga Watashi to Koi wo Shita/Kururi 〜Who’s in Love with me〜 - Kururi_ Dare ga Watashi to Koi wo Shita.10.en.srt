00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,470
I was dating Ritsu.

3
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,100
<i>Ex-boyfriend, to be exact.</i>

4
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,800
Why? Kotaro-san.

<i>I've never fallen in love at first sight before.</i>

6
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,000
What's the truth?

7
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,360
Is everything okay?

8
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm sorry I rushed home.

9
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,460
My head was starting to spin.

10
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,350
It's not much, but I hope this can help.

11
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,290
Thanks.

12
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,240
I also brought these.

13
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, so... how long did we date?

14
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,830
Was it about a year?

15
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,540
I'll tell you about it another day. Get some rest.

16
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:14,150
- Okay.
- I'll text you when I get back.

17
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,000
Thanks.

18
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,050
He's not my ex-boyfriend.

19
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,650
Kotaro-san?

20
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,990
Oh my? Is that what's going on here?

21
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,540
I still can't remember getting this ring made.

22
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,230
Ritsu.

23
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,910
I met Ritsu around the time I got hired.

24
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,690
<i>Makoto-san!</i>

25
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,820
<i>I don't recognize almost everyone here.</i>

26
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,220
<i>Congrats on getting that informal offer.</i>

27
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,750
<i>So many freshmen have joined us since you graduated.</i>

28
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,820
<i>Some want to hear your job hunting tricks, too.</i>

29
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,340
<i>You're lucky you got a great offer at a great place, Ogata-san.</i>

30
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,070
<i>I got the worst offers.</i>

31
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,880
<i>Set me up with someone at your place.</i>

32
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,020
<i>I work with people only older than me.</i>

33
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,750
<i>- I don't know...
- Seriously, I envy you.</i>

34
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,890
<i>I wish I could try job hunting again.</i>

35
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,400
<i>Makoto-san.</i>

36
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:07,980
<i>- And you are...
- Ritsu Itagaki, from Keimei University.</i>

37
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,870
<i>- If you're sneaking out, will you join me for tea?
- What?</i>

38
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:18,920
<i>It will be nicer than hearing your efforts called "luck."</i>

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,870
<i>What do you like to do for fun?</i>

40
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>Do you enjoy museums, cooking, or flowers?</i>

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,660
<i>I somewhat enjoy them.</i>

42
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,860
<i>Right? You have that kind of mature vibe.</i>

43
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,300
<i>Do you think so?</i>

44
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,320
<i>- I want melon soda!
- All right.</i>

45
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,520
<i>I might like children, too. They are honest.</i>

46
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,660
<i>Wait, are you saying I'm like a child?</i>

47
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,190
<i>No, definitely not!</i>

48
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,000
<i>- You are.
- I am not!</i>

49
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,980
That's how it all began.

<i>I've nothing to wear.</i>

53
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,880
<i>Are these date clothes?</i>

54
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,570
<i>- Thanks for waiting.
- Makoto-san.</i>

55
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,630
<i>Thank you.</i>

56
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,460
<i>You look beautiful.</i>

57
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,950
<i>That dress suits you.</i>

58
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,330
<i>Thanks.</i>

59
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,160
<i>Wow, it's so beautiful!</i>

60
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,230
<i>I like you.</i>

61
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,000
<i>I like you, too.</i>

62
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,820
<i>I can remember everything until last Christmas.</i>

63
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,880
After that, though...

64
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,830
- <i>What's wrong?
- Someone is following me.</i>

65
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,930
<i>I've never seen you in that way before.</i>

66
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,570
Are these this year's memories?

67
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,560
What about the day I fell?

68
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,180
Oh, I can't remember a thing!

69
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,300
There are things I never knew until I lost my memories,

70
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,260
like how good I am at crane games.

73
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,360
I remember everything.

74
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,990
Kotaro-san...

00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,250
<i>[I'm okay now.]</i>

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,180
<i>[These flowers are tasty.]</i>

77
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,270
Morning, Makoto-chan.

78
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,030
Kae-san.

79
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,170
<i>Evening.</i>

80
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,520
I saw Kotaro-san leaving your place yesterday.

81
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,220
How did that go?

82
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,130
Oh, well...

83
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,560
Well, whatever happens, I just want you to be happy, you know?

84
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:08,320
I appreciate everything you've done, truly.

85
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,470
What's up? You're acting like a stranger.

86
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,630
Anyway, I must get going.

87
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,460
See you.

88
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,660
A familiar view...

89
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,460
<i>Yet it all looks different somehow.</i>

90
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,020
<i>I don't know the names of the colorful flowers.</i>

91
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,680
<i>A slightly pale bicycle.</i>

92
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,040
<i>A flashy sign.</i>

93
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,820
<i>A pastel-colored blouse.</i>

94
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,550
The sky.

95
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,130
A blue sky.

96
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:05,100
<i>This world is full of color.</i>

97
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:11,150
<i>The world is more colorful than 12-set colored pencils, you know.</i>

98
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,160
Good morning.

99
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,280
I say this pink stone suits the design best.

100
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,250
No, I think this pink is deeper and more lovely.

101
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,890
- "Deeper," how?
- How?

102
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,530
- It pops against the silver.
- "Pops"?

103
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,570
- So it becomes a pinkish-silver.
- A what?

104
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,250
It's a color between pink and silver!

105
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,780
Which is it? You are not making sense.

106
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,660
Oh, good morning.

107
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,130
- Is something up?
- No.

108
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,110
I'm just glad to know I still love it here.

109
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,910
What?

110
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,210
Would you happen to know around when I got this ring made?

111
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,270
I'm sure it's in our records, but I think it was mid-March.

112
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,960
Why?

113
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,680
No reason.

114
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,420
<i>Hey, I like this one.</i>

115
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,980
<i>I was apparently going to gift it to someone.</i>

116
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,230
<i>Maybe it is fate.</i>

117
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,110
Then why...

118
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,910
Why are we eating premium beef for lunch?

119
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,580
Just eat. I don't like being indebted to people.

120
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,240
"Indebted"?

121
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,240
You gave me a piggyback ride.

122
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,340
Oh, right.

123
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,570
And I got your heart broken.

124
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,000
You have nothing to do with that, nothing at all.

125
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,420
That's good.

126
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,230
So? How is Makoto-san?

127
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,950
You can't bribe me to tell, even with expensive meat.

128
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,740
We have nothing to discuss besides Makoto-san.

129
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,310
Fair enough.

130
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,590
Say, how do you even know Matsunaga-san?

131
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,660
I just used to ask her how Makoto-san was at the office.

132
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,600
That's creepy.

133
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,220
Here, eat.

134
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,560
Hello?

135
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,410
Yes, I'll handle the matter on my end.

136
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,960
As long as my employees are guaranteed their current positions,

137
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,260
selling the company is favorable on our end as well.

138
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,550
Thank you again.

139
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,070
Asahi.

140
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,230
Yes.

141
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,340
You have gotten better.

142
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,240
Only a bit. I'm still as clumsy as before.

143
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,390
- True.
- Hey, don't agree with me.

144
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,880
I honestly had no idea though. You used to make catchy signs at the office.

145
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,490
I just copied Aoyama-san's work.

146
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,430
I mean, I probably copied some example.

147
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,410
How do you know Aoyama-san is good at crafts?

148
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,380
Did your memories return?

149
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,920
Not all of them. I still can't recall events of this year.

150
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,850
But for the most part, yes.

151
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,460
Did you recall anything about me?

152
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,930
Well, yes...

153
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,600
Really? Like what?

154
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,480
Asahi, I think the executive director dislikes you.

155
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,320
What?

156
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,090
<i>Hold the door.</i>

157
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,500
- <i>I pressed the wrong button.
- That was our executive director.</i>

158
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,110
<i>What?</i>

159
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,080
Now that you mention it, I've never been invited to his golf parties.

160
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,470
Thanks for visiting today.

161
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,610
Kae-san said if I ran away, our friendship would end.

162
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,570
- How is she so perceptive?
- Right?

163
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,830
Maybe she's a secret agent.

164
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,530
Now that's a bit far-fetched.

165
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,450
Oh... You finally laughed.

166
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,920
I met with that guy today, Ritsu Itagaki.

167
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,460
I overheard him mention selling his company.

168
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,360
It made me realize how pragmatic business owners must be. Honestly, I respect him for it.

169
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,320
Have you met Kotaro-san recently?

170
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,220
I want things to go well, for my peace of mind.

171
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,550
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about your memories.

172
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,540
You kept quiet since you didn't want anyone to know, right?

173
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,190
Welcome back.

174
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,890
Hello there.

175
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,110
Is everything okay?

176
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
What? Were you dating that "love at first sight" Ritsu?

177
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,180
- Yes.
- I'm confused.

178
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,250
Then what about Kotaro-san?

179
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,170
Maybe you two started dating this year?

180
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:20,250
No. He wasn't my ex-boyfriend.

181
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,780
So did he lie?

182
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,030
I have memories with Kotaro-san.

183
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,980
It started around last spring, I think.

184
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,330
<i>We celebrate five years since opening.</i>

185
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,380
<i>Is this edible?</i>

186
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,270
<i>I suppose if you try hard enough.</i>

187
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,930
<i>I received a flower during my walk home.</i>

188
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,200
<i>Excuse me!</i>

189
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,070
<i>What a cute bouquet.</i>

190
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,690
<i>Kotaro-san, she said your flowers are cute!</i>

191
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,860
<i>Oh, hello there.</i>

192
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,090
<i>Were you able to eat that flower?</i>

193
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,290
<i>Kotaro-san.</i>

194
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,700
<i>Excuse me.</i>

195
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:07,150
<i>What should I do with a bouquet of roses, when I don't have a vase for them?</i>

196
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,480
<i>- How are you preserving them now?
- In a bathtub, filled with water.</i>

197
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,280
<i>- What?
- Kotaro-san, over here!</i>

198
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,690
<i>I'll make a group chat for the picture.</i>

199
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,890
<i>I'm so sorry about her...</i>

200
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,160
<i>Makoto-chan, you, too.</i>

201
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,590
<i>It's blurry.</i>

202
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,520
<i>[Delete photo]</i>

203
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,360
He was just a florist, and I was a loyal, nonpaying customer.

204
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
I see.

205
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,080
I also remember stuff about Asahi.

206
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,000
He gave me chocolate and accidentally shut the elevator doors on someone.

207
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,690
Makoto-chan, do you like Kotaro-san?

208
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,440
He's always the first person I want to tell when something happens.

209
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,590
I've become an even worse customer than before.

210
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:26,690
But with my memories back, I also remember my feelings for Ritsu.

211
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,250
Before, you liked Ritsu. But now, you like Kotaro-san.

212
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,520
I said I'd quit searching for myself, yet...

213
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,970
<i>Today is our anniversary, remember?</i>

214
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,520
<i>Chigusa-san...</i>

215
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,100
<i>Chigusa...</i>

216
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,310
<i>He's my elder brother.</i>

217
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:52,960
<i>I've come to see how painful it is to be forgotten.</i>

218
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,400
<i>I’m Ritsu Itagaki. Nice to meet you.</i>

219
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,380
I wonder how Ritsu felt, acting like we'd never met before?

220
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,430
You will never know if you just sit here.

221
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,430
You should go see him.

222
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:14,680
You might never know his feelings, but maybe you can clarify yours.

223
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,850
Makoto-san.

224
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,010
Sorry to make you wait.

225
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,640
Thank you.

226
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:57,340
- What?
- I'm just happy. You never asked me out before.

227
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,070
You always treat me so I should return the favor.

228
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,690
Don't worry about that.

229
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,510
If you return the favor, I feel you won't reach out again.

230
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,020
I picked a nice restaurant to celebrate the occasion.

231
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,520
<i>I've visited this place with Ritsu before.</i>

232
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,990
<i>Ritsu always took me to places he thought I'd like.</i>

233
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,210
Are you getting lost in my good looks?

234
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,310
No, it's not that.

235
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,310
- Sorry, give me a minute.
- Sure.

236
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,520
Hello?

237
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,730
How did it go?

238
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,200
All right. I'll call again later.

239
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,530
- Sorry about that.
- Is everything okay with work?

240
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:02,290
Yes. I need to make a difficult choice.

241
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:07,440
Is this about selling your company? Asahi mentioned it.

242
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,210
So he heard me.

243
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,960
It's not a bad deal.

244
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,820
But I'd feel much better if you gave me a hug.

245
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,980
<i>Let me recharge for a bit.</i>

246
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,950
<i>Sure.</i>

247
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,210
Ogata-san.

248
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,940
You are practicing more. Is everything all right?

249
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,160
I feel I can forget about other things when I work.

250
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,890
"Other things"?

251
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:05,970
But I can't keep forgetting things forever.

252
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,700
Makoto.

253
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,460
Do you want to stop in?

254
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,750
That's my experimental batch.

255
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,250
There's a scent you helped me devise as well.

256
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,530
Really? I wonder if I can pick it out.

257
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,000
It's not here right now.

258
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,510
Once it's done, it's yours.

259
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,000
Really? I'll look forward to it then.

260
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,620
I recommend you light it in someone's company though.

261
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,820
Why is that?

262
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,720
Because you might feel melancholic.

263
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,070
Makoto.

264
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,960
I'm sorry. I've been lying to you.

265
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,890
I'm not your ex-boyfriend.

266
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,580
We were never in a relationship.

267
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,170
I was just a florist, and you were my loyal, nonpaying customer.

268
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,600
You don't seem surprised.

269
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
I'm too surprised.

270
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm sorry. I should have told you sooner.

271
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,260
Why did you say you were my ex?

272
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,320
Remember how you ran into my store when someone was following you?

273
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,240
That night, I let you go home alone with an umbrella.

274
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,090
About a week later I heard about it.

275
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,180
<i>What? She fell from here?</i>

276
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,210
<i>That explains the ambulance.</i>

277
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,960
<i>I heard it was a young woman.</i>

278
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,190
<i>But why these stairs?</i>

279
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,450
<i>- Wasn't there a flower-viewing party that night?
- I think so.</i>

280
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,030
<i>I had a bad feeling.</i>

281
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,980
<i>- We went to visit Grandma and saw Makoto-chan.
- What?</i>

282
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,380
<i>My mother is hospitalized at Setagaya Hospital,</i>

283
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,180
<i>and Mio claims she saw Makoto-san there.</i>

284
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,930
I thought something might have happened.

285
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,310
Maybe I could have prevented it if I had walked you home.

286
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:52,180
It's not your fault.

287
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,000
Still...

288
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,930
<i>When I saw you at the hospital...</i>

289
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,540
<i>[Are you alive?]</i>

290
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,970
<i>[I heard you had an accident.]</i>

291
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,830
<i>[I'm surviving.]</i>

292
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,430
<i>[However, I've lost my memories. I forgot everything about myself.]</i>

293
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,340
<i>[Sorry. My phone also broke in the accident, and I've lost all our chat history as a result.]</i>

294
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,380
<i>[Who are you?]</i>

295
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,240
<i>I had no idea how to respond.</i>

296
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,280
<i>That was your ex?</i>

297
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,120
<i>Yes. He was two-timing me.</i>

298
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,890
<i>But I've put that behind us. We are best friends.</i>

299
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,710
<i>He knows me well, but I don't have to worry about romance.</i>

300
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,840
<i>It's an easy friendship.</i>

301
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,160
I thought an ex-boyfriend could be there for you if anything happened.

302
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,550
I understand.

303
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,190
Then what was that about my two-timing?

304
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,790
No, well... you asked for a reason, and I was flustered.

305
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,420
I'm sorry.

306
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:14,040
I also thought an ex-boyfriend wouldn't bring you too much trouble.

307
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,860
"Trouble"?

308
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,350
But it has.

309
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm in a real bind right now.

310
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:49,250
So am I, for a long while now.

311
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:05,400
If your memories ever return, and you want to leave me,

312
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,260
you don't need to worry about me, all right?

313
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,130
<i>[UBARS Inc.]</i>

314
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,510
<i>"UBARS"? What does that mean?</i>

315
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,030
<i>Nothing. It's just the first initial of each of our founders.</i>

316
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,300
<i>I see. It's a nice name though.</i>

317
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,660
<i>It sounds like it's the start of something new.</i>

318
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,170
Ritsu, they've arrived.

319
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,230
Please, come in.

320
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,550
Ritsu?

321
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,430
What are you doing here?

322
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,000
I was in the area so I thought I'd stop by.

323
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,360
Do I come across as a creep?

324
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,150
Is everything okay?

325
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,200
What do you mean?

326
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,820
- Should we grab-
- Is this about your company?

327
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,570
Our client is a major gaming company. Their money would help fund us.

328
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,880
We would get bigger projects too.

329
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,040
Logically, the pros far outweigh the cons.

330
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,940
They do, but...

331
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:05,740
They want us to change our company's name.

332
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,810
Your name...

333
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,290
UBARS.

334
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,990
It's a nice name.

335
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,240
I know, right?

336
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,170
Nothing will change if we get rebranded.

337
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:30,020
I guess I just liked this name more than I thought.

338
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,300
<i>Please don’t make a decision about me yet.</i>

339
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,320
<i>Please don't make final decisions on important matters.</i>

340
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,500
<i>Makoto-san. I love you.</i>

341
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:56,580
It's like the start of something new.

342
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,990
Makoto-san?

343
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,970
That line... did your memories come back?

344
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,680
They must have. Because...

345
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,220
Did everything come back to you?

346
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,800
I can only recall things up to last Christmas.

347
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,760
But I do remember we were in a relationship.

348
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,010
Did your memories return?

349
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,700
I remember we were in a relationship.

350
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:23,880
I've been thinking of many things since my memories returned,

351
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,120
mostly questions.

352
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:34,080
Like why you act as a stranger, although we were together.

353
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,430
Or how you felt doing so.

354
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,650
I'm sorry.

355
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,040
When I first heard your memories might never return,

356
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,060
I thought I could redo it from the start,

357
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,860
that I would have you fall for me again.

358
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,620
Ritsu...

359
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:18,020
Yes, it's me, Ritsu.

360
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,960
Ritsu.

361
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,980
I've been waiting for you.

362
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,050
I finally, finally found you again, Makoto-san.

363
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,830
I'm so relieved.

364
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,180
I'm so, so relieved.

365
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,950
I'm sorry I'd forgotten about you.

366
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,410
Let me recharge a lot, okay?

367
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,090
Makoto-san...

368
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,650
Kotaro-san.

369
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,660
- I announce.
- Oh?

370
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,290
My memories have returned.

371
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,810
- Oh my!
- Wow!.

372
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,830
I still can't remember coming here to get my ring made though.

373
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:44,550
I see.

374
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,960
Despite all that, my aspirations to become a jeweler remain.

375
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,490
I'll continue to be in your care.

376
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,770
The pleasure is ours. Again, welcome to the shop.

377
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,380
Welcome.

378
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,520
Did you figure out whom the ring was for?

379
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,440
- Yes.
- Good for you.

380
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,980
<i>It smells melancholic, but also quite good too.</i>

381
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,480
<i>Kotaro-san. If you have time, would you like to...</i>

382
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,050
If only she stayed a melancholic, lonesome flower.

383
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,990
Sir, your friend is here.

384
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,250
And today, he's very sober.

385
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,200
Hello there.

386
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,890
I came to be a busybody.

387
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:17,400
For Ogata's sake, of course.

388
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,700
I was rejected by her.

389
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:28,380
If anything, I think I'm helping you so what are you doing?

390
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:38,960
Are you bothered by what I said about exes breaking up for the same reason?

391
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,010
I'm not her ex-boyfriend.

392
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,190
I was lying to her.

393
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,820
- What?
- I already told Makoto.

394
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,990
Why did you lie to her?

395
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,210
Because I had regrets.

396
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,160
That day...

397
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,080
<i>What's wrong?</i>

398
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,700
<i>Someone is following me.</i>

399
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,550
<i>"Following" you?</i>

400
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,570
<i>Thank you.</i>

401
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,250
<i>Are you all right?</i>

402
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,630
<i>I'm sorry I barged in, when I have no business here.</i>

403
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,860
<i>I'll be fine now.</i>

404
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,660
<i>- Thank you for the towel.
- Hold on.</i>

405
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,950
<i>Thank you. Good night.</i>

406
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,570
<i>She was terrified, and I sent her home alone.</i>

407
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,200
The accident happened afterward.

408
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,720
I thought her stalker might have pushed her.

409
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:24,500
I thought an ex-boyfriend could stay close if anything were to happen.

410
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,680
She was terrified.

411
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,040
But that faking is no longer necessary.

412
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,840
Makoto's memories have returned.

413
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:43,200
Asahi-kun, I hope you help Makoto, no matter your relationship.

414
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,910
- Ritsu.
- Makoto-san.

415
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,470
- Shall we?
- Yes.

416
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,950
Pardon me.

417
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,630
Please enjoy yourselves.

418
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,630
This place is wonderful.

419
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,770
- Did you reserve the entire restaurant?
- Yes.

420
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,980
After all, it's our first date since your memories returned.

421
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,920
Thank you.

422
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,200
Honestly, I was a bit worried at first.

423
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,760
I didn't realize you didn't like flowers.

424
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,520
<i>But honestly, I have no interest in flowers.</i>

425
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,890
<i>What?</i>

426
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,430
Sorry. I never said so, since I thought it'd make things weird.

427
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,640
<i>I'd like to get Makoto-san a bouquet of her favorite roses.</i>

428
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,310
<i>"Roses"? "Her favorite"?</i>

429
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:56,360
Let's take a trip together this summer. Maybe we can go to an island.

430
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,830
That sounds fun.

431
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,810
Ritsu.

432
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,940
What happened to your company?

433
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,490
We decided to sell it and change our name.

434
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:15,030
- As long as you remember the name, all's well.
- Ritsu...

435
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:20,090
I already looked up several vacation spots.

436
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:24,540
<i>Ritsu never steps over any boundaries.</i>

437
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:29,050
<i>We're similar in that way, and it was comfortable being together.</i>

438
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,960
I'm sorry.

439
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,020
I put you through a tough time, didn't I?

440
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,460
That's...

441
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:55,080
It seems this was a gift for you.

442
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,750
It doesn't have to be right now.

443
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,420
I want you to give this to me, once there's a pair to it.

444
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,910
Makoto-san, you will make your own, and it can be our pair.

445
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,250
Ritsu, making rings is really difficult. I'm nowhere near-

446
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,740
I'll wait.

447
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,590
I'll wait however long it takes.

448
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:30,280
And once they're a pair, let's wear them together.

449
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,420
Okay.

450
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,030
I'll do my best.

451
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,410
Thanks.

452
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,320
Thanks for dinner tonight.

453
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,600
Won't you invite me in for coffee?

454
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,540
I'm joking. It's our first date since your memories returned.

455
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,040
I'll leave for today.

456
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,150
Good night.

457
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,110
