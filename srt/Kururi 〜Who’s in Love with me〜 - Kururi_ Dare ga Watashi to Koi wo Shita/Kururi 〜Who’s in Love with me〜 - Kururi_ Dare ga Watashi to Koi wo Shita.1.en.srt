We've successfully treated your internal bleeding, so there's no issue on that end.

21
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,370
You're either experiencing post-traumatic amnesia due to the fall,

22
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,950
or you're experiencing a sort of dissociative amnesia

23
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,740
as a result of some trauma or strain.

24
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,380
Is this why I can't even remember my name?

27

Given the way my skin is, I must be in my twenties.

30
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,420
This isn't a quiz, miss.

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,510

It could be tomorrow, a month, or even a year from now.

We've resolved this case as an accident,

seeing as there was no criminal nature behind the fall.

42

Maybe she was just playing along to stay on our good side.

270
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,050
I've heard her tell Mr. Shirai and the boss they both look like her father.

271
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,320

272

- True.
- Hold on.

274
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,350
No, girls like her tend to crush on their childhood friends for life.

- But did you see her and Asahi earlier?

276

I did! I've never seen her smile like that before.

277
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,190
Asahi's a nice guy, he'd be all-accepting. Like a blanket almost.

- Yup.

are included in the "work" you have to relearn.

- Yes, why?

00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,950
How on Earth did we part on "good terms"?

355
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,780
Because I'd forgiven you.

356
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,280
I'm so sorry, it seems like I was an awful woman.

357
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,990
Does that mean this other dude is my boyfriend?

358
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,020
Say, am I dating anyone right now?

359
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,800
I don't know.

360
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,290
- Afternoon, Manager.
- Hey.

361
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:19,460
Huh? I've forgotten all the names of these flowers.

362
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,630
It's not that you forgot, you never knew them in the first place.

363
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,230
You'd never be happy receiving flowers, and you'd leave them to wilt.

364
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:28,950
You always said you preferred practical gifts, like gift certificates.

365
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,160
Really? I said that?

366
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,990
Although, given my home decor, I can imagine it...

367
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,320
The first time we met...

368
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,040
- For our five year anniversary.
- My, thank you.

369
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,150
Have a flower on us.

370
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,710
A flower for you.

371
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,450
It's to celebrate our five years since opening.

372
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,810
Is this edible?

373
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,470
I suppose if you try hard enough.

374
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,620
I remember your honesty left an impression on me.

375
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,220
Me? Honest?

376
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,930
That was my first thought.

377
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,360
Your opinion is the complete opposite of everyone else's.

378
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,010
- Who's everyone?
- My coworkers.

379
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,260
Well for one, you have no interest in flowers, do you?

380
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,220
No, I do not.

381
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,780
I saw this light yellow flower at the hospital.

382
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,510
That would be a yellow Marguerite daisy.

383
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,460
I know nothing about flowers,

384
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,630
but I thought this flower looked especially pretty against the white hospital walls.

385
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,200
I know what you mean.

386
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,730
Can you identify every flower here?

387
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:55,020
- It's part of the job.
- I see.

388
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,340
Then what are those light pink ones called?

389
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,640
- The ones colored like cherry blossoms?
- Yes, the cherry blossom -

390
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,620
These are ranunculuses.

391
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,350
Here.

392
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,180
To celebrate leaving the hospital. Dry flowers won't wilt.

393
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,800
Wow, thank you.

394
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,600
Hitting my head might've changed my mind on flowers.

395
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:29,010
Maybe losing your memories gives you the freedom to be unbound by what makes you, "you".

396
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,770
It's like you get another shot at life.

397
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,200
You even forget all the bad things.

398
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,650
I'm honestly a bit jealous.

399
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,930
In other words, why not give this "flower-liking" you a chance?

400
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,420
No, this man is a victim of my own wrongdoing. He's my ex!

401
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,280
Sorry, let me see your finger.

402
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,710
- What, why?
- I only need a moment. Let me see your hand.

403
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,810
- But why?
- It's all a part of the process of elimination.

404
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,520
What's this?

405
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,050
That makes things more complicated.

406
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,390
Right then.

407
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,250
This is a look...

408
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,410
Pretty nice.

409
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,700
This one looks great, too.

410
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,000
That jacket is quite cute, isn't it?

411
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,740
I see you have a triangular shaped body, miss.

412
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,310
This outfit would suit you as well.

413
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,700
It's a design that appeals to all.

414
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:58,140
I'm not looking for something that suits all. I'm looking for something that suits "me".

415
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,960
Face identified. Please head on in.

416
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,820
Good morning.

417
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,840
- Woah.
- What?

418
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,860
What happened, Ms. Ogata? Did you have a change of heart?

419
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,250
I think it's a nice look.

420
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:19,280
- Agreed.
- Thank you.

421
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,790
Thank goodness.

422
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:26,960
- I'll be in your care again, Ms. Matsunaga.
- Likewise.

423
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,420
- Ms. Ogata.
- Yes?

424
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,310
Could you fix this portion here? The price revision is occurring next month.

425
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:38,970
Thank you for catching that, I would have been fired.

426
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:42,510
No need to worry on that front. You're an employee after all.

427
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,750
Maybe, but I'm on thin ice here.

428
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,710
I'll get this fixed right away.

429
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,250
That is so sweet.

430
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,750
Sorry, I don't mean that it's bad.

431
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,760
It's simply too sweet to finish, I suppose.

432
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,550
Honestly, I prefer this Ms. Ogata over the previous one.

433
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,820
- Isn't she a bit cute, too?
- Yeah.

434
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,230
- How'd I never see it before?
- Seriously.

435
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,990
Hasn't Ogata gotten a bit annoying since losing her memories?

436
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,220
- Yeah.
- She's turned into an attention hog.

437
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,020
- Anyways...
- R-Right.

438
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,990
- Hey there.
- Hey.

439
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,000
I think you should lay low until your memories return.

440
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,210
- Oh, you mean this?
- Not just your clothes. In general.

441
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,360
It's for your own sake.

442
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,260
Because that's more like "me"?

443
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:15,810
In order to climb the ladder here, you focused on being considerate.

444
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:20,790
You mean by laughing along, and making sure I fit in perfectly?

445
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,410
And yet I was trashed behind my back, like an idiot.

446
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,420
Don't call yourself an idiot.

447
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,260
You weren't an idiot. You were putting forth your best foot.

448
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,350
You were working hard, in your own way.

449
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,870
You didn't want to become anyone's enemy.

450
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,120
Because if you stood out, work would only become more difficult.

451
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,180
So that justifies pushing all my work onto Ms. Matsunaga?

452
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,990
Of course not.

453
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,530
But if you lend a hand to assuage your own guilt,

454
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,180
it only makes it harder for everyone else to do their own jobs.

455
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,740
- Even you really -
- Really, what?

456
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,630
That's called being "cunning". Don't act like you know me.

457
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,650
But I do.

458
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,280
I know you better than you do.

459
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,860
Sorry.

460
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,980
Don't destroy everything you've been.

461
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,410
Don't ruin what came before all this.

462
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,640
I don't want to see all your effort go to waste.

463
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,490
[Iguchi Mental Health Clinic]

464
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,330
The hospital recommended I attend counseling at a clinic.

465
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:22,250
Especially in the case my memory loss

466
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,910
was due to some sort of trauma.

467
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:31,150
For starters, let's chit-chat and see how you do.

468
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:34,760
No need to get stiff, alright? We'll only be making small talk.

469
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Doctor, is there any way to recover my memories immediately?

470
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,980
Unfortunately, there is no way to speed up the recovery process.

471
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,410
I thought so.

472
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:51,500
To be honest, I don't feel so great about the person I was before.

473
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,670
If we were classmates, I doubt we'd even be friends.

474
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,950
I want to know who I "really" am, but...

475
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:05,430
What does it mean to "really" be yourself?

476
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:10,310
Everyone changes the way they act, depending on who they're around.

477
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,830
Heck, when I was a young lad,

478
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:17,800
I use to always put on a good front when my crush was around.

479
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,030
I hope you too, can learn to become friends with the person you are now.

480
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,070
Here is your change.

481
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,640
And your new membership card.

482
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,420
Thank you.

483
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,910
Oh my.

484
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,010
What a wonderful jacket that is.

485
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,280
Is it a favorite of yours?

486
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,700
Thank you again.

487
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:29,590
Then I'll leave you to passing the torch to Ogata.

488
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,090
Right.

489
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,000
Passing the torch?

490
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,170
My contract ends this month. I'll be in your care until then.

491
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,850
This month? Are you transferring?

492
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,640
- I've been fired.
- What?

493
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,040
Accessing clientele files as a temp worker was against protocol anyways.

494
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:54,480
But that's because everyone was passing their work to you.

495
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,780
Boss, why won't you renew Ms. Matsunaga's contract?

496
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,110
- We have enough hands as is.
- But sir -

497
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:06,630
Ogata. You'll have to work support for our department, right?

498
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,020
Well we don't need two people running support.

499
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,770
Let's get to work.

500
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,840
Work...

501
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,860
That's that.

502
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,930
Thank you for everything.

503
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,380
No, thank you.

504
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,550
Ms. Ogata, a delicious Italian place opened up by the station. Want to join us?

505
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,540
- I'd love to.
- Then let's go!

506
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,580
Ms. Ogata, have you remembered anything?

507
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,400
Not yet. Sorry sirs.

508
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,060
- Let us know as soon as you do.
- Of course.

509
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,540
- Don't push yourself.
- I won't, thank you.

510
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:46,430
Maybe I'll just quit.

511
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,640
I quit.

512
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,150
Ogata?

513
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,360
I'll continue to be deadweight if my memories never return anyways.

514
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,430
- Right, so you can work support -
- This is a wonderful company.

515
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:21,260
You haven't fired me, despite my amnesia.

516
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,910
I'm sure I worked hard to join the team here.

517
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,650
I wore these dull clothes to fit in,

518
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,570
and probably used other cunning measures to work my way up.

519
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:37,760
But at the end of the day, I don't think I really like this job.

520
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,780
- Not that I'd remember.
- Sir, she's only confused, what with her memories and all -

521
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:48,200
The me now could never turn a blind eye, or "shrug things off".

522
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,900
Ms. Matsunaga is far more capable and necessary here than I am.

523
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,210
I believe she ought to stay, over myself.

524
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:02,410
Besides, some folks can't leave on time without pushing work onto her now, can they?

525
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:08,400
And sir, you really ought to say something to Mr. Shirai about his sexual harassment.

526
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,290
Thank you for everything. Farewell.

527
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,340
But...

528
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,030
Ms. Ogata.

529
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,380
Now I've gone and done it.

530
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,100
I've lost my memories, my job,

531
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,170
my savings...

532
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,320
Mr. Kotaro?

533
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,890
Don't you work in an office?

534
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,950
I did. I got fired.

535
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,130
Fired? Because you lost your memories?

536
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:16,060
Long story short, I put up a brave front, and told my boss I'd quit.

537
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,240
Sounds just like you.

538
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,900
I think I'll have those flowers to celebrate my last day.

539
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,020
Lily of the valley's are toxic. They're not edible.

540
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,690
And I've got to get going.

541
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:38,970
Good luck making those deliveries.

542
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,350
If you run into trouble -

543
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:47,440
I usually am, so I'll reach out again.

544
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,670
I don't know who you are, ring-man. But I'll start with this.

545
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:59,500
I think I've gotten on better terms with who I've become.

546
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:04,790
Hopefully by the time I remember you, I'll be on even better terms with myself.

547
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,030
Miss.

548
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,990
Could you grab that bug-catching net for me?

549
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,940
The one on that bench.

550
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,250
Oh, sure.

551
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,650
- Here.
- Thanks.

552
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,870
- A little more to the left.
- The left?

553
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,820
Just a bit more.

554
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:55,010
- Down?
- Yes, down.

555
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:57,990
Straight down.

556
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,570
Almost there.

557
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,900
You practically have it.

558
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:06,700
You got it! He got it!

559
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,970
Great job!

560
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:20,780
- Here.
- Thank you.

561
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,180
- And here.
- Thank you.

562
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,390
- See you.
- Bye bye.

563
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,680
There. Thanks for being my cheerleader, pupper.

564
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,590
I appreciate the assist.

565
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,350
Well this is a first.

566
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:59,190
I've never fallen in love at first sight before.

567
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,670
- Love, at first sight?
- Yup.

568
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,120
I guess memories won't just come back, huh?

569
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,740
First things first, try not to die.

570
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,260
Would you stay friends with me?

571
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,880
Just come to love me, bit by bit.

572
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,380
You said the ring was for someone you loved dearly.

573
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,680
I said that, about this?

574
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:40,800
You are her ex-boyfriend, are you not?

575
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,850
I'm jealous.

576
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,110
Makoto!
