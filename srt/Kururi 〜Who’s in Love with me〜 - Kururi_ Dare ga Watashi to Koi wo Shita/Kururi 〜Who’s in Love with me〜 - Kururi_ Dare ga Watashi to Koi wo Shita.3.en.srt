- Quite.

I've decided to work here as an apprentice jeweler.

I'm really sorry for all the hassle I've caused you.

Please let me make it up to you somehow.

One day, I'll make customer's leave the shop with a smile.

10
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,160
But until then, it's training time.

I'm so glad to hear it. May I check the fit?

Our store specializes in customizing rings on the spot for our customers.

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,430
This requires you to weld, shape, polish, and design the rings.

34
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,900
You'll need an eye for this sort of stuff.

35
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,830
For starters, try to get familiar with the materials while working the front,

36
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,040

- Hello.

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

44
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,970
We used this ring as a base, with an added wave.

45
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,710
And I believe on the inside...

46
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,060
Yes, my girlfriend and I had our initials inscribed within our rings.

47
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,250
If I may ask, would it be possible to make the same exact ring?

48
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,130
Well, yes.

49
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,760
Thank goodness. I can't find that ring, no matter where I look.

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,160
I can't even remember where I misplaced it, if I did.

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,350
I would like to purchase the same ring, before my girlfriend catches on.

52
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,600
I see. Although, while this ring may be quite similar...

53
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,430
Yes, I know. It will never truly be the same.

54
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,340
How about giving it another search?

55
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,620
I've scoured my room, and every place we visited the day I noticed it went missing.

56
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,160

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,410

Every mark made on that ring is a part of our history.

64
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,120
A new ring simply won't have the same sentiment.

Around 100,000 yen?

72
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,750
20,000. Because it's made of silver.

73
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,930

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,340
An insulting assumption.

The ring was part of a pair he bought with his girlfriend.

But if you can't find it no matter how hard you look,

I wonder how that leaves the people who were left behind?

I'm sure it's difficult for the person who's forgotten,

163
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,980

- If you do, I'll -
- I'll be fine!

176
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,420
I'll call an ambulance for you right away.

177
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,890
I'm so full.

178
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,810
I've never eaten a full bundle of bananas before.

179
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,200
And I've only seen a gorilla pull off such a feat, until now.

180
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,170
Sorry, you must be hungry after I ate all your bananas.

181
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,400
I fell down these stairs? I'm surprised I came out alive.

182
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,500
Wait, how did you know this location?

183
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,310
It's part of my jogging route.

184
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:29,160
Your fall was all people talked about for a while.

185
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,440
That's so embarrassing.

186
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,360
Any luck?

187
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,600
I wonder, what brought me here?

188
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,800
I hear the park out back was bustling because it was flower viewing season.

189
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,200
Flower viewing? Me?

190
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,720
Yeah, didn't think so.

191
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,900
I do enjoy the food festivities involved in flower viewing though.

192
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,770
To each their own, really.

193
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:59,230
You're free to appreciate the flowers, think they're delicious,

194
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,110
or ponder in their melancholy.

195
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,120
- It's your life.
- It's your life.

196
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm free, because it's my life?

197
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,850
I'd say that smells melancholic, but also pretty good too.

198
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
Did you just remember something?

199
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,540
No, nothing. Sorry.

200
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,600
Sorry about that.

201
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,820
I'm myself, but I'm also not.

202
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,070
What makes someone themselves?

203
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,510
Is it a culmination of our memories,

204
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:45,860
and the marks we've made, or inflicted on others?

205
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:50,010
If that's the case, then I'm practically a different person entirely.

206
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,330
Like this is year one of my life.

207
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,030
And the person I am now loves it.

208
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,810
I smile, like nothing is amiss.

209
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,520
But I also feel a bit bad.

210
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,270
Both for the person I used to be, and the individual who was supposed to get this ring.

211
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,660
Scents won't change.

212
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,610
Even though different flowers bloom here every year,

213
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,990
the scent they emit won't ever change.

214
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,010
Ogata!

215
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,250
Asahi?

216
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,720
You're from the other night.

217
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,560
You two know each other?

218
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
I ran into him while jogging.

219
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,290
Here?

220
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,110
I sometimes drop by this area after work.

221
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,780
What brings you here, Ogata?

222
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,910
Apparently, I fell down these stairs.

223
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,470
I thought coming here might trigger some memories,

224
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,440
but unfortunately, nothing.

225
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,740
I see.

226
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
- This is...
- Mr. Kotaro.

227
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,470
- He's a florist.
- A florist?

228
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,940
And this is Asahi. A former coworker of mine, and a friend.

229
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,890
A friend.

230
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,050
[KAE - One new message]

231
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,640
[What's up? I'm practicing, since the store is practically empty.]

232
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,760
Say, are you two hungry?

233
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,210
- Ta-da!
- Wow!

234
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,400
- Thank you, Kae.
- Of course.

235
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,990
Nice to meet you both. I'm Makoto's neighbor, Kae Hirano.

236
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,890
Please enjoy yourselves.

237
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,380
You're just going to crush it like that?

238
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,890
It's better to drink coffee while it's hot.

239
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,460
- Is that a gorilla?
- No, this is definitely a bear.

240
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,980
Bears aren't that burly.

241
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,510
Yes, they are.

242
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,410
So...

243
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,390
How do you two know each other?

244
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,390
Oh, right. He's my ex-boyfriend.

245
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,010
- Your ex?
- He's also the person who knows the most about me, thus far.

246
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,870
I see.

247
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,790
I wonder where I should tackle this from...

248
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,080
Are you ever going to start drinking that?

249
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,940
Says you, foam-animal-crusher.

250
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:30,570
- You know, I actually got my ring finger measured the other day.
- Really?

251
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,780
Yeah, I was a size 14.

252
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,300
That ring of hers fits perfectly on my ring finger.

253
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,390
Mine, too.

254
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,150
I wonder if it's just a common size.

255
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,460
Maybe I'll shove this ring on every person I meet. Call it, Operation Cinderella.

256
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,030
- Cinderella?
- Like her glass slipper.

257
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,320
And it's the perfect size for some deranged lunatic.

258
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,320
Not every guy who approaches you has good intentions, alright?

259
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,080
What? No, that's impossible. It's not like I'm rich or anything.

260
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,860
One time, before your fall, you came running into my store at night.

261
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,910
You said someone was following you.

262
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,340
I had a stalker?

263
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,870
- Not according to you.
- Did she describe this person?

264
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,430
Has anything similar happened to you recently?

265
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,390
No...

266
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,330
Let's not freak her out.

267
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,560
Ogata's already going through a lot as is.

268
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,230
There's no harm in being careful.

269
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,330
Where could he be?

270
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:49,370
Maybe he's mad that I haven't reached out. Is that why he's been silent?

271
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,980
Or maybe he's overseas?

272
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,440
He could still text if he wanted to, though.

273
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,260
Maybe he's a secret agent, who can't be contacted.

274
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,420
What are you talking about?

275
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,510
If... If this secret agent -

276
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,280
Thanks for waiting! You all must be starving.

277
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,900
Thank you! Say, where's the restroom?

278
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,360
- Right that way.
- Then I'll be right back.

279
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,750
[Investigation Report]

280
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,940
I'm starving.

281
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,510
I'm going out for dinner. Anyone joining?

282
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,480
- Count me in.
- Only on your dime.

283
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,100
Japanese or Chinese, what's the majority pick?

284
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,430
- I want Japanese.
- Sounds good.

285
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:53,170
- Nice.
- I'd like a sit down place.

286
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,340
Man, I'm beat.

287
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,710
I'm young, so.

288
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,450
Two good-looking guys are putting their pride on the line.

289
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,350
And the reason for all the competition, is...

290
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:50,700
I really like the vibes of this store, Kae.

291
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,670
Say, what's the deal with those two?

292
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,800
Wow, they must have been starving.

293
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,050
Being dense and amnesia have nothing to do with each other, right?

294
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,550
I am so full.

295
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,760
I didn't realize you two have such huge appetites.

296
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,030
Next time we should all go to a buffet together.

297
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,080
- Hey look, a secret agent.
- What?

298
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,600
One more. Just one more store!

299
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,100
Quit screwing with me.

300
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,900
Looks like an agent to me.

301
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,700
- How?
- Watch closely.

302
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,010
So, about this "secret agent".

303
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,140
If you were able to meet him, what would you do?

304
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,950
Would you pursue a relationship, even though you've forgotten him?

305
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,050
I don't know.

306
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,580
Anyways, I'm walking home.

307
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,410
- I'm heading to the store so -
- It's late, I'll see you back.

308
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,980
Makoto! There you are.

309
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,810
My boss said I could turn in for the night.

310
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,400
- Let's head home together.
- Yeah.

311
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,210
Come visit our store again.

312
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:11,710
- Good night.
- Night.

313
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,520
- Thanks for having us.
- Thanks for dropping by.

314
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,390
So should we grab a drink... or not, I suppose.

315
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,610
Most definitely not.

316
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,230
Bye.

317
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,550
Asahi.

318
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,980
What would you do, if you met this "secret agent"?

319
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:52,010
Would I pursue a relationship with him? Do I even like him?

320
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,690
Speaking of liking things,

321
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,920
I've come to decorate my place with flowers. Dried ones, though.

322
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,200
Would you love me, even as I am now?

323
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,080
The master doesn't watch their student.

324
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,210
The student always watches the master.

325
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:03,500
What?

326
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,780
I still have a ways to go...

327
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,020
How did she get it like this?

328
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,140
When you're able to make an even ring, this is your next task.

329
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,020
Was there ever an artisan here, who was as clumsy as I am?

330
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,010
Just one.

331
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,440
Only one?

332
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,430
Chi va piano, va sano e va lontano.

333
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,010
Come again?

334
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,570
- It's an Italian saying.
- Meaning what?

335
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:44,920
- Welcome.
- Ms. Makoto!

336
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,830
- How did you...
- Someone you know?

337
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,040
I looked into it. You work here every day, late into the night?

338
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,520
That's straight up terrifying.

339
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,450
Don't worry. I'm a good guy, who comes from a good family.

340
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,720
I just have a lot of money, passion, and a knack for investigating.

341
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,800
Sorry. My friend advised me to be more cautious of people.

342
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,750
That florist?

343
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,780
So you're still in contact with him, even as your ex.

344
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,420
You must've parted on good terms.

345
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,040
Probably? I wouldn't remember.

346
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,370
I actually visited him the other day.

347
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,940
Sorry, that was probably a bit nosey of me.

348
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,410
But I just wanted to meet him myself.

349
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,900
He runs a nice store, and looked like a nice guy too.

350
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:35,020
- I guess.
- And yet, something stank of a lie.

351
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,250
Scent is often used to describe gut-feelings, right?

352
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,140
We often say things stink of a lie, reeks of fishy business,

353
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,840
and what else... smells like stupidity?

354
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,280
- Maybe not that last one.
- Sorry, I'm on the clock right now.

355
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,130
Then could you show me those rings over there?

356
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,190
Of course. Which one, exactly?

357
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,480
- This one.
- Alright.

358
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,880
Say, whenever you make your first ring, make it something you'd wear.

359
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,280
Why?

360
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,610
So I can buy it, and give it to you as a present.

361
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,480
Your skin looks dry.

362
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,670
I can't accept something like that.

363
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:13,250
And I might get fired before I even make it that far.

364
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:18,020
Then I'll come every week, and buy something equal to your salary.

365
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,390
Then you'll keep her around, right?

366
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,630
What sort of accessories interest you, sir?

367
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:26,560
If I had to choose, a ring.

368
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,870
- Hold on -
- One sale will cover all that.

369
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,720
Hey, I like this one.

370
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,000
That's not for sale...

371
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,310
What? It isn't?

372
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,070
This ring is mine.

373
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,800
I was apparently going to give it to someone as a gift.

374
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,050
Maybe it is fate.

375
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,670
Is this a one-size-fits-all?

376
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,830
Hold on.

377
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,910
Let me see your left ring finger.

378
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,940
- Let's see.
- No way, that's not fitting.

379
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,730
Ow, ow, ouch!

380
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,460
Which ring should I choose for today?

381
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,880
This one's cute.

382
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,960
Thank you, come again.

383
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,420
It seems like there's someone important I've forgotten about.

384
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,800
I've only begun to consider how they might feel about all this recently.

385
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,400
About time, I suppose.

386
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,110
It is indeed sad to be forgotten about.

387
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,700
Right, of course. No surprise there.

388
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,160
But if I were in this person's shoes,

389
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:57,150
I wouldn't mind, so long as you were happy and well.

390
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,950
- So long as I was happy and well?
- Indeed.

391
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,860
I would be grateful I was only forgotten, and not also forgetting.

392
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,920
Doc, you're too kind for your own good.

393
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,830
Don't feel the need to blame yourself for not remembering.

394
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,200
I'm terribly sorry for going over my allotted time.

395
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,010
It's no worry at all.

396
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,480
My brother has always been quite the chatterbox after all.

397
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,000
- Here is your change.
- Thank you.

398
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,540
My, what happened to your hands?

399
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,160
I've begun working as an apprentice ring maker.

400
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,390
The silver turns my hands black.

401
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,240
- I need to buy myself some hand cream.
- Goodness me.

402
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,780
Your hands have done good work. Great job.

403
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,160
Thank you.

404
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,980
That's a beautiful ring. Is it a wedding ring?

405
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,790
It's a favorite of mine.

406
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,900
Thank you, I'll come again.

407
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,420
- Take care.
- Thank you.

408
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,460
I wonder if he'll be surprised to see how my hands look now...

409
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,020
Mr. Nozawa?

410
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,120
- Oh, hello again.
- What are you doing?

411
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,130
I'm trying to find my ring, but to no avail.

412
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,620
I swear we passed through this park, though...

413
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:48,450
- Please allow me to help.
- What? What, no -

414
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,860
I'm sort of in a similar boat after all.

415
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,400
Here, I'll search from this side.

416
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,790
Thank you. Thank you so much.

417
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:03,160
- See anything?
- Not down here.

418
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,710
Where are you...

419
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,100
- Sorry!
- Sorry.

420
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,930
Where's that ring...

421
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,410
Mr. Nozawa!

422
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,000
Over here, look!

423
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,440
Isn't that it?

424
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,600
Look!

425
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,580
- Where?
- Here.

426
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,990
T-That's it! That's...

427
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,920
Not it.

428
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,230
We ought to give up.

429
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,240
What's gone is gone.

430
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,680
Mr. Nozawa...

431
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,110
Luck is really not on my side.

432
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,440
I absolutely treasured that ring, so how did I lose it?

433
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,290
It's over.

434
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,260
I was able to divert her attention away the other day, but now she's suspicious.

435
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,950
I won't be able to keep this up any longer.

436
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,430
She'll be so mad if she finds out though.

437
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,110
What do women do in situations like this?

438
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,040
Am I... going to get dumped?

439
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,690
If she dumps me, I...

440
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:28,410
She may dump you. You've lost something important, after all.

441
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:33,920
Those were precious memories for you both.

442
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:40,350
You can't blame her for any disappointment she may feel.

443
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,030
Right...

444
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:50,740
But do you think she agreed to the rings, to make you feel such agony?

445
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,790
She's your girlfriend.

446
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,350
If anything, are the rings even necessary?

447
00:36:56,350 --> 00:37:02,280
You can't even tell her you've lost something, and you got rings?

448
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,490
I was planning on marrying her.

449
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,470
I hear nothing matters more than seeing your partner happy and well.

450
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:18,040
- What?
- That's a piece of sage advice from my chatterbox guru.

451
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,250
- Wow, you really dropped everything.
- Sorry.

452
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,940
If you're not careful, you'll lose something again.

453
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:34,020
Go like this, and then like this, and...

454
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,330
You're finally getting the hang of it.

455
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,680
How can you tell?

456
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,860
The sound of your mallet. It sounds decent now.

457
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,830
From the sound alone?

458
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,950
You're a professional.

459
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,230
You didn't think I was before?

460
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:58,220
Was that clumsy person you mentioned before also able to become a professional?

461
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,700
Somehow.

462
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,220
It took them 6 years to make anything worth selling though.

463
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,060
6 years?

464
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,010
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

465
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,880
Hello again.

466
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,580
We would like to change this ring's design.

467
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:31,180
Yes, to the design of my new ring. It's to be our new matching pair.

468
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,590
Something different, and yet the same.

469
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,370
That sounds wonderful.

470
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:42,040
However, we would like to request that she make our rings.

471
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,590
You mean Ogata?

472
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,890
I'm terribly sorry, but I just started working here.

473
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,380
If you do not like my work, I can have Hayase make your rings.

474
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,590
No, it's not that we dislike anyone's work.

475
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:01,810
Ms. Ogata simply encouraged me to tell my girlfriend that I had lost my ring at all.

476
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:05,530
"You sham of a couple can't even tell each other about lost rings?"

477
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,270
"Then just get rid of them!" is what she told my boyfriend.

478
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,510
I wasn't that blunt...

479
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,820
Well, losing the ring has become a memory of ours, too.

480
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,080
Ms. Ogata, allow me to purchase a ring of yours one day.

481
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,980
I'll give it to my girlfriend as a gift.

482
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,970
Then please stick together for a while. It may take some time.

483
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,620
- Us two? We'll be fine. Right?
- Right.

484
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,400
- I'll be heading out for the night.
- See you tomorrow.

485
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,520
- I almost forgot.
- Yes?

486
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,410
"Those who tread slow, will go far."

487
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,260
- Huh?
- The Italian saying.

488
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,010
You know, the one who took 6 years, was Ms. Anri herself.

489
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,420
Well, see you tomorrow.

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,780
- Woah, that's good.
- Right?

523
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,670
Right?

524
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,400
You haven't changed.

525
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,650
Huh?

526
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,760
It's something sweet, but...

527
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,950
It's different. But it's the same.

528
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,980
What's that supposed to mean?

529
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,790
I was just thinking I like this.

530
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,060
I'm glad, this is a favorite of mine as well.

531
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,850
Could I try that on?

532
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,320
This?

533
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,390
Well then...

534
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,550
Wow, it's totally loose.

535
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,540
I wonder what size this is?

536
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:26,030
Apparently once you're good at making it, you'll get a feel for size too.

537
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,560
Wait until I can make something proper, yeah?

538
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,000
I'll be looking forward to it.

539
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,050
[Yuriko]

540
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,270
Hello?

541
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,990
Makoto?

542
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,810
Are you going anywhere during Golden Week?

543
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,760
That's my birthday.

544
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,770
Celebrating a birthday is another expression of love.

545
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,650
It's as if you don't even exist when people forget to celebrate.

546
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:44,010
Will you celebrate my birthday?
