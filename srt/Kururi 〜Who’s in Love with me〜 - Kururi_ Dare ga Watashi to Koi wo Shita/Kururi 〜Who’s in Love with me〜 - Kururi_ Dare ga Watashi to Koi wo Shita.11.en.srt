1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,920
<i>Sorry, I'm not here to buy flowers.</i>

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,700
<i>I just wanted to see you.</i>

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,270
<i>I was dating Ritsu.</i>

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,500
<i>With my memories back, I also remember my feelings for Ritsu.</i>

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,410
<i>I finally found you again, Makoto-san.</i>

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,380
<i>Makoto's memories have returned.</i>

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,480
<i>Asahi-kun, I hope you help Makoto, no matter your relationship.</i>

8
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,920
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ❤️‍🔥 The Challengers of Love❤️‍🔥 Team@viki.com</i>

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,180
It helps to visualize the ring you want to create

10
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,510
and whom you want to give it to.

11
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,760
<i>I want you to give this to me, once there's a pair to it.</i>

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,570
<i>I'll wait however long it takes.</i>

13
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,100
<i>Good night.</i>

14
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,230
Ignoring me when I'm right here? I'm hurt.

15
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,250
<i>So the ring was for Itagaki-san.</i>

16
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,060
You remembered everything, right?

17
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,750
Including the accident?

18
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,020
Not about the accident.

19
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,790
I see. Then you should remain alert.

20
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,140
If anything happens, call me...

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,420
No, I guess you have Itagaki-san now.

22
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,620
Kotaro-san, I-

23
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,380
I really went overboard by calling myself your ex. Sorry.

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,760
That's not true.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,060
I was able to come this far, thanks to you.

26
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,860
<i>Your saying I was being myself when I quit my job</i>

27
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,240
helped me like myself more.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,970
Honestly, I was shocked when you quit your job, though.

29
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,820
Your professionalism inspired me to work hard at my current job too.

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,130
Although I wasn’t planning to buy any flowers, I went to your shop to see you.

31
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,880
I'd suggest not dropping by anymore then.

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,100
Although I'll maintain my professionalism,

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,110
having non-paying customers is hard for me,

34
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,940
at least for now.

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,940
I’m fine as long as you’re happy.

36
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,220
You are happy, aren't you?

37
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,570
Good.

38
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,090
Take care.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
Thanks.

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,750
You, too.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,720
Ritsu.

42
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,730
Makoto-san.

43
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,940
I haven't worn something like this in a while.

44
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,560
You look beautiful.

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,480
I want a charge.

46
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,450
Here.

47
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,010
Makoto-san.

48
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,860
Don't, that's embarrassing.

49
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,300
Then how about this?

50
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,500
- Nice photo.
- We look like we're having fun.

51
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,380
We are having fun... right?

52
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
Let's look over there.

54
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,180
Great timing, Makoto-chan.

55
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,350
I was off visiting home for a while.

56
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,840
So you're from Yamagata (Kae speaks with an accent here).

57
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,610
And I hear you began going out with Ritsu-kun while I was gone.

58
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,370
- Yes.
- So I guess those date clothes were to his taste.

59
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,760
I'm glad he liked the dress after making him suffer so long.

60
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,670
I see. Did you have fun?

61
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,930
He really tried hard to make it fun for me.

62
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,110
So did you actually have fun?

63
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,260
How are things with Kotaro-san?

64
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,010
I don't think I'll be seeing him anymore.

65
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,720
I was sort of rude and ended up hurting him.

66
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,540
I understand you're keeping your distance because you've hurt him,

67
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,060
but what about your feelings for him? Did they disappear?

68
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,850
Kotaro-san was only a florist I used to frequent. Everything is back to normal.

69
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,070
I'm back to my true self, where I'm meant to be.

70
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,250
Makoto-chan, remember when we first met? It was cherry blossom season.

71
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,550
I do! You came at me with an umbrella.

72
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,620
Now it's cherry fruit season.

73
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,930
Tasty.

74
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,460
You know, cherries can never return to their blossoms, but they are delicious.

75
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,200
Tasty.

76
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,550
This is delicious.

77
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,030
<i>[Ubars Inc.]</i>

78
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,420
Excuse me.

79
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,650
- Welcome.
- Over here.

80
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,380
- Right.
- Ready and...

81
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,430
Thanks, it's so heavy.

82
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,150
This is nothing compared to hauling our CEO around.

83
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,930
It happens when he's drunk,

84
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,180
especially during our flower viewing party this year.

85
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,730
- Oh, with the bunny costume.
- Yes.

86
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:42,720
Apparently, his girlfriend had just dumped him back then.

87
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,170
- "Dumped him"?
- He had never experienced heartbreak before,

88
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,630
and he kept whining about getting back together with her.

89
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,710
Excuse me, but is the CEO in today?

90
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>[Hey, there's something I want to talk about.]</i>

91
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,200
If only I had a bit more time.

92
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,460
Hello. Are you here for the delivery?

93
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,870
Do you need anything?

94
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,190
You were the ex-boyfriend.

95
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,270
Were you following her after you two broke up?

96
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,740
What? You think I'm the stalker?

97
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,550
You approached her, claiming love at first sight, hoping to reunite.

98
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,930
Exactly. And what's so wrong with that?

99
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:44,620
I've done nothing to harm her.

100
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,760
I'm just telling her I love her.

101
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,420
Why were you there the day she fell?

102
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:53,760
You even bothered to hide your face.

103
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,730
Do I need to tell you?

104
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,880
- <i>Cheers!
- Cheers.</i>

105
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,120
- <i>We heard you the first time.
- Who cares?</i>

106
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,430
- <i>That siren is close.
- Sounds like it's by the shrine.</i>

107
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,810
<i>You've finally shown yourself, Ritsu-san.</i>

108
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,790
<i>Why are you even wearing this?</i>

109
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,350
<i>Because I get teary when I drink.</i>

110
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,030
<i>- He's really feeling the heartbreak.
- Come on, cheer up!</i>

111
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't like people seeing me cry.

112
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,560
You are annoying.

113
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,210
Anyway, don't worry about Makoto-san. She has me.

114
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,270
Well, I'm sure it's rough to hear she's dating Ritsu-kun now.

115
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,350
That's not why I'm wallowing.

116
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:56,140
Ritsu-kun also had it rough, having been forgotten this whole time.

117
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,150
So I guess she remembers him.

118
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,520
What do you mean? She remembers you too, right?

119
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,680
There’s something more painful than being forgotten.

120
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,380
What do you mean?

121
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:21,440
Even if we experience the same thing, it doesn’t mean we see eye to eye on it.

122
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,110
Are you hallucinating?

123
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,810
All right, no more alcohol.

124
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,220
- What? Why? Just one more glass.
- No.

125
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,060
Sorry I had you come to the office.

126
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,420
It's fine. I'm the one who called you.

127
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:55,450
When we went to the aquarium, I wore an outfit I'd apparently bought for you.

128
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,550
Sure. It made me happy.

129
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,500
I know.

130
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,620
I wanted to remain beautiful and mature, just as you'd liked.

131
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,940
That's why I wore it again.

132
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,570
I thought I'd return to the way I was, now that my memories were back.

133
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,090
Except...

134
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,860
I was wrong.

135
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,110
After I first lost my memories, I frantically searched for myself.

136
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,390
But there never was a "real me" to find.

137
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,660
I think I had always been my real self.

138
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,650
I acted like I had a personality, no matter whom I was with.

139
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:47,220
There was never a version of me that was definitively myself.

140
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:00,120
Still, if there's one thing I'm certain about,

141
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,780
it's that forcing you to smile with that outfit is not "me."

142
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,160
Ritsu.

143
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,130
I can't stay with you anymore.

144
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,790
I'm sorry.

145
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:37,650
At first, I was desperate to bring back the Makoto-san I used to know.

146
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,740
But now...

147
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,510
I love the person you've become: the person who is critical of her definitive self.

148
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:01,800
Would you... please give me another chance?

149
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,760
I knew it.

151
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,330
Just one last time, okay?

152
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,500
I'm all charged up.

153
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,870
Don't look so upset.

154
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,990
This is my second rejection, after all.

155
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,990
Come get angry at my lie when you remember, okay?

156
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,180
Farewell, Makoto-san.

157
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,030
Farewell.

158
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,980
At least this time I was able to see her off with a smile.

159
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,390
<i>I recommend you light it in someone's company though.</i>

160
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,400
<i>Because you might feel melancholic.</i>

161
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,530
Even though I'm alone, I guess I can still light it.

162
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,890
What a pleasant scent.

163
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,150
<i>Again?</i>

164
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,100
- <i>Again?
- Yes, again!</i>

165
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,050
<i>Really?</i>

166
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,040
<i>Take care, Makoto.</i>

167
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,000
<i>I know this scent from my childhood.</i>

168
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,090
And also...

169
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,900
<i>What are you doing?</i>

170
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,640
<i>Great question.</i>

171
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:55,000
<i>This floral scent always reminds me... spring is on its way.</i>

172
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,530
<i>Oh, the winter daphne.</i>

173
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,900
<i>- "Winter daphne"?
- Yes. It's a shrub that blooms in early spring.</i>

174
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,240
<i>There's one by the park entrance there.</i>

175
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,330
<i>Whenever I catch this scent,</i>

176
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,190
<i>I always get anxious and lonely.</i>

177
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,790
<i>Sorry, that must be strange. I really don't know about flowers.</i>

178
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,730
<i>It's not strange at all.</i>

179
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:33,020
<i>You're free to think flowers are beautiful, delicious, or lonesome.</i>

180
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,980
<i>I'd say they smell nice and lonely.</i>

181
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,860
<i>"Free"?</i>

182
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,610
<i>I guess it’s my choice.</i>

183
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,970
<i>They do smell nice and lonely.</i>

184
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:04,390
<i>I'll walk you home since you seem lonely.</i>

185
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,350
<i>- Thanks.
- See you.</i>

186
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,150
A flower that blooms in early spring...

187
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:28,190
I've been in love with Kotaro-san for a while now.

188
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,960
<i>You'd prefer gift certificates over flowers, right?</i>

189
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,690
<i>Yes.</i>

190
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:43,540
<i>Maybe you don't appreciate flowers because you're lonely.</i>

191
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,860
<i>- What?
- Flowers serve no practical use.</i>

192
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,520
<i>You buy them only if there's a recipient,</i>

193
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,350
<i>like someone important or precious to you.</i>

194
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,970
<i>Don't people buy flowers for themselves?</i>

195
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,570
<i>Exactly, someone important.</i>

196
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,840
<i>Sorry, I'm acting like a know-it-all.</i>

197
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,540
<i>- Ignore me.
- It's fine.</i>

198
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,050
<i>You've inspired me to get a gift for my special someone, too.</i>

199
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,490
<i>I can have this design made in two weeks.</i>

200
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,480
<i>Thank you.</i>

201
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,510
<i>I hope your recipient will like it.</i>

202
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,200
<i>Yes. It's a gift for someone I love.</i>

203
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,980
<i>How wonderful.</i>

204
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,720
<i>Kotaro-san.</i>

205
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,220
<i>If you have time, would you like to...</i>

206
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,460
<i>I'm sorry. I've never seen you in that way before.</i>

207
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,250
<i>You're free to think of flowers however you want,</i>

208
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:20,080
But I'm a florist. Come back if you ever find flowers beautiful.

209
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:35,320
So you were never going to be worn after all.

210
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,810
Makoto hasn't come to visit recently, has she?

211
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,010
- She won't be dropping by anymore.
- What?

212
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,300
Why's that?

213
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,070
Sorry, what?

214
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,020
I said I was dumped for a second time.

215
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,230
I told you not to meddle with Makoto-san, so I figured I'd tell you myself.

216
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,350
She and I are no longer...

217
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:23,840
Oh, great. So, that means Asahi is the closest to Makoto-san now.

218
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,300
He also lied by telling her they were friends.

219
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,810
What?

220
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,090
Asahi was lying?

221
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,200
You didn't know?

222
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,100
Asahi was only a coworker of hers.

223
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,370
They were all lies,

224
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:44,300
including my "love at first sight" and you being her ex.

225
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:50,060
I guess that shows just how much we all cared about her.

226
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,830
I really want her to be happy.

227
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,450
But I couldn't be the one to make her smile from the heart.

228
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,970
- Hey there.
- Hey.

229
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,620
I see. You two broke up.

230
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,620
Right.

231
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,240
He'll be fine. He's a strong guy.

232
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,440
So how are your memories?

233
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,110
A lot has happened since I initially lost them,

234
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:08,870
but I'm glad it let me find this job, and become friends with you.

235
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,460
Sorry, I didn't mean...

236
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,700
Don't be. I'm happy you feel that way.

237
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,570
I've decided to focus on work for now.

238
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,830
Still, it'd be nice if I could recall what happened the day I fell.

239
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,490
Asahi-kun.

240
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,010
What're you doing out here?

241
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,010
I was heading home from the office.

242
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,450
I heard you weren't really friends with Makoto.

243
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,660
No, I wasn't.

244
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,540
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

245
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,220
You see, I...

246
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,380
If you're in this area often, do you pass by my store as well?

247
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,430
Yes.

248
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,980
Even on rainy days?

249
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,030
Even then.

250
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,350
However...

251
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,490
- I won't make excuses.
- You really should.

252
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,990
Why did you lie to get on her side?

253
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:13,080
Sometimes you lie because they won't believe you,

254
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,050
you no matter what you say.

255
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:24,500
Who did you lie for?

256
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,670
Such nice weather today.

257
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,040
It'll be okay.

258
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,900
May I take this seat?

259
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,070
- Oh my, Ogata-san.
- What?

260
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,650
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.

261
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,380
- Are you alone today?
- Yes.

262
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,480
This park is quite a memorable spot for me.

263
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,030
Coming here makes me feel like I can find myself.

264
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,000
- Yourself...
- I used to come here often with my husband.

265
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,090
Is that so.

266
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:04,710
I have precious memories at this park, too.

267
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,410
But now, having those memories hurts.

268
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,450
True.

269
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:18,620
Sometimes you think you'd feel better if you could forget everything.

270
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,180
Well, I forget things all the time.

271
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:30,740
At times I can be myself like this, but the memories fade quickly.

272
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,640
I even forget the fact that I've forgotten.

273
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,980
I assume I've caused you plenty of trouble as well.

274
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,990
At times, we laugh. At times, we bicker.

275
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,410
Memories are never solely filled with happiness,

276
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,760
like my fun yet struggle-filled youth,

277
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,980
or the gift, which brought both happiness and tears.

278
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,430
Or the pleasant scent that makes you feel lonely?

279
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,290
Exactly.

280
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,550
Some memories are painful. Some, troubling.

281
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:19,260
Yet now, even those memories feel precious to me.

282
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,550
I agree.

283
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:27,570
It’s a shame to forget memories just because they’re sad.

284
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,020
I'd rather remember those sad memories as they are.

285
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,750
That's a beautiful ring.

286
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,490
Thank you.

287
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,000
My husband chose it for me.

288
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,350
Chigusa-san.

289
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,430
And Ogata-san. Hello there.

290
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,720
What happened? Didn't you have work today?

291
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,760
Today is my day off.

292
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,010
This is my elder brother.

293
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,620
Hello there.

294
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,400
A place I can find myself...

295
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,500
[Yuki Asahi - One new message]

296
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,320
[Could we meet up today?]
[There's something I want to talk about.]

297
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,790
[I'm heading to the steps where I took my fall.]

298
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,240
Why was I here that day?

299
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,650
What did I see before I fell?

300
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,040
[Now calling - kotta]

301
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,470
Hello?

302
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,820
Makoto, where are you?

303
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,370
I'm at the steps where I fell.

304
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,980
What?

305
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,000
This was where it all began.

306
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,930
Ogata!

307
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,190
I'm glad I caught you. Are you alright?

308
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,810
Your phone...

309
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,620
Thank you again.

310
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,430
Asahi-san? What are you doing here?

311
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:10,140
Well, it's difficult to call out to you at the office, so...

312
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:15,410
Did you get your handkerchief?

313
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,710
I put it in your mail slot.

314
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,020
I was wondering if you received it.

315
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:44,840
<i>Someone is tailing me.</i>

316
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,010
So...

317
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,830
Oh, no, it's not like that.

318
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,360
Wait, this is a misunderstanding!

319
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,200
Ogata-san!

320
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,220
Excuse me!

321
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,950
Excuse me.

322
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,140
Sorry about that.

323
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:38,800
Your phone might be broken. It's not turning on.

324
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,090
Ogata?

325
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,220
Did everything come back to you?

326
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,130
[kotta]

327
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,710
Ogata-san!

328
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,940
Hello? Yes, a person has collapsed.

329
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,100
Please... please come right away!

330
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,180
I only wanted to return your handkerchief.

331
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,030
<i>I happened to pick it up, but missed out on handing it back to you.</i>

332
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,870
<i>It was dirty, so I washed it.</i>

333
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,880
<i>I wondered if you'd find it weird,</i>

334
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,190
<i>or even bothersome if I gave it to you at the office.</i>

335
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,530
<i>I ended up looking like I was following you while trying to figure out what to do.</i>

336
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,630
<i>I wanted to return it anonymously,</i>

337
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,440
but it seems like that scared you even more.

338
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,900
Honestly, I had no idea until I heard your perspective on it.

339
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,970
I'm really sorry.

340
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:53,090
Sounds like something the old me would do.

341
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:58,460
I mean the me that used to wear plain clothes.

342
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,950
If she had just accepted the handkerchief with a thanks,

343
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,670
and listened to your side of it, this case would've been settled.

344
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,230
You really scared me back then, though.

345
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,350
Well, seeing how frightened I was, I get why you chased after me.

346
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,960
No, I should have just returned the handkerchief at the office,

347
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,040
without worrying about what others would say.

348
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,200
Back then, I thought interacting with people was nothing but a bother,

349
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,040
so I guess I ended up making myself lonely.

350
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:41,400
Regardless, I should have apologized about this sooner,

351
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,360
but I was only thinking about myself.

352
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,230
I'm truly sorry for everything.

353
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,000
Say...

354
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,960
Do you remember sharing cup noodles with me?

355
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:35,980
It's not that you can't recall the memory, but that you never remembered it.

356
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,820
<i>Just give it a bite.</i>

357
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,640
<i>I want more people to know how good this is.</i>

358
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:46,800
It must've been something insignificant to you.

359
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,040
Although we shared the same experience, I suppose we didn't see eye to eye on it.

360
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,310
Still...

361
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:59,230
- <i>That's good.</i>
- <i>Right?</i>

362
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,370
To me, it's a special memory.

363
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,690
Well then.

364
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,030
Wait.

365
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,000
I have to go.

366
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,810
Otherwise, I think <i>I'll</i> get pushed down.

367
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:31,630
Asahi, do you remember giving me that piece of chocolate?

368
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,060
Chocolate?

369
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,590
I really liked that chocolate.

370
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,860
It's a happy memory for me.

371
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,500
See you.

372
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,510
See you around.

373
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,480
I've finally remembered everything.

374
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:16,030
It was your fault that I fell down these steps that day.

375
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,440
My fault?

376
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,650
At that time, I thought for the first time

377
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,990
that flowers were so beautiful.

378
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,490
I wanted to tell you right away.

379
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,700
Because then, I could finally go back to your store.

380
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:53,500
I could try to give you that ring, even though I'd been rejected.

381
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,480
Except, I got so flustered, I slipped and fell.

382
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,060
So it was because of you.

383
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,130
It was because of the cherry blossoms.

384
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,970
It was because the flowers were so beautiful.

385
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,240
They were the reason I ended up losing my memories.

386
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,470
If that was the case, I'm sorry.

387
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:19,070
Therefore, I may never come to like flowers.

388
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,880
I'm fine with that,

389
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,050
because I'll just stay with you until you do.

390
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,610
Love you.

398
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:10,160
When Ogata first came to our store to get her ring made,

399
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,340
she brought in a toy ring, as her size reference.

400
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,750
A toy ring?

401
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,570
Yes. She said her youngest friend lent her a hand.

Makoto is still a fresh wound, I assume.

She is, but I never want to forget her.

I enjoyed our time together...

412
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,440
And got an awful friend out of our relationship, too.

413
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,420
Hey.

414
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,230

You would get kicked out if you did.

A friend of mine advised me to.

424
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,160
<i>Look, we're matching!</i>

425
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,610
<i>Is that a gift for Kotaro-san?</i>

426
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:04,720
<i>Yes! Because Kotaro-san owns a flower shop.</i>

427
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,280
<i>She says she can't give flowers to a florist.</i>

428
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,430
<i>Fair point.</i>

00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,390
Oh, that toy ring.

430
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,090
Right. But I won't be giving this ring to you.

431
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,630
I'll be keeping it as a charm.

432
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,230
It's helped me through a lot, after all.

433
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,660

441
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,630
Your hands are dry.

442
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:41,640
- Hand cream?
- I don't have any.

443
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,380
What? I assumed you did.

444
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,380
- Because you're Mr. Hand Cream.
- What's that supposed to mean?

445

Besides, I don't just put hand cream on anyone.

446

Really? Then what about that time...

447
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,950
