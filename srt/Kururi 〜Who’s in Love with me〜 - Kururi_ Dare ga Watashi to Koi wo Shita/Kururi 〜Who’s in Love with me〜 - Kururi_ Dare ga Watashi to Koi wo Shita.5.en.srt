1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,480
Happy birthday.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,460
It's not fair when her ex-boyfriend comes in swinging.

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,550
Why did you two break up anyways?

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,710
Do you regret that choice? Or maybe you're getting back at her?

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,410
Say...

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,320
That whole "love at first sight" thing is a lie, right?

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,230
And what about you, Mr. Ex-boyfriend?

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,550
Ogata?

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,040
Makoto, are you drunk already?

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,960
I'm fine. I just need to use the restroom.

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,990
Makoto, who is it you truly prefer?

12
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,030
Is everything okay, Makoto? Drink some water.

13
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,560
Sorry, I just remembered something.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,030
Remembered what?

15
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,800
It was only a flash, but it seemed like a childhood memory.

16
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,970
I was talking with someone, probably my mother.

17
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,020
Maybe you'll continue to remember things from here on out.

18
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,670
The doctor said it was definitely possible to recall things in a sort of chain reaction.

19
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,050
I didn't realize that was actually a thing.

20
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,700
Seems like it.

21
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,090
You must be relieved.

22
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,190
Maybe you'll remember who that ring was for, too.

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,420
It's that time of year again.

24
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,820
- Sure is.
- What's the occasion?

25
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,850
Ah, our loyal un-paying customer.

26
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,900
Hey, but I can still recognize these. They're carnations.

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,990
Right. Mother's Day is always the busiest seasons for florists.

28
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,430
I didn't realize people actually send their mothers carnations.

29
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,690
Seems like my parents forgot my birthday either way.

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,420
- You should have her look at our Mother's Day samples.
- Erm...

31
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,230
Samples?

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,760
I wanted a third opinion. Which one do you like?

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,890
Let's see... This red bouquet seems like a classic for Mother's Day.

34
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,770
The pink one gives off an elegant vibe.

35
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,150
This blue one would suit any room without fail.

36
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,340
And this last one is quite classy.

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,120
- Was I off the mark?
- Not entirely.

38
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,240
But I was asking more for your opinion.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,480
Choose a bouquet, I won't judge.

40
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,000
- Choose?
- Yeah. What's your preference?

41
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,860
My preference?

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,700
Um...

43
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,600
Sorry, I can't seem to choose.

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,960
Is something up?

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,540
I was asked to make a choice, in that childhood memory.

46
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,190
By your mother?

47
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,490
Yeah.

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,240
Does your mother know of your memory loss?

49
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,490
I can't bring myself to tell her.

50
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,320
She asked if she could clear out my bookshelf, and I haven't even answered her.

51
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,500
Is that so?

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,120
Do you think I should go see my mother?

53
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,620
That's your choice.

54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,260
I know. I know that, but...

55
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
She really ought to celebrate your birthday, even though you're an adult.

56
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,640
Sorry to your mother, but that's my honest opinion of her.

57
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,620
And if she's clearing out your bookshelf, the least she could do is tell you what's there.

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,950
I know, right? I can't believe her.

59
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,000
Thanks.

60
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,540
[Grandma gave Genta a bunch of books today. Can we free up the bookshelf of your books? You won't need them, right?]

61
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,890
[I'll come visit this weekend, and clean out the shelf.]

62
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,870
I understand. After all, making a choice means you must also give something up in exchange.

63
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,870
Then rather than being averse to choices, I dislike making sacrifices?

64
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,840
You don't need to see your mother if the notion scares you.

65
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,420
No, sir. I want to know more about myself.

66
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,370
I have to assume my mother would know something.

67
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,590
Then I would advise you to bring someone along.

68
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,670
Ideally, someone who won't hesitate to voice their complaints.

69
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,130
Why is that?

70
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,110
While it's easy to discuss the good,

71
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,840
the bad, and harder to touch topics are much more difficult.

72
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,600
You trust a person, once you can share your truth to them.

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,930
My... truth.

74
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,620
- Here is your change of 600 yen.
- Thank you.

75
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,220
My, your fingers are black. What happened to them?

76
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,390
I believe I mentioned my job the other day?

77
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,470
Your job?

78
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,740
Ms. Chigusa. Ms. Ogata is a jeweler who makes rings.

79
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,070
You make rings?

80
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,060
That's quite amazing.

81
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,690
Thank you...

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,300
[I'll come visit this weekend, and clean out the shelf.]

83
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,290
I have to assume Kae's probably busy on the weekends.

84
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,180
[Yuki Asahi - One new message]

85
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,870
[Hey]

86
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,880
[Have you been able to recall anything else since then?]

87
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,950
[Makoto Ogata - One new message]

88
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,060
[Nope.]

89
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,070
[I'm going to see my mom this weekend though.]

90
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,390
- Yeah?
- Hey. You're going home to Izu?

91
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:25,410
Yup, Mother's Day and all that. I might even remember more once I'm there.

92
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,080
Then maybe I'll tag along.

93
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
Tag along?

94
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,850
Thanks, but I'll manage.

95
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,870
Talk to you again.

96
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,470
Yeah, see you.

97
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,600
- Looking forward to it.
- Thank you.

98
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,860
I'm glad our clients weren't so mad about our slip up.

99
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,710
Nah, if we don't pull through, they'll drop us without a word.

100
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,590
It'll depend on our efforts.

101
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,760
- Yikes. We better get on that.
- Yeah.

102
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,640
I have dinner plans tonight, but I'll be sure to return by midnight.

103
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,880
Can't you move it to another day?

104
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,340
Sorry, but this is with my most important client.

105
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,070
And I'm sort of in a rush, in my own way.

106
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,350
Sorry, but we're closed for the night.

107
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,160
Let's grab dinner. I want to make it up to you, for your birthday.

108
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,090
Do you like restaurants like this?

109
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,930
Not necessarily. I just thought it'd be good for getting acquainted.

110
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,030
Then what sort of places do you like?

111
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,620
Places I like?

112
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,980
So long as the food's good and the atmosphere's fine, I have no complaints.

113
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,690
It's hard to answer when people ask what you prefer, right?

114
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,900
I get it, I'm the same way.

115
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,680
That's because you're clever.

116
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,440
When you have strong preferences, it's easy to be hurt, and to hurt others.

117
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,650
You prefer to make your choices based on the pros and cons.

118
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,210
In that sense, I think we're quite similar, you and I.

119
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,450
I looked up my hometown, and guess what?

120
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:28,010
It's got hot springs, oceans, mountains - the whole package!

121
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,480
I wonder if I can swim?

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,920
Let's go visit in the summer and find out.

123
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,020
I am visiting, this weekend actually.

124
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,870
This weekend? Oh, Mother's Day.

125
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:45,520
I wonder what she's like? Honestly, I'm a bit terrified.

126
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,470
You aren't obligated to get along with your folks.

127
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:55,040
Makes it easier to think of them as classmates you just ended up with, you know?

128
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,030
But a weekend in Izu, huh?

129
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,450
Might as well make it a glamping trip for two -

130
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,780
Ms. Makoto? Ms. Makoto.

131
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,800
No way.

132
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,960
We're almost there, Ms. Makoto.

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,670
- I feel sick...
- What?

134
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,390
Hold it in, please?

135
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,470
What's the big idea, getting her drunk stupid at this hour, hm?

136
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,150
To be fair, I wasn't expecting this either.

137
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:29,270
While I could turn a blind eye to this development, I'm still trying to remain neutral.

138
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,020
So here, I'll take her off your hands.

139
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,420
Too bad. I think 90% of women would choose me over an ex or former coworker though.

140
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,640
Romance isn't about probability.

141
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,960
- You're a tough opponent, Ms. Kae.
- Sure am.

142
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Alright, Makoto. Let's get you home.

143
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,710
Ow...

144
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,410
I wonder if I'm a lightweight...

145
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,640
This is rough.

146
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,390
- This is Asahi, speaking.
- Glad I got through. I've got an emergency.

147
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,530
I'll need you to accompany me on my business trip to Fukuoka tomorrow.

148
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm sorry sir, but this weekend is...

149
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm begging you, Asahi. Great, thanks!

150
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,980
Sir. Sir, I can't.

151
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,030
Ritsu, this is not getting settled by Monday, even at this rate.

152
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,890
Alright, you're all staying in the Ritz-Carlton tonight.

153
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,350
Your rooms are on me.

154
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,070
- Rest, and let's reconvene in the morning.
- The Ritz?

155
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,700
- Holy cow!
- Yes!

156
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,350
- This is going to be awesome.
- Thanks, sir.

157
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,400
Thank you, come again.

158
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,490
Which bouquet has been popular?

159
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,560
The red one, so far.

160
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,080
Really? Then I guess that lady is a fan of blue.

161
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,030
Or her mother is.

162
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,830
I wonder if family would know each other's preferences?

163
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,100
- 3,000 yen.
- What?

164
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,210
Be a paying customer for once.

165
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:31,810
It's actually 3,980 yen, but I'm giving you a special offer.

166
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,490
Well, I can't turn down a deal like that.

167
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you, dear customer.

168
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,040
Will this be for Mother's Day?

169
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,660
Yes. I plan on visiting over the weekend.

170
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,090
Alone? Will you be alright?

171
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,770
I mean, this is pretty heavy.

172
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,990
Then could you deliver it to Izu with me?

If I did all that for 3,000 yen, our store would go under.

174

Too bad, 3,000 yen is my budget.

00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,020
I will.

Asahi? Why?

187
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,520
I managed to get someone to cover my business trip.

188
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,260
It's the first time I've turned down the boss though.

189
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,250
Hold on, I'm not following.

190
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,180
I'll come with you, to Izu.

191
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,470
- Why?
- "Why"?

192
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,010
Because I'm your friend.

193
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,190
I'll hold that.

194
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,800
Thanks.

195
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,410
I don't remember any of this.

196
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,680
Got it. According to the map, your house is that way.

202
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,080
I guess I have no choice but to be honest upfront.

203
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,070
Yes?

204
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,460
- It's me, Makoto.
- Coming.

207
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,710
Gosh, you should have told me!

208
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,900
- Oh no, we're not -
- Remember me, Makoto?

209

Oh my, what a mess...

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,050
Nope, still don't remember anything.

216
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,980
Welcome home, Makoto.

218
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,150
- Huh?
- Yuki Asahi. Nice to meet you, sir.

219
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,700
Hello there. I'm Makoto's father.

220
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,060
I didn't realize you'd marry so soon.

221
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,430
- Erm...
- We're not getting married.

222
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,220
- Ah, so not yet.
- I'm her coworker.

223
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,020
You two met at the office?

224
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,770
- How wonderful.
- It's one misunderstanding after the other.

225
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,620
- Ogata.
- Oh, right.

226
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,550
These are for you.

227
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,550
Carnations?

228
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,760
Sorry, did you not like flowers?

229
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,240
What? Who wouldn't like receiving flowers?

230
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,900
Right.

231
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,610
- Thank you, dear.
- Sure.

232
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,910
- That's so nice.
- They're absolutely beautiful.

233
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,980
So what is Makoto like at the office?

234
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,120
She is an efficient salesperson, far more than myself.

235
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,310
How do I breach the topic from here?

236
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,550
If I may ask, what was Ms. Makoto like as a child?

237
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:25,530
She's always been a clever girl, and never a handful to deal with.

238
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,840
She was almost too mature for her age.

239
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,710
She moved out to Tokyo for college,

240
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,560
and she's only been home three times since, including for her coming-of-age ceremony.

241
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,570
That's why I'm surprised she's back for Mother's Day.

242
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,300
I didn't realize.

243
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,080
I mean...

244
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,930
I hear there are great hot springs in the area.

245
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:57,160
Ms. Makoto says she'd prefer to stay home, but I'd like to take a dip since I'm here.

246
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,660
In that case, shall us guys go?

247
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,240
- I'd love to.
- I actually know a good place.

248
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,430
Really?

249
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,810
I see this Asahi is a kind, good-natured man.

250
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,320
Yeah.

251
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,550
I'm glad I insisted you pick a good man to be your husband.

252
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,120
Have you been strict about choices since I was a child?

253
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,360
Of course. I want my only daughter to lead a good life, after all.

254
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,860
Life is a never-ending slew of choices.

255
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,690
You earned a recommendation into college, chose a steady company,

256
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:34,620
and now, Asahi. Your choices are as rational as ever, dear.

257
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:42,340
If, hypothetically, I forgot everything about myself,

258
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,180
and quit my job to become an artisan of sorts, what would you think?

259
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,620
You, forgetting everything?

260
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,210
Gosh, don't even joke about something like that.

261
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,210
I can't be worrying about you at this age.

262
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,630
Genta already gives me enough trouble.

263
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,850
Right.

264
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,120
That goes over in the left cabinet, up top.

265
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,730
- Okay.
- Thank you.

266
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,780
I want this marriage to be a success, you know?

267
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,150
You remember how difficult it was for me after the divorce.

268
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,440
How old was I when that happened again?

269
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,500
Let's see...

270
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,010
You had your multiplication tables memorized by then.

271
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,790
So third... no, second grade? Either way, you were about eight.

272
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,850
Then I wonder if this happened when I was around eight, too.

273
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:45,720
You were asking me to make a choice, over who I preferred.

274
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,980
Do you remember what we were talking about?

275
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,990
What? I wouldn't remember something from that long ago.

276
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,180
Right. Shot in the dark, I guess.

277
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,780
Mom, I'm going to soccer practice.

278
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,280
Okay, hold on.

279
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,510
Do you have your towel?

280
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,820
Yup!

281
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,720
Then be careful.

282
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,560
- I will!
- See you later.

283
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,040
So? The temperature feels nice, right?

284
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,120
It's a bit hot, but yes.

285
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,290
I'm glad Makoto found someone like you, Asahi.

286
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:37,940
I'm sure you've heard, but I married Makoto's mother when she was in high school.

287
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:42,680
In fact, Makoto was the one who gave me the push to go for it.

288
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,180
She's a real good kid.

289
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,830
Then you didn't have much time with her, before she moved out.

290
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,220
Unfortunately. She's not one to complain about anything,

291
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,490
and she ended up leaving the nest early.

292
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,150
She really is a mature kid.

293
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,220
Saves us trouble, what with Genta being an absolute handful.

294
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,700
That's only inevitable.

295
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,950
Yes, he's quite the troublemaker after all.

296
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,210
She had no choice but to be mature.

297
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,680
Huh?

298
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:26,340
I'm glad I was able to accompany her to Izu.

299
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,420
Hot!

300
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,670
It is scalding in there.

301
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,620
[What Day is it Today?]

302
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,140
Ogata.

303
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,850
Welcome back.

304
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,010
- How was the hot spring?
- It was hot.

305
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,780
Were you able to bring up your memory loss to her?

306
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,320
- It's fine though.
- But -

307
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,870
I'll just clear out my bookshelf and be on my merry way.

308
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,300
If anything, this shelf tells me a lot about myself.

309
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:18,640
It's filled with manuals and textbooks - a real snooze fest, I'd say.

310
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,790
And done.

311
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,590
- Origami?
- Yeah, muscle memory I guess.

312
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,120
I see.

313
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:32,490
I found one picture book on my shelf.

314
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,580
It had an origami piece between one of the pages.

315
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,450
"What Day is it Today?"

316
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:48,220
It's about a child who places notes throughout the house addressed to her mother.

317
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,050
She'll place one within the umbrella stand...

318
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:55,360
which would lead her mother to the pond, and so on.

319
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,510
Each note has a hint on it, like a treasure hunt of sorts.

320
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,080
The story concludes with the notes leading to a box,

321
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,740
which contains a present for her parents' anniversary.

322
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,990
- That's a nice story.
- Yeah.

323
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,650
I found this between the pages, too.
[Happy Anniversary!]

324
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,580
Is this your handwriting?
[Happy Anniversary!]

325
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,260
Probably.

326
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,260
But if it was hidden away here,

327
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,540
I assume that means my mother didn't find the final note.

328
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,480
[Were you able to carry the flowers on your own?]

329
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,920
[Thanks for worrying! Asahi carried them for me, so it worked out.]

330
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,870
Asahi?

331
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,450
I've been wanting to place some greenery in our office.

332
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,990
Since we're in the area, could you check our place out?

333
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,860
This is the busiest day of the year for me.

334
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,510
Right, Mother's Day.

335
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:36,400
I wonder if Ms. Makoto's alright back home alone.

336
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,450
Asahi went with her.

337
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,160
You let them go together?

338
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,330
I didn't "let them" go anywhere.

339
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,140
Aw, you're deflecting.

340
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,970
I hear oblivious people only realize they're in love

341
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:54,340
when they become jealous, you know?

342
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:06,030
I've stopped at nothing to get my hands on the things and people I truly want.

343
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:11,650
So no boring man like Asahi,

344
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,270
or fishy ex-boyfriend deters me.

345
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,460
In fact, I think I'll come out victorious.

346
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,230
She's waiting on that ring-man of hers though.

347
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:28,000
Doesn't matter. I'll just have Ms. Makoto fall for me before he turns up.

348
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,620
So? What's your take on this "ring-man", Mr. Florist?

349
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,170
- I have my questions.
- Oh?

350
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,680
For one, why hasn't he come for her already?

351
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,430
And is the man a good guy, or not?

352
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,650
- Ritsu, our beta test is ready.
- Great.

353
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,580
Then if you could find a place for those greens, I'd appreciate it.

354
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,180
Those photos are from our flower viewing party.

355
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,310
It's beautiful. Was this close by?

356
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:17,390
This year we held it at Setagaya Central Park. It was a blast.

357
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,660
Setagaya Central Park?

358
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,350
Wasn't there an accident around that time? I heard an ambulance had to come.

359
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,980
Oh yes, I remember something like that.

360
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,840
Did your boss not join the festivities?

361
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,400
No, he's the bunny there.

362
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,500
He said something about staying undercover.

363
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,600
Our boss is funny like that.

364
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,610
I like the next photo, where he has the mask off though.

365
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:56,180
- Ta-da!
- Wow, it's a feast!

366
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,740
Tomorrow is Mother's Day.

367
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,150
Beer?

368
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,810
- Thank you.
- I want fried chicken.

369
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,190
There you go.

370
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,560
Here, Dad. Just don't drink too much.

371
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,370
- Come on, it's a special day.
- Is that enough?

372
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,790
I'll take that.

373
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,480
Genta, do you drink milk?

374
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,740
No, I hate milk.

375
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,250
Someone's never growing taller then.

376
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,390
Maybe it's thanks to Asahi, but you've become cheery, Makoto.

377
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,990
You think so?

378
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,270
- For you.
- Now eat up.

379
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,990
Thank you.

380
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,600
Hey.

381
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,070
Sorry, I wasn't planning on staying over...

382
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,930
That is one crazy shirt.

383
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,580
I know, right? It's something the old me liked.
[Eating Disorder]

384
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,730
Didn't realize you had that in you.

385
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,810
The previous "Makoto Ogata" sure is an enigma, isn't she?

386
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,950
Are you sure you aren't pushing yourself?

387
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:12,420
You're acting the way you used to.

388
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,160
Are you sure you won't tell them about your memories?

389
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,340
I came here to ask them about my true self,

390
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,360
yet here I am lying like an absolute hypocrite.

391
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,530
- Ogata...
- Sorry you ended up becoming my pretend "boyfriend" too.

392
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:35,180
It's fine. I'll move downstairs to sleep though.

393
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,830
Why? Just sleep here. I don't mind.

394
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,550
No, but...

395
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,040
No buts. I bet you're tired anyways.

396
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,450
I thought coming home would trigger a memory.

397
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,560
But this whole time, it's felt like I'm at a stranger's house.

398
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:24,490
Asahi. Thanks for coming with me.

399
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,750
I'm absolutely beat.

400
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:38,230
Good night.

401
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,200
Even if your memories never come back,

402
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
I like you as you are now.

403
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:17,240
I seriously can't sleep.

404
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,960
"Who do you... prefer."

405
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,750
- Morning.
- Morning.

406
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,950
- Where's Asahi?
- He's still asleep.

407
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,970
Makoto.

408
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,470
- I remembered.
- Huh?

409
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,040
The incident you asked me about yesterday. I remember now.

410
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:23,260
It was when your father and I were on the verge of a divorce.

411
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,810
Things were dicey between us.
[Love you, Daddy! Look in your pockets!]

412
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:29,220
Which of us do you prefer? Mommy or Daddy?

413
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:36,800
Makoto, who is it you truly prefer?

414
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,880
I… I…

415
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,940
So you're saying the same things to your father.

416
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,090
Makoto, you truly are a clever girl.

417
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,950
I remember.

418
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,980
I recall admiring how you dealt with it all, telling us both you loved us equally.

419
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,420
It made me realize you had it put together, unlike myself.

420
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:17,080
Thinking back on it now, that person was indeed your father.

421
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,440
But in my eyes, it felt like you had betrayed me, and I lashed out.

422
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,540
I see.

423
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,220
I get it.

424
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,170
It all makes sense.

425
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,970
Huh?

426
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,000
I think I understand now.

427
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,290
I understand why I can't just choose.

428
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,260
I get why I lived in that empty room.

429
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,600
Why I live so pragmatically.

430
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,730
Why I don't even have flowers around.

431
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:56,730
It's because a "clever child" needs none of those things.

432
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:58,400
Makoto?

433
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,990
Ogata.

434
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,020
Asahi...

435
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,590
Ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm not her boyfriend.

436
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,480
- What?
- Asahi.

437
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,750
My apologies. I'm actually just a friend.

438
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,860
I came along with her to Izu, because I was worried.

439
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,400
Worried? Why would he worry?

440
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,840
I was involved in an accident, and lost all my memories.

441
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,890
What?

442
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:39,280
I had forgotten my name, age - everything.

443
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,870
The only thing I've remembered since, is that memory from when I was eight.

444
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,540
- Dear...
- But don't worry.

445
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,980
I've been able to deal with it just fine.

446
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,910
If anything, I'm doing better. I have more friends, I quit my job,

447
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,620
and I'm currently aiming to become a jeweler, making rings.

448
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,360
What?

449
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,910
I'm doing something I actually love.

450
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:09,950
So I'd say I'm leading a good life, just like you wanted.

451
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,080
Whether I'm successful or not is a whole other story though.

452
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,560
Oh, I probably have a boyfriend too.

453
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,720
Makoto?

454
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,850
Yup.

455
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,630
I'm Makoto.

456
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,520
But...

457
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:33,000
"Makoto" also doesn't feel like "Myself".

458
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:41,910
So as I learned of this younger "Makoto Ogata",

459
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:49,390
I realized she must have been folding that origami, with all her heart.

460
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,930
It made me long to give her a hug.

461
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,160
I have to go clear those books, don't I?

462
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,510
[What Day is it Today?]

463
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,190
[What Day is it Today?]

464
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,150
[Love you, Daddy! Look in your pockets!]

465
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,080
[Love you, Mommy! Look in your kitchen cabinets!]

466
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,720
[Love you, Mommy! Look in your kitchen cabinets!]

467
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,740
So you're saying the same things to your father.

468
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,710
Makoto, you truly are a clever girl.

469
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,710
[Love you, Daddy! Look in your pockets!]

470
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:35,390
[Happy Anniversary!]

471
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,670
[Open when you're in a pinch]

472
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,800
[Carnations are edible. Good luck.]

473
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,670
Mr. Kotaro...

474
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,720
Gross.

475
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,750
That tastes terrible. What do you mean they're edible?

476
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:10,660
Seriously, what do you mean?

477
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,120
Of course I can't choose.

478
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,120
Mom...

479
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,580
This is seriously gross.

480
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,920
Unbelievable.

481
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,410
Ogata.

482
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,160
Oh, uh...

483
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,940
You okay?

484
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,390
Thanks.

485
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,730
You helped me open up about my memory loss.

486
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:04,940
The only thing I learned here, was that within this home,

487
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:11,990
"Makoto Ogata" acted as the version her mother wished to see.

488
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,330
[What Day is it Today?]

489
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:23,530
Was acting a part for someone else who I truly was?

490
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,540
Then of course she would earnestly consider flowers to be food.

491
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:32,790
She grew up to be pragmatic, without a need for "useless" items.

492
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,390
She was desperate to lead the "good life" she was supposed to.

493
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:41,940
Makoto Ogata, was desperate to succeed.

494
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,950
Sorry, the reason I was eating this flower was because Mr. Kotaro said -

495
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,690
Asahi... I'm not eight.

496
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,420
- See you.
- Thank you for the carnations.

497
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:47,280
I wouldn't call them my personal favorite though.

498
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,380
They taste downright terrible.

499
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,190
Let's go.

500
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,640
- Thank you for having us.
- Come again.

501
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,780
Take care, you two.

502
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,840
- Wave them good bye.
- Bye!

503
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,740
[What Day is it Today?]

504
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,750
[Happy Anniversary!]

505
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:30,100
Please... don't remember any more than you already have.

506
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,200
Thank you, come again.

507
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,730
Welcome.

508
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,980
That carnation tasted horrible.

509
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,340
You're here to complain?

510
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,960
I am, indeed.

511
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,090
I'm sorry it failed you in your time of need, ma'am.

512
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:03,290
Although I would have rushed over to exchange the product...

513
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,530
Sorry.

514
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:11,770
No, the flower was useful.

515
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:14,400
I had to laugh at how tasteless it was.

516
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,600
It made me laugh.

517
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,970
I got so mad at how gross it was, I couldn't help it.

518
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:27,750
And then, it made me realize I didn't like the stupid thing.

519
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,830
- Carnations?
- Yeah.

520
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:35,200
In a word, I'm glad I visited.

521
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,500
I wonder if there's a flower out there I'd like.

522
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:49,360
You're free to come visit until you find the one.

523
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:57,060
And when you do, let me send it to you to celebrate the occasion.

524
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,460
[YUKA - One new message]

525
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,520
"YUKA"?

526
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,130
Who's that?

527
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,750
[How's it going with you and Hayato?]

528
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,200
[...Hayato?]

529
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,020
"Hayato"?

530
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,080
[...Hayato?]

531
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,730
- Yuka?
- Makoto!

532
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:39,170
She's apparently her best friend from high school.

533
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,550
Were you able to figure out who that "Hayato" was?

534
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,910
I even hear you and Hayato had met up until recently.

535
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,110
Are you this, "Hayato"?
