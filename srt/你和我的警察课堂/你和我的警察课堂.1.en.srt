I am Kim Hyunsoo

GRANNY

00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,823
Everything...

12
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,159
has started...

13
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,661
with his death.

UNIV. NAC. OF KOREAN POLICE - KNPU

17
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,627
EPISODE 1

18
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,420
UNIV. NAC. OF THE KOREAN POLICE

19
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,467
CANDIDATE KO EUNKANG

20
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,803
What did you want to be as a child?

21
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,641
I always wanted to be a policeman

22
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,602
and serve the country and the people
since she was a little girl.

23
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,939
I was always told to be a policeman
and fight injustice.

24
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,566
To be a policeman is my only dream.

25
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,284
- Miss Ko?
- Yes.

26
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:05,995
Did you want to be a policeman since you were a child?

27
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,330
No.

28
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,417
I have wanted to be several other things.

29
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,451
Move your arms, come on!
Let the two of us, just the two of us

30
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,245
Let us dominate this night

31
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,706
Make the moonlight shine

32
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,960
Mom!

33
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,169
- What?
- Mom.

34
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,714
I've made up my mind.

35
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,049
I'm going to be a singer, a K-pop star.

36
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,302
Didn't you say you would be a firefighter?

37
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,637
No! Not anymore.

38
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,097
My thing now is to sing.

39
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,891
- I am talented.
- What?

40
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,975
I can show you.

41
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:10,852
Bon appetit.

42
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,562
But the world is big,

43
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,564
and dreams change.

44
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,483
Wow, what a delay...

45
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,069
2,000 WONES

46
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,196
Two per person...

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,323
2,000 x 10 = 20 MILLION

48
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,825
2,000 x 100 = 200 MILLION?
2,000 x 1,000 = 2 MILLION?

49
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,201
That's a lot of money!

50
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,704
- Mom.
- Yes?

51
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,539
I want to sell donuts when I grow up.

52
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,583
What?

53
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,252
I have arrived.

54
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:39,296
Come in!

55
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,342
What?

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,928
Eunkang, guess who is here.

57
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,515
Sageori, the pharmacist's son.

58
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,937
You know, the top student from Yangmun College,
who entered KNPU this year.

59
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,064
Jang Juchan.

60
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,901
Two months to go
for his semester to begin,

61
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,819
so I asked for private lessons.

62
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,906
That's right, the fork.

63
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,810
You must be Eunkang.

64
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,986
Hello.

65
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,447
I hope we will be friends.

66
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,092
UNIV. NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KOREAN POLICE

67
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,970
Then, my dream...

68
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,305
From today on, my dream is...

69
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,641
I decided to become a policeman...

70
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,188
Gotcha. Bang, bang!

71
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,820
Because of a certain person.

72
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,240
Miss Ko?

73
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,703
- Yes?
- Who is this person?

74
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,122
You signed up here
because of someone.

75
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,499
That person is

76
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,627
Professor Cha Ugon.

77
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,507
That's right. After seeing him

78
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,676
in the documentary Mysteries Without Solution.

79
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,178
I thought:

80
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,182
"I want to be a smart cop
and good-hearted like him."

81
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,600
Then,

82
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,560
I also read his book.

83
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,480
After reading this book,

84
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,441
I wanted even more to become his student.

85
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,653
Give me the chance to learn from my idol, Professor Cha.
with my idol, Professor Cha.

86
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,406
I will be a great policewoman!

87
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,202
You are flattering me.

88
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,248
- TV programs can influence a lot.
- I get it.

89
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,752
What is the problem?

90
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,795
The interview accounts for 5% of the grade.

91
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,714
I had to pull his bag.

92
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,967
Anyway, he loved it.

93
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,386
I should have praised all the teachers.

94
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,888
I had other teachers there.

95
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,140
They must have taken away the points he gave you.

96
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,018
Well, better a bird in the hand
than two in the bush.

97
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,937
It is better to focus on just one.

98
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,941
You don't understand.
It was all strategically planned.

99
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,361
Right. Very good.
Are you coming straight home?

100
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,446
Why? Will you make something tasty for me?

101
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,281
- Yes.
- Right.

102
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,365
Bye.

103
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,539
I can't miss the opportunity.

104
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,059
- How was the interview?
- It was fine.

105
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,895
Why do you ask? Where are you?

106
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Right.

107
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,484
- Health.
- Health.

108
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,115
This place reminds me of last year.
It was that time.

109
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,700
- I was always in anguish.
- Why was that?

110
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,202
The fortune-teller said
that I would not get into college.

111
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,247
That's why he had a talisman in his underwear
on the day of the vestibular?

112
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,832
You are very superstitious.

113
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,501
That was costly!
And that's what got me through.

114
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,754
- Want to see? I still do.
- How disgusting!

115
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,174
Come on, guys. Of course he would pass.

116
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,845
Drink it all at once.
Then you too will pass.

117
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,888
That doesn't make sense.

118
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,309
- What? Are you crazy?
- What is it?

119
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,729
He withdrew the money we had saved
to do the backpacking.

120
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,230
- What?
- What?

121
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,899
I only took my share.
I'll go with you on the next one.

122
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,276
- Why?
- What is it?

123
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,237
He bought a designer handbag
for his girlfriend.

124
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,239
- Branded? Have you gone mad?
- What?

125
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,158
- He is blinded by love.
- Damn it.

126
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,411
- I'm sorry. I'll buy the drinks.
- No. Call your girlfriend.

127
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,997
- Why?
- You bought the bag,

128
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,042
she has to pay for the drinks.

129
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,211
Yeah, call her.
Seunghyun doesn't know her yet.

130
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,963
She should come and greet him.

131
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,214
But...

132
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,091
I don't like other people's girlfriends.

133
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,718
- Still...
- There it goes.

134
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,595
- Unbelievable.
- However,

135
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,014
I want to see who ruined our fellowship.

136
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,891
Well, she is very busy.

137
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,434
- Call her.
- Wow!

138
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,019
- She is pretty. Turn it on.
- Let's go.

139
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,647
- Is she pretty?
- Is she pretty? I want to see.

140
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,607
How old is she?

141
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,069
- Come on, show us.
- How old is she?

142
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,570
Is that her? I want to see.

143
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,405
You are right.

144
00:10:57,406 --> 00:11:00,701
Wow, she looks really busy.

145
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,836
There?

146
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,588
It's not...

147
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,175
It's not the...

148
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,612
I knew it! That's why you rushed me.

149
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,988
Yes, I'm coming!

150
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,825
What should I do?
The employee didn't show up.

151
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,119
Are you going to let a student do the delivery?

152
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,706
Mom, I'm going to take the vestibular soon.
Every second is worth gold.

153
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,375
You should be nervous.
What if I'm not accepted?

154
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,294
I'm nervous, come on!
You will be accepted, don't worry.

155
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,505
- But...
- Let's go. Come on, hurry.

156
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,423
- Wow!
- Let's go!

157
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,175
- Excuse me. A beer, please.
- Coming!

158
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,805
Why do I have to work
and Mikang doesn't?

159
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,228
Wow! You think that being a senior in school
is very important, isn't it?

160
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,190
It was fun, wasn't it?

161
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,361
- I'm hungry. Let's get something to eat.
- Okay.

162
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,679
How much did you give?

163
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Hello.

164
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,893
Isn't that the pizza delivery guy?

165
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,936
We are looking for a person.

166
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,440
Got it.

167
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,108
- Strange.
- Wait.

168
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,276
Hold on. One second!

169
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,112
- Honey, what is it?
- There are some crazy guys out here.

170
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,196
One second.

171
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,200
What?

172
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,454
HAPPY BIRTHDAY

173
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,372
Let me go!

174
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,499
Mikang!

175
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,638
What is it?

176
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,313
Let me go!

177
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,025
- We broke up last week.
- Wasn't that a joke?

178
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,819
How could you? It's only been a week!

179
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,697
Mikang, were you cheating on me?

180
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,490
What?

181
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,244
We'll talk later.

182
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,789
No. If you cheated, apologize.

183
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,124
Get out of the way. It's none of your business.

184
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,252
Only after you apologize.

185
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,796
- Then I'll call the police.
- What?

186
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,174
I feel threatened.

187
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,386
You seem to count
on the public authorities,

188
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,514
But that is for good people,
who have a conscience.

189
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,267
Not for a shameless one.
It would be wasting taxes.

190
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,643
So don't abuse it.

191
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,186
Stop it.

192
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,938
Stop what, you idiot?

193
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,649
She was just taking advantage of you.

194
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,943
This golddigger just played with you.

195
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,361
Control yourself!

196
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,904
- What happened?
- Hey!

197
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,698
Eunkang!

198
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,867
What did you say?

199
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,370
- What did you call my sister?
- A golddigger.

200
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,706
How rude!

201
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,040
What should I call her?

202
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,128
She dumped my friend after winning
a scholarship of 5 million wones.

203
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,131
And she was cheating on him too.
My friend is not an idiot.

204
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,091
Go ahead, but be decent.

205
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,720
If you were going to break up with him,
why did you accept the gift? Low blow.

206
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,723
It was a gift...

207
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,933
Wow, so you accepted.

208
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,103
She accepted it because he gave it to her.

209
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,940
It was out of consideration.
It would have been rude to refuse.

210
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:05,195
Tell me. Did she ask you to buy this?

211
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:07,489
No.

212
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,199
No way.

213
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,244
I swear. I bought it because I wanted to, I really did.

214
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,164
You heard him.
It seems that he just wanted to impress you,

215
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,749
which she never asked for.

216
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,878
If you don't know what happened,
don't accuse an innocent person.

217
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,546
My sister is not swayable.

218
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,508
Mikang, give back everything he gave you.

219
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,302
This is very pathetic.

220
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,261
No.

221
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,097
I would feel bad.
You don't have to do that.

222
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,182
Hey.

223
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,101
She will return everything you have given,

224
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,645
then look no further.

225
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,356
And stay away from our house.
If we see you around here,

226
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,941
Let's report them to the police.

227
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,108
You'd think so.

228
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,402
My friend never wants to see his sister again.

229
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,447
Great. I guess we won't be seeing each other anymore.

230
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,574
So bye. Let's go.

231
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,659
Quick.

232
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,455
Where are you going?

233
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,960
Were you cheating on me?

234
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,463
No.

235
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,465
- I already said that...
- Yes, I was!

236
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,259
Wow! Do you have to yell at me?

237
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,427
Follow me.

238
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,972
- Hold on.
- Let me go.

239
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,098
Excuse me.

240
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,809
Gee, what's your problem?

241
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,893
Who are you?

242
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
Answer. What do you want?

243
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,610
There is no need for violence.

244
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,863
- You don't like it either, do you?
- Hey! Let me go.

245
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,448
Let it go first. Then you can go.

246
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,830
You know she betrayed me.

247
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,207
I know, but I don't agree with your violence.

248
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,500
It is wrong.

249
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,168
Pulling someone is violence.

250
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,714
What? Violence? You...

251
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,341
- Violence?
- Do you have anything else to say?

252
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,010
This is unbelievable. Hey.

253
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,970
- Let me go and let's talk.
- Let's go!

254
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,221
Please let him go.

255
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,931
Can you let go?

256
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,809
- Hey. Look...
- Did you say "look"?

257
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,618
You are a disgrace to our family.

258
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,872
I did not betray him.

259
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,624
I am not that kind of person.

260
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,628
You could have waited
before going out with another guy.

261
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,297
He got another one after a week!

262
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,631
You naughty girl

263
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,219
- Sit down.
- Just say it.

264
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,429
Sit down!

265
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,393
When two people feel a connection,

266
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,855
can become best friends
and even lovers in a single day.

267
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,317
Love is about depth,
not with time.

268
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,861
So love while you can.

269
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,863
Life is one. Don't regret it.

270
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,865
You drive me crazy.

271
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:55,949
Wow!

272
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,829
Anyway, return everything you received from him.
Is that OK?

273
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,500
Answer.

274
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,127
It wasn't only me who got presents.

275
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,630
I also gave him a fancy wallet.

276
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:13,300
- We gave each other gifts.
- The prices are different.

277
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,260
Put your hand on your conscience.

278
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,932
What is my answer?

279
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,852
- All right.
- Give it all back, okay?

280
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,978
I'll keep an eye out.

281
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,857
Where did you get the money for the wallet?

282
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,867
No, you didn't...

283
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,207
Hey!

284
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,501
- Hey!
- What?

285
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,585
Hey!

286
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,130
Come here!

287
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,548
Calm down, Eunkang.

288
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,509
Please, Eunkang. Calm down.

289
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,386
"Calm down," my ass!

290
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,720
Calm down!

291
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,597
How could you? You...

292
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,099
- Hey!
- It's me, your sister.

293
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,226
- I'm going to kill you!
- Let's go. Calm down.

294
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,436
- Calm down!
- Give me my money back!

295
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,647
- Damn it!
- Calm down!

296
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,506
Let's go. Apologize to Mikang.

297
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,801
It is her fault.

298
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,469
She took my money.

299
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,014
I know that! Still,

300
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,392
How could you hit your own sister?

301
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:47,936
Is money worth more than your family?

302
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,106
We have to do something
about her temperament.

303
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,400
We were cool
to concentrate on your studies,

304
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,360
and this is how you repay us?

305
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,571
Let's go. Apologize to Mikang.

306
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,490
- Why am I the only one who gets scolded?
- Who would I fight with?

307
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,202
Why should I apologize if it is her fault?

308
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,495
They always defend her because she is sick.

309
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,748
I'm not so healthy either!

310
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,667
And you always send me to deliver.

311
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,753
Ko Eunkang!

312
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,464
Shut up!

313
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,552
How dare you retort like that?
Respect your mother!

314
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,514
Wow, what's her problem?

315
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,142
What do you think you are, a fighter?

316
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,644
Wow...

317
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,983
My goodness, I'm so scared...

318
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,109
Ko Eunkang!

319
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,404
I did nothing wrong.

320
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,531
I am sweet when no one disturbs me.

321
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,535
I don't know how I became such a positive person
in this horrible environment...

322
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,830
When I go to college
I'm gonna move out of that house

323
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,541
And I won't even look back.

324
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,169
- Wow!
- What are you grumbling about?

325
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,505
Hey.

326
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,511
Are you staying in the dorm?
Long time no see.

327
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,138
I was in a training session after the races.

328
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,850
By the way, how was the interview?

329
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,104
They asked the same questions
that you asked me.

330
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,816
And Professor Cha's book
was also very helpful.

331
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,859
He was one of my interviewers.

332
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,279
Really? You were very lucky.

333
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,781
I'll take you to dinner if it's accepted.

334
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,117
No, I'm buying dinner.
Your job is to come in.

335
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,120
You are very strange.

336
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,915
I thought it was a joke
that I wanted to study at my college.

337
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,127
It was very daring,
his grades were not good.

338
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:39,256
Only my grades in math were bad.
The rest was good.

339
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,340
Even in mathematics.

340
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,677
Anyway, I was the student
who progressed the most last year

341
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,928
in the whole school.

342
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,180
My teacher said it was a miracle.

343
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,474
You don't know how hard I tried!

344
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,060
I am proud of you.
You are very dedicated.

345
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,897
In the end,
I'm actually kind of smart.

346
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,190
No, it is not.

347
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,073
The vestibular is worth 50% of the score.

348
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,951
- Stay focused until the end.
- I will.

349
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,163
Here.

350
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,001
What?

351
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,846
STEP

352
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,974
They are sweet "step" sweets.

353
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,435
I hope it will pass so we can study together.

354
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,520
Study...

355
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,648
together?

356
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,526
- You can go in. I'm coming.
- Bye-bye.

357
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,335

- You see?
- Mikang,

364
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,424
I will be a policeman when I join the KNPU.

365
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,551
The police represent integrity.

366
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,346
How can I keep such an item at home?

367
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,142
Pass before you say that.

368
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,727
Wait a little.
The result will come out in two days.

369
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,147
Serious? Interested?

370
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,901
I will return the bag
and make his friend apologize.

371
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,071
That idiot.

372
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,327
PASSED THE KNPU IN 2017

SEARCH

374
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,584
I can't look. What if she didn't pass?

375
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,794
Hey, watch your mouth.

376
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,963
What? I'm scared.

377
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,756
Silence. It's almost time.

378
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Five.

379
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,719
- Four.
- Four.

00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,887
- Three.
- Three.

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,971
- Two.
- Two.

382
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,055
One!

383
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,559
Today we are going to talk
about juvenile drug crime

384
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,269
that happened in the arcade.

385
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,314
Mr. Wi Giyong is head
of the Gyeonggi Prefecture.

386
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,565
INSIDE THE NEWS

387
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,648
Hello, sir.

388
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,151
Hello.

389
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,695
You are the foremost Korean expert

390
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,239
in drug investigations.

391
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,617
It has been ten years since he revealed

392
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,913
the connection between a drug cartel
and the Damos Hotel in Gangnam.

393
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,873
You were the head of Narcotics,

394
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,875
and this case caused a stir at the time.

395
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,629
What do you think about this drug crime?

396
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,298
- Well, this case...
- Excuse me.

397
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,883
Sorry.

398
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,135
- We need to take a break.
- Of course.

399
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,058
We apologize, sir.

400
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,393
- We know how busy you are.
- It's okay.

401
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,315
WIFE

402
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,070
He got the highest score!

403
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,366
Haven't you seen it yet?

404
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,076
You have already posted about it.

405
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,704
How proud of my son!

406
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,083
He is a beautiful boy!

407
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,086
Don't be so gaudy!
The score doesn't matter.

408
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,255
What matters is his performance there.

409
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,633
Let's go. A compliment wouldn't hurt.

410
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,721
He even dropped out of medical school
to be a great policeman like you.

411
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,224
I still think it's a shame...

412
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,726
He makes his own decisions.

413
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,479
Did you say anything strange to the reporters?

414
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,232
Don't worry.
I didn't say anything about you.

415
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,315
Great.

416
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:11,027
When they learn
that the father is high up,

417
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,030
- are going to make things difficult for him.
- Right.

418
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,993
I was thinking of going out today,

419
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:21,663
buy him new clothes
and have dinner together.

420
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:22,998
When will it end?

421
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,959
Go without me.
We are solving an emergency right now.

422
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,042
Dear...

423
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,213
Wow!

424
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,426
He thinks he is the only one protecting the country.

425
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,475
Is it ready yet?

426
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,270
Yes. Is he busy?

427
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:50,775
Yes. But we can make
our own celebration,

428
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,777
just the two of us. Are you okay?

429
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,823
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

430
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,368
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED

431
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,875
I told you to be careful what you say.

432
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,712
Why is it my fault?

433
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,844
Everything is fine.

434
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,477
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED

435
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,929
KOREAN NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

436
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,138
MONUMENT OF JUSTICE

437
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,848
Attention!

438
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,975
Attention!

439
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,936
Attention!

440
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,941
Let's start the Cheongram training
for the students of class 47.

441
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,652
Cheongram is a mentoring program

442
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,237
for the freshmen.

443
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,988
In the next two weeks,

444
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,949
will train the physical and the mind.

445
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,743
I hope you can finish the training

446
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,245
and enter university.

447
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,205
Understood?

448
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,373
- Yes!
- Yes!

449
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,166
Louder. Understood?

450
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,502
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

451
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,338
All freshmen must
turn in their personal belongings

452
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,923
and use the products provided.

453
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:41,177
Using prohibited items, such as cell phones,
can lead to expulsion.

454
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,930
So I want you to be careful.

455
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,724
Gi Hanna.

456
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,061
- Next.
- Wi Seunghyun.

457
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,816
WI SEUNGHYUN
KNPU

458
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,996
There, I got it all.

459
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,666
- Delivered.
- Can't I take my sneakers?

460
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,085
- Do you think this is a parade?
- Ah...

461
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,087
Fair enough.

462
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,049
- I'll take this one and this one.
- Just one.

463
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,845
Next.

464
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,225
Is that all?

465
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,478
One second.

466
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,688
Next.

467
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,772
Yoo Daeil.

468
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,319
Freshman.

469
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,947
What is it?

470
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,035
It is a pillow.

471
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,330
I have anterior projection of the head.

472
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,125
You know how important it is
to maintain the C-curve in the neck.

473
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,919
- Delivered.
- Yes, sir.

474
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,759
Don't be alarmed, folks.

475
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,095
They are only exaggerating
to intimidate the naive freshmen.

476
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,306
Pretend to be afraid.

477
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,935
Many students give up halfway through.

478
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,646
Last year, 20 freshmen dropped out.

479
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,397
Don't worry.

480
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,150
People adapt to any environment.

481
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,069
It doesn't matter where they live.

482
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,154
Are you calm because you are older?

483
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,781
Really...

484
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,033
It can be informal. We are colleagues.

485
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,618
But he is three years older.

486
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,662
Hey, Bumju,

487
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,665
- Stop doing that.
- Let's talk without formality.

488
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,333
- It makes everything simpler.
- É.

489
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,460
He's right. Say hello.

490
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,921
- Hey!
- Hey!

491
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,216
Whose is it?

492
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,967
It is mine.

493
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,635
Why are you there?

494
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:02,735
Wasn't it yours?

495
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,237
Sure, thanks.

496
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,825
Your name is Kim Tak, right?

497
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,035
- I hope we get along well.
- I did.

498
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,003
Wow, what a guy...

499
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,297
Finally, I would like to say...

500
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,178
that, since we are here, we are colleagues,
I hope we get along well

501
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,055
and make it to the end.

502
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,809
Thank you. I'm Woo Juyoung.
I have finished my presentation.

503
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,939
Why did you come here
if you took Biology in high school?

504
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,067
I thought I would study
somewhere like KAIST.

505
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,613
Gee, you don't know anything, do you?

506
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,949
What is the essence
of police investigations today?

507
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,451
Forensic Science.

508
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:55,288
So I'm trying to use my strength.

509
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,040
Is that so?

510
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,791
Good luck.

511
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,545
And you?

512
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,255
You are obviously from Seoul.

513
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,132
I am from Ilsan.

514
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,885
My name is Jang Soyeon.

515
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:11,012
I enjoy walking and reading.

516
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,013
And I'm good at...

517
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,182
I can say that I am a good pianist.

518
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:15,850
It's your turn now.

519
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,894
My name is Gi Hanna.

520
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:19,854
From Gangneung.

521
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,815
I love Gangneung. I've been to Gyeongpodae.

522
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,944
Is that all?

523
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,864
- Should I say more?
- Well...

524
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,741
You don't have to.

525
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,535
Does she want to be mysterious?

526
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,537
How annoying!

527
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,038
Never mind.

528
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,460
Is it my turn now? I'm ...

529
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,880
Actually, you probably already know...

530
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,008
Wait. Have you...

531
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,510
Now! Right?

532
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,015
That's right. I am Shin Ari,
star of Golden Bell.

533
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,183
Have you ever been on TV?

534
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,726
Didn't you know?

535
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,604
No, I was going to ask
if you have had eyelid plastic surgery.

536
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,775
What are you talking about?

537
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,319
Wait. You had a nose job too.

538
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,654
No, I didn't!

539
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,573
- I don't believe it.
- It's serious. Touch.

540
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,826
- Feel.
- Where did you operate on your eyes?

541
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,953
The nose. Touch the nose.

542
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,036
But his eyes...

543
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,626
Freshmen, assemble now.

544
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,926
It took them 20 minutes to get together!

545
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,929
I'll let it go because it's the first day.

546
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,472
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,349
I am the head coach, Um Hyuk,

548
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,060
and I will train them
for the next two weeks.

549
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,651
From now on,
you can only say three things.

550
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,654
"Yes, sir," "Sorry, sir."

551
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,031
and "I'll get better, sir."

552
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,741
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

553
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,409
Is that all?

554
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,202
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, sir!

555
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:00,788
Wi Seunghyun got the highest score
to enter.

556
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,999
He will be your representative.

557
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,417
Yes, sir!

558
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,169
- Wi Seunghyun is the leader.
- Leader!

559
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,880
- Form eight rows!
- Yes, sir!

560
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,632
Move it!

561
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,426
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR

562
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,640
Let's start the basics
of physical training with the PT series.

563
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,686
Until the end of the Cheongram training,
you will have to do a thousand PTs a day.

564
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,397
Got it? Got it?

565
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,066
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

566
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,496
Synchronize!

567
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,373
100 more!

568
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,417
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

569
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,466
Move to the rhythm.

570
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,094
Stand in line!

571
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,471
Hold the line!

572
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,479
Get the hang of it!

573
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,191
Stay alert!

574
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,943
Get it right!

575
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,361
Keep moving!

576
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,196
Keep moving!

577
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,365
- Look ahead.
- Keep on counting!

578
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,908
Don't stop!

579
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:19,992
- Yes!
- Yes!

580
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,748
I told you to do it right!

581
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,044
The goal behind you.

582
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,839
The first ten
to go around it pass.

583
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,757
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

584
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,092
Run now!

585
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,679
Faster!

586
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,403
COUNTRY, JUSTICE, HONOR

587
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,657
- Take your positions.
- Yes, sir!

588
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,701
- In your positions.
- Yes, sir!

589
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,036
Same thing, without the top ten.

590
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,831
This time, the top 20 pass. Go!

591
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,040
- Yes!
- Yes!

592
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,426
STUDENT DORMITORY

593
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,848
Advertisement for the freshmen.

594
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,267
There will be a roll call at 10 pm.

595
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,770
Get ready for the call.

596
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,354
Repeat.

597
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,567
There will be a roll call at 10 pm.

598
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,237
Get ready for the call.

599
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,323
Repeat.

600
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:43,701
There will be a roll call at 10 pm.

601
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,996
- Get ready for the call.
- Dope.

602
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,295
Is that trash can supposed to be there?

603
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,384
What are you doing here?

604
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,887
Do not change the ownership of KNPU.

605
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,597
Yes, ma'am.

606
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,729
Who is responsible for this?

607
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,192
That's me.

608
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,236
Did you clean it or not?

609
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,988
I didn't clean the outside.

610
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,615
What are you grumbling about?

611
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,659
I didn't know it was supposed to be cleaned from the outside.

612
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,244
Answer right!

613
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,828
I only cleaned from the inside!

614
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,877
If you did it, say so.
If you didn't, say so.

615
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:38,589
- Can't answer?
- I'm sorry. I'll answer right.

616
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,176
- Wipe again.
- Yes, ma'am!

617
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,328
This training teaches you

618
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,747
to obey orders
quickly and correctly.

619
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,542
This helps in the development
of the police mentality.

620
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,295
First, you will learn about formations.

621
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,380
Form five lines!

622
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,674
Form five lines! Leader, one!

623
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,175
- Two!
- Three!

624
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,220
- Four!
- Five! End of the order! In formation!

625
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,346
In formation!

626
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,933
Form eight rows!

627
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,934
Leader, one!

628
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,060
- Two!
- Two!

629
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,145
Get it right!

630
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,564
Forward march!

631
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,647
Left.

632
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,233
Left.

633
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,695
Change of pace, march!

634
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,114
You may leave!

635
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,658
Follow the rhythm.

636
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,412
- One, two.
- One, two.

637
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,955
Don't make that face!

638
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,415
- One, two.
- One, two.

639
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,583
- One, two.
- Right!

640
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:56,792
- One, two.
- Hurry up!

641
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,336
- One, two.
- One, two.

642
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,587
Get a grip!

643
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,342
Form four lines!

644
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,760
- Leader!
- Two!

645
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,345
- Three!
- Four!

646
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,267
You have to say:
"Four. End of order. In formation!"

647
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,602
Four! End of the order!

648
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,604
- In formation.
- Four! In formation!

649
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,285
"Four. End of the order. In formation!"

650
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,371
End of the order. In formation.

651
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,498
- Louder.
- Four! Order! In formation!

652
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,581
Are you kidding?

653
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,709
- Again.
- Sorry, sir!

654
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,961
- Again!
- Four! Order! Form...

655
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,214
- Four! In formation! End!
- Again.

656
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:49,011
- Are you crying?
- No, sir!

657
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,430
- Again!
- Four! End of the order!

658
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,056
Louder.

659
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,226
End of the order! In formation!

660
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,398
This exercise is the most basic.

661
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:04,652
How do you want to be a policeman
without knowing the basics? Idiots!

662
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,028
Pardon me, sir!

663
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,448
Say "let's go" in one
and "concentrate" on two.

664
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,991
Start doing 100 push-ups.

665
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,077
- Begin.
- Yes, sir!

666
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,079
- One.
- Let's go

667
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,747
- Two.
- Concentrate.

668
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,541
- One.
- Let's go

669
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,000
- Two.
- Concentrate.

670
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,877
- One.
- Let's go

671
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,421
- Two.
- Concentrate.

672
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,380
One.

673
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,881
- Let's Go
- Let's go

674
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,925
- Two.
- Concentrate.

675
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,678
- One.
- Let's go

676
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,555
- Two.
- Concentrate.

677
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,515
- One.
- Let's go

678
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,350
- Two.
- Concentrate.

679
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,352
- One.
- Let's go

680
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,895
- Two.
- Concentrate.

681
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,148
- One.
- Let's go

682
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,191
- Two.
- Concentrate.

683
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,609
Three more to go!

684
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,820
- One.
- Let's go

685
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,572
- Two.
- Concentrate.

686
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,825
- One.
- Let's go

687
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,618
- Two.
- Concentrate.

688
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,579
Stand up.

689
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,460
Do you want them to do it all over again
just because of you?

690
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,503
Being a woman is no excuse.

691
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,881
If you want to be weak,
stop and go away.

692
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,591
No, sir. I will do it again.

693
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,055
Let's concentrate.

694
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,809
Let's concentrate.

695
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,436
Let's go

696
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,354
concentrate.

697
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,440
Let's go

698
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,192
concentrate.

699
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,318
Let's go

700
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:29,694
concentrate.

701
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,363
Let's go...

702
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,204
Stand up.

703
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,544
- Excuse me, sir!
- Get up!

704
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,298
Freshman Wi Seunghyun, sir.

705
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,051
May I say something?

706
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,219
Go ahead.

707
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,431
She doesn't seem to be doing well.

708
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,975
You. Stand up.

709
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,403
Are you not feeling well?
If you are not well, you are dismissed.

710
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,322
Well...

711
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,366
I'm not...

712
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,536
- feeling...
- Answer me straight.

713
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,291
I'm fine, sir. I can do it.

714
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,257
Great.

715
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,008
Then do the rest.

716
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,302
Yes, sir.

717
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,138
Please, sir.

718
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,185
How can she be sincere

719
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,312
under such pressure?

720
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,024
No one could say that it is not okay.

721
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,617
What about "that pressure"?

722
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,163
In case you don't know,
you didn't come here to have fun.

723
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,999
You came to train, so train.

724
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,625
Training is a must,

725
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,545
even if you are tired
ill or doesn't want to.

726
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,133
Won't you help people in trouble
if you are feeling bad?

727
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,181
Listen to everyone.

728
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,727
After graduation, you will be police officers

729
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,855
and will take care of the life
and the safety of the people.

730
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,565
Police officers have to set an example.

731
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,942
If you use your state as an excuse,

732
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,070
No one will obey your orders.

733
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,449
Whoever is not confident,
can leave now.

734
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,368
For the weak,
this place will be hell.

735
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,413
They will not last four years here.

736
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,293
And who protects us when we are sick?

737
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,644
STUDENT DORMITORY

738
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,228
There are two possibilities.

739
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,357
Or his brain froze
after being punished in the cold,

740
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,275
Or his eyes froze and he went blind.

741
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,110
Does our brain freeze?

742
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,990
I didn't mean literally. Wow!

743
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,534
He didn't understand the situation
and crossed the line.

744
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:26,455
I thought he was smart,
he got the highest score.

745
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,041
It has no emotional intelligence,
doesn't see the environment.

746
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,876
He was not wrong.

747
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,796
I found it very rewarding.

748
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:37,341
He must have known who he was talking to.

749
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,177
Look at the coach's face.

750
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,804
That kind of scoundrel

751
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:44,431
crushes you harder
when you try to defend yourself.

752
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,392
Don't mess with them.

753
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,771
So Seunghyun is in trouble,
the coach didn't like him.

754
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:54,274
He is not the one you should worry about.

755
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,652
- We are not safe either.
- Why not?

756
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,072
He will not only pick on Seunghyun.

757
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,367
If he does that, they will say it is bullying.
What will he do?

758
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:07,496
He will punish Seunghyun
and whoever is together with him.

759
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,831
Do you know the name of this?

760
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:13,711
It is called joint and several liability.

761
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,799
If he sees a speck of dust,

762
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,677
It will end with all of us. I'm sure of it.

763
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:24,805
Damn it!

764
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,183
Why do I have to share a room?
I don't want to get involved.

765
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,853
People, stay away from Seunghyun.

766
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,772
There is something sinister about him.

767
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,650
Stop exaggerating, okay?

768
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,403
Stop being ominous.

769
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,406
Me?

770
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,289
Why do you think so?

771
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,231
He asked who was protecting us.

772
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,817
We protect each other.

773
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,903
So we train to be strong.

774
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:25,699
But training that
that ignores differences can be tough...

775
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,743
It is no place for individual education.

776
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,328
Either you hang in there, or you give up.

777
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,663
They are your only options.

778
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:36,043
Doesn't a policeman's son know that?

779
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,006
Don't think that your father will protect you.

780
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,263
Whoever your father is,
no one can get in the way of training.

781
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,067
UNIV. NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF KOREAN POLICE

782
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:11,453
- Are you really leaving?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

783
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,330
No fuss...

784
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,998
Can't you take a little more?

785
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,416
It's almost over.

786
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,253
They will not act like this
after the Cheongram training.

787
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,047
I only caused trouble for others.

788
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:24,675
I am sorry.

789
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,561
Let's go back.

790
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:36,644
Right.

791
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,568
It must have been very difficult.

792
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,903
Hey, we found you.

793
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,240
Soyeon just left.
You can catch up with her if you run.

794
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,284
- Yes.
- I'm fine.

795
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,160
We don't really talk much.

796
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,332
She was our roommate.
You should say goodbye.

797
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,294
I don't want to be distracted
by a quitter.

798
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,172
Well, we are here and that's what matters.

799
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,429
Who will use this bed, then?

800
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,558
CONGRATULATIONS ON GRADUATION

801
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,520
They could have sent it by mail.

802
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,440
What am I doing here?

803
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:24,902
GRADUATION CEREMONY
OF PUNGJIN HIGH SCHOOL

804
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,327
- Let's go!
- Let's eat something tasty today.

805
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,786
- Really? Yay!
- Yes!

806
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:36,705
Mom! I'm here.

807
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,373
I told you to hurry.

808
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,251
You could have let me know it was over early.

809
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,295
- Eunkang!
- There you go answering me.

810
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,673
There she is. Eunkang.

811
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,216
Dear!

812
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,385
See, that's why I told us to hurry.

813
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,596
Sorry I'm late.
Congratulations on graduation.

814
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,809
Eunkang, let's take a picture together.

815
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,771
A photo? We don't need one.

816
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,523
Let's go. To celebrate her graduation.

817
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,693
What is this face?
Is it because you were not accepted?

818
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,947
- Try again next year.
- She's right. College?

819
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,157
It can wait a year. What's the problem?

820
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,701
No luck this time.
Your time will come.

821
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,578
- Heads up!
- Yes.

822
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,456
- Right. Let's take a picture.
- Yes. Head up.

823
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,958
- Let's go.
- A photo?

824
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,460
Look here. Let's go.

825
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:27,214
Three, two.

826
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,633
- Wait.
- What is it?

827
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,801
They are calling me.

828
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,302
- Calling you?
- Yes.

829
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,890
- Hello?
- Is this Miss Ko Eunkang?

830
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,684
Yes, that's her.

831
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,143
Here it is from KNPU.

832
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,312
- What?
- We have an opening, and it's yours.

833
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:43,855
Can you register tomorrow?

834
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,567
Right. I'm on it.

835
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,783
What is it?

836
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,876
Why? What is it?

837
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,086
What is it?

838
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,296
I was accepted!

839
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,137
I got in!

840
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,018
CONGRATULATIONS

841

STUDENT DORMITORY

842
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,083
Use the empty bed.

843
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,627
The other students are training now.

844
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,464
So, if you have any doubts,
ask your colleagues.

845
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:57,888
After lunch,
come for the afternoon training.

846
00:50:58,972 --> 00:50:59,972
Yes, ma'am.

847
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,931
What is that? What a good smell!

848
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,185
KNPU

849
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,853
Is it lunchtime?

KNPU
A CRADLE OF GLOBAL TALENT

851
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,592
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

852
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,596
Thank you.

853
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:28,979
Life is unpredictable.

854
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,737
I thought they didn't accept me
in college,

855
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,447
But then a miracle happened.

856
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,575
What did you say?

857
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,286
What did you call my sister?

858
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,329
Interesting.

859
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:51,501
Sometimes you meet someone again
you thought you would never see again.

860
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,255
As if

861
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,299
was fate.

862
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,594
But I didn't know

863
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,973
that it was just the beginning of my 20s,
which turned out to be

864
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,475
like a roller coaster.
