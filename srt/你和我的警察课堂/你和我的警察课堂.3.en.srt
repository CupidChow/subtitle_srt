PART 3

4
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,561
If the camera was recording,

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,521
There must be a charger somewhere.

6
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,107
Where is she?

7
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,247
It must be here somewhere.

00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,879
SAVE ELECTRICITY

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,845
Hi. I forgot something.

10
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,806
God, where is it?

11
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,399
Is that what you're looking for?

12
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,948
Will you explain to me what it is?

13
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,702
It looks like a camera charger.
Where did you get it from?

14
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,289
- Bring it on.
- You did it, didn't you?

15
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,375
- Give.
- Answer. Have you been recording?

16
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,628
Answer! You've been recording, eh?

17
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,171
Leave me alone!

18
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,341
Let go!

19
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,135
What do they do?

20
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,850
- Give it back!
- Let go!

21
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,352
I said let go!

22
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,110
The entire Training Corps
Is in favor of expulsion.

23
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,654
What does the student government think?

24
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,530
We are gathering feedback from yearbooks.

25
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,491
It will take some time, as we are on a break.

26
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,827
Be careful that the issue does not surface.

27
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,539
Why do we need a first-timer like her?

28
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,458
I knew there would be trouble with her,

29
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,419
When she told Sunyu that she was awake.

30
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,755
I felt like smacking her then.

31
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,007
- What is it about?
- Never mind.

32
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,930
- What's going on?
- Camera. That is.

33
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,308
I know whose camera it is.

34
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,729
Don't.

35
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,314
That's not me.

36
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,152
So where did this charger come from?

37
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,113
This is.

38
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,741
phone charger.

39
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,868
It is not allowed to have a phone at the training.

40
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,329
Sorry.

41
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,206
My mother is sick.

42
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,583
There is no other family,

43
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,878
So just in case
I have a phone with a charger.

44
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,098
NAME: GI HANNA
INFORMATION: NO FATHER

45
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,480
Will you leave us alone?

46
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,898
That's right.

47
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,866
Sit down.

48
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,332
Your mother called.

49
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,501
I couldn't call you,
because you had training.

50
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,211
Belated congratulations.

51
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,379
Thanks.

52
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,221
It must have been hard.

53
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:54,062
Yes, you don't even know how hard it was.

54
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,023
I don't know where to start.

55
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,276
It's been a few days,
and I'm like years older.

56
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm not kidding.

57
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,158
Why didn't you say it was like that here?

58
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,078
They constantly inflict punishments on us.

59
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,121
I feel like I'm in the military.

60
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,874
They check if we sleep during lectures.

61
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,461
- You got caught sleeping.
- I wasn't sleeping.

62
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,254
She misinterpreted it.

63
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,132
He always has a cap covering his eyes

64
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,968
And somehow he squints,
That he certainly can't see anything.

65
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,013
And how do you know that?

66
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,432
Have you heard from this girl?

67
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,267
No "the one," she's your superior.

68
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,312
From her, anyway.

69
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:41,359
What a cutthroat.
I didn't know she was like that.

70
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,653
A little strange.

71
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,821
Eunkang.

72
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,074
- It's not what you think it is.
- What.

73
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,952
- Well...
- The Corps is not for the faint of heart.

74
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,871
They have six months of training
before the Cheongram program.

75
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,833
Here they test,
whether the freshmen will survive four years.

76
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:57,959
Take it seriously.

77
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,462
Right.

78
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,173
Address me formally at school.

79
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,259
Right.

80
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,683
But you don't have to be afraid.

81
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,272
By the way, Jechan...

82
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,942
I ask.

83
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:28,698
When you heard about the camera,
did you think it was my fault?

84
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
Of course not.

85
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,161
I know you.

86
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,583
Let's go.

87
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,251
- Well done.
- Thanks.

88
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,007
PHONE

89
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,133
Caution.

90
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,602
Nothing to worry about.

91
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,062
Send me everything that is left there.

92
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,192
My grandchildren are helping me,
so we'll be up and running in no time.

93
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,861
Okay, for now.

94
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,865
Oh, come on.

95
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,451
Fold nicely.

96
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,370
Defective deduct from paycheck.

97
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,873
- Right.
- That's right.

98
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,835
But you know we wanted to pay....

99
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,962
later.

100
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,006
Did you see the card?

101
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,300
I haven't seen.

102
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:33,221
But anyway, how could I trust you?

103
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,640
Well...

104
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,269
glue them all together carefully

105
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,480
Before I go back, okay?

106
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,692
Or I will tell everything to the
Training Corps.

107
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,277
Do we understand each other?

108
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,529

113

Today we will not sleep.

114
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,920
Damn!

115
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,381
Where did that bastard Seunghyun go?

116
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,554
What took so long?

117
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,349
KOREA NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

118
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,815
You are doing great. Hi.

119
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,983
For now.

120
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,282
Hey.

121
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,325
- Don't scare me.
- What about you?

122
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,036
- Apparently you have a guilty pleasure.
- How do you know?

123
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,414
You've taken a beating. Everyone knows.

124
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,833
But how did you know about the charger?

125
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,712
Well, I had it right under my nose.

126
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,008
She could only hide it in one place,
So I searched our room.

127
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,012
In any case, you are also contributing.

128
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,305
I have to admit.

129
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,933
Just why did she do it?

130
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,477
I don't know. They should discover it.

131
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,146
Pardon?

132
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,148
Please charge.

133
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,693
Right.

134
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,163
It doesn't fit, does it?

135
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,375
Because it's not a phone charger.

136
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,894
Who gave it to you?

137
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,401
A student will not easily get such a thing.

138
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,992
It is a Russian model,
It was used seven or eight years ago.

139
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,079
We used to use it too,
But not anymore. Battery too weak.

140
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,039
Can it be purchased just like that?

141
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,167
I don't know. Rather, you can,
the only question is why.

142
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,377
Do you want to buy?

143
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,711
Don't.

144
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,923
I ask out of curiosity before class.

145
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,677
Forgive the off-the-cuff question.
UNPK colleagues are the best.

146
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,763
- Thanks, man.
- How about thanking me in person?

147
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,432
You've been rotting in school since you returned to Korea.

148
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,019
Sounds good to me. I'll give it a call.

149
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,069
Tell me. Who gave it to you?

150
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,081
Unlock.

151
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,166
- I'm listening.
- Go ahead.

152
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,180

00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,287
It is necessary to recharge every eight hours.

What if I get caught?
There are cameras in the dormitory.

Starting tomorrow, repairs in the ceiling.

All the cameras will be taken away.
Don't worry.

170
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,727
I checked everything.

171
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,974

172
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,518

I didn't know there was one.

177
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,880
And I knew something was wrong with her.

178
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,425
He has such slanted eyes
And perpetually tense eyebrows.

179
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,218
That's what anxious people have.

- Analyze your face?

182
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,103
Show.

183
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,900

- Stop it!

Sorry. To the point.

186
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,699
Quick!

187
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,039
Seunghyun, give more saliva,
so that it sticks well.

188
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,374
But you're a slacker.

189
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,877
Bumju, what is this?

190
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,171
- Again.
- What are you doing?

191
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,255
Me: I supervise.

192
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,841
Who asked you?
Don't you see the need to do?

193
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,176
God, what a...

194
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,261
You don't understand anything.

195
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,432
Listen. When something is done in a group,

196
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,937
It takes a boss to make the system work.

197
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,690
I check what is slowing us down
And I control the speed.

198
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,860
I also check the quality.

199
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,946
Close.

200
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,658
- That's who should supervise...
- Sit.

201
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,210
Right. Even supervisors
sometimes work in the field.

202
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,462
Let me help you.

203
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,927
It will take us centuries to get there.

204
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,221
They are about to turn off the lights.

205
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,264
Right.

206
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,104
ACADEMIC

207
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,777
Check here and...

208
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,204
I FIRST

209
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,790
DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO IT?

210
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,917
SWAPPED, THAT IS, WILL NOT EMBRACE

211
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,420
GOOD, I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU

212
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,547
GOOD LUCK!

213
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,438
I have to ... use the restroom.

214
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,579
MALE

215
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,972
The eagle has arrived. Acceptance, Latavian.

216
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,730
- What took so long?
- They exchanged.

217
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,190
Did he suspect nothing?

218
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,484
I am a great actor.

219
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,989
Prompt. We've done a lot already.

220
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,741
Where is Yes?

221
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,285
Right.

222
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,678
Look where we landed
Because of the stupid pasta.

223
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,263
I will have a pasta trauma.

224
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,060
You took too much at once.
You should not have overdone it.

225
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,604
What, you say, is my fault?

226
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,649
You were the one who ate the most.

227
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,150
Don't you remember anymore?

228
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,111
We ate equally.

229
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,612
Equally?

230
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,323
I saw how much you take. A little culture.

231
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,450
Okay, get out of there.

232
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,077
Get out!

233
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,788
Can't we finish and go to bed?
I'm so sleepy.

234
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,335
Sorry.
I shouldn't tell you about the pasta.

235
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:51,380
Less so. Everyone agreed to eat.

236
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,592
I didn't think I would be facing such a thing here.

237
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,435
Detective Lee Jaehan.

238
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,772
Do you guys do something like this too?

239
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,661
Is it the same there?

240
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:26,790
Is there ... is it the same?

241
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,791
If you have the cash...

242
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,876
If you have the cash...

243
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,295
- ...and acquaintances...
- ...and acquaintances.

244
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:35,132
...Can you lead a good life
regardless of your hopelessness?

245
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,275
But 20 years have passed.

246
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,944
Something must have changed.

247
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,779
Right?

248
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,659
No, not true.

249
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,872
Detective

250
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,291
Lee Jaehan.

251
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,921
Do you me...

252
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,506
hear?

253
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,053
Did you answer the phone?

254
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,763
You answered me...

255
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,686
Detective Lee!

256
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,606
- Who is Lee Jaehan?
- It's obvious.

257
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,108
Because of him I am here.

258
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,486
Guess what?

259
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,072
If I become a cop
And I get unsolved cases.

260
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,492
someday I will be able to work with him....

261
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,077
Talk about a series.

262
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,453
As if how?

263
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,622
Dude, you need imagination.

264
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,500
God, what a freak. Stop.

265
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,712
- Lightning struck and that's it.
- You guys don't seem to have feelings.

266
00:20:55,796 --> 00:21:00,133
How are you going to talk to citizens?

267
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,266
What is the stench?

268
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,725
Something stinks here.

269
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,232
Kim Yes!

270
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,150
- Holy shit.
- That's you, right?

271
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,362
God, Yes, Detective!

272
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,572
I will murder you, Yes!

273
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,826
UNPK

274
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,912
You wanted to reveal,
how a colleague was unfairly treated,

275
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,580
Which is gone.

276
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,791
- Am I right?
- That's right.

277
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,086
The colleague left
three days after receiving her punishment.

278
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,006
I didn't want a repeat,

279
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,258
So I decided to
to unveil the Cheongram program....

280
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:43,635
The school had to be informed.

281
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,138
If there was trouble with the Corps.

282
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,015
Don't you think so?

283
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,478
I could not inform,
being put under pressure.

284
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,565
If I did that, I would be punished.

285
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,943
Did you intend to make it public?

286
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,404
I was counting on outside pressure.

287
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,991
I acted thoughtlessly,
But please understand that I meant well.

288
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,662
The police are acting in accordance with the law.

289
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:15,000
Illegal acts cannot be
justified by good intentions.

290
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,044
Additionally,

291
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,422
How could you
prosecute illegal recorders,

292
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,924
When you do it yourself?

293
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,679
We can consider the matter closed.
In accordance with the rules of the school

294
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,014
you are expelled.

295
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,726
You can appeal,
But that would be a waste of time.

296
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,519
The result will remain the same.

297
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,606
I consider the disciplinary committee closed.

298
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,818
Can I appeal elsewhere?

299
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:47,324
Publish online
Or report on the violence,

300
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,160
Which I have experienced here?

301
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,126
If I am not a student,

302
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,879
then I have no reason...

303
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,757
to cover it up.

304
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:16,228
This is no longer about just any camera.
The case is about violence at the university.

305
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:22,484
I will still talk to the student.

306
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,361
It was difficult to communicate with her.

307
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,072
Even a mouse,
being trapped, will bite a cat.

308
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,909
And this girl wanted to bite you.

309
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,328
- Professor.
- No hard feelings.

310
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,164
I just wanted to say,
That we are not going to solve the problem,

311
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,041
influencing it in this way.

312
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,627
What do you suggest?

313
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,462
Should we not excrete it?

314
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,423
If that's what it takes.

315
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,426
It had to happen eventually.

316
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,679
We train these kids
the same way I was trained.

317
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,305
There will be dissenting voices.

318
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,598
Under these circumstances

319
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,893
We can radically change the
Cheongram's program.

320
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,103
Professor!

321
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,689
The problem of violence
of verbal and physical Corps

322
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,941
will only grow.

323
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,609
Penalties are part of education.

324
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,403
They are not targeted without reason.

325
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,655
The kids you are talking about,

326
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,158
do not know patience,
dedication, unity.

327
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:15,871
The spoiled brats will not listen,
if we are calm and gentle.

328
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,999
They will listen. They are not children.
They are over-twenty-year-old adults.

329
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,917
The school has its own traditions.

330
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,628
We do everything our own way.

331
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,754
Traditions?

332
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,089
Which ones specifically?

333
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,845
Why always, at the end of the day,

334
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,139
Are you arguing in my office?

335
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,350
Does this place have that effect on you?
Do you feel the competitive spirit here?

336
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,393
Sorry.

337
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,561
Sorry.

338
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,897
I understand you, professor.

339
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,441
I also understand the professor.

340
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,068
This time, let's listen to Professor Cha.

341
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,612
Ma'am.

342
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,323
UNPK CONTROVERSY

343
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,866
Most students,

344
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,993
Who graduated from UNPK, went to law school.

345
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,664
People are angry that taxes
are spent on lawyers, not police officers.

346
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,000
They say it is de facto theft.

347
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,836
People are not with us.

348
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,173
So let's not make a scandal out of it.

349
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,137
Sorry.

350
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,681
I would like to say something as a consolation.

351
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,022
Will you continue to ignore me?

352
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,444
I know you were afraid. And since you are apologizing,

353
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,280
then I will be better and accept the apology.

354
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,824
But that doesn't mean I'm not angry.

355
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,537
Well!

356
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,122
I will improve, I promise.

357
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,543
Save such talk for the boy.

358
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,963
- Come on, don't be like that.
- God, what are you doing?

359
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,006
- Leave.
- They announced the decision.

360
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,135
NOTICE

361
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,429
GI HANNA
THREE MONTHS CONDITIONAL PERIOD

362
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:57,430
Conditional period?

363
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,140
What nonsense.

364
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,268
The condition is not just a punishment.

365
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:03,478
He can't go out for three months.

366
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:06,731
But it's not right. It's not fair.

367
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,275
Eunkang nearly flew out.

368
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,735
I also have a distaste for it.

369
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,904
Does she have any connections here?

370
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,121
Wait, what's the point?

371
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,540
- About water.
- Water, clearly.

372
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,626
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing of the sort.

373
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,753
What did you do?

374
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,049
Right.

375
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,512
I don't know what you did,
But you owe me an apology.

376
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,306
You haven't apologized to me yet.

377
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,683
For what?

378
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,935
Are you talking about the camera in your jacket?

379
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,187
That's not me.

380
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,648
You took my jacket by mistake.

381
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,321
So you don't owe me an apology?

382
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,617
Don't you know that I would almost fly out of here?

383
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,745
Are you so mad?

384
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,331
- What?
- They didn't even accept you here.

385
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,042
You got in by luck. Don't be angry.

386
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,836
If you don't like my punishment,
talk to the school,

387
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,463
and not with me.

388
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,390
Do you want a colleague to be expelled?

389
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,726
That's not what I'm wondering. I'm wondering...

390
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,935
If not,

391
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,396
then don't cause trouble.

392
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,440
This is a trial period.

393
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,317
Don't distract others.

394
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,277
Have you thought that with this attitude

395
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,613
Are you distracting others from learning?

396
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,659
- But...
- If that's all, go ahead.

397
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,539
This is cowardice.

398
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,253
It is not fair to suggest,
That I want the expulsion of my colleague.

399
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,380
I just want to know,

400
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,883
Why she got the condition,
and I almost got fired.

401
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,803
I wanted to know what had changed.

402
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,777
I think we need to her
explain the punishment to Ms. Gi.

403
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,279
He is a freshman.
He doesn't need to know everything.

404
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,157
We have to stick to the school's guidelines.

405
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,163
No way.

406
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,374
- They were not friends.
- Really?

407
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,376
Scary.

408
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,620
There's been a lot going on lately.
Exercise is tiring, isn't it?

409
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,748
Sorry for the confusion.

410
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,416
It's my fault.

411
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,667
Needless to say.

412
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,503
I don't want to blame you.

413
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,757
As for the punishment against Ms. Gi.

414
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,759
The school made the best decision.

415
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,261
Her conduct was inappropriate,

416
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,306
However, the Training Corps was also at fault.

417
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,559
If the kids
would complain about the punishments,

418
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,144
The school would be in big trouble.

419
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,814
We had to consider these circumstances.

420
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:35,899
May you understand.

421
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:41,070
There is a risk,
That students will not accept Ms. Gi.

422
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,866
This is already up to Mrs. Gi.

423
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:48,411
Please remain impartial
and keep an eye on her.

424
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:11,226
UNPK, CRADLE OF WORLD TALENT

425
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:17,607
...seventy-two, seventy
three, seventy-four.

426
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,650
Orient.

427
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:23,988
Drop already.

428
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,284
You were lucky, you know?

429
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:33,248
Because of this camera
attention focused on Gi Hanna.

430
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:37,710
If not for that, we would have been done for.

431
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,713
From now on you are to behave.

432
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,927
Many colleagues have turned away from you,

433
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,263
But I have not abandoned you.

434
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,306
Because we are collegial.

435
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,018
Well, that's a shame.
We could have stopped being colleagues.

436
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,895
Do you know what I think?

437
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,899
We live together,
So we are together until the end.

438
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,403
Once a roommate, always a roommate.

439
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,489
Bumju! Seunghyun!

440
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,496
- What.
- You're terrible.

441
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,624
I understand.

442
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,085
Your poop is scarier.

443
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,504
How could you make her so quiet?

444
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,756
Mr. shitting his pants.

445
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,133
- Stop.
- Stop what?

446
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,426
- Come here.
- You come.

447
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,013
- I'll get down there right away.
- Come on, get down.

448
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,681
Come on!

449
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,866
Yoo Daeil is the best.

450
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,998
What's up with the first-timers?

451
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,210
Zero respect.

452
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,588
We have never been like that.

453
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,341
They need to be hammered with some respect.

454
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,385
I think it's a bad idea.
What if someone reports it?

455
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,221
In addition, one of the freshmen
is the son of an officer.

456
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,724
It is better not to mess with him.

457
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,727
INFORMATION

458
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,776
Listen up! After the cleanup, a collection in the hall.

459
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,570
- What?
- Not now.

460
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,864
We are to go to the hall after cleaning.

461
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,533
Now get on with the cleaning.

462
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:53,304
TO GI HANNA
COLLECTION OF STUDENTS IN THE HALL AT 21

463
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,691
You bream...

464
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,098
Well, no. After all, I didn't do anything.

465
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:41,269
Collective responsibility.
"There are a hundred of you, and it's like one."

466
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,312
Girls, quickly.

467
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,772
Movements.

468
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,215
TO GI HANNA
COLLECTION OF STUDENTS IN THE HALL AT 21

469
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,175
HALA

470
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,385
I vow to be honest

471
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,637
and an honorary student of UNPK,

472
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,432
Who will not succumb to injustice.

473
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,352
Honest and honorable?

474
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,980
Forbidden items, sloppy attire,

475
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,024
Loss of school property, bad behavior.

476
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,776
Is it honorable?

477
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,778
No, coach.

478
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,905
Louder, morons!

479
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,656
No, coach!

480
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:41,496
Who did not follow these simple rules,
Shirked by fatigue and forgetfulness,

481
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,748
let him stand up.

482
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,958
Get up, fast!

483
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,590
I lost my gloves while exercising.

484
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,260
I slept through the lecture.

485
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:00,973
I was late for the scheduled cleaning.

486
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,739
That much?

487
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,922
Why are there 11 girls?

488
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,141
Who is missing?

489
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,353
Answer! Who is missing?

490
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,189
It seems to me that Gi Hanna.

491
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,992
What are you doing here?

492
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,744
- I beg your pardon?
- Didn't you know about the collection?

493
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,997
I haven't heard anything about it.

494
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,712
I didn't see it.

495
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:16,674
The card was on the door.

496
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,885
And you haven't seen it?

497
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,680
I really didn't see it.

498
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,392
Was it recorded by someone off camera?

499
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,604
Let's see what happened.

500
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,733
Did you not record this time?

501
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,695
Do 30 laps of the hall.

502
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,197
Now.

503
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,948
That's right.

504
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,468
Hurry up!

505
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,026
Heads down.

506
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,362
Heads down!

507
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,243
Return to the site.

508
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,271
Hanna.

509
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:32,495
EMERGENCY

510
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,456
- Back inside!
- Back inside!

511
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,708
- Get inside quickly!
- Get back in!

512
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,814
She really might not have noticed.

513
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,625
I think he's going to pass out.

514
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:20,709
Leave.

515
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,837
It will be useful to her.

516
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,839
He must be taught a lesson.

517
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,468
God, a lesson learned?

518
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,137
What lesson?

519
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,186
- Are you really going?
- Yes.

520
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,522
Complaints have a mode.

521
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,607
You can't just walk into the dean's office like that.

522
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,609
File a complaint with the Corps of...

523
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,529
I can't. It's all about them.

524
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,782
I need to talk to the most important,
That is, the dean.

525
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,742
If you're not going, bitch.

526
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:02,460
KOREA NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

527
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,961
FEBRUARY

528
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,260
You wanted to talk.

529
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,596
I want to listen to what about.

530
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:18,350
Ms. Kim, do you know,
what happened last night?

531
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:25,983
In the morning we were informed,
That there had been a minor accident.

532
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,234
A minor accident?

533
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,321
The punished student was taken to the hospital.

534
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:34,200
- Is it supposed to be a minor accident?
- This is what happens during exercises.

535
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,535
This was no ordinary exercise.

536
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,163
What does it mean?

537
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,875
She was punished for the camera case.

538
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,627
Everyone knows about it.

539
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,920
Ms. Ko.

540
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,727
I, too, think she did the wrong thing.

541
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,855
But she has already suffered punishment for her actions.

542
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,108
She should not receive another punishment

543
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,528
Because of a personal grudge.

544
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,700
Bottom line.

545
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,577
I understand.

546
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:20,996
Is there anything else?

547
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,332
- You may have already...
- Yes.

548
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:28,170
Shouldn't recording with a camcorder
Shouldn't it result in expulsion?

549
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,465
When I was set up,
I was told I would be fired.

550
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,552
And she received a minor punishment.

551
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,136
It seems unfair to me.

552
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,097
But when I think about it now,

553
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:40,975
It's also not fair to her.

554
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,852
Recording in secret is bad,

555
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,855
But kicking and beating people is worse.

556
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,858
But none of these people face punishment.

557
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,527
She is probably angry about it.

558
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,154
Beating will not make us
better police officers.

559
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,908
It will simply lead to revolt.
I am sure about that.

560
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,290
- Is the Training Corps unfair?
- I think so.

561
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,042
Society even more so.

562
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,795
You will encounter more difficult

563
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,673
And even more unfair things.

564
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,802
Will you shout out your complaints
every time?

565
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,888
You are angry because a colleague has suffered,

566
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,348
But I saw,

567
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,934
how a criminal
Stabbed a colleague to death,

568
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,856
And the dog ripped her apart before my eyes.

569
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:32,026
Compared to such psychopaths

570
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,987
exercises,
Which you find so difficult...

571
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:38,532
Are just a game.

572
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,036
Patience is part of the exercise.

573
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,456
Your colleague will be treated well.

574
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,335
Please demonstrate your work
during the exercises.

575
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,295
- But...
- Please leave now.

576
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,825
How did it go?

577
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,539
I told you. It's like banging your head against a wall.

578
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,125
You will only hurt yourself.

579
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,294
Maybe I won't tear down the wall,

580
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,879
But I will leave some kind of trace.

581
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:35,881
If I don't change anything,

582
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,425
then at least they will know,
That something is not right.

583
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,639
If you really want to make a difference,

584
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,517
then talk to the guilty party. Don't avoid him.

585
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:50,396
If this person does not notice the problem,

586
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,605
then nothing will change.

587
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,032
Who went to see Ms. Dean?

588
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,829
Show up!

589
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,961
Me, the trainer.

590
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:37,735
Shithead one. Are you mocking me?

591
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,362
Rise.

592
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:47,911
No...

593
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,205
I don't mock.

594
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,709
- I'm afraid of the trainer.
- What did you say?

595
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,879
Answer!

596
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:59,339
I said that beating students is wrong.

597
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,803
We beat you because you can't get a grip!

598
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,849
You will always find a reason to punish us.

599
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,650
- What?
- We didn't come here to be punished.

600
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:23,447
Please stop the violence,
and we will respect you.

601
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,907
You little...

602
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,548
Enough is enough.

603
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:43,801
You two, stand on your heads.

604
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,762
Can't you hear?

605
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:53,602
No one will get up,
Until they carry out the order.

606
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,480
Understood?

607
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,669
I swear,

608
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,297
That I will be sincere and honorable

609
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,883

612
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,517
- I vow to be sincere....

00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,768
UNPK student,

614
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,353
Who will not succumb to injustice.

615
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,648
- I vow to be a sincere...
- Vow,

616
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,608
That I will be honest

617
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,692
and honorable

618
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:27,195

Who will not succumb to injustice.

619

I vow to be sincere and honorable

Who will not succumb to injustice.

622
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,330
I vow to be honest

623
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,165
and an honorary student of UNPK,

624
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,458
Who will not succumb to...

625
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,460
I vow to be sincere and honorable

626
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,128
UNPK student who will not succumb to the

627
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,504
injustice.

628
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,382
I vow to be honest

629
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,550
and an honorary student of UNPK,

630
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,843
Who will not succumb to...

631
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,178
Sit down

632
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,555
UNPK student who will not succumb to the

633
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,182
Who will not succumb to injustice.

634
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,809
I vow to be honest

635
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,894
and an honorary student of UNPK,

636
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,145
injustice.

637
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,063
Sit down!

638
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,274
Can't you hear?

639
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,318
You are to sit down!

640
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,070
Silence!

641
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,279
What?

642
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,991
I vow to be a sincere
and honorable student of UNPK,

643
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,244
Who will not succumb to injustice.

644
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,288
I vow to be honest

645
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,665
and an honorary student of UNPK,

646
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,208
injustice.

647
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,352
That is, they refuse to exercise for two days.

648
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,063
Yes.

649
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,150
The protest was signed by all first-year students.

650
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,110
PROTEST LETTER

651
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:51,613
They will not practice,
until their demands are met.

652
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,656
FEBRUARY 23, 2017

653
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,157
PR Department...

654
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,453
received a call from a journalist.

655
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,166
I don't know how they found out,
But they want to interview you.

656
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,047
What do we do?

657
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,967
Changing...

658
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,095
Cheongram program.

659
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,558
We must avoid...

660
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:23,603
this storm.

661
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,483
Now that we care about human rights,

662
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:32,487
I think UNPK also needs a change.

663
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,616
From now on we will avoid
training as in the army

664
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:42,789
And we will focus on creating an environment
Where students will develop their creativity

665
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,791
and practice professionalism.

666
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,295
UNPK WANTS TO TRAIN
CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS,

667
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,963
HUMAN OFFICERS

668
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:51,506
NOW THAT WE CARE ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS....

669
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,633
UNPK CHANGES RECRUITMENT SYSTEM

670
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,011
UNPK WANTS TO TRAIN
CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS

671
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,554
CREATIVE OFFICERS

672
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,264
UNPK ANNOUNCES REFORM

673
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,724

Salute the chairman of the council!

695
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,417
Hello!

To leg the gun.

702

To leg the gun.

703
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,022
To leg the gun.

704
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,277
All students in the Cheongram program,

00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,696
including Um Hyuk's first coach,

706
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,574

00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:47,205
and a whole hundred from the class of 47
was integrated into the student body.

709
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,501
Salute the chairman of the council!

710
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,919

Good morning.

717

Jang Juchan,
chairman of the UNPK student council.

718
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:20,864
When I see first-graders
At this time of year,

719
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,282
I look forward to seeing new colleagues,

720
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,619
Who share similar problems,
similar lives

721
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,121
and similar experiences.

722
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,253
Wi Seunghyun.

723
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,631
- Don't be intimidated.
- People will adapt.

724
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,424
It makes no difference where they live.

725
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,384
I'm dying.

726
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:42,969
Colleagues!

727
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,512
Get on with it!

728
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,555
Colleagues!

729
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,390
Get on with it!

730
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,767
Colleagues!

731
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,435

00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,480
Soon rounds at 10 pm.

733
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,649
Trashcan. Is he supposed to be standing here?

734
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,493
- Turn around.
- Now, excuse me.

735
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,039
I will have a pasta trauma.

736
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:14,668
You took too much at once.
You should not have overdone it.

737
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,295
Sorry.
I shouldn't tell you about the pasta.

739
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,311
You did it, didn't you?

740
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,941
Was it recorded by someone off camera?

741
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,943
Do 30 laps of the hall.

742
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,154
We didn't come here to be punished.

743
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,739
Please stop the violence.

744
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:45,782
You little...

745
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,579

749
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,842
I vow to be sincere and honorable

00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,260
UNPK student,

751
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,304
Who will not succumb to injustice.

752
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,722
I swear,

753
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,473
That I will be sincere and honorable

754
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,850
UNPK student,

755
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,435
who will not succumb

756
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,687
injustice.

757
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,981
I vow to be sincere and honorable

758
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,441
UNPK student who will not succumb to the

759
00:55:19,524 --> 00:55:20,775
injustice.

760
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,362
You are UNPK students.

761
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,407
We have high hopes for you,

762
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,326
That you will demonstrate.

763
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,660
First-timers,

764
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,954
welcome to UNPK.

765
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,922
You did a great job today.

766
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:25,423
And now the tradition is before us,

767
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,759
meaning you can ask questions.

768
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,095
If you have any,

769
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,557
A representative of the PR department and I
will be happy to answer you.

770
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,562
What are the requirements
for a student exchange program?

771
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,481
It depends on the program in any given year,

772
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:44,234
But I think you have to be
in the top ten.

773
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,694
Is there somewhere to go out by the school?

774
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,989
There are Internet cafes.

775
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,826
We also have billiard rooms and bowling alleys.

776
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,370
Apparently, it is not allowed
date other students.

777
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,164
If you want, give it a try.

00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,736
You are my first and only student.

781
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,363
I believe in you.

782
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,616
Hard work will pay off. You can do it.

783
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,827
Get there, and I put lunch every day.

784
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,246
I just happened to be asking for it.

785
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,623
Well...

786
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,959
Who knows? If we eat together...

787
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,718
Calm down.

788
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,554
I have to get there first.

789
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,350
I will say this with conviction.

790
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,436
- What.
- Never mind.

791
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,812
Any more questions?

792
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,482
You want to go drinking, don't you?

793
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,318
Lovely this head of local government, isn't he?

794
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,361
Apparently there is no girlfriend.

795
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,113
Maybe I'll pick him up.

796
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,909
Dear God, have you already fallen in love?

797
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:18,828
Wrap. The dude sure is successful.

798
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,164
Probably a mass of girls are attracted to him.

799
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,584
Could it be? I feel the will to fight within me.

800
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,212
God.

801
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,673
Cheers!

802
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,052
To the bottom!

803
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,596
- Drink.
- You have to drink at once.

804
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,288
But great.

805
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,208
I love chicken.

806
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,460
Keep.

807
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,380
What is it, already eaten?

808
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,180

809
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:20,265
Good.

810
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,892
- Listen.
- What.

811
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,143
I hope we will get along.

812
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,938
May you pass the exam,
And we will study together.

813
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,148
Learn...

814
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:54,942
