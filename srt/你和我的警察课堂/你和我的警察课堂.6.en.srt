1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:03,086
I will pour the gentlemen.

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,964
But give the formalities a rest.

3
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,675
Here, address me by name.

4
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:11,720
There is nothing worse
Than to suspect a good person.

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:17,225
But actions mean more than words.

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:20,270
Wooyong kept writing
regarding the Promotion Corps.

7
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,148
My phone broke down
and took it in for repair.

8
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,692
I picked up yesterday
and that's why I didn't notice.

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,986
If it behaves suspiciously,

10
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,988
it needs to be checked, although it is difficult.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,408
Okay, stop it already.

12
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,454
Enough!

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,251
Let's not complicate things, eh?

14
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,672
You know what happens,
When a UNPK student beats up people.

15
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,642
And when suspicions are confirmed,

16
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,062
one option remains.

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,021
I will carry it.

18
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,940
Penalty.

19
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,528
But you will do the same.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,127
POLICE ADEPTS

21
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,047
PART 6

22
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,972
Yes, I'm on my way.

23
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,350
Bright.

24
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,145
Eunkang!

25
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,482
- Have fun.
- For now.

26
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,493
I envy her. He invited her again.

27
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,956
So what? You talk,
as if no one invited you a second time.

28
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,049
Sorry.

29
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:16,261
Did you check the ratings?

30
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,638
- For goodness sake!
- Come on.

31
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,473
Talk. What did you get?

32
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,476
Why do you ask? This is my private matter.

33
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:24,936
I said.

34
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,230
But on my own, I didn't ask you.

35
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,066
Well. Then tell me one thing.

36
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,527
Do you have better grades than Eunkang?

37
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,112
Better or worse?

38
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,239
But you are stubborn. Similar, satisfied?

39
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,198
You say?

40
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,868
That is, the seventh group.

41
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,286
Seventh...

42
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,121
KO EUNKANG, WOO JUYOUNG

43
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,456
What do you know everyone's ratings?

44
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,710
Not all of them, just half of them.

45
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,297
You have to know yourself and the enemy,
To survive here.

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,799
Semi is there. I wonder what she got.

47
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,551
Semi!

48
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,525
- Do you like this picture?
- What?

49
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,028
Oh, you know...

50
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,365
This artist in his paintings
mixes fantasies with reality.

51
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,161
On this side of the door reality,
On the other, the ideal.

52
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,746
A fantasy world, so to speak.

53
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,169
The artist likes to paint forests
and ordinary things like trees or flowers.

54
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:33,963
Confused, huh?

55
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,009
He painted an abstraction to blur the line

56
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,803
Between the world and the ideal
And get a mood like from a dream.

57
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,603
They have great coffee.

58
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,855
I always drink coffee after contemplation.

59
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,524
What will you drink?

60
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,197
What is it? Why such a choice here?

61
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,407
Have you made up your mind?

62
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,369
Because you know...

63
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,204
I'll take an americano.

64
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,956
So you like espresso.

65
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,501
They make a great overflow, you should try it.

66
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,672
Do you prefer a more acidic coffee
with a mild flavor, or strong?

67
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,718
You know... Whatever will be.

68
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,887
- Why don't you try Geisha?
- Good.

69
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,932
One Geisha, please

70
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,434
and one Blue Mountain.

71
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,984
OFFICE OF THE HONORARY COMMITTEE

72
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,738
You will get a light punishment,
But a colleague will be expelled.

73
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:07,890
KOREA NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

74
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,324
- Thank you.
- Come back safely. I will call you.

75
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,408
Right.

76
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:06,032
SINABEURO
STEP BY STEP, BEFORE YOU KNOW IT

77
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,116
Didn't you eat?

78
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,493
What?

79
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,788
I ate. I've been to a burger joint,
Which they show on television.

80
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,582
I ate a burger with fries.
I devoured a ton of calories.

81
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,756
Then.

82
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,926
Why do you eat as if you are hungry?

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,595
I don't know? I think I'm hungry.

84
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,227
Say.

85
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,229
- Did you have a good time?
- Me?

86
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,026
I learned a lot.
We went to an art gallery.

87
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,029
It turned out that he knows a lot about art.

88
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,989
He talked about the paintings like some kind of curator.

89
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,701
A very intellectual rant.

90
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,914
- It sounds cool.
- Because it was cool.

91
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,837
But I don't understand something.

92
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,090
He has a good character and is nice to me.

93
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,426
I like him,

94
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,887
But I don't feel comfortable with him.

95
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,225
I don't know if it's because I like him.

96
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,021
Reportedly, how do you like someone,

97
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,191
then you get so stressed,
That you can't say anything.

98
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,360
All in all, I didn't have a chance to chat.

99
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,447
"Really?", "I understand.

100
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,574
I responded like a robot.

101
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,995
And to me it's always the mouth that pops out.

102
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,706
Well, that's right.
I'm not one of the silent ones.

103
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,208
But he asked about things I don't know about.

104
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,627
I didn't say much,
so as not to come off as ignorant.

105
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,590
Anyway, I'm not sure,

106
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,759
Whether I stressed because I like him,

107
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,804
Whether I feel uncomfortable around him.

108
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
Stupidity.

109
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,099
You don't know if it's good or bad for you?

110
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,519
It's confusing. That's why I ask.

111
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,480
Then find someone by whom you know.

112
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,690
When you like someone, you know.

113
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,530
Be with someone,
With whom you feel comfortable.

114
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,576
With whom you can just be yourself.

115
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,331
Whoever you are with,
you need to be part of that relationship.

116
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,294
- Did you cut yourself?
- It's nothing.

117
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,670
- Show.
- But it's nothing.

118
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,088
I still do that.

119
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,177
But you're an herb.

120
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,638
Wait.

121
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,759
Because your hair...

122
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,894
That's enough, thanks. Let's go now.

123
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,813
Wait.

124
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,774
It needs to be cleaned up.

125
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,901
Well, right, clean up.

126
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,444
I'd forgotten.

127
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,405
Oh no.

128
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,368
- I'll take it.
- Right.

129
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,708
- And you?
- Me?

130
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,043
If you have a problem, speak up. I will listen.

131
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,461
I don't.

132
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,674
Share the problem,
and you'll solve it halfway.

133
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,845
I don't think I'm
such a close friend.

134
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,513
- I understand.
- God.

135
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:04,228
If someone takes your friend
Hostage and threatens....

136
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,814
- Who?
- Here's what I'm wondering.

137
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,608
Okay. So what?

138
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,068
You can shoot the kidnapper,

139
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,946
But a friend will also suffer.

140
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,449
What would you do?

141
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,203
It's time for a sniper.

142
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,874
- What.
- Don't you know American TV series?

143
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,294
In such situations there is always a sniper,

144
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,004
Which lies somewhere on the building.

145
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,797
You have to give him a signal.

146
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,382
Then the sniper shoots.

147
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,593
Hostage rescued.

148
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,553
End game.

149
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,682
Thanks for the advice.

150
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,688
Why do you think,
That you only have two options?

151
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,066
More optimism.

152
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,902
There will always be a sniper,
Who will save you.

153
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,780
Evening.

154
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
Evening.

155
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,450
Have you had dinner yet?

156
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,118
- Yes.
- Did you eat together?

157
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,038
I ran into him on the way back.

158
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,374
He said he wouldn't eat anything,
But he let himself be convinced.

159
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,959
Good to see,
That you get along with your colleagues.

160
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,295
It is necessary to take care of colleagues.

161
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,464
In the end, they are the only ones left.

162
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,550
I would also love to eat with you guys. I'm betting.

163
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,552
Really? That's very nice.

164
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,848
Thank you.

165
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,645
Are you betting?

166
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,771
You are not a first-timer.

167
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:30,439
So Juchan...

168
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,483
But I want to be a first-timer.

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,963
STUDENT GOVERNMENT

170
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,302
What are you talking about?

171
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,973
I guess you don't believe the letter, huh?

172
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,266
You have to understand me.

173
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,643
You are said to have broken the rules.
I need to verify this.

174
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,188
Who reported?

175
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:15,609
Which turd said,
That I was downloading on the exam?

176
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,278
The denunciation was anonymous.

177
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,779
But I wouldn't say so anyway.

178
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,698
One thing is certain.

179
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,284
He is one of those
Who wrote at Professor Bang's.

180
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,746
Someone accurately described the course of the exam
and your behavior.

181
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,705

182
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,040
It's just as much a bunch of nonsense.

183
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,041
Listen.

184
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,503
Do you remember the first year?

185
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,214
There was a type that had good grades without learning.

186
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,634
There were rumors,
That his uncle is a professor here.

187
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,053
Someone tipped off that he knew the questions for the exam.

188
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,972
What was next?

189
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,099
They were not related.

190
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,687
Now it's the same. We have slander.

191
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,358
All probably because,
Because I wasn't good enough.

192
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:01,238
That is, you say you did not download.

193
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,740
Well, sure!

194
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,870
Bottom line. For now.

195
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,832
Wi Seunghyun, you bastard.

196
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,834
Want to have some fun?

197
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,006

200
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,394
Detective Kang Namgi, right?

201
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,981
God. It's been a kick of a year.

202
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,943
Fact.

203
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,945
What brings you here?

204
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,197
I'm going to the institute.

205
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,491
For training.

206
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,203
Mr. Constable, that is.

207
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,749
professor,
I heard that you came back here.

208
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,377
Yes, I went back to Korea
about five years ago,

209
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,422
But I have so many activities at school,
That I haven't had time to inform people.

210
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,676
- Where are you working now?
- In South Gangneung.

211
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,469
Gangneung?

213
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,559
Now excuse me.

00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,645
You wait, detective.

215
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,234
Are you perhaps familiar with

216
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,112
A student named Gi Hanna?

217
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,325
Gi Hanna?

218
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,703
I don't associate.

219
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,664
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

220
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,916
Then.

221
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,879
Detective.

222
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,259
I may be

223
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,762
a poor teacher,

224
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,389
But I will protect the students.

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,422
What questions do they ask during the interview?

229
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,051
Thank you for your interest in
our school.

230
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,720
There are no fixed questions at the interview,

231
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,514
however, lecturers
usually ask the reason for the application,

232
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,391
favorite books

233
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,144
And opinions on international issues.

234
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,021
Have you checked the number of souvenirs?

235
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,857
I'll get right on it.

236
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,373
Oh no.

237
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,375
Take a look.

238
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,505
UNPK STUDENT ATTACKED ME

239
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,882
Okay, stop it already.

00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,717
Enough!

241
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,519
Is that you two?

242
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,562
Answer!

243
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,106
- That's right!
- That's right.

244
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,195
Have you come here to beat people up?

245
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,697
No, the coach. It's an accident.

246
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,323
- An accident?
- That's right.

247
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,952
We accidentally got into a fight,
protecting an employee.

248
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,746
What do you mean by "protecting the employee"?

249
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,331
It's not in the video,

250
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,209
But earlier
threatened an employee there.

251
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,087
I tried to stop them,
they attacked me, and Yes...

252
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,715
And yet you beat up citizens.
Thugs of you?

253
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,009
Will you beat up anyone whose eyes look bad?

254
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,468
No, coach!

255
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,514
That's why it is said that cops beat people.

256
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,476
- Do you know?
- So were we supposed to get beaten up?

257
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,941
- What.
- We tried to avoid violence.

258
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,318
However, there is no help for some things.

259
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,988
No advice, right?

260
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,787
It's all my fault.
I will humbly accept the punishment.

261
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:19,872
Shut up!

262
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,500
Hyuk, let's call this employee
and let's ask him.

263
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,294
Let's find out what happened.

264
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,255
Right. Then one will think about punishment.

265
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,299
I'll call the billiard room.

266
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,777
I was at the cash register, accepting payments.

267
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,195
Suddenly they began to fight.

268
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,074
He started hitting everyone.

269
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,200
What are you talking about?

270
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,452
And he gave vent to his anger by beating others.

271
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,080
Why do you say that? After all, it's not true!

272
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,664
Then I ran away.

273
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,595
What about him?
Does he have some reason that he hates us?

274
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,680
I have no idea.

275
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,308
What an absurdity.

276
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,525
Sorry.

277
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,486
- That I got you into it.
- Don't be silly.

278
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,696
If I were you, I would do the same.

279
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,448
The turds would end up in the hospital

280
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,158
And it would have been even worse.

281
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,703
I think you're exaggerating a bit.

282
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,332
You deal weak blows.

283
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,500
What?

284
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,753
In middle school, I banged whoever I could.

285
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,464
The kids called me "Nuclear Fist."

286
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,258
When soloing with other classes,

287
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,176
I was the one sweeping them.

288
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,221
Come and see. I have a scar.

289
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,514
Good, show.

290
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,850
I have such a scar from that.

291
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,019
Guess what it was with the countryman,
Who got it for me. He got hit like this,

292
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,063
- That he spent two weeks healing.
- Two?

293
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,356
You probably scratched it.

294
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,400
Don't spar.

295
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,115
What now?

296
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,200
That's right.

297
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,202
Seunghyun.

298
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,538
Maybe we can ask Hyunseok to help.

299
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,749
- What?
- After all, he was there, too.

300
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,751
I don't know if he saw everything,

301
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,670
But he should take our side.

302
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,463
We can't.

303
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,591
Why not? Hide your pride.

304
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,551
We were to tell him in case of trouble.

305
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,136
We can't.

306
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,939
I didn't expect it.

307
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,609
So did he post the video?

308
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,527
It went from another account,

309
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,322
But it's the same video, so....

310
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,407
Did you know about it? Why didn't you say anything?

311
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,534
Because it is not the most important thing now.

312
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,290
This way we will not prove innocence.

313
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,544
For now, let's focus on,
getting this employee to tell the truth.

314
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,798
I don't think he wants to see us.

315
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,261
Who is lying?

316
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,347
Are you suspicious of your friends?

317
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,723
Don't.

318
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,478
Though they may have a wild side,
That we do not know.

319
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,522
Maybe the disorder
Explosive intermittent disorder or WSW syndrome....

320
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,775
Okay, shut up and don't talk nonsense.

321
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,652
Why do you always criticize me?

322
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,946
Probably this employee is lying.

323
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,989
They wouldn't beat people for no reason.

324
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,117
But why would he lie?

325
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,286
After all, they helped him.

326
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,289
- Maybe they are blackmailing him?
- Are they blackmailing him?

327
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,917
These thugs can blackmail him.

328
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,212
They probably feel bad for Seunghyun and Tak.

329
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,630
They had to do something.

330
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,715
Do they have cameras in the billiard room?

331
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,883
Let's check.

332
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,844
This is the first thing Sunyu checked.

333
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,013
They have been broken for a long time.

334
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,432
They didn't fix them. They were left as dummies.

335
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,600
Not good.

336
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,062
The punishment for assault is probably severe.

337
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,897
That's still nothing.

338
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,733
If the victims report it,
they may get charges.

339
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,527
Then they will throw them out.

340
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,031
Listen, why don't we talk
With this employee?

341
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,286
We shouldn't. They will think,
That we're trying to stonewall something.

342
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,872
In any case, don't say anything to anyone.

343
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,041
Apart from us, few students know about it.

344
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,669
- What about this post?
- I deleted it from my staff account.

345
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,629
But you never know.

346
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,257
Someone may have seen it before me.

347
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,685
There is a freshman, Wi Seunghyun.

348
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,478
Keep an eye on him.

349
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,398
Let us know if he does anything strange.

362
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,955
Can I take it and check it out?

363
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,956
Of course.

364
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,793
In the name of justice, I will help,

365
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,920
As much as I can.

366
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,631
We don't need anything else.

367
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,343
We came here when you called,

368
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,180
not because of compensation.

369
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,848
We only want one thing.

370
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,021
To kick them out of school.

371
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,858
- Do you want them thrown out?
- Yes.

372
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,153
Lord will think what will happen to this country,

373
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,697
If such kids become police officers.

374
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,535
They beat and blackmail innocent people!

375
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,537
Are they blackmailing?

376
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,832
I think they were afraid that we would go to the police.

377
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,209
They said they knew every police officer,

378
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,044
So we have nothing to report.

379
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,757
One of the perpetrators is the son of a police officer.

380
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,219
Did they say anything else?

381
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,431
- Something about your fathers?
- Yes!

382
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,642
I remembered something.

383
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,519
One asked if I knew his father.

384
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,062
"He's not going to let it go."

385
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,313
What doesn't?

386
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,442
- Yes. He's right.
- That's what he said.

387
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,903
It's called "corruption" or something like that.

388
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:10,699
You see, I for my parents
I am also important!

389
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,077
It's okay.

390
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,997
Bottom line.

391
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,875
The owner of the billiard hall said,

392
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,252
That there was also an employee.

393
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,380
How so?

394
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,424
Yoonki?

395
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,467
Hong Yoonki.

396
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,179
Do you have his bearings?

397
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,347
- And why.
- He is a witness.

398
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,891
He probably saw what happened.

399
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,227
Sure.

400
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,273
But I don't think it's happening.
He's not answering his phone.

401
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,985
We heard so from the owner.

402
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,821
But does his testimony
matter at all?

403
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,075
We have a victim here
and we're all witnesses, aren't we?

404
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,245
- God, it hurts even more.
- In fact.

405
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,164
Bottom line.

406
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,209
KOREA NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

407
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:06,755
DEAN UNPK, SUPERINTENDENT
KIM SUNYEONG

408
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,089
Yes, Mr. Kim?

409
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,968
A rag of time has passed. In fact, whole years.

410
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,137
What is the point?

411
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,568
We are barely done
With the issue of the Cheongram program.

412
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,362
And now this?

413
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:36,034
You are supposed to watch over the students.

414
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,994
Sorry.

415
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,380
What's next for these students?

416
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,800
They remain locked up
pending a disciplinary committee.

417
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,720
One of them is said to be Wi Giyong's son.

418
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,973
Yes, but he was not the one who committed the assault.

419
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,267
He was simply there.

420
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:05,105
I thought Mr. Wi
is a model first-year student.

421
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,856
We are trying to determine the course of events.

422
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,776
Both students involved
assure of their innocence.

423
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,781
Professor Cha,
please find out what happened.

424
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,824
That's right.

425
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:20,704
We may be dealing with
something more serious than expulsion.

426
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,622
At worst

427
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,833
There will be no recruitment next year.

428
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,630
I know this journalist,
I asked for a day's delay,

429
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,632
But will write about it tomorrow.

430
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:36,136
Find a solution,
Before the text comes out.

431
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,362
Eunkang, become my sniper.

432
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,241
I say I don't know.

433
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,826
Please. Just this one thing.

434
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,707
I really don't know.

435
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,209
How do I know where he is?
He walked away without saying a word.

436
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,295
Please at least give his address.

437
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,756
He certainly submitted a resume,
when he applied for the job.

438
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,341
There must be an address there.

439
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,134
I have already thrown them away.

440
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,804
I wouldn't say anyway.
That would violate his privacy.

441
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,560
Because my friend

442
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,064
She developed a crush on Yoonki.

443
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:38,031
Could you

444
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,911
allow you to meet him for the last time?

445
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,747
But what do you mean the last one?

446
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,083
Because my friend...

447
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,877
is very sick.

448
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,011
I do not know the exact address.

449
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,639
But he lives next to a curbside stop.

450
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,058
BILLARD CLUB

451
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,310
I haven't acted like this in a long time.

452
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,522
Hey, Juyoung.

453
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,650
Send me the address. We'll be there right away.

454
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,695
He's got a lead, let's go.

455
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,115
I can't go.
I have a meeting of the Promotion Corps.

456
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,199
First I've heard.

457
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,951
Because I forgot.

458
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,286
I can't miss, it's important.

459
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,206
That's three of us going.

460
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,624
Just be careful.

461
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,546
God's ways.

462
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,923
Big this neighborhood.

463
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:39,592
I don't know,
whether we will find it before sunset.

464
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,720
We have to be discreet.

465
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,806
When he finds out that we are looking for him,
he may not come home.

466
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,641
Where do we start?

467
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,729
I divided the area.

468
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,108
In this area we have 288 homes.

469
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,193
We will divide into four, because Ari is not there,

470
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,237
So that leaves 72 per person.

471
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,282
You and Eunkang will go here.

472
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,533
Daeil with me here.

473
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,243
- On the other side.
- Well, no.

474
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,370
Stupidity.

475
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,165
Who socked me with such amateurs?

476
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,919
Follow me.

477
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,305
Good morning ma'am.

478
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,395
The owners of the laundry are divorcees.

479
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,607
Only then did they hook up.

480
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:41,112
Except that the wife didn't bring the baby.

481
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,865
Aha.

482
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,661
The lady knows everything about the area.

483
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,413
Ma'am.

484
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,791
Do you know where he lives

485
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,084
Hong Yoonki?

486
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,837
Wait, where was that?

487
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,924
I have.

488
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:07,764
The hair salon lady is the worst.

489
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:11,392
She lived there for a whopping 30 years,
eventually sold the house,

490
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,522
And then they decided to renovate the area.

491
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,357
My God.

492
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,943
Wealth is not meant for her.

493
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,071
By the way...

494
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,576
Do you know where Hong Yoonki lives?

495
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,080
Where was it?

496
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,835
Hello?

497
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,713
Is anyone here?

498
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,844
Is anyone there?

499
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,431
Is anyone here?

500
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,517
The house seems to be empty.

501
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,480
Be ready.

502
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,733
As of now, we are on watch.

503
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,404
Eunkang, there at a 45-degree angle.

504
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,073
Bumju, you at 120 degrees.

505
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,910
Juyoung, hide there and watch,
whether Hong Yoonki is running away.

506
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,287
- And you?
- Me?

507
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,873
I will be the chief.

508
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,086
You are supposed to sit here like a shepherd.

509
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,380
Let's go.

510
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,008
Separate!

511
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,719
Wait here.

512
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,066
Maybe you had to go?

513
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,158
How did it go?

514
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,955
Was it a one-sided attack?

515
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,373
I was hoping not,

516
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,335
But I was disappointed.

517
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,212
Are you close with them?

518
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,009
You'd better watch out for your friends.
If you get involved,

519
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,302
you may be in trouble.

520
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,763
Don't.

521
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,349
If I get involved, I may regret it.

522
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,675
What are you doing here alone? Where are the others?

523
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,427
They all came out.

524
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,765
- Where is Seunghyun?
- He doesn't want to eat.

525
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,373
You like strawberries.

526
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,921
Why do they give only two? Not enough.

527
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,881
It is barely possible to taste.

528
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
What are you!

529
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,679
What do you do?

530
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,640
I left it for later.

531
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,350
You also sneak my food.

532
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,020
I wanted to eat later.

533
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,063
Then I will buy you.

534
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,942
- I'll probably bludgeon you.
- I'll redeem you.

535
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,487
Needless to say.

536
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,823
Eat. I don't like strawberries.

537
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,959
I had clean hands, eat.

538
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,909
But my body is messing me up.

539
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,968
SAMGEORI SHOP

540
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,308
Wait, already...

541
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,810
Coming.

542
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,354
I'm almost there. I can see.

543
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,689
Sold us out, huh?

544
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,109
No, really.

545
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,986
Then how did the guy know we were smoking?

546
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,324
Now they have stolen the pipes from us.

547
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,827
- Because of you.
- I didn't say anything, seriously.

548
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,620
He needs to be taught reason.

549
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,580
- Damn.
- Hold it.

550
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,167
What do you do?

551
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:34,549
Snotty snot.

552
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,092
Kids.

553
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:39,762
It is necessary to be nice to colleagues.

554
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,264
What is...

555
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,641
- Who are you?
- Don't look at me like that.

556
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,520
I say yes,
Because you are like my younger brothers.

557
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,771
You will regret it.

558
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,691
You don't know what the future will bring.

559
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,527
If you become an actor,

560
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,448
it's because of you that they may delete the series,
in which you will appear.

561
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,243
- Think of the future!
- God, what a sound!

562
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,290
Was I loud?

563
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,377
Kids, take it easy.

564
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,006
You have to control yourself,
To be successful someday, clearly?

565
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,507
I will go now.

566
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,969
Wait, kids.

567
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,513
I'm a cop.

568
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,057
I have buddies...

569
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,518
They are waiting for me.

570
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,896
He says he is a cop.

571
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,275
Cops shouldn't lie. Keep.

572
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,278
What is it?

573
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,487
- What do we do?
- Blast.

574
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,739
What now?

575
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,824
Well, no!

576
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:47,496
You guys are lucky, you know?

577
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,123
The cops arrived just in time.

578
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:50,791
Where did they come from?

579
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,543
Fear.

580
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,134
My gosh.

581
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,386
- Well done.
- Accurate.

582
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,388
Is that why you've been away for so long?

583
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,725
I couldn't let the bullies go.

584
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,186
I am a real police officer.

585
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,355
Case in point.

586
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,107
Young, are you okay?

587
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,567
Thank you.

588
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,694
Go to the doctor.

589
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,113
I don't have to. I have medication at home.

590
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,367
- Get up. We'll walk you home.
- Yes.

591
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,795
- Yoonki.
- What is it? I told you not to call.

592
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,965
- Well, you know...
- Hong Yoonki.

593
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,892
- We are UNPK students.
- Hail.

594
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,104
Stop him!

595
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,205
Eunkang!

596
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,499
- Eunkang!
- Step back!

597
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,888
Eunkang!

598
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,056
Where to?

599
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,335
Hail.

600
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,303
Wait... I don't want to catch you.

601
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,597
I have this...

602
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,558
From Seunghyun.

603
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,770
- For you.
- From whom?

604
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,648
From the more handsome one

605
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,733
With lighter skin.

606
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,164
I don't want to.

607
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,346
I said I don't want to catch you with my hands.

608
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,766
What else do you want?

609
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,476
Why did you come to me?

610
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,187
Why are you avoiding us?
As if you did something wrong.

611
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,815
And what do you want?

612
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,400
Tell the truth.

613
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,027
- Or they get them fired.
- So what?

614
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,738
What do you think will happen if I tell the truth?

615
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,367
You know what, I'm sick of everything too.

616
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,663
I am fed up with the constant intimidation and beatings.

617
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,167
I didn't ask them for help.

618
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,171
They made everything difficult for me!

619
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,718
Unlike you
we don't have parents to protect us.

620
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,927
We have nothing.

621
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,847
You can call us cowards.
We have no choice.

622
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,558
Give us a break.

623
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,985
Shall I tell you my life motto?

624
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,656
"Repay."

625
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,410
Whether for kindness or anger,

626
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,204
always repay others.

627
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,083
You can do that, too.

628
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,212
Repay Seunghyun for his kindness.

629
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,464
Play off these types.

630
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,216
We can help you.

631
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,305
You're funny.

632
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,142
It's easy for you to say that.

633
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,250
JUNGSIM GAZETTE

634
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,675
Yes?

635
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,928
The school wants to show me some footage.

636
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,806
I'll just check and be back.

637
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,890
Stay tuned.

638
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,726
KOREA NATIONAL POLICE UNIVERSITY

639
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:50,568
Many journalists
listen to only one version of the story.

640
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,112
But you are different, Mr. Kim.

641
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,364
The Lord is of the true ones.

642
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,449
The right to a replica is fundamental.

643
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,369
What evidence does the school have?

644
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,204
You are impatient.

645
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,623
Please have a cup of tea.
The evidence will be here soon.

646
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,876
By the way...

647
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,964
Where did you get the video?

648
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,591
From the informant.

649
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,384
Just who...

650
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,595
Do you want to know my source?

651
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,305
That's not what I meant.

652
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,516
At stake is the future of two young people.

653
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,062
We wonder,
why someone sent you the video,

654
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,940
Which was deliberately edited.

655
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,817
What do you think?

656
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,365
I also thought something was wrong,
That's why I was looking for a witness.

657
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,575
I understand.

658
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,201
Great.

659
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,623
Please enter.

660
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,592
This is the original video recorded by the victim.

661
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,594
It shows what was happening before the attack.

662
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,137
And also.

663
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,224
Yes, you are invited.

664
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,935
I invite you to go ahead.

665
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:16,070
Here is a real victim of the incident and a witness.

666
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,869
Leave. The boss will deduct from my paycheck.

667
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,331
Then call the police.

668
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,833
You know what awaits your brother, no?

669
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,511
One, two, three, four, five....

670
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:44,765
I will notify the editors and let you know.

671
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,018
Right. If you have any questions, please call.

672
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,938
The witness will be happy to help you.
Please call directly.

673
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:51,855
I understand.

674
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,065
Right.

675
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,442
- That's it.
- Sure.

676
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,489
By.

677
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,034
- I wish you good health.
- Reciprocally.

678
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,542
We appreciate your courage.

679
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:14,002
I should have told the truth right away.

680
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,214
- Excuse me.
- But where did you come from,

681
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,675
To film in that situation?

682
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,885
They often blackmailed me.

683
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,763
I collected evidence on them.

684
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,812
Well, yes, I...

685
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,774
We are going to eat something later.

686
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,776
- Is it?
- Yes.

687
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,403
Well, let's go then.

688
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,196
Are you joining us?

689
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,412
Right.

690
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,749
I forgot,
That I had to report something to the dean.

691
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,418
It slipped my mind.

692
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,920
- Go.
- Gathering.

693
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,213
Sure, go.

694
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:04,970
For now.

695
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,645
- How do you think it went well?
- I don't know.

696
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,317
Eunkang!

697
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,616
Thank you. Thanks to you, my punishment was revoked.

698
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:27,993
No, I'm the one who owes the apology.

699
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,788
You have been quite worried by me.

700
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,039
It was.

701
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,712
To wit.

702
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,091
What are you talking about?

703
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,762
We agreed that there is a shtick,
So behave normally.

704
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,847
Exactly. Shtam. We are among our own.

705
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,808
Right?

706
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,894
That's right, buddy.

707
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,860
Okay, enough of the tenderness.
I'm hungry, let's go.

708
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,405
Have you tried the cafeteria food?

709
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,825
They have great pork.

710
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,828
- Today it is not on the menu.
- Didn't you check?

711
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,084
They are able to make friends just like that.

712
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,963
It's good to be young.

713
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,341
STUDENT CENTER
AKADEMIK

714
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,223
Why did you change your mind so suddenly?

715
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,641
Yesterday you were stubborn.

716
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,269
I read the leaf.

717
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:26,361
Yoonki, you are not alone.
My friends will help you.

718
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,540
Yoonki.

719
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,834
They seem to want to help us.

720
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,382
YOU ARE NOT ALONE

721
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,304
If they bother you, call us.

722
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,097
Friendship.

723
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,558
Thanks.

724
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,729
But from now on I will no longer avoid them.

725
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,940
This made them inferior.

726
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,193
But it's nice to know that I have friends.

727
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,157
I'll be right back.

728
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,827
When do you have a free moment?

729
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,496
Hyunseok puts on dinner.

730
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,289
- Really?
- Yes.

731
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:20,874
But where?

732
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,460
- Grill.
- That restaurant.

733
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,504
- What kind of barbecue?
- For the barbecue I'm going.

734
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,797
Will there be beef jerky?

735
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,843
- What is it about?
- Are you...

736
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,971
do you know him?

737
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,414
Did you really have to do that?

738
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,707
I return the question.

739
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,167
Did you have to report it?

740
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,377
I did not report.

741
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,339
If not you,

742
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,633
then who?

743
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,676
I don't know.

744
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,803
But that's irrelevant.

745
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,556
You shouldn't do it at all.

746
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,894
I've also seen the elders pull off.

747
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,772
But I turned a blind eye,
So that they got good grades.

748
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,691
If we don't take care of ourselves....

749
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,026
It is because of this

750
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,194
the whole incident today.

751
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,447
Because you didn't admit it.

752
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,451
If you had admitted
And take responsibility for it,

753
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,619
would not have happened.

754
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:45,459
Take responsibility for your actions.

755
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,312
My gosh.

756
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,064
Give a coin.

757
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,024
I don't have coins, use yours.

758
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,734
What's up?

759
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,569
What's so surprising?

760
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,619
Are you hanging around because you got fired from school?

761
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,205
Haven't you heard?

762
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,040
They gave us peace of mind.

763
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,336
We have the original recording of the entire incident.

764
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,381
Do you want to know,
What will happen to you now?

765
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,884
We take it to the police.

766
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,969
There they will charge you with assaulting an employee,

767
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,472
Of blackmail, theft and...

768
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,684
Knitting, falsifying evidence
And spreading disinformation.

769
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,272
Better get ready.

770
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,482
Now you know.

771
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:51,942
Case in point.

772
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,073
Play around, because you're in for a long break.

773
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,453
Let's go. Good luck.
Stop causing trouble.

774
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,501
What are they talking about? The original recording?

775
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,629
- They bluff.
- What if they really have?

776
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,755
What do you think,

777
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,675
Hyunseok was able to give it to them?

778
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,135
Nonsense.

779
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,887
He was the one who wanted to throw them out.

780
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,889
Maybe he's making us look like a horse.

781
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,600
Wait.

782
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,234
Hi, can you talk?

783
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,072
Seunghyun came to the game room

784
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,700
And talked about some recording on a flash drive.

785
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,660
But I don't know what it was about.

786
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,078
Do you know anything perhaps?

787
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,080
What are you talking about?

788
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,582
Hyunseok.

789
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,918
You can't do that to us.

790
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,546
We will say that you gave the order.

791
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,173
Are you threatening me?

792
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:00,260
Who do you think you are?

793
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,304
Back off, punks.

794
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,264
Wait!

795
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,558
You think you're our boss,

796
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,643
Because we're listening to you, huh?

797
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,396
If they do something to us, you'll flop too!

798
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,064
Wait!

799
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:14,691
What did he say?

800
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,443
Wait a minute.

801
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,202
I left my phone...

802
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,253
Let's go.

803
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,756
Here we go.

804
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:53,897
Hyunseok, I need to check something.

805
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,649
We see ourselves in local government.

806
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,038
Will Wi Seunghyun...

807
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:13,541
- Did he say something?
- He didn't.

808
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,043
It's someone else.

809
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:21,591
Actually, we were the first to attack.

810
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,469
Relax. I just left this part out,
When you peel.

811
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,887
You are the victims.

812
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:28,640
Say the settlement threads,
If they don't kick them out.

813
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,059
And if they do something against...

814
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,311
Don't want to continue working for the school?

815
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,482
- Hyuk, listen...
- Boys,

816
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,528
Who uploaded the video online,
came begging for mercy.

817
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,157
It turned out that for three years

818
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,535
The Promotion Corps
purchased materials and souvenirs

819
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,830
From their print store and their online store.

820
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,332
They also have other schools.

821
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:57,669
Yes, but I discovered,
That we pay them more.

822
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,381
And they share the profits with you.

823
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,093
Well, yes... That's funding for corps outputs.

824
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,722
Anyway, there is not much of it.
I can give it all away.

825
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,266
I'll give it all back, all right?

826
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:17,063
Hyuk, you know,
how hard I work for the school.

827
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:18,940
You can't do that.

828
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,444
Hyuk.

829
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,365
This one time. Let go this one time.

830
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,450
Please.

831
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,369
Hyunseok.

832
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,372
You are behaving like people,
whom we are going to arrest.

833
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,124
People exercising power

834
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,585
for their own benefit
and destroying others.

835
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,297
Make an honorable decision yourself.

836
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,676
Nothing more as a colleague
I can't do for you.

837
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,971
We spent a lot of time together here.

838
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,274
What's up? What did you call us for?

839
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,945
Surprise! This is for you.

840
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,073
I will thank.

841
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:10,700
You have to eat to avoid bad luck.

842
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,035
- Eat.
- Thank you.

843
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,007
Congratulations.

844
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,509
You start from scratch.

845
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,304
What are you chauffeuring around so much by yourself? Give some.

846
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,723
Stop constantly interfering.

847
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,141
What are you always so mean?

848
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,353
We have for you
welcome party. Come along.

849
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:43,775
Quick!

850
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,443
Let's go.

851
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,409
Beautiful weather.

852
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,619
This is the kind of student life I have just dreamed of.

853
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,038
Eunkang, have you stopped meeting
with this guy?

854
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,623
You haven't talked about him in a long time.

855
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,917
- They parted ways.
- When?

856
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,797
Come on. We weren't even in a relationship.

857
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,467
There was no physical contact,
so it wasn't a relationship.

858
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:12,720
But congratulations on being single again!

859
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,682
What a girl.
She's happy to see someone left alone.

860
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,518
Ari.

861
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,437
What's up with the Promotion Corps?

862
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,481
Not very good. Everyone knows,
That one must not fully trust others,

863
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:25,608
But who would have thought that Hyunseok...?

864
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,736
Gone and playing guitar, no?

865
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,697
Running away won't fix anything.

866
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,991
Everyone knows about bribes from this company.

867
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,910
He won't even show up at rallies.

868
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,831
Apparently, that's not all.

869
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:48,256
He is said to have pulled off every exam.

870
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,259
By some miracle
no one had caught him before.

871
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:55,221
But this time he did.
Apparently someone snitched on him.

872
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,306
- What?
- Really?

873
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,058
- Who is that?
- This I do not know.

874
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,939
THURSDAY

875
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,274
CASE ANALYSIS

876
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:14,092
When did you break up with this artist?

877
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,093
What?

878
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,724
Well...

879
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:24,852
Eunkang.

880
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,605
We are not a good match. Sorry.

881
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,066
But I didn't get the trash.

882
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,195
I also thought that we didn't fit together.

883
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,034
The one and only time we were on a date alone.

884
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,953
There was nothing else.

885
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:45,498
I never wrote first.

886
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,045
You are explaining yourself as if it were a betrayal.

887
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,797
Why the excuses?

888
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,382
Come on...

889
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:58,428
I don't want any misunderstandings.

890
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,972
I don't want anyone to think that we were a couple.

891
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:02,682
Therefore.

892
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,267
Consensus.

893
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,023
When will you buy me dinner?

894
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,610
- Dinner?
- I saved your life.

895
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,280
- Because I was a great sniper.
- Great you say?

896
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,985
UNPK SHOOTING RANGE

897
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,046
First time with real cartridges.

898
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:20,927
Again.

899
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,680
This time for real.

900
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,534
Close the left eye.

901
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,123
With the right eye

902
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:53,501
set a goal in front of you.

903
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,223
Don't breathe.

904
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:12,353
What's going on? I really can't breathe.

905
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,772
