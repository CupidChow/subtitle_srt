1
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:05,254
Thank you.

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,147
You...

3
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:28,486
What are you doing here?
This place is not for everyone.

4
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,366
What? Does he study here?

5
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,284
No, easy.

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,538
If he is Minyong's friend, he must be...

7
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,334
Excuse me, are you my veteran?

8
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,048
Dope.

9
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,924
Wow, hello.

10
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,634
How have you been?

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,846
How funny we should meet here!

12
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,890
Small world...

13
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,516
Yeah, I was surprised too.

14
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,062
Did they get home okay that night?

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,146
Intact?

16
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,317
Thanks to you,
my sister and I arrived safely.

17
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,488
Wow, I can't thank you enough.

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,618
I knew it. He is still angry.

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,830
Was the problem solved?

20
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,459
We sent the bag back to him.
Did you hear about this?

21
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,294
- So what?
- What?

22
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:29,380
Did you think that sending her back
would make you feel better?

23
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,592
You don't understand, do you?

24
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,930
He didn't talk about the bag

25
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,226
because he wanted her back,
but so that she would apologize.

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,978
Apologies for playing with his heart.

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,023
What is it like? Playing with his heart?

28
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,651
My sister said she suffered from the breakup

29
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:53,363
with your friend,
although it was a quick thing.

30
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,240
She started dating after that.

31
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,242
I mean that she did not betray him.

32
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,035
We must make that clear...

33
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,831
What was that? How thick!

34
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,002
- Miss Ko Eunkang.
- Yes. Coming, ma'am.

35
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,672
Excuse me, can we talk later?

36
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,340
I have to go now. Bye.

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,800
Wait...

38
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:20,973
ROOKIE COPS: THE ROOKIES

39
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,431
ROOKIE COPS: THE ROOKIES

40
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,143
This is Ko Eunkang, her roommate.

41
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,313
Introduce yourselves.

42
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,734
After lunch,
let her know the dormitory rules.

43
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,360
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

44
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,324
KITCHEN

45
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,163
Hello.

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,708
I was so upset!

47
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,211
Then they told me
that a vacancy had arisen.

48
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,004
It was crazy.

49
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,798
I wish that
this had happened to me.

50
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,344
- It sounds so exciting!
- Not for me. I hate how nervous it is.

51
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,138
Did you come after they called yesterday?

52
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,307
Yes, I couldn't shut my eyes.

53
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,184
But I'm not even tired.

54
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,645
Now that I have arrived,
I feel that my place is here.

55
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:55,818
Great. Enjoy it while it lasts,
until you start to cry.

56
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,655
I hope this animation lasts.

57
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,197
Good luck.

58
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,453
- I'm done.
- Okay.

59
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,580
Right. See you later.

60
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,339
This is not how you socialize.

61
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,925
When in a group,
be kind and helpful.

62
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:19,926
She is not.

63
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,221
She is a spoiler.
She always ruins the mood.

64
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,555
Even before you arrived.

65
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,432
It can be occupied.

66
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,935
No, we all have the same schedule.

67
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,438
I want the training to end soon
to have new colleagues.

68
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,565
They're going to change roommates, right?

69
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,694
You never know. But there are only 12 girls.

70
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,821
She can be with you again.

71
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,573
No way! I'll make sure they switch.

72
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,788
My name is Bang Heesun.

73
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:53,001
I have a degree in psychology
and I teach Criminal Psychology.

74
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,421
As they are not yet officially students

75
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,673
and this is just a guideline,

76
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:03,303
I will tell you about the institution
and about what you will learn here.

77
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,849
She has charisma.

78
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,059
KNPU
INTRODUCTION

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,020
Does anyone know what this is?

80
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:18,026
- It is the emblem of our university.
- Great.

81
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,737
The bird on the hibiscus is a sea eagle.

82
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,531
What do you think it means?

83
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,827
The eagle symbolizes the police

84
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,079
and the hibiscus symbolizes the country and the people.

85
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,415
It is the image of the police protecting the people

86
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,584
and taking off with the hibiscus in its claws.

87
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,463
See how crazy she is for attention.

88
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,547
Hey.

89
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,980
Who is he?

90
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,570
THE TERROR TRAINER

91
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,531
For the next four years,
you will study

92
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:09,327
specialized theories
and how to put them into practice,

93
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,872
general studies, such as Humanities,
Sociology and Science,

94
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:16,334
and, in the second year,
will learn police science,

95
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:17,710
with subjects such as Law

96
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,754
and Public Administration, depending on your area.

97
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,634
You must learn
the current security policies

98
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,846
and, over time,
develop creative policies.

99
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,806
Right.

100
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,767
That's it for today.

101
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,395
In the next lesson, I will talk about

102
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,481
about the career after graduation.

103
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,192
If you have any doubts,
write it down and ask me next time.

104
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,819
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

105
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,654
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

106
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,701
Wow, that was very boring!

107
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,954
Class after lunch is terrible.

108
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,914
I'd rather go for a run.

109
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,961
What are you writing? What is it?
I want to see what it is.

110
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,088
- Everybody sit down!
- Eita.

111
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,690
Those who were dozing during class
can get up.

112
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,655
How dare they nap if their education
is being paid for by taxes?

113
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,992
They can't say they are KNPU students!

114
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,969
Obey, or it will be worse.

115
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,597
This is a warning.

116
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,307
Be honest.

117
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,367
You, why are you sitting down?

118
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,371
Me? I wasn't dozing.

119
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,165
I saw you dozing.

120
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,042
Who is she? I have never seen that face.

121
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,045
- She must have been reassigned.
- No.

122
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,797
I was sleepy because I didn't sleep much,

123
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,885
but I pinched my hand
not to nod off. Take a look.

124
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,181
Hey, do you think this is a joke?

125
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,850
It's not what I...

126
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,101
On your feet!

127
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,981
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- It's good to walk the line.

128
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:47,068
- I'll keep an eye on you.
- Yes, ma'am.

129
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,738
Those who stood up
will receive extra training.

130
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,698
Be in the lobby after class.

131
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,991
Yes, ma'am!

132
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:19,350
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB
ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS

133
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,436
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

134
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,026
I am sorry!

135
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,904
I am sorry!

136
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,656
- I'm not listening.
- I'm sorry!

137
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,866
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry!

138
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,492
I am sorry!

139
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,331
I am sorry!

140
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,967
People, on your feet.

141
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,771
- You.
- Freshman Ko Eunkang, sir.

142
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,316
Do you know why you are doing
this extra training?

143
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,277
Still not sure where you went wrong?

144
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,614
Actually, no, sir.

145
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,118
I was not dozing.

146
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,121
I can't say that I was
if it's not true.

147
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,751
So it was a misunderstanding
from your veteran?

148
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,210
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,381
I apologize
if I seemed rude in the afternoon.

150
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,842
But I don't think...

151
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,013
I did nothing to deserve
a beating with a baseball bat.

152
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,475
That's fine.

153
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,062
Let's just say it was a mistake by the veteran.

154
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,563
It will still remain here.

155
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,149
May I ask why?

156
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,902
I'll tell you in a minute. Pay attention.

157
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,197
First, his attitudes were confusing.

158
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,618
Second, you jokingly responded
to the first warning.

159
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,578
Third,

160
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,123
you have challenged a veteran.

161
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,417
- But...
- You can't disobey a veteran.

162
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,712
That is the rule here and that is the basis of the police.

163
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,092
- Is there a problem with that?
- But...

164
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,941
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

165
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,623
I can't even say it's unfair?

166
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,458
You'd better hold on.

167
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,794
Otherwise you will look bad to them.

168
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,171
They were tougher
because you fought back.

169
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,048
She is right. If you look, you find.

170
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,051
Don't look for confusion.
Just say, "Yes, sir,

171
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,804
"I'm sorry," "I'll get better."
That's all you have to say.

172
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,639
I am not from the Joseon era.

173
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,558
I can't keep quiet like this.

174
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,059
Are you going to hit it head on?

175
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,645
I have the right to say that something is wrong.

176
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,231
I don't understand, that's ...

177
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,302
STUDENT DORMITORY

178
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,102
Wow!

179
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,855
Hunger doesn't let me sleep.

180
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,900
I can't go to the cafeteria or outside.

181
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,611
As if that would make me patient.

182
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,742
I'd like a lámen.

183
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,912
I want jjajangmyeon.

184
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,330
I want a hamburger.

185
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,623
I want fried chicken.

186
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,042
Half spicy, half normal.

187
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,888
I know where they keep the lemen.

188
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,744
See that pantry?

189
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,042
DESPENSE

190
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,421
TASTY MILK

191
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,180
I went through the pantry in the afternoon

192
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,099
and I saw instant noodles.

193
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,852
I think it's for the cleaning crew.

194
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,770
So you want to steal them?

195
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,981
- We'd better not.
- We shouldn't.

196
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,482
Stealing is not right.

197
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,362
Unless we leave a note.

198
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,642
Come on. Quickly.

199
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,418
Next time.

200
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,879
- Next time.
- Yes.

201
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,589
Next time.

202
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:31,138
Scream for five seconds!

203
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,315
Morning call!

204
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,776
Total of 100. No injuries.

205
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,152
No absences.

206
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,405
Currently, there are 100 gifts.
No problem. Sir!

207
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,244
Recite oath of honor!

208
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,830
I will be an honest student

209
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,791
and honorable KNPU,

210
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,710
who will not give in to injustice.

211
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,880
All students at the university

212
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:10,594
need to practice kendo,
hapkido, taekwondo or judo.

213
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,763
Today they will take their first judo class.

214
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,807
I'll show you some practical moves

215
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,309
that can be useful in real life.

216
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,407
First, the shoulder throw,
the most basic blow.

217
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,450
SHOULDER THROW

218
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,415
First, hold your opponent by the collar.

219
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,960
Destabilize him and, at the same time...

220
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,762
You can sit down.

221
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,351
Judo is a sport that requires physical strength,
but it goes beyond that.

222
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,855
You can easily defeat
a bigger opponent than you.

223
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:16,035
When your opponent is as big as he is,
it will be difficult to get close.

224
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,953
In that case,

225
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,499
enter the opponent's space
and turn around slowly.

226
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,469
Right. Sometimes,
opponents are quite athletic.

227
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,179
In that case...

228
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,567
Bend over, kick your opponent's leg
and press him as hard as you can.

229
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,585
I took it easy on him.

230
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:52,965
Hey.

231
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,092
MEN'S CHANGING ROOM

232
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,643
You almost had me fooled.

233
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,729
Is lying fun?

234
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,898
Why did you tell such an obvious lie?

235
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,066
Lie?

236
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,483
I did not lie.

237
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,487
Wow, when I asked
if he was my senior,

238
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,698
you said yes yesterday in the hall.

239
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,283
I never said that.

240
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,827
You assumed this because you wanted to.

241
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,413
- Did I want to?
- Yes.

242
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,500
Excuse me, are you my veteran?

243
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,131
You didn't say you were my veteran,

244
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,677
but he didn't deny it either. That's a yes.

245
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,180
I was speechless with shock.

246
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,682
Are you speechless?

247
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,435
What a great excuse!

248
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:47,769
It should be in Mensa.

249
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,771
You lie, and lies have short legs.

250
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,106
Do you want to know?

251
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,567
If you are ashamed
of your own stupidity,

252
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,903
all right. I'm over it.

253
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,821
What?

254
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,407
Hey.

255
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,827
Wait, stop right there. Are you going to avoid me now?

256
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,664
Wow!

257
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,417
- Is he a hero?
- Yes.

258
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,088
"Stop, sir.
How can she be sincere under pressure?"

259
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,799
He was very nice.

260
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,469
Wow, he looks like a different person here.

261
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,972
Don't be fooled.
He is calculating and petty.

262
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,432
It's like

263
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,809
who asks for gifts back
after the breakup.

264
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,228
No! Really?

265
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,479
Yes.

266
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,690
But how do you know that? Do you know each other?

267
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,068
No, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.

268
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,571
I just want you to know
that he is not who you think he is.

269
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,034
I get it. I thought he was
the cutest here.

270
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,788
Come on, wasn't that other boy
wasn't he cute?

271
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,624
Kim Tak of the athletic grant.

272
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,086
He has such broad shoulders!
He looks very strong.

273
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,504
Not my type.

274
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,131
He looks kind of dumb.

275
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,595
And you?

276
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,682
I'm not interested.

277
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,518
We can't go out with students anyway.

278
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,943
It was all hypothetical.

279
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,112
She is so annoying.

280
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,863
What's that? Leave her alone.

281
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,782
At least she is sincere.

282
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,075
I don't care!

283
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,805
I heard you were an athlete.
Of what? Soccer? Judo? Wrestling?

284
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,931
Judo.

285
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,102
I also played sports
when I was little.

286
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,363
I wanted to be a speed skater
in elementary school.

287
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,158
Right.

288
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,077
From now on, you are team Yoo.

289
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,122
Yoo Team.

290
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,875
I will help you grow. Count on me.

291
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,301
But I am bigger than you.

292
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,144
The physical is not everything.

293
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:37,773
Brain. It needs to be smart.
My brain with yours...

294
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,776
physical.

295
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,694
We are going to be unbeatable.

296
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,821
Let's be friends.

297
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,913
Hey.

298
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,168
Better be careful.

299
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,965
Hey! What are you careful about?

300
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,258
- It burns!
- My bad!

301
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,137
It's burning!

302
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,430
Water!

303
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,849
Stop! It's cold!

304
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,728
It's cold!

305
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,981
Cold! It's very cold!

306
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,608
It's cold!

307
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,366
By the way, can't we hang out
with other students?

308
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,244
Yes, it seems to be a veiled rule.

309
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,664
I heard that the guild gives a warning
if you go out with a boy,

310
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,249
because it distracts from the studies.

311
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,668
How mean! They won't even let us date?

312
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,253
Actually, I think it's great.

313
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,005
What if the couple breaks up?
It will get very strange.

314
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,882
It is a small place. It can't.

315
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,345
Do you have a boyfriend here?

316
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,180
What? No.

317
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,685
- Yes, it does.
- No, not yet.

318
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,270
"Not yet?"

319
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,815
- Who is it?
- No.

320
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,401
Are you a veteran? What year? Come, tell me.

321
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,610
I don't date.

322
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:08,530
Yes, she does.

323
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,791
I'm coming. See you around.

324
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,460
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

325
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,480
I didn't tell him that I was accepted.

326
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:48,153
Where did she go? She didn't even take her jacket.

327
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,242
- Right. See you later.
- Bye-bye.

328
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,163
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

329
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,594
Is it from Eunkang?

330
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,686
Which one is mine?

331
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,148
Left, turn around.

332
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,777
Forward march!

333
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,781
Left,

334
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,616
left.

335
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,285
Left flank, march.

336
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,453
- One, two.
- One, two.

337
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,579
In formation!

338
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,331
Synchronize!

339
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,417
Left.

340
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,879
Half-turn, march.

341
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,589
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

342
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,883
Pay attention to the person next to you!

343
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,343
Change past, march.

344
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,678
- One, two.
- One, two.

345
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,429
Left.

346
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,516
Keep your distance!

347
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,352
Focus!

348
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,360
This shows that the criminal

349
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,657
continuously stabbed the victim
while chasing her.

350
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,742
By logic,

351
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,913
we assume it is a premeditated crime,
motivated by a grudge.

352
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:26,334
However, there is still one outstanding question.

353
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:30,255
The crime was committed
in a crowded subway station,

354
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,465
on a holiday afternoon.

355
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,427
How was the culprit so bold?

356
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,723
It was very good.
I increased the audience of the program.

357
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,019
Let's see how much we made.

358
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,855
Let's see

359
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,275
AUDIENCE, RESEARCH

360
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,405
DEPUTY SEO KICHUL

361
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,995
THE DEPUTY PROPOSES
A PROJECT TO ABOLISH THE KNPU

362
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,415
Have you seen the newspaper?

363
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,918
Of course. It is the eighth most
most talked about at the moment.

364
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,422
What a headache!

365
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,382
I took medicine on an empty stomach

366
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,301
and now I'm sick.

367
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,512
Why is he doing this?

368
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,598
What did we do against him?

369
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,391
There are many reasons.

370
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,393
He finds it absurd

371
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,563
that recent graduates with no experience
lead the police.

372
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,066
It is the same with the prosecutor's office.

373
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,234
These young promoters are children

374
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,778
and boss around their elders.

375
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,863
Let's be honest.

376
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,783
It's because police officers
don't get promotions, right?

377
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,082
That's fine.

378
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,918
I didn't graduate here,

379
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,629
But now I am part of KNPU.

380
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,757
What do you think, Professor Cha?

381
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,094
This subject comes up again and again.

382
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,514
But it seems more serious this time.

383
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,225
- They will even hold a hearing.
- So...

384
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,937
the university can actually
be closed this time.

385
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,438
Professor Cha.

386
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,274
Well, to be honest,

387
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,444
more than 40% of the policemen
have graduated from the KNPU.

388
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,988
Of course, the rest feel excluded.

389
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,074
This is the cause of internal conflicts.

390
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,034
What are you talking about?

391
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,412
It is not easy to become a policeman.

392
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,373
You need training
and pass the promotion test.

393
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,084
How can you trivialize

394
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,962
the efforts of your colleagues
being a KNPU alumni?

395
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,380
I am not trivializing.

396
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,676
- That's what it looks like from the outside...
- Let's stop.

397
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,386
They didn't come here to fight.

398
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,930
I called them to ask

399
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,307
more attention to the students,
because it seems serious.

400
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,352
Professor Cha
will take care of the freshmen this year.

401
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,689
And, Professor Bang, you will be a mentor.

402
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,400
You know what happens
if students cause trouble.

403
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,694
It will only help the opponent.

404
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,947
Form four rows!

405
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,157
- Home. One!
- Two!

406
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,658
- Three!
- Four! End of the order!

407
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,578
- In formation.
- In formation.

408
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:07,579
In formation!

409
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:08,997
Introduce yourself!

410
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,125
- Run.
- One.

411
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,792
Two.

412
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,462
Three.

413
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,171
Four.

414
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:19,841
One, two, three, four.

415
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:24,345
- You have disappointed me a lot.
- One, two, three, four.

416
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,389
- They are not improving at all.
- One, two.

417
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,558
Is this place a joke?

418
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,643
- Sorry, Sir!
- Pardon me, sir!

419
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,269
Standing.

420
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,149
On the ground.

421
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,235
Standing.

422
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,741
Do burpees
until your colleagues stop running.

423
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,743
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

424
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,371
- One.
- One.

425
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,041
- Two.
- Two.

426
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,668
- Three.
- Three.

427
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,880
- Four.
- Four.

428
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,508
- Five.
- Five.

429
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,135
- Six.
- Six.

430
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,391
- Eight.
- Eight.

431
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,520
- Nine.
- Nine.

432
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,646
- Dec.
- Dec.

433
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,858
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

434
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,277
- Twelve.
- Twelve.

435
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,740
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.

436
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,494
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen.

437
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,997
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

438
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,251
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.

439
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,504
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.

440
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,798
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

441
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:42,966
You there, stop.

442
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,133
- Nineteen.
- Nineteen.

443
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,385
Can't you hear me?

444
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,928
Twenty.

445
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,889
- Twenty-one.
- Is this yours?

446
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,140
Well...

447
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,517
- Twenty-two.
- Answer.

448
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,019
Yes, sir. Freshman Ko Eunkang.

449
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,855
You are out of training.

450
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,064
Yes...

451
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,234
- What?
- Wait in the room until further notice.

452
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,819
What?

453
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,160
That is...

454
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,499
Why did you film this hidden?

455
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,501
I didn't film it.

456
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,044
Will you continue to deny it?

457
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,090
I am your veteran
and I saw it when you fell off your jacket!

458
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,679
I also don't know
why it was in my jacket.

459
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,348
If you don't confess, as head coach,

460
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:36,269
I will ask the superiors
to consider canceling your enrollment

461
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,521
- for dishonoring the name of the KNPU.
- What?

462
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,565
Student Rules, Section 4/45.

463
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,984
"Maintain confidentiality
about the teaching and facilities.

464
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,985
Giving information

465
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:47,447
or possess and distribute
documents, photos or videos

466
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,198
damaging to another's dignity

467
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,618
can lead to loss of enrollment."

468
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,121
I didn't do that.
Please believe me.

469
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,332
A disciplinary committee will be created.

470
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,167
Save your saliva until then.

471
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,892
You will stay in the detention room
until further notice.

472
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,419
Hello.

473
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,089
Hi, Uncle. How are you feeling?

474
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,800
Right. I already told you

475
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,929
that Eunkang entered the university?

476
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,847
KNPU, you know?

477
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,017
Korean National Police Univ.

478
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,188
When she graduates,
she will leave there as a lieutenant.

479
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,358
A lieutenant is worth as much as
a police chief!

480
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,944
Well, not that much!

481
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,322
Why isn't he answering? Let's go!

482
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,074
Wow.

483
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,035
Hi, Uncle. It's me, Yangchul.

484
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,080
His nephew who lives in Seoul.

485
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:25,294
I feel so safe now
that I have a policewoman in the family!

486
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,298
By the way, if you need to go to the police station,
call me.

487
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,842
Don't be ashamed to ask.

488
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:33,302
And say hello to Auntie.

489
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,513
Okay, you don't have to come.

490
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,806
Bye.

491
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,686
Why did you say that?

492
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,896
What if he really calls?

493
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,482
I'm just trying to be nice.
Don't worry about it.

494
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,984
You know my uncle.

495
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:51,446
He has never visited Korea
since he moved abroad.

496
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,449
I didn't want to spend for the ticket.
Don't worry about it.

497
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,658
Uncle, it's gone.

498
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,994
Did you call your friend too?

499
00:33:58,619 --> 00:33:59,619
My friend?

500
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,664
Your friend from elementary school

501
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,417
who lives in Hannam
and always has foreign cars.

502
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,461
You are talking about Miran.

503
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,130
- I can't call her.
- Why not?

504
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,300
What is it?

505
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,512
What's so funny?

506
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,514
Her daughter was studying

507
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,600
- for the vestibular again.
- Yes.

508
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,810
- I heard that it was not accepted.
- Again?

509
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,646
Yes, and it seems that Miran has snapped
and is at her worst

510
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,109
because he spent a lot of money
on her daughter's education.

511
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,696
She said that children need
expensive teachers.

512
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,283
Our daughter had no private teacher,

513
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,868
but he managed to get a spot.

514
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,873
This proves that money is not everything.

515
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,919
Look at you, all excited.

516
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,796
Hold on.

517
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,089
Let me see.

518
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,217
Were you happy to hear
that Miran is suffering?

519
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,468
Did you stay?

520
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,303
I did not!

521
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,471
Stop it!

522
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,394
But why was it here?

523
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,440
Wow, I can't believe it!

524
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,876
Hey, did you hear?

525
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:33,005
Eunkang filmed us getting beaten up
during the extra training.

526
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,676
I think it's serious.
I heard that she would be expelled.

527
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,055
Is it from Eunkang?

528
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,810
Which one is mine?

529
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,356
Who cares?

530
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:55,653
Was it a spy camera?

531
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,699
It doesn't matter, it wasn't mine.

532
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,493
It wasn't mine, so it must be hers.

533
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,129
I loved that.

534
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,972
Salt invigorates
all my cells. Doesn't it?

535
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,266
This is why it is essential.

536
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,895
Even Napoleon ordered his subordinates to bring salt
to bring salt before battle.

537
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,356
Stop it and give me here.

538
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,025
Leave a little.

539
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,319
I bet you will eat it all.

540
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,454
Did you leave a note?

541
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,248
Of course.

542
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:37,296
DESPENSE

543
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,513
TASTY MILK

544
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:53,312
We borrow lmen.
We are like Jean Valjean,

545
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,314
the man who stole bread out of hunger.

546
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:58,859
We promise to pay
when the training is over.

547
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,321
Why wasn't the night watchman there?

548
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,949
I should be in a meeting.

549
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,701
At this hour?

550
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:09,495
It's an emergency.
It must be an emergency meeting.

551
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,875
Will Ko Eunkang be kicked out?

552
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,005
Of course. They will certainly punish her.

553
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,215
- But isn't it an exaggeration to expel her?
- It is.

554
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,302
You have no idea
what this means.

555
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,471
This is serious stuff.

556
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,059
If the video of our punishment
and the scolding spreads on the internet,

557
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,564
in the worst case scenario,
the dean can be fired.

558
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,774
I don't think she wanted that.

559
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,320
She wanted to screw the head coach.

560
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,531
But it is only a matter of time
before she is expelled.

561
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,242
She is in detention, watch out.

562
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,578
- We can't talk to her.
- Why not?

563
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,121
Did you nod off in orientation?

564
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:55,041
According to the rules,
we are not allowed to talk to students

565
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,959
who are being punished.

566
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,255
But did she really do that?

567
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,257
Of course he did!

568
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,217
They found the evidence on the spot.

569
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,928
Hey, that's enough.

570
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,056
- Stop eating.
- Leave some for me.

571
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,099
It is Ko Eunkang.

572
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,232
Eunkang?

573
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,612
How can she be hungry?

574
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,160
She is tough. Isn't she?

575
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,039
What did you eat?

576
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,874
I don't know. My stomach hurts.

577
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,377
- Again?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

578
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,337
- Hey.
- Ari.

579
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,963
Ari.

580
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,224
I'm sorry. I know you can't
talk to me right now,

581
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,851
- but I have a question.
- What is it?

582
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,647
I am looking for who made the video,
but no luck.

583
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,734
If I remember correctly,
I took off my jacket twice yesterday.

584
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,861
In martial arts and in the cafeteria.

585
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,779
So what?

586
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,824
And you took my jacket
when you left the cafeteria.

587
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,327
- You...
- Hey, are you suspecting me?

588
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,164
No, I just wanted to know
if you saw anyone take my jacket.

589
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,248
I don't know. I haven't seen it.

590
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,168
Try to remember.
It is very important to me.

591
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,336
I don't know.

592
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,297
You forgot your jacket,
and I gave it back. That's all.

593
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,490
DESPENSE

594
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,877
Does she deny it?

595
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,003
Yes, sir.

596
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,172
Did you see the security cameras?

597
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:08,674
The dormitory cameras have been removed

598
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,342
to apply waterproofing.

599
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,094
So he couldn't see the cameras.

600
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,971
- No, sir.
- And how are you sure

601
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,681
that it was Miss Ko Eunkang?

602
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,933
To begin with, the proof was with her.

603
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,437
The video was shot
after Ms. Ko entered the KNPU.

604
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,981
Nothing was filmed before that.

605
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,071
We can't cancel the registration
only with suspicion.

606
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,743
Just as you can't arrest someone
for having a gun in his jacket.

607
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,828
And you said she denied it.

608
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,789
But she has been misbehaving
during training.

609
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,919
This is a serious matter.
We have to be discreet.

610
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,339
Don't let it leak.

611
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,174
Have you talked to Professor Bang?

612
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,301
- Not yet.
- I'll do it.

613
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,596
We really need a disciplinary committee.

614
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,806
- Yes, sir.
- You may go.

615
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,240
It happened when the cameras
had been removed.

616
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,495
So one knows well
what happens here.

617
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:30,506
The Gangneung Poseo-dong case

618
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,385
involves a criminal who invaded
more than 40 empty apartments

619
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,220
inhabited by single women

620
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,889
to steal money,
valuables and lingerie.

621
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,308
The culprit was arrested.

622
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,645
A special
a special fluorescent material,

623
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,605
not visible to the naked eye,

624
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,524
where the criminal would have played

625
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,401
as he entered the house.

626
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,236
So, under UV light,

627
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,864
As you can see, it appears like this.

628
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,662
The material was created in the UK,
but is already produced in Korea.

629
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,039
It is easy to find online.

630
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,625
Next, the luminol.

631
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,461
It detects bloodstains.

632
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,131
Reacts to oxidizers or metals...

633
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,633
It was quite unsettling.

634
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,760
I wish I had classes like this every day.

635
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,931
I wish we had
special classes every day.

636
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,725
The class was interesting, wasn't it?

637
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,685
What? It was.

638
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,769
Shin Ari,

639
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,814
can I talk to you?

640
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:29,982
With me?

641
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,567
See you around.

642
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,157
What is it?

643
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,825
Do I say it or do you say it?

644
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,746
I saw you in the cafeteria that day.

645
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,247
Right. See you later.

646
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,582
Sorry.

647
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,636
Is it from Eunkang?

648
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,312
I don't know what you are talking about.
What did you see?

649
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,396
You get it.

650
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,483
If that's all it was, I'll go.

651
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,485
I gave you a chance.

652
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,821
A chance to be honest.
And you blew it.

653
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,586
Ari!

654
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,422
I'm happy for you.
Did he ask you out?

655
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,799
Let me go.

656
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,687
What about her?

657
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,731
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

658
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,857
- One.
- One.

659
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,317
- Two.
- Two.

660
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:56,902
- Three.
- Three.

661
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,529
- Four.
- Four.

662
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:05,035
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

663
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,550
One.

664
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:20,967
Two.

665
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,302
Three.

666
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,595
Four.

667
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,097
One.

668
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,807
Two.

669
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,182
Three.

670
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,434
Four.

671
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,727
One.

672
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,103
Two.

673
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,397
Three.

674
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:52,207
Cafeteria, gym, dining hall, restroom.

675
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,919
Dormitory, university courtyard.

676
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,300
It has to have been here.

677
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,054
Better ask Ari again.

678
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,185
Wow!

679
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,984
Did Wi Seunghyun say anything?

680
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,986
Wi Seunghyun? About what?

681
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,781
Well...

682
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,242
was me.

683
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,788
The Spy Camera.

684
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,498
I put it on your jacket.

685
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,291
- What?
- I'm sorry.

686
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,710
I didn't know it was a spy camera.

687
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,046
- I thought it fell off your jacket.
- Hey!

688
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,716
Why are you saying this now?
Because of you, I will...

689
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,011
I'm about to be kicked out.

690
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:50,015
But she is not mine either.
Believe me.

691
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,310
- Let's go.
- Where?

692
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,354
To the military corps room.

693
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,563
No.

694
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,942
Eunkang, I will help you
find the culprit.

695
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,527
Don't talk about me to them.

696
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,362
If we know who did it, it all ends.

697
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,364
- What?
- When it leaks,

698
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,200
I won't be able to study here.

699
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,577
Whatever. It's none of my business.

700
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,079
I need to clear my name.

701
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,419
Eunkang.

702
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,299
MILITARY BODY

703
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,804
But she is not mine either.
Believe me.

704
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,683
I am not a saint.
This is not the time to worry about others.

705
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:45,028
When this leaks out,
I won't be able to study here.

706
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,215
- How could you?
- What?

707
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,385
I understand that you don't like me,

708
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,597
but how could you do nothing
when a colleague was set up?

709
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,807
I can't lie just to clear your name.

710
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,559
You saw Ari putting on the camera.

711
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,978
No, I have no supervision.

712
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,355
- How could I have seen it?
- What?

713
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,107
So you lied to Ari?

714
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,234
I said she put something on her jacket,

715
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:25,819
not that it was a spy camera.

716
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,529
She should feel guilt.

717
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,533
Are you happy now? I'm coming, then.

718
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,617
It wasn't Ari's.

719
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,704
She was afraid of being accused.

720
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,247
She did not record the video.

721
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,208
In other words, someone else did it.

722
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:41,418
We need to find it.

723
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,338
- Are you going after this person?
- Of course I will.

724
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:47,007
It's not fair

725
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,718
Ari and I have to suffer
because of this person.

726
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,553
I can't let that happen.

727
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,765
Great attitude. Good luck.

728
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,475
Are you leaving like that?

729
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,644
Help me.

730
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,563
I can't do it alone.
I'm in detention.

731
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,732
I can't talk to the other students.

732
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:06,568
I have to find her
before they form the disciplinary committee.

733
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,404
Otherwise I will be expelled.

734
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,366
That is not his strong suit.

735
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,371
I'm sorry,
but you'll have to do this on your own.

736
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,456
I hate to get involved in other people's lives.

737
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,125
It's not true. You like it.

738
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,462
The girls see you as a hero,
and you helped my sister.

739
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:28,298
- I had no choice, but now...
- I am

740
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,050
an innocent citizen.

741
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:35,806
Will you stand by and watch
an innocent citizen suffer like this?

742
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,101
You shouldn't act like that.

743
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,938
If you want to be a policeman
you must protect innocent citizens.

744
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,649
Is there a better reason for you to help me?

745
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,404
DESPENSE

746
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,806
- Did you see you?
- You almost caught us.

747
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,979
- That's a lot.
- One each.

748
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,649
What if they notice?

749
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:30,235
Even if they notice,
they won't know it was us.

750
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,325
But there is no perfect crime.

751
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,505
Can I help you?

752
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,134
Right.

753
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,553
Wow, what a handsome boy!

754
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:01,725
It was you, wasn't it?
You're the ones who stole my lunch.

755
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:05,020
She was

756
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,856
Mrs. Sherlock!

757
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,693
THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST

758
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,158
One, two, three, four,

759
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,745
five, six...

760
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,580
Six...

761
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,334
Geez.

762
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,211
WE BORROWED SOME GINGERBREAD...

763
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:52,526
TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ARREST

764
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,160
She noticed that the
in the pantry was disappearing

765
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,538
and started to observe people.

766
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,842
The person

767
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,430
In a yellow shirt

768
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,309
Is that her?

769
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,734
A special
a special fluorescent material,

770
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,027
not visible to the naked eye.

771
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,490
She got the fluorescent material,
used with UV light,

772
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,450
and applied it to the packaging.

773
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:19,196
D-DAY

774
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,963
I got you, idiots.

775
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:43,220
We stole the lmen,
not knowing that we have fallen into the trap.

776
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:46,223
- Can I help you?
- E...

777
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,310
- she caught us in a jump.
- It was you, wasn't it?

778
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,020
That they stole my lmen.

779
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,106
Let's make a brief inspection.

780
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,734
Let me see your hands.

781
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,486
Good, I see.

782
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,489
My goodness!

783
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:04,991
You idiots.

784
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:09,120
They say that practice makes perfect.

785
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:13,458
I have been a cleaner at this university
for 30 years, okay?

786
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:17,629
I have been following the lessons
on criminal investigation for years.

787
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,007
Now, on your knees!

788
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,510
Come on, move it!

789
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,012
Hands up. Let's go.

790
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,181
- Hands...
- It must have hurt.

791
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,933
Take it easy.

792
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:36,773
Ari said she found the camera
in front of the cafeteria.

793
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,651
In other words, it was already in the jacket.

794
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,199
They may have planted it inside.

795
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,001
It wasn't that. Ari would have seen it.

796
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:00,338
We had a martial arts class in the morning.

797
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,673
It didn't go there.

798
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,592
We lock our jackets in the closets.

799
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,265
And I put it back on right after class.

800
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,475
No one would have put anything there.

801
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,688
- Maybe the jacket has been changed.
- What?

802
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:18,898
Maybe it wasn't someone who put it in,

803
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,483
But the jacket that was changed.

804
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,570
Changed? When...

805
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,157
It was all hypothetical.

806
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:29,284
She is so annoying.

807
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,586
It is. If it wasn't Ari's jacket...

808
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,672
Whose is it?

809
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,551
- What do I do now?
- Don't worry.

810
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,429
There were no cameras there.
No one will know it was you.

811
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,264
I might be in trouble.

812
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,685
Whatever, I don't know.

813
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,646
I did what you told me.
Even if they find out, I don't...

814
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,608
POLICE

815
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,863
Hey, who's there?

816
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,991
I think I got lost.
I'm looking for the dorm.

817
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,494
The dorm is that way.

818
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,829
Hurry up.

819
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,999
They're already making the call.
You can't stay here.

820
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,250
Yes, sir.

821
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:38,520
If Ari took the jacket
thinking it was hers,

822
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,772
was someone from the next closet.

823
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,191
I'm not interested.

824
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,735
We can't go out with students anyway.

825
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,532
The person who left his jacket
next to hers was

826
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,410
I'm done.

827
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,286
It can be occupied.

828
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,872
No, we all have the same schedule.

829
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,466
LANTERN

830
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,564
If the camera was filming...

831
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,816
- Excuse me, sir!
- Sorry, sir!

832
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,276
THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB

833
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,819
It must have a charger.

834
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,863
Where did she put it?

835
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,624
