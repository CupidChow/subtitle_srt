1
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,869
Once in a hundred years

2
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,664
we have finally
found such a flower.

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,782
Mr.Chairman, finally we did it.

4
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,326
Then let's move forward
-Hmm

5
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,246
Not stealing.

6
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,455
Hey!

7
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,343
Wait! I'm coming.

8
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,052
One minute!

9
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:20,890
Oh! Ho!

10
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,690
Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!
- Excuse me sir!

11
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,109
Could you tell us where
is the SaRang Church?

12
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,153
We are searching since a long time
- Where is SaRang Church?

13
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,487
There!

14
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,196
Oh! Okay!

15
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,489
-Oh! There!
-Yes.

16
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:37,866
Thank you! Thank you!

17
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,870
Stop! Listen! As you have helped
us, I would like to give you something.

18
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,539
I'm getting late! Please let me go! Sorry!

19
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,750
Why are you so slow?
-I'm not slow, he's really fast.

20
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,335
Why was he in such a hurry?

21
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,634
Open! Stop! Stop!

22
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,719
Please stop!

23
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,720
Stop!

24
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,180
Why is he always late?

25
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,347
It's his daily habit now.

26
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:03,975
I'm sorry

27
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,059
Sorry!

28
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,395
*insufficient fund*

29
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,440
*insufficient fund*
-There's no balance.

30
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,192
Don't touch it again and
again and move back.

31
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,943
- Can't you hear?
- Sorry.

32
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,446
Here...
-Oh god!

33
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,949
You do this every day. Go and sit.

34
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:22,952
Sorry...

35
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,288
I'll bash you, you stupid person.

36
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,707
You make all of us late every day!

37
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,126
What makes you late? Stupid.

38
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:30,960
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,340
Don't you show me
your stomach! Understood?

40
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,257
Close it!

41
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,259
Don't you have parents
to wake you up?

42
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,345
- Sorry, sorry!
- I saw everything!

43
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,639
Even your body hair!

44
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,724
Dirty person...

45
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,561
Why is my life like this?

46
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,983
There's a reason I need
to get on the bus at this time.

47
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,080
It's her.

48
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,629
The only wish I have.

49
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,727
Look at all these
shameless boys.

50
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,145
How they are staring at her.

51
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,731
None of you stare when I pass by.

52
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,152
She probably doesn't
know that I even exist.

53
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,324
Chang-soo is late again.

54
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,619
Bok-gil is cleaning
the same spot.

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,829
There he is.

56
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,999
Let's start our
morning meeting.

57
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,797
Yoon-mi, you're looking great.

58
00:04:59,424 --> 00:04:59,757
Really.

59
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,097
Fix your wig.

60
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,064
- Are you taking hair loss pills?
- Yes, sir.

61
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:20,945
Very good.

62
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,616
Your hair is a mess.

63
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,251
Clench your leg muscles.
- What?

64
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,210
Stand straight.

65
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,379
Ready?

66
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,091
Pay attention.

67
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,844
What are you?

68
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,303
Huh?

69
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,682
You're the face of our brand.

70
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,977
Looking at the condition of
you, would anyone buy our cars?

71
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,604
Look at your pants.

72
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,690
Is that your only pair?

73
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,400
At least iron it.

74
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,071
I ironed it,
but I ran here and because of that...

75
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,447
You ran?

76
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,324
You had to run fast.

77
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,660
You can't sell the cars nor come on time.

78
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,454
What should I do about you all?

79
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,914
All you do is sleep.

80
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,582
Why would you run?

81
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,253
Well, an old lady in the bus...
- Who old lady?

82
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,254
Kye Jun-il.

83
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,548
- Kye Jun-il!
- Yes?

84
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,220
You brought him, so teach him the basics!

85
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,683
Damn it...

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,108
Ms. Jo, is the report ready?

87
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,109
Here it is, sir.

88
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,986
You finished it already?

89
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,614
I like doing things right away.

90
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,327
Sir, I kept reminding you.

91
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,832
I need your receipts from
the 8th, 15th and 19th.

92
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,750
So please tell me by
when you will submit them.

93
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,545
Yes, I know. Thank you!

94
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,882
You can't use the company
card for personal matters, right?

95
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,136
The card's already maxed
out. I hope you know that.

96
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,434
You're too good at your
job. Continue doing it.

97
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,519
Just give me the receipts.

98
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,320
Did you talk to the
bus goddess today?

99
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,197
No.

100
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,744
Just man up and go after her!
Do I need to teach you this?

101
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,998
Remember one thing! Girls like brave men!

102
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,916
She'll reject me.

103
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,545
Then, she might stop
taking the same bus.

104
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,966
Seeing her every morning
is enough for me.

105
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:50,636
I didn't thought you
would give up so quick!

106
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,139
That's why you never had a girlfriend.

107
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,599
Kim tell me one thing.

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,934
What's love to you?

109
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,646
Wanting to see someone.

110
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:07,695
Love is challenge. Love is conquering.

111
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:15,661
Let me show you some moves
that I learned from YouTube.

112
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:27,924
Bok-gil?

113
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:32,970
Bok-gil...

114
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,682
You're looking amazing!
Let's go for a movie together.

115
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:47,276
Wow!

116
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,403
Amazing! Good!

117
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,659
Look how sexy he is!

118
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:59,956
His shoulders, his back
and his abs!

119
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,124
Hey! Enough!

120
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,294
He's so sexy. What a man.

121
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,506
I don't like men who seduce
girls with their bodies.

122
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,634
Why are talking all this?

123
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,678
Just look how much hard work he is doing.

124
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,223
Some people are only
beautiful on the outside.

125
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,307
Stop it!

126
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:20,893
Hey!

127
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,605
If you're going to spray me,
at least use perfume!

128
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,065
Why did you spray the room fresher.

129
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,069
You know I've fallen in
love with how many men.

130
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,613
Total..

131
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:34,740
Five!

132
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,826
Have you lost your mind?

133
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,371
I'm not even interested in all this.

134
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,708
Come here.

135
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,587
Are you going to stay single forever?

136
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,755
How many years has it been?

137
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,382
So what if I'm single?

138
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,385
Until when are you going
to lead a boring life?

139
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928
You've got it wrong.

140
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,556
Life is supposed to be interesting
and not boring by staying single.

141
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,099
No, you're wrong.

142
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,688
Your pessimism is bringing
me down, how can you be so negative.

143
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,276
Try out a cute laugh, like me.

144
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,957
Let me ask you something.

145
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,585
How does sitting down help sell cars?

146
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,087
How does cleaning
help sell cars?

147
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:30,671
Huh!

148
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:37,595
You think a customer will magically
show up and buy a car?

149
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,013
Hello!

150
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,352
It's the test driving villain.

151
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,062
Hello?

152
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:46,771
Today...

153
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,774
Who'll help me out?

154
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:51,567
This guy!

155
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,110
You!

156
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,112
- No, this guy!
- Huh?

157
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,407
Oh, you're the one!

158
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,494
Let's go.

159
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,496
I'll be right back.

160
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,413
Smile!

161
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,459
This leather smell!

162
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,588
We only use the best quality leather.

163
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,174
Look at the finishing
over here. This as well.

164
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,926
This is a nice leg space.

165
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:18,803
And...

166
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,355
Sir, if you'll look here...

167
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,442
- Sir.. Please come inside.
- New car smell!

168
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:33,984
Sir.

169
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:35,778
Please sit.

170
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,280
I need coffee!

171
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,033
Next week's meeting with Keumseong...

172
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,202
Don't talk about work.

173
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,913
Lunch time is sacred.

174
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,541
I'll take care of this further.

175
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:49,667
Whoa...

176
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,795
Hey, look! Look at him.

177
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,673
He's even handsome
from the back!

178
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,925
He must be a new employee!

179
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,052
Watch out how I'll seduce him.

180
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,470
Good luck.

181
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,514
Excuse me.

182
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,101
Excuse me!

183
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,186
We'd like to order...

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,648
What are you doing here?

185
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,402
Saw you after a long time.

186
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,238
Where were you so long?

187
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,782
Has it been 5 years?

188
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,492
Yes, probably.

189
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,289
I guess you work in this
building. Didn't see you before.

190
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,249
We'd like to order.

191
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,002
One hot americano,
extra shot?

192
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,462
Like always.

193
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,131
I quit coffee. One iced tea.

194
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,177
Eun-hee, what would you have?

195
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,472
Yes, I'd like...

196
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,978
A hot iced vanilla
caramel coffee with Choco chips.

197
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,899
- A vanilla latte?
- Yes, exactly.

198
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:55,399
Here.

199
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,778
We'll be meeting again?

200
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,448
Don't stop coming here
because of me.

201
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,993
If you mind your own business.

202
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,080
You haven't changed.

203
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,708
You look better in brighter colors.

204
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,628
And you still can't mind
your own business.

205
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,505
I'll make your orders.

206
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,136
I can't believe what did I just saw.

207
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,810
Listen, go to the department store
and buy another suit!

208
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,735
- Hello sir, welcome!
- Hello.

209
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,447
- Looking for something?
- I'm just browsing.

210
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,492
These are handmade suits,
so they're a bit pricey.

211
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,036
I'll show you something as per your budget.

212
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,579
Are you okay with that?

213
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,539
I see...

214
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,791
How much is this?

215
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,043
This one is a bit expensive.

216
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,378
3.5 million won.

217
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,629
3.5 million?

218
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,007
They're too expensive, right?

219
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,428
You should go next door.
They're having a sale.

220
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,894
She ignored me!

221
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,688
I should buy something from here!

222
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,274
This one looks nice!
How much is it?

223
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,485
4.5 million won.

224
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,946
This one's even better!
How much?

225
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,948
5.8 million.

226
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,740
What about this one?

227
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,159
6.2 million.

228
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,537
- This suit?
- Yes, this suit!

229
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,121
Wow!

230
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,497
Sir...

231
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,126
That's just the jacket price.

232
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,919
Add the pants, and...

233
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,217
Sorry.

234
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,557
Hey!

235
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,108
What did you just do.

236
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,987
This is the most expensive suit here.

237
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:08,449
It's your now.

238
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,251
Chang-soo.
Chang-soo.

239
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,964
Oh! You bought a new suit?

240
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,259
770,000 won...

241
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,637
That's pretty expensive.

242
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,474
Look carefully.

243
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,684
There's an extra zero! Add that as well.

244
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,228
What? What do you mean?

245
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,857
7.7 million? have
you lost your mind.

246
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,525
This must be a dream.

247
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,611
Where are the pants? Tell me?

248
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,030
You only bought the jacket?

249
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,574
Add the pants, and
it's over 15 million!

250
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,159
15...

251
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,120
But...

252
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,580
Wow.

253
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,833
It does look nice.

254
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,460
Let me try it on.

255
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,518
- What happened?
- You tore it!

256
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,521
It's not my fault.

257
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,691
I don't know how did that happen.

258
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,734
I'll keep it here.

259
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:26,568
Alright.

260
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,018
She fixed it!

261
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,519
Let me try it out.

262
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,439
Hey!

263
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,066
It's like your own brand!

264
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:34,887
Damn it...

265
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,019
Love you, love you, love you
My love!

266
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,228
How do I sing?

267
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,773
- You sing so well!
- Really?

268
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,859
I think I might pass!
- Yes

269
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,819
Don't you know what time it is?

270
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,530
We'll get kicked out
if the neighbors complain!

271
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,198
Hey!

272
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,410
The neighbors are out.
We have manners, you know.

273
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,245
She's so strict.

274
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,250
Soon, we'll all become rich.

275
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,713
Ah-young was approached
by huge company.

276
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,716
The president used to
be IU's manager.

277
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:16,011
Mom, he knows that
I'm the next superstar.

278
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,265
If he tries to scout you,
play hard to get.

279
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,101
All stars do so.

280
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:22,976
I know.

281
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:24,228
Listen.

282
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,524
Can't you praise your sister
for working hard?

283
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,693
I'm the one who worked late.

284
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,697
And how much you would
shop from my credit card?

285
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,284
I don't know when it will stop.

286
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,123
Hey, listen to me.

287
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,002
We should buy a car,
for Ah-young's sake.

288
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,967
How much will a nice one cost?

289
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,476
Camping?
Without any girls? No tension!

290
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,186
Life is amazing!

291
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,079
Oops, sorry.

292
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,666
I told you not to play soccer here.

293
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,258
My wife died and then..

294
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,223
- Very sad.
- She isn't dead.

295
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,017
I didn't mean that.

296
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:46,268
Dad

297
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,105
She went to Grandma's
because of what you did.

298
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,607
My mom is not dead.

299
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,276
She's dead in my heart!

300
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,195
Our love is dead...

301
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,031
Be brave.

302
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,202
If you apologize,
she would surely come back.

303
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,662
Fight happen between couples.

304
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,955
Do you think so..

305
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,000
Hey!

306
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,586
I shouldn't be
saying such things.

307
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,297
I...

308
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,259
I've had a crush on
someone for a year.

309
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,303
I see her every day.

310
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,183
But I don't know her name.
I've never spoken to her.

311
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,976
I'm not brave enough.

312
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,520
I need courage.

313
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,607
People need courage.

314
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,906
But I'm not courageous at all. I
don't know what am I going to do.

315
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,708
It's almost ready.

316
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,378
Hang in there.

317
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:08,267
Turn off the streetlamps
and use the smokescreen.

318
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,768
There should be no mistakes.

319
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,728
I need courage...

320
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,732
Oh, he's here.

321
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,819
-Hide.
-Quick, get the lights!

322
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,528
Hide!

323
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,548
I'm not a bad person.

324
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,466
Please help me.

325
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,261
- Come over here.
- You scared me!

326
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,267
Help me pick these up.

327
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,188
- Hold on.
- The perfume...

328
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:55,605
Go.

329
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,364
This belongs to you
maybe, you dropped this, too.

330
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,330
Great!

331
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,373
No wonder you were chosen.

332
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,169
What do you mean?

333
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,171
This is your chance to
change your life.

334
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,006
Don't miss it out.

335
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,899
No! No! No! I don't want this.

336
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,575
It was a dream.

337
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,786
What a relief.

338
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,875
I'm screwed! I'm late again.

339
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,133
It wasn't a dream?

340
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,054
I drank too much last night.

341
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,017
Is it a perfume? Yes, this looks like
a perfume.

342
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,219
What is this? Let's go!

343
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,623
What's going on?
Why are they following me?

344
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,834
Why are they acting this way?

345
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,301
What is this?

346
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,512
This is completely different.

347
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,104
Jung-hyuk?

348
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,942
Ladies and gentlemen,
new star Jung-hyuk!

349
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,198
You left me for the basket ball?

350
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,971
Oh, it's Yun Soo-il.

351
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,007
My love!

352
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,093
What are you doing! Hey! Leave me!

353
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,096
What's going on! Don't kiss me!
-Leave him!

354
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,847
Leave me! Leave me!

355
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,268
Leave me! What's going on! Stop kissing me.

356
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,271
Hey! Leave me!

357
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,369
Stop!

358
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:20,996
What's going on?

359
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,956
Hey! What's going on?

360
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:23,748
Leave me!

361
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,296
What are you doing? Leave me!

362
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,463
Leave me! Leave me!

363
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,632
What's wrong with you? Leave me!

364
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,842
Leave me!

365
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,897
What are your intentions?

366
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,024
Please leave me!

367
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,483
Please stop!

368
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,361
Please leave me!

369
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,614
What's happening to me?

370
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,216
56.. 57

371
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,844
58.. 59

372
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,262
60..

373
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,056
1.. 2

374
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,100
So you're finally here!

375
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,393
How much time..

376
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:29,814
Hey!

377
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:36,404
Sir, I'll go scold him.

378
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:40,950
What's happening to me?

379
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,122
Did you see a ghost?
What's with the face?

380
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,959
Do I seem off today?

381
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,378
You seem off every day.

382
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,338
Perfume...

383
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,423
Maybe it's the perfume.

384
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,009
- Perfume?
- I used perfume today.

385
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,427
How does it smell?

386
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,180
- I don't want to.
- Just smell it!

387
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,849
Damn it...

388
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,811
Move over.

389
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:09,604
All right.

390
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:18,363
What happened?

391
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,284
If you're late every single day like this..

392
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,914
- Give it a good whiff!
- Let me go!

393
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,916
- Smell it properly!
- No!

394
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,543
What are you doing?

395
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,552
It's not like that.

396
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,806
It's not what
you're thinking!

397
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,141
Oh...

398
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,476
You come here to work or..

399
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,145
I'll teach you right now.

400
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:51,521
Stop!

401
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,030
What's wrong with me?

402
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,286
What are you saying? On the bus?

403
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,455
Tell me, what happened next.

404
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,414
Be quiet!

405
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,753
I can't believe someone
made your heart pound!

406
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,213
So, who was he?

407
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,884
I don't know how to explain it...

408
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,678
Did your heart go pitter-patter?

409
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,722
Yes.

410
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,849
Maybe it's a panic disorder.

411
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,893
I should go to the hospital.

412
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,269
Look

413
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:36,191
As an expert, I'll diagnose you.

414
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:42,906
Your illness is L-O-V-E. Understood?

415
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,824
What is it?

416
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,743
Love!

417
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,412
Hey, no way!

418
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,041
Congrats, friend! You're in love.

419
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,503
It's nothing like that...

420
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,237
My love!

421
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,907
Let's test it out again.

422
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,035
Yes, Eun-hee?

423
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,914
I'll drop off my clothes
and be right there.

424
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:34,958
Okay.

425
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,417
Hmm

426
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:49,764
Excuse me...

427
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,309
You're back.

428
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,856
Are you here to buy pants this time?

429
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,830
Min-joo?

430
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,207
What the hell?

431
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,128
It was a misunderstanding!

432
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:23,339
Nothing happened between
me and Jun-seok!

433
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,300
I love only you!

434
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:26,676
Umm...

435
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,429
Excuse me.. Move aside.

436
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,727
I'll just...

437
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,404
Jung-hwan!

438
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,823
Love of ours.

439
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,285
Catch him!

440
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:53,995
Hey!

441
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,538
Stop!

442
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,584
Listen to us! Please stop!

443
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,419
Catch him!
- I'm telling you to stop!

444
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,840
My first love!

445
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,927
Stop! Don't go!

446
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,723
Stop! Stop!

447
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:30,531
There he is!

448
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,410
Where? Where?

449
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,537
Where is he?

450
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,264
What's going on!

451
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,521
What are you doing to me?

452
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:04,941
Huh?

453
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,819
Who are you?

454
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:09,487
Tell me!

455
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:15,034
Well, I'm a car salesman...

456
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,928
Wait, wait...

457
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,515
Please don't misunderstand.

458
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:39,892
What have I done?

459
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,770
I'm sorry...

460
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,157
What did I do?

461
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,703
Why did I do it?

462
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,250
Have I gone mad.

463
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,170
How can I do that?

464
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:11,841
Tell me!

465
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,636
What insane thing did you do?

466
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:19,557
Kiss?

467
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,478
Great job!

468
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,483
Tell me in detail? What
type of kiss was it?

469
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:29,734
So..

470
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:33,237
Did you kiss him?
Or did he kiss you?

471
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,450
I kissed him.

472
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,662
You kissed him? For real?

473
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,207
OMG!

474
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,145
No workplace romance!

475
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,939
No workplace romance!

476
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,857
No workplace romance!

477
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,863
No workplace romance!

478
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,491
He's back again?

479
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,868
Sir, believe me, I will
teach him a good lesson.

480
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,828
Wait a second.

481
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,538
I'll talk to him.

482
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:34,882
Sir...

483
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,386
Didn't you say we'd have
a company dinner this week?

484
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,887
Sure, let's have dinner.

485
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,849
I want to get drunk.

486
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,393
What do you want?

487
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,978
Yes!
- Alright.

488
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:48,729
Wow!

489
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,487
Thank you!

490
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,867
People love beef,

491
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,077
but I prefer chicken!

492
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,412
It's so juicy.

493
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,498
I'm happy that you're happy.

494
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,548
- You got some on your face.
- Love shot!

495
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,301
What's wrong with them?

496
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,930
- This place has 5 stars.
- Wow, that's impressive.

497
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,682
Let's sit here.

498
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,478
Our clothes will
stink of Chicken.

499
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,566
Chicken over here is given
5 star rating on Instagram.

500
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,902
You're addicted to Instagram.

501
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,821
I guess I'll order now.

502
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,871
Eun-hee...

503
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,333
- What?
- Bus, bus.

504
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,042
What?

505
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,045
- Kiss!
- Kiss?

506
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,966
The guy from the bus!
Where is he?

507
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:00,301
Show me!

508
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,054
Let's just go someplace else.

509
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,180
I know...

510
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,516
Sit back down. Where are you going?
- He will see me.

511
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,063
What's wrong?

512
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,191
It's the bus goddess!

513
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,318
The bus goddess?

514
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,696
- Who is it?
- Where is he?

515
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,574
Dude, she's so pretty.

516
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,785
Is it the guy in suit.

517
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,038
No, the one on the left.

518
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:29,830
It's the black dress girl.

519
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,082
black dress girl?

520
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,043
The naive-looking
guy with curly hair?

521
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,587
You have fallen in love with him?

522
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,841
I want to see him closely,
take me over there.

523
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,134
She's so hot!

524
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,720
Don't go, Eun-hee!

525
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,055
- Sit back down.
- Why?

526
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,140
-Sit down!
-Why

527
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,979
Your voice was so loud.
He must have seen me.

528
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,983
If I make a move, I'll be able
to seduce one of them.

529
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,150
Here, drink.

530
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,619
She's pretty, right?

531
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,998
She's waiting for me! Let me just go once.

532
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,541
Try to understand
- Let me go.

533
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,462
I hate one-sided love!

534
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,632
Where is she?

535
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,636
Go sit next to her.
You might get lucky.

536
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:28,973
Not now.

537
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,353
Keep acting like this,
and you'll never talk to her.

538
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:35,938
You idiot.

539
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:37,565
What?

540
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,943
We even kissed, you idiot.

541
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,657
What? You kissed?

542
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,951
Yes, we kissed!

543
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,121
Isn't he strange!

544
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,498
- You kissed?
- Yeah!

545
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:55,875
- Her?
- Yes!

546
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,462
Give us some details?

547
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:09,055
- Did your tongues kiss?
- Shut up!

548
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,306
Hey!

549
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:13,726
How can you do this in front of me?

550
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:17,146
Hey behave yourself.

551
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,024
It's not like that!

552
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,942
I'm so hurt!

553
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,780
What's wrong with you?

554
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,698
-Don't say things like that!
-Where are you going?

555
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,241
- Stop crying.
- Just don't.

556
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,242
I'm going home.

557
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,494
Hey...

558
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,454
I didn't want to come
in the first place.

559
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,248
- At least pay!
- She's leaving.

560
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,419
My shoe got dirty.

561
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,255
Watch out!

562
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:44,715
I'm sorry.

563
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,593
I'm not drunk.

564
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:52,098
I can walk properly, I don't need anyone.

565
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,356
I shouldn't have gone there.

566
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,070
I shouldn't have gone there.

567
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,413
Enough!

568
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,670
I'll get on the bus
and go home.

569
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,216
I'm so thirsty.

570
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,601
Will she like me
without the perfume?

571
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,199
Oh, it's you!

572
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,207
Why do we keep running into each other?

573
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,843
I'm sorry.

574
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:12,553
I'll leave.

575
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,057
Stop!

576
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,395
Do you want to sleep with me?

577
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,077
Huh?

578
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,250
That was my first kiss!

579
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,128
Oh, no...

580
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:01,268
Huh?

581
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:15,574
What have I done! I must be insane!

582
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,871
I'm really sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

583
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:21,789
Please believe me.

584
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,666
My phone, my wallet...

585
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,626
Please don't take me in a wrong way.

586
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,086
I didn't do on purpose.

587
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,089
I don't remember much,
but I'm telling you sorry.

588
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,427
What did I do?
- Oh god!

589
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:36,345
What happened?

590
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,805
Hey, wait...

591
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,734
We used protection

592
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,153
We didn't use protection

593
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:55,739
We used protection

594
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:57,992
We didn't use protection

595
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,829
We used protection

596
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,388
We didn't use it!
We didn't use it!

597
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,271
- Curly hair!
- Hold on!

598
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,408
Why did I do that?

599
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,046
Maybe I should get a taxi.

600
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,685
Ah-ra, what are you doing?

601
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,233
He isn't on that bus.

602
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,194
Alright

603
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,251
She's not here.

604
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,087
What a relief!

605
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,265
What should I do?

606
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,937
He's here only.

607
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,781
I'll be brave.

608
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,334
Hurry, hurry...

609
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,003
What should I do?

610
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,428
Excuse me!

611
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:38,986
Kim Chang-soo!

612
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,409
Park asked me to deliver him
his car keys during lunch.

613
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,328
If you do it. I'll buy you coffee.

614
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:49,705
Okay.

615
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:50,873
Thank you!

616
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:53,876
Jun-il...

617
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,798
My friend really needs your advice.

618
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,176
About what?

619
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:03,677
The perfume...

620
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:04,887
Actually..

621
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:10,642
He wants to get into a relationship
but on the grounds of a lie.

622
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,728
But

623
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,563
He's scared

624
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,692
If the other person finds
out then what would happen.

625
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,279
What should he do?

626
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,531
Will she forgive him?

627
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:29,077
Because their relationship
will be built on a lie.

628
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,914
Why did he lie?

629
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:38,003
Because the relationship
wouldn't start without a lie.

630
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,175
At least the love started.

631
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,473
But unless it was a crime, he can ask for
forgiveness. There's nothing wrong in it.

632
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:51,809
Right?

633
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,104
But it wasn't a simple lie.

634
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,818
Is the lie the only thing
that's worrying your friend?

635
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,489
He's not sure whether
she really likes him.

636
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,159
He's just a coward!

637
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,383
I couldn't sleep last night.

638
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,343
I'm exhausted.

639
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,554
Sleep is the best.

640
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,978
You're acting weird.

641
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,522
No, I'm not.

642
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,566
Not at all.

643
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,903
It's clear that you're hiding something
from me right now.

644
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:49,491
What?

645
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,995
- It's lunch time!
- You scared me...

646
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,872
It's already been 5 minutes.

647
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:02,212
Hey!

648
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:07,551
One of our new employees
workshop is going on here.

649
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,845
No, I know what you did last year.
- No problem.

650
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,930
There will be so many
handsome new faces!

651
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:15,225
- You're too much.
- I can't go by myself!

652
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,852
Horoscope?
Tarot?

653
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,899
- You want to get a tarot reading?
- No way.

654
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,735
It's all superstition.
It's nonsense.

655
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,737
I don't understand people
who believe that stuff.

656
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:35,913
I see it!

657
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,166
- He's mad.
- Hey!

658
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,501
You're calling the tarot
God a mad person?

659
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,551
He's good-looking.

660
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,053
He's about average.

661
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,889
He's good at looking average.

662
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,016
He's a bad boy!

663
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,228
A bad boy heart breaker!

664
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:01,480
He's nice.

665
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,776
- You don't believe me?
- Let's just go.

666
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,277
What do you want to know?

667
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,865
I'll tell you specifically what I'd like
to know. You will be able to tell me?

668
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:16,536
Put a percentage on how well
our relationship will go.

669
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,039
Both positive and
negative results.

670
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,334
The error range should be
less than 2 percent.

671
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:25,837
She's an accountant with a math degree.

672
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:27,005
Oh God!

673
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,050
Do you think love is a math equation?

674
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,845
The tarot gods warn...

675
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,765
He's hiding something.

676
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,935
I hide facts about
my family, too.

677
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:40,560
He's...

678
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:42,938
Not brave.

679
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:47,234
I'm not brave, either.

680
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,070
Maybe that's why I like him

681
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:50,821
He's...

682
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,826
Going to hurt you someday.

683
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,788
That will probably
depend on how I act.

684
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,042
I'll try to be brave.

685
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:04,668
Leave!

686
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,962
No tarot for you.
Just leave.

687
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,297
Don't you want your money?

688
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,634
You two will make a great couple.

689
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:18,181
He might be the man
of your destiny.

690
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:19,558
He said 'destiny'.

691
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,563
I've just realized that
you two are both crazy.

692
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,313
Why am I..

693
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,983
So much money for such small thing.

694
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,193
Destiny...

695
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:35,824
We've studied the people
on screen closely for months.

696
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:39,828
Only the perfume given to
Kim Chang-soo worked.

697
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,373
There were some side effects,
but they weren't severe.

698
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:58,930
Listen

699
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,977
Don't you think he's nice?

700
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,109
He's different from most guys.

701
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,655
Are you listening?

702
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:20,327
Hey, answer me!

703
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,670
She didn't call.

704
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,465
Of course she won't.

705
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:44,601
If you're free. Let's meet at Gwanggyo
Aqua Planet tomorrow at 7.

706
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:45,727
Wow...

707
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:46,978
Amazing!

708
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,298
This is too formal.

709
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,012
Hello, How are you?

710
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,574
- Hello, How are you?
- Hello.

711
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,246
- They're so pretty.
- You're right.

712
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,083
Do you like fishes?

713
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,586
I mean, fish?

714
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,423
Yes, I've always
wanted to come here.

715
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,176
There are so many.

716
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,389
They're so pretty!

717
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,121
Maybe we're...

718
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,833
Like stars in the night sky.

719
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:34,794
If we have met..

720
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,592
because of destiny...

721
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,094
What have you written down?

722
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:43,678
What?

723
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,766
It's okay, just show me.

724
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,729
I memorized it all,
but I got nervous.

725
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:57,359
'Maybe we're like
stars in the night sky.'

726
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,694
I like you.

727
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,200
My heart feels like
it's about to explode.

728
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:09,162
If I don't get you in
my life.. I would die.

729
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,834
These days, none proposes like this.

730
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,735
You make my mind go blank.

731
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:42,654
What?

732
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,034
I've never felt this way before.

733
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,096
Jo Ah-ra.

734
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,061
From now on, call me by my name.

735
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,732
Okay, I will.

736
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:31,494
Ah-ra... Wait..

737
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,332
This is my house.

738
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,125
Oh, I see.

739
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,462
- You should go.
- I will.

740
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,006
After you go inside.

741
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,565
Go!

742
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,717
Komul, can you hear
my heart pounding?

743
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,389
What'll I do?

744
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,811
I never thought this
would happen to me!

745
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,848
I've never seen this side of you.

746
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,570
I wasn't your first love.

747
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:13,698
That's why.

748
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:20,330
Shit!

749
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

750
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,644
Say hello.

751
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:44,771
Oh...

752
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,483
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

753
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,027
We were never properly introduced.

754
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:55,198
I'm Ah-ra's best friend,
Eun-hee.

755
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,199
Hi

756
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,202
I've heard a lot about you.

757
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,456
There's something strange...

758
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,168
Why are you staring?

759
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,421
I'm trying to find out
what you like about him.

760
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,090
His face..

761
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,509
Is he rich?

762
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:15,468
Excuse me.

763
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,847
I invited a friend. Is that okay?

764
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,641
- Male?
- Yes.

765
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,938
That was really smart of you.
That you thought of both of us.

766
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:27,939
What's he like?

767
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,234
He's nice.

768
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,570
He's funny and kind.

769
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,030
Is that all?

770
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,616
He's loyal and funny.

771
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:42,912
I'm only interested in his looks.
Other things doesn't matter.

772
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,875
He should be at least 180 cm.

773
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,461
A bit muscular, with
clean skin

774
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:52,297
and have a jawline that's it.

775
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,965
That would be enough.

776
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:56,259
And his voice
should be low.

777
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,595
Also, long hair.

778
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,764
I'm asking for too much right.

779
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,476
He should have medium
body hair. I'll manage.

780
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:09,022
His skin should be soft so that
when he touches me it should feel soft.

781
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,693
Does he meet all of my requirements?

782
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,905
I think he does.

783
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:20,575
Excuse me.

784
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,661
Where are you going?

785
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,416
- Is everything okay?
- I'm not sure.

786
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,006
I'll make him mine.

787
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,051
Let's see...

788
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,180
This should be fine.

789
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,018
Hello, Eun-hee.

790
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,228
My name is Kye Jun-il.

791
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:50,938
Thanks for coming here.

792
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:53,858
Hello?

793
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:55,985
What?

794
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:57,779
My dog is hungry?

795
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,823
I need to go feed the dog.

796
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:01,532
Let's go.

797
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,994
Eun-hee, you don't have a dog.

798
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:05,912
Sit down.

799
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,957
Where am I stuck..

800
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,835
I should had a dog
to get out of this situation.

801
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,089
Watch your mouth.

802
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,676
- You've seen his face.
- Shut up!

803
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,135
- Eun-hee...
- Huh?

804
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:25,515
- Am I hearing things?
- That was me, Eun-hee.

805
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,517
Yes?

806
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:30,853
- I'll...
- Yes?

807
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,397
- Become...
- Yes?

808
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,273
Your dog.

809
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,236
-You..
-What..

810
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:39,821
Sorry.

811
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,031
That was a monologue.

812
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,700
Mr. Kye Jun-il...

813
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,370
I think I'll just get
a proper dog.

814
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:50,581
Woof, woof!

815
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:51,916
Woof, woof!

816
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,878
Oh god! What is this?

817
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:00,091
If you drink that,
you have to raise me.

818
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:03,636
I'm really sorry.

819
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:04,804
I did it by mistake.

820
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,890
- Sorry
- Chang-soo...

821
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,809
Will you hand me
some napkins?

822
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,158
We escaped from the room!

823
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:27,827
Good job!

824
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:30,913
The next puzzle...

825
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,665
Is it over there?
- Must be there.

826
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,839
It's this customer's turn.

827
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,637
What are you doing?

828
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,055
Eun-hee!

829
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,058
Hey!

830
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:53,102
Stop it! Don't hit him!

831
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,733
- Leave us alone!
- Did you get hurt?

832
01:03:00,526 --> 01:03:03,446
- Just leave us alone!
- Come to your senses!

833
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:09,827
This is nice.

834
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,168
- It's so pretty.
- Really.

835
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:31,015
Honestly, I'm jealous of
my mom and my sister.

836
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,851
- You have a sister?
- Yes.

837
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,687
She's my younger sister,
and she's a little weird.

838
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:39,816
She performs crossover music
dressed in fusion hanbok.

839
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,234
She wants to become a singer.

840
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,610
Oh...

841
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:45,071
She enjoys doing all this.

842
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,741
I don't like her doing all this

843
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,660
but I don't know why she likes it.

844
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,829
It's a risky lifestyle.

845
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,416
- But...
- Yeah?

846
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,044
I've always been jealous of her.

847
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,966
I wished I could enjoy my life, like her.

848
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,511
What about now?

849
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,931
- Do you still wish it?
- No.

850
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,728
Ever since I met you, I
look forward to tomorrow.

851
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:19,856
Thanks, Chang-soo.

852
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:26,737
Let's go.

853
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:38,207
Ah-ra, will you sit down for a moment?

854
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:41,419
I'll be right back. Wait here.

855
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,046
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

856
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,318
Chang-soo, what's all this?

857
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,613
The pharmacy was about to close,
so I bought various things.

858
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:09,572
What?

859
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,657
Your foot's bleeding.

860
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,161
You're right.

861
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:22,835
Hold still.

862
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,046
I didn't notice.

863
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,633
I forget everything when I'm with you.

864
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,677
I'm glad I noticed before it got painful.

865
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,235
What is it? Is something wrong?

866
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,619
Thank you, Chang-soo.

867
01:05:58,371 --> 01:06:00,247
For appearing in front of me.

868
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,917
For being by my side.

869
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,426
Don't cry.

870
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,888
I like it best when you smile.

871
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:21,769
I want you to always be happy.

872
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:36,761
I didn't use it!

873
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,264
I didn't use the perfume then!

874
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,684
I haven't used it since the first day!

875
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:14,882
This car seems nice.

876
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,926
Oh, yes.

877
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:18,344
It's a nice car.

878
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,434
This model is...

879
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,727
What perfume do you use?

880
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:27,895
Excuse me?

881
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,689
It reminds me of my first love.

882
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:38,656
You think that kind of love is real?

883
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:43,577
Who are you?

884
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:45,830
I made that perfume.

885
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,263
Who was that?
How did he know?

886
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:04,765
He made the perfume?

887
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,232
Why aren't you surprised?

888
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:17,153
Is something wrong?

889
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,155
No, it's nothing.

890
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:26,579
Fancy restaurants aren't my thing.

891
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,917
Let's leave. Follow me.

892
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:38,090
I think it's done. Let's taste it?

893
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:40,509
Let's eat.

894
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,767
Dip it in sauce and then eat it.

895
01:09:58,652 --> 01:09:59,153
How is it?

896
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:04,950
It's good.

897
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:07,203
Are you acting for my sake?

898
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:08,829
No, it's really good.

899
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,999
I've never had this before.

900
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,334
- Really?
- Yeah!

901
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:18,255
- Can I use this sauce?
- Yes, you can.

902
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:27,431
It's so good!

903
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,058
- Is it tastier?
- Yes, it is.

904
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,852
So I didn't expect it to be so good.

905
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:35,522
Cheers!

906
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:48,285
So...

907
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,080
Do you want to go camping
on the weekend?

908
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:56,961
You said that you like camping.

909
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,922
I was thinking if we can do it together?

910
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,884
You want a special
birthday, huh?

911
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:05,636
How did you know?

912
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,472
Two days of camping?

913
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:11,600
Sure!

914
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:44,049
Wow!

915
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:44,883
Come!

916
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,468
Look at the weather!

917
01:11:58,897 --> 01:11:59,606
Say hi!

918
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:04,987
Hey!

919
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:12,786
Be careful.

920
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:15,748
Oh!

921
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,752
Chang-soo, did you
bring the sauce?

922
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:20,461
Yes.

923
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:21,337
I'll get it.

924
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,421
- Go get it!
- Yes, sir!

925
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:23,297
Salute!

926
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:24,590
Yeah!

927
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,800
He's like a professional.

928
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,513
- Isn't it hot?
- Not at all.

929
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:33,932
- Be careful.
- I'll be fine.

930
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,394
I'm hungry.

931
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:46,862
That was scary!

932
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:48,614
Are you alright?

933
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,541
- It's not hot at all.
- This is nice.

934
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,588
- Ah-ra.
- Yeah?

935
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:05,756
Want to go for a walk?

936
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:06,924
Sure.

937
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,472
- We're off.
- Take your time.

938
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:13,847
Huh!

939
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:14,973
Hmm.

940
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:21,688
Look at those two!

941
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,566
Oh my god!

942
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:26,235
Shameless.

943
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,863
They're going too far!

944
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:33,742
- You're right.
- They must be crazy.

945
01:13:34,368 --> 01:13:35,077
I'm jealous.

946
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,463
Wait, wait...

947
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:47,005
One minute.

948
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,469
Eun-hee, I want to say something.

949
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:55,139
Close your eyes.
- Hey

950
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:01,645
Will you be with me?

951
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,815
Be my girlfriend!

952
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,946
I thought we were already dating.

953
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:12,448
What?

954
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:13,574
You stupid.

955
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:17,661
Why did you touch me
if we weren't dating?

956
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:18,537
Stupid.

957
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,706
Why did you kiss me if we are not together?

958
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:23,292
- I won't leave you.
- Stop, Eun-hee!

959
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:24,334
Eun-hee!

960
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:30,716
- Follow me.
- Oh.. Where are you taking me?

961
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:33,594
All done.

962
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,847
- Does it look good?
- Yeah.

963
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:39,892
Thank you.

964
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,145
I've never received a
such birthday gift before.

965
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:48,609
Do you think destiny is real?

966
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:49,735
Huh?

967
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,987
How did we end up together?

968
01:14:53,071 --> 01:14:57,659
I never thought this would happen
when I saw you on the bus.

969
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:03,540
Ah-ra...

970
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:05,083
Hmm?

971
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:09,713
Hold on.

972
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,184
Why didn't you pick it?

973
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:26,230
It's not that important

974
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:28,106
I guess it was spam.

975
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,483
You're right.

976
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,402
I hate spam calls.

977
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,114
Ah-ra...

978
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:41,119
Did you get any strange calls recently?

979
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:44,414
Strange calls?
Like what?

980
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,417
Calls with no caller ID.

981
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,671
I don't answer calls from
numbers I don't recognize.

982
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:56,134
Do you answer them?
That's dangerous these days.

983
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:58,220
I know.

984
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,352
What's going on?

985
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,396
You're acting strange.

986
01:16:09,439 --> 01:16:13,360
I couldn't sleep recently at night.

987
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:17,656
Me, neither.

988
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:22,661
This is my first camping trip
and my first birthday gift.

989
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:24,955
Next time, we will come again.

990
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:28,458
Okay.

991
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:39,928
It's so pretty.

992
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:00,490
Did you tell her it's fake love?

993
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:04,578
Why are you doing this?

994
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,586
You think you're in love?

995
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,006
It's not love.

996
01:17:17,549 --> 01:17:19,551
It's just a fantasy that I created.

997
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:22,679
Listen carefully.

998
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:24,848
Get away from Ah-ra.

999
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:28,810
And tell her the truth.

1000
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,480
Then, stay away from her.

1001
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:35,692
Without the perfume...

1002
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:39,446
She wouldn't have been
interested in you.

1003
01:17:41,865 --> 01:17:42,991
What about our feelings?

1004
01:17:45,952 --> 01:17:47,496
We really love each other.

1005
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:55,962
Idiot.

1006
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:04,054
Why are there 3 accounts
ask him once.

1007
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,723
Why doesn't it add up to 15 million?

1008
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:08,892
Ms. Jo, where are the files.

1009
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,104
Yes, sir. Please check these.

1010
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,315
What could be the reason
for it not matching?

1011
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:18,068
What is this?

1012
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:23,031
Are they here?

1013
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:41,633
You...

1014
01:18:57,649 --> 01:18:58,150
Ah-ra.

1015
01:18:58,734 --> 01:18:59,276
Hello?

1016
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,405
Why didn't you call me back?

1017
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,367
Sorry, I was busy. I forgot.

1018
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:10,579
Are you off work?

1019
01:19:12,956 --> 01:19:13,582
Should I head over there?

1020
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,333
No, I'll go.

1021
01:19:16,793 --> 01:19:19,838
I liked the perfume that you have sent me.

1022
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:21,631
Perfume?

1023
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,593
What kind of perfume?

1024
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,512
It wasn't from you?

1025
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:32,476
It's late. Are you talking
to Kim Chang-soo?

1026
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:33,602
Ah-ra...

1027
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:36,897
Are you with someone?

1028
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:39,483
Sorry, I'll call you back.

1029
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,568
Ah-ra, don't hang up...

1030
01:19:41,902 --> 01:19:43,361
How do you know his name?

1031
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:45,822
No...

1032
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:49,409
You smell nice.

1033
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,077
Blue Irene?

1034
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:55,290
Luxury perfumes suit you.

1035
01:19:56,875 --> 01:19:58,001
That was from you?

1036
01:19:59,252 --> 01:20:00,545
What do you want?

1037
01:20:01,338 --> 01:20:02,380
It's a limited edition perfume.

1038
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,677
But this is one of a kind.

1039
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:12,307
Ah-ra...

1040
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,186
Do you really think you love him?

1041
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:18,188
What?

1042
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:26,446
Don't you think it's weird that
you suddenly fell for that stupid?

1043
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,700
How did you know?

1044
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:34,538
This perfume manipulates you.

1045
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,415
It makes you think
that you're in love.

1046
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,884
Lying, sabotaging,
obsessing...

1047
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,053
are one of your old habits.

1048
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,973
You really haven't changed at all.

1049
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:54,516
Perfume?

1050
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,102
You think all this happened because of that

1051
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,730
But I'm going to ignore your rubbish.

1052
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:04,609
You think I'm kidding?

1053
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,194
I'm not.

1054
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:10,532
Ask him about the perfume
yourself. You will come to know.

1055
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,744
I wonder what he'll say.

1056
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,417
That day you met,
on the bus...

1057
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:23,128
he was wearing this perfume.

1058
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,339
Why don't you understand.

1059
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,511
Why would you like someone like him?

1060
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:37,809
Don't touch me.

1061
01:21:44,065 --> 01:21:46,067
Call me if you want
to know the truth.

1062
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:57,996
Taxi.

1063
01:22:20,226 --> 01:22:23,229
Ah-ra, pick up. Please... Pick the call.

1064
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,704
Eun-hee, check
these files for me.

1065
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,081
- But I'm busy.
- No, you're not.

1066
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:49,816
Ah-ra...

1067
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:54,362
Sorry.

1068
01:23:55,905 --> 01:23:56,656
Do you want to eat something?

1069
01:23:58,283 --> 01:23:59,951
Everything is messed over here.

1070
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:03,163
If I knew you were coming,
I would have cleaned up.

1071
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,205
It's fine.

1072
01:24:06,332 --> 01:24:08,126
The chicken might be cold.

1073
01:24:08,501 --> 01:24:11,129
It's fine. It smells good.

1074
01:24:19,512 --> 01:24:19,846
Hmm?

1075
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:21,056
Hmm.

1076
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,239
Aren't you going to say something?

1077
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:39,908
Hmm?

1078
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:43,828
You kept calling and texting me so I
thought you wanted to say something.

1079
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,831
But now, you're not saying anything.

1080
01:24:53,296 --> 01:24:55,840
I'm here to listen to
what you have to say.

1081
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:08,728
Before I met you,
I never felt real joy or love.

1082
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,481
But I came to know
about it after meeting you.

1083
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:14,317
I only felt those emotions
after I met you.

1084
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:18,696
I felt alive for
the first time in my life.

1085
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:21,866
- Ah-ra...
- But listen..

1086
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,163
Someone told me that it's all fake.

1087
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,044
- It's not.
- Then what?

1088
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:39,467
Ah-ra, I love you.

1089
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,177
You know that.

1090
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,054
What about me?

1091
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:48,726
Can you be sure that I love you?

1092
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,272
Of course.

1093
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:57,735
Because the perfume
made me think I love you?

1094
01:26:09,622 --> 01:26:11,082
Ah-ra...

1095
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:16,379
Wow. Look!

1096
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,215
You really have it.

1097
01:26:25,305 --> 01:26:25,680
Ah-ra.

1098
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:27,849
I'll explain everything.

1099
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,645
All those emotions...

1100
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:36,482
All those moments...

1101
01:26:37,942 --> 01:26:39,777
They were all caused by the perfume?

1102
01:26:40,236 --> 01:26:42,197
I wanted to tell you, but...

1103
01:26:43,781 --> 01:26:45,200
I was scared of losing you.

1104
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:47,368
I was really scared.

1105
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:50,830
You were scared?

1106
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:53,625
That was your reason?

1107
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,088
What about my deep feelings for you?

1108
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:00,006
Ah-ra...

1109
01:27:03,092 --> 01:27:03,801
Let go of me.

1110
01:27:05,094 --> 01:27:09,265
If you don't, I might
refuse to see you again.

1111
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,022
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

1112
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:19,901
Stop the research.

1113
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:22,278
But sir...

1114
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:31,537
Dementia made her forget me,
my name and our memories together.

1115
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:37,377
I wanted her to see
the man she used to love.

1116
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:42,131
I wanted her to
relive her first love.

1117
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:49,639
But if this experiment
causes people pain...

1118
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,808
We should stop.

1119
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:56,062
Destroy everything
related to this experiment

1120
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,440
the perfume must not see the light of day.

1121
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:03,361
Yes, sir.

1122
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,208
I was too greedy.

1123
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:22,880
You were enough for me.

1124
01:28:25,049 --> 01:28:26,384
I love you.

1125
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:42,275
Ah-ra!

1126
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:44,819
Ah-ra!

1127
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:02,253
Please follow that car.

1128
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:39,475
What's all this?

1129
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:41,352
You're here.

1130
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:44,647
That was fast.

1131
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:46,649
You psycho.

1132
01:30:47,733 --> 01:30:49,193
Have you been stalking us?

1133
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,363
Stalking?
That's a bit harsh.

1134
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:59,662
Experiment subjects
need to be studied.

1135
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:01,289
What?

1136
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,755
Was the perfume
all an experiment?

1137
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,553
He's so slow.
Do you like him?

1138
01:31:15,761 --> 01:31:19,765
Why did you make
the two of us fall in love?

1139
01:31:19,932 --> 01:31:21,309
You don't fall in love.

1140
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,437
You're supposed to
see your first love in me.

1141
01:31:28,274 --> 01:31:29,525
The bus...

1142
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:33,613
The shopping mall...

1143
01:31:34,363 --> 01:31:36,991
It was my mistake.

1144
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:41,704
I thought that
I was your first love.

1145
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:47,710
But you never really
loved anyone.

1146
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:51,297
Then...

1147
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,009
Then why...

1148
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:57,803
You came to see him
as your first love but that was not true.

1149
01:31:59,847 --> 01:32:01,516
Why else would
you date him?

1150
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:08,606
You two were just
under my spell.

1151
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,234
Can't you understand this?

1152
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:12,944
It was all an illusion.

1153
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,071
An illusion made by me.

1154
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:16,614
An illusion.

1155
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:20,743
Wait...

1156
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,293
I became her first love?

1157
01:32:31,754 --> 01:32:33,297
She felt love for the first time.

1158
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,261
How could you conduct such an experiment?

1159
01:32:50,940 --> 01:32:52,316
You crazy person.

1160
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:09,083
I'll show you exactly what he did.

1161
01:33:19,135 --> 01:33:19,552
See?

1162
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:24,640
Do you like me now that I look like him?

1163
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:34,734
Do you get it now?

1164
01:33:36,819 --> 01:33:38,446
You don't love him.

1165
01:33:41,907 --> 01:33:44,452
This perfume made you
imprint on him.

1166
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:47,246
All this is because of this perfume.

1167
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:07,475
Here!

1168
01:34:09,852 --> 01:34:11,937
Still you didn't understand?

1169
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,610
Take this!

1170
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:24,367
Ah-ra...

1171
01:34:26,243 --> 01:34:27,161
Don't do it.

1172
01:34:28,537 --> 01:34:29,246
Don't..

1173
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:33,751
That's the last one.

1174
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:35,586
Give it to me, now!

1175
01:34:36,128 --> 01:34:37,254
Give it to me!

1176
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,341
Crazy person!

1177
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:44,929
Do you know how much money
and time I've put into this?

1178
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:00,861
Ah-ra...

1179
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:10,788
Ah-ra.

1180
01:35:18,629 --> 01:35:20,423
I know you won't believe anything I say.

1181
01:35:23,634 --> 01:35:26,929
But from the moment I
met you, up until now...

1182
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:33,144
My love, my actions.
They were all real. Believe me!

1183
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:40,401
Because of the perfume,
James looked like you.

1184
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,739
I couldn't believe it.

1185
01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:47,324
I didn't want to.

1186
01:35:50,828 --> 01:35:52,121
Real love?

1187
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:57,334
What about the love I felt for you?

1188
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:04,884
The fact it was all
fake, it was all a lie...

1189
01:36:07,678 --> 01:36:08,929
I hate you.

1190
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,346
I like you.

1191
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:53,557
My heart feels like
it's about to explode.

1192
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:57,144
From now on,
call me by my name.

1193
01:37:18,123 --> 01:37:20,376
No, I'm not like that!

1194
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,503
I'm different from others.

1195
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:26,298
Yeah, I know.

1196
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:31,303
Does it look okay?

1197
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:03,395
You're here!

1198
01:39:05,064 --> 01:39:06,023
Come here.

1199
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:07,942
Come here.

1200
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,862
Sit here. You will get a nice view.

1201
01:39:19,828 --> 01:39:22,247
- I wired you the money.
- What money?

1202
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:25,584
The money you lent us.

1203
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:35,511
Isn't she good?

1204
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:39,848
Good job, everyone!

1205
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:41,100
Let's go.

1206
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,894
- How was our show?
- You were the best.

1207
01:39:46,188 --> 01:39:48,816
My beautiful daughters...

1208
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:50,693
Should we go eat
something delicious?

1209
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:53,278
Are you buying?

1210
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:55,572
Let's go before she changes her mind!

1211
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:05,124
Have some coffee.

1212
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:06,917
Slowly.

1213
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:08,669
Enough.

1214
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:10,963
Look at this!
- Yes, look at this.

1215
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:18,804
Sis, hurry up!

1216
01:40:19,179 --> 01:40:19,805
Okay.

1217
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:26,520
Wow...

1218
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,607
I didn't think you'd
actually sign.

1219
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:33,277
Hey, I'm loyal!

1220
01:40:33,736 --> 01:40:35,279
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1221
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,825
- Yeah!
- Your car key, yeah!

1222
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:42,536
Make the exchange, yeah!

1223
01:40:43,078 --> 01:40:45,039
Let's go see your car, yeah!

1224
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:50,836
Chang-soo's so cool.

1225
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:53,380
How many cars
did you sell this month?

1226
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,633
Zero...

1227
01:40:56,967 --> 01:40:58,093
I should hit you.

1228
01:40:59,636 --> 01:41:01,555
You sold zero cars, too!

1229
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:26,455
Hello!

1230
01:41:28,373 --> 01:41:29,208
Cheers!

1231
01:42:15,003 --> 01:42:16,380
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning.

1232
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,173
Good morning.

1233
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:24,388
Wait, he changed completely
how did that happen?

1234
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:29,518
Ma'am, how have you been?

1235
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:36,567
Are you the guy I called a stupid?

1236
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:40,237
Oh, wow! You look good.

1237
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:04,219
I miss her even today.

1238
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:10,267
the way I saw her for the first time.

1239
01:43:12,936 --> 01:43:14,563
I wish to see her again.

1240
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:25,616
My first love.

1241
01:44:03,612 --> 01:44:05,656
- Hi.
- Hi.

1242
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:41,733
Jun-il, I'm late on my first day!

1243
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:44,236
I ran to the next bus stop!

1244
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:46,613
I'll be right there!

1245
01:44:47,072 --> 01:44:47,698
Please handle it.

1246
01:44:48,073 --> 01:44:48,573
Wait a minute..

1247
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,494
Oh, no!

1248
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:55,372
Why are my socks are wrong?

1249
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:56,623
Why does it happen with me?
