1
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,953
You hated how she only acted like
she cared for you and worried about you--

2
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,997
Chun-hui!

3
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,084
What are you doing right now?

4
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,504
I warned you not to cross the line.

5
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,025
You've gone mad, haven't you?

6
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,110
This is…

7
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,572
who you really are.

8
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,992
The real you who wanted to be a professor
without knowing your true worth.

9
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,829
You acted so high
with your high education,

10
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,705
but it turns out you're no different.

11
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,457
You messed with something

12
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,710
you should never have.

13
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,422
I won't let this slide.

14
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,259
I'm going to stomp you into the ground.

15
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,136
I'm going to kill you!

16
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,030
Hello?

17
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,949
This is Dong-seok's mom.

18
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,827
There's something I wanted to ask.

19
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,996
I won't take up too much of your time.

20
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,791
Okay, I'll see you there.

21
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,520
EPISODE 9
TOWARDS THE TOP 0.01%

22
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,119
-Thank you. Please come again.
-Thank you. Let's go.

23
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,462
SANGWE BIG MART

24
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,674
Eun-pyo, I shouldn't have
moved into this neighborhood.

25
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:41,346
She was such a happy kid back in Incheon.

26
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,642
How ashamed must she have been
about her mom to…

27
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,816
I'm utterly heartbroken.

28
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,657
I feel so upset when I think of
the pain she had to go through alone.

29
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,287
I really want to switch academies.

30
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,833
Why should we be the ones to leave?
It's their fault.

31
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:18,007
But we have no idea
what that woman is capable of.

32
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,637
Let's go.

33
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,098
Where?

34
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,059
First, we have to keep those
big mouths in check.

35
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,188
They're the worst kind of human beings
who torture others for fun.

36
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,564
Well…

37
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:38,027
I guess I'd say we're neutral.

38
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,070
I see.

39
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,155
Neutral?

40
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:45,660
It's not like we enjoy snooping
around in other people's business.

41
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,957
Then was it any of your business
when you tried to kick Eun-pyo out?

42
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,751
What's with the double standard?

43
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,925
To be honest, you're not in
any position to say things like that.

44
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,220
Su-in lied and that's a fact.

45
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,724
She was threatened!

46
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,017
Didn't you hear that part?

47
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,396
Why are you so angry?
We're not here to fight.

48
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,189
Yun-ju, that's enough.

49
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:19,527
All right, we understand.

50
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,031
But I want you to let your children know

51
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,700
that it's bad to spread ungrounded rumors.

52
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:29,203
Of course.
I let them know that all the time.

53
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,665
You do that all the time?

54
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,878
So what did Jae-bin say?

55
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,713
Well, Jae-bin…

56
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,132
What are you trying to get at?

57
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,218
Jae-bin usually knows everything
that goes on in the neighborhood,

58
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,887
big or small.

59
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,766
I was wondering if you talk about
a lot of things in front of him.

60
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,560
No, I don't.
I never said anything in front of him.

61
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,354
Oh, is that so?

62
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,857
Be careful.

63
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,569
It's uncanny how much kids
tend to take after their mothers.

64
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,155
Was that an insult or a compliment?

65
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,533
If you're trying to say something,
just say it outright!

66
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,702
Hey, come on. Let this one go.

67
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,746
She's twisting her words around.

68
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,956
I'll just be honest.

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,833
Ask anyone what they would do.

70
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,919
Would they believe Yu-bin,
the model student,

71
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,171
or Dong-seok, the goofball?

72
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,007
So what you're telling me is that

73
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,761
you want Dong-seok to go down
to a lower-tier class, right?

74
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,137
It's not a lower-tier class.

75
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,932
It's just a different class.
We're simply splitting them up.

76
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,352
So why does he have to
move classes when he's the victim?

77
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,271
I see.

78
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,360
You still don't believe Dong-seok's story.

79
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,696
-No, that's not what I'm saying--
-But Ma'am.

80
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,784
Are you aware that you've
consistently been overly strict and unfair

81
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,285
with Dong-seok?

82
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,706
That's because you're much more
educated than the other mothers

83
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,167
and you've also been
very understanding of us.

84
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,503
Well, that's right.

85
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,716
Humans do tend to share a bad habit
of taking kindness for weakness.

86
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,387
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

87
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,931
We're just trying to
reduce the students' stress levels

88
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,016
and figure out
an appropriate plan for them.

89
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,351
OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED

90
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,603
Please discard…

91
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,981
all of these.

92
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,650
After discriminating
against my boy like this,

93
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:26,154
it's not right for you to use his name
to promote your business.

94
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:31,033
I'm sure you're embarrassed enough
that a troublemaker like him

95
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,494
is one of your students.

96
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,248
No, wait, Ms. Lee.

97
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,168
What kind of nonsense is that?

98
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,260
Are you trying to close your business
in this neighborhood?

99
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,013
I'll never allow her to be
in the same class as the abuser.

100
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,348
I want him out of her sight,
do you understand?

101
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,976
Bye.

102
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,826
Did the director tell you about Yeong-bin?

103
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,245
Yes.

104
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,292
I let my guard down recently

105
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,711
and it seems like it affected my son.

106
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,755
I'm sorry.

107
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,925
But the reason I came to see you today

108
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:33,262
isn't because of Yeong-bin,
but because of my second child.

109
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:38,059
I heard your second was still
taking classes in your neighborhood.

110
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,355
I want to arrange
an individualized study program.

111
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,106
An individualized study program?

112
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,318
My second child was very upset

113
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,240
that she wasn't accepted to
the school for gifted students.

114
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,620
I'm sure you're aware

115
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,082
that individualized study programs
entail a lot of late nights

116
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,959
and there are a lot of study materials.

117
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,879
It's fine. We'll try our best.

118
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,016
-Thank you so much, sir.
-Bye.

119
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,643
-Bye.
-All right.

128
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,562
Plus four…

129
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,400
plus two…

130
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,778
plus two is…

131
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,157
So the answer is 44.

132
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,367
HOW MANY SMALL AND LARGE
RECTANGLES CAN YOU MAKE?

133
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,328
Mom, do we have
any more questions like this?

134
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,793
Eun-pyo.

135
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,254
What's all this?

136
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,173
I printed out some questions
from previous competitions,

137
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,925
as well as the schedule.

138
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,137
There's going to be a competition
at Sungmyung University

139
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,888
and then at the University of Education.

140
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,807
Let's enter the kids into both of them.

141
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,101
All of a sudden?

142
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,437
I've been thinking and realized that

143
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,107
people in this neighborhood
only believe the top student

144
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,943
and not the worst student.

145
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,446
You're right.

146
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,406
So to have them believe our story,

147
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,576
we just need to come in first place.

148
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,245
Eun-pyo.

149
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,583
You know as well as I do
that all other things aside,

150
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,169
studying was the easiest thing for me.

151
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,672
I'd be more than thankful but…

152
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,633
Just you wait.

153
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,595
I'll have all of them on their knees.

154
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,558
There wasn't anything unusual in
the blood samples or anything like that.

155
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,269
The cause of death
was multiple organ failure.

156
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,562
I see.

157
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,105
Yes.

158
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,318
Call the bereaved tomorrow

159
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,029
and let them know
the results of the autopsy.

160
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,241
Tell them the final verdict is
that it was a suicide.

161
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,367
Yes, sir.

162
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,745
Keep up the good work.

163
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,896
They're asking you to find
how many centimeters it is.

164
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,524
-Okay.
-The total perimeter is 96 centimeters.

165
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,818
It's past midnight.
Are you still studying?

166
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,112
We're not done yet. Get out.

167
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,407
Look, the length. The radius is four times

168
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,617
and the width is eight times the radius.

169
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,495
So the perimeter of the rectangle
is what you get

170
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,581
if you add the width and the length…

171
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,466
Do you have to
make him study past midnight?

172
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,468
He's only eight years old.

173
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,762
What if he gets burnt out?

174
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,515
I don't want to hear any of it.
This is all for his sake.

175
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,976
All of that work
might not even get you anywhere.

176
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,479
How long do you think
he'll hold up if you drag him like that?

177
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,529
People change so easily.

178
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,366
Just until recently, you told me
we shouldn't follow others blindly.

179
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,786
I bet you're the scariest one
in this neighborhood now.

180
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,460
Do you think I'm doing this
because I have nothing to do?

181
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,836
That's not what I meant.

182
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,087
Didn't I tell you

183
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,340
that I won't let anyone
pick on our son anymore?

184
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,383
Is that all you have to say

185
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,969
to someone who's doing
their best to put in some effort?

186
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,726
Also, leaving such
a smart kid like him alone

187
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,770
would be to neglect our duties as parents.

188
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,929
Mom's doing this…

189
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,015
because she loves you.

190
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,477
So hold on just a bit longer, son.

191
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,697
-Gosh, what should we do?
-I don't know. I'm so nervous.

192
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,784
We managed to implement a law preventing
pre-learning after a long struggle,

193
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:36,829
but it's of no use
in a neighborhood like this

194
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,373
because all the academies
are using education for gifted students

195
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,791
and competitions as an excuse

196
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,336
while trying to play it off
as part of their in-depth curriculum.

197
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,838
If you look right here…

198
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,052
Are you getting ready to move?

199
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,053
Yes.

200
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,305
They've already listed the house.

201
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,309
There's no one else to pack things,
so I should do something about it.

202
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,897
But with the housing prices
being so expensive

203
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,026
and because someone died here,

204
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,069
no one seems to be
interested in this house.

205
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,946
I see.

206
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,951
You're the wife of that director
who came to visit all the time, right?

207
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,495
Yes.

208
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,667
I heard my husband
had interviews with the deceased.

209
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,420
Did he come here often?

210
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,173
He used to.

211
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:33,969
Before she died, he used to come over
almost four times a week.

212
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,972
What did they usually talk about?

213
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,475
Gosh, I don't know.

214
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,228
They would go into the studio
and close the door.

215
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,025
Why?

216
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,028
Do you think they had an affair?

217
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,824
Goodness, I wouldn't worry
about anything like that.

218
00:17:56,533 --> 00:18:00,621
You have no idea how much
she was in love with her husband.

219
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,958
You could tell just by the way
she looked at him.

220
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,548
Maybe it's because they were both artists
and had something in common.

221
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,804
Sometimes they'd have wine
and raise their voices at each other.

222
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:23,352
Now that I think of it
when he came the day before she died…

223
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,937
Could you tell her
that Director Oh is here?

224
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,856
Ms. Seo is working on something
at the moment

225
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,691
and said she won't be seeing anyone.

226
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,152
But could you just
tell her that Director Oh is here?

227
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,904
I hear you,

228
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,741
but she's quite sensitive today
and won't be taking any visitors.

229
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,040
She turned him away
without even coming out to greet him.

230
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,876
She was never one to act like that.

231
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,711
Wait…

232
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,466
We have to stop
private education at its roots.

233
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,009
You're right.

234
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,886
-That's very important.
-That's right.

235
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,431
The law preventing pre-learning has been
lumped together rather haphazardly.

236
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,684
-Sometimes--
-Broccoli? Where are you going?

237
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,230
I'm sorry, I have something
I need to attend to.

238
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,274
-I'll be excusing myself.
-What? Right now?

239
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,401
Broccoli…

240
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,027
They lack impact!

241
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,364
They need to have
some sort of impact for me to cast them.

242
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,242
My goodness.

243
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,911
What about Song Hae-seon?

244
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,164
That works!

245
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,083
-Song Hae-seon works.
-I'm not joking around.

246
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,001
I'm not either.

247
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,587
-You heard what he said, right?
-Yes.

248
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,671
-That works?
-That works?

249
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,964
-Song Hae-seon.
-Yes, sir.

250
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,758
If you can really get
Song Hae-seon for me,

251
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,677
then I'll edit it however you want.

252
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:41,638
Come to the office tomorrow, okay?

253
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,556
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,391
Wait.

255
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,435
Hello, Yeong-mi.

256
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,563
Geon-u, will you be late today?

257
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,356
I'm here with Mr. Park.

258
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,444
He wanted to discuss
how much he enjoyed the book.

259
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,530
He's saying we can start casting
after the final edit.

260
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,157
Gosh, really?

261
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,453
See? I told you this one
would have a great response.

262
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,248
I think I might be here for a while
so don't wait for me.

263
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,543
All right. Good luck with the meeting.

264
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,139
SECRET GARDEN

265
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,844
28TH KOREAN MATHEMATICS COMPETITION

266
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,848
Please complete your answer sheets
ten minutes before the testing time is up.

267
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:33,518
Even if you haven't solved everything,
start completing the answer sheets.

268
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,230
And note that your answers
may be logged incorrectly if you color…

269
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,733
Why are you guys copying me
and taking the test?

270
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,109
We're not copying you.

271
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,944
We were already planning
on taking the test.

272
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,405
Tattle-tale.

273
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,532
You're the one who made me lie.

274
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,994
Who's talking in the testing room?

275
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,829
Quiet, please.

276
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,418
All right,
let's get the test started then.

277
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,216
-Your Americanos are ready.
-Thank you.

278
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,135
Aren't they mine?

279
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,638
These are mine.

280
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,767
I was just worried about your habit
of sneaking looks at other people's stuff.

281
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,772
By the way,
why is your son taking this test?

282
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,651
Did you hear that Yu-bin was going to
take the test from somewhere?

283
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,114
Why? You think you can win again
just because you won last time, don't you?

284
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,039
Listen, Byeon Chun-hui.

285
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,167
I'm sorry, but I don't think

286
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:42,838
your daughter is
any match for my Dong-seok.

287
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,883
What?

288
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,010
You asked if I had
some kind of hidden card.

289
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,514
Only a person like you would use
that kind of cheeky tactic.

290
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,224
I don't do that kind of stuff.

291
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,476
You better brace yourself.

292
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,645
Because no one can come up

293
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,314
against me and my son.

294
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,717
Did you already get
all of your things done?

295
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,885
Please.

296
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,971
My dad keeps telling me to have a meal
with the chairman of Ilpoom Foundation,

297
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,848
but I'm just too lazy.

298
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,647
I heard Yu-bin
is also taking the test today.

299
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,149
Yes.

300
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,860
Yu-bin's doing it more for the experience.

301
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,072
The director of Ilpoom told me

302
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,409
that they raised the difficulty
of the test this year.

303
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,620
Really?

304
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,331
Sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

305
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,375
There were so many eyes to look out for.

306
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,253
It's fine.

307
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,173
It doesn't really make a difference.

308
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,308
-Mom, it was so hard.
-Come here, son!

309
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,811
Did you do well? Give your bag to dad.

310
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,273
-Why aren't they coming out?
-The questions were too hard.

311
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,566
Goodness!

312
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,569
Jeez, Byeon Chun-hui's there.

313
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,198
Gosh, I didn't even do anything wrong,

314
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,618
but I don't know why
I'm so scared of her. It's annoying.

315
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,457
Su-in! Dong-seok!

316
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,417
-Dong-seok!
-Mom!

317
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,169
-Goodness.
-Did you do well?

318
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,545
-I did.
-Good job.

319
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,672
-Let's go.
-It wasn't too hard?

320
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,965
No, It wasn't.

321
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,676
-Did you do well?
-Yes.

322
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,011
-Did you do well?
-I think I did pretty well.

323
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,596
Let's go.

324
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,432
Yes, number 20 was a division problem.

325
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,517
-Really?
-Yes.

326
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,434
So you did well?

327
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,519
-You're good at that.
-Yes.

328
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,104
I did do well.

329
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,689
-Really?
-Yes.

330
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,943

KOREAN MATHEMATICS COMPETITION
2022 COMPETITION RESULTS

334
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,741
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.

335
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,327
I thought it'd be perfect for you
because it's about your major.

336
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:27,372
I know. I feel bad about it too.

337
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,791
But I just don't have the time right now.

338
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,545
Did you start some other work
to pay for your son's tuition?

339
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,006
I'm teaching him myself
to save on tuition fees.

340
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,884
All right. I'm sure
it'll be for the better.

341
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,054
Right, about the last book
you were working on.

342
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,057
I'm planning to have dinner
with the editing team and the author.

343
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,395
-Do you want to join?
-I'm guessing it's been published?

344
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,688
Yes.

345
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,356
After what happened to his wife,

346
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,943
I was worried he might not want to
proceed anymore, but he did.

347
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,281
He's going back to France for good,
so I wanted to have a meal all together.

348
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,784
I didn't even stick with the project
until the end anyway.

349
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,080
Why don't the two of us
have dinner together next time?

350
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,415
All right, then.

351
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,541
Bye.

352
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,718
Mom, hurry up!

353
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,761
Okay.

354
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,054
Gosh.

355
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,681
Let's go.

356
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,109
Have you been well, Dong-seok's mom?
This is Min-ji's mom.

357
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,946
Yes. Have you been well?

358
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,281
More or less.

359
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,242
I've been meaning to call you,

360
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,702
but I just…

361
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,039
There's a rumor going around

362
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,209
that Dong-seok came in first
among all first graders

363
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,211
at the Sungmyung University competition.

364
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,295
Is that true?

365
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,715
I know that Su-in received a gold prize.

366
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,008
Yes, that's right.

367
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,304
That's so impressive.

368
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,306
Congratulations.

369
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,267
How did he do so well on his first try?

370
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,896
I thought Dong-seok
quit all the academies.

371
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,358
I just bought him some workbooks.

372
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,277
I'm sorry,
but I'm actually headed somewhere.

373
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,821
I see.

374
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,490
Fill me in with the details
the next time we meet.

375
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,741
All right, then.

376
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,078
This woman really said
she just bought some workbooks.

377
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,371
Can you believe it?

378
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,039
Dong-seok won the grand prize.

379
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,583
-He won the grand prize?
-How does she even teach him?

380
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,876
Ta-da!

381
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,670
-Hello.
-Hello.

382
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:40,046
-Goodness.
-You're here.

383
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,714
-Hello.
-Is Eun-pyo here?

384
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,049
-Hello.
-Hello.

385
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,509
-Hey, Jae-ung.
-Hello, Uncle.

386
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,011
-Hello.
-Hello.

387
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:50,139
All right, all the men come over here.

388
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,226
-What can I help you with first?
-There's nothing.

389
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,270
-All the men, get over here.
-All right.

390
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,396
-Let's have soju.
-Sure.

391
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,564
-Mom!
-Sit here.

392
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,191
Why does Dad always
want to drink with the men first?

393
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,319
Eat up, everyone.

394
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,365
-They're eating so well.
-Mom, I'll take that.

395
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:09,909
I'm fine.
You just make sure you're eating well.

396
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,036
I already ate a lot.

397
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,580
-I said I'm okay.
-Here, kimchi.

398
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,833
-I'm fine.
-Mom, just eat. Let me do it.

399
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,585
-Gosh, give it to me.
-I'm fine.

400
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,170
I'll cook the meat,
so you just focus on eating, okay?

401
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,507
Hey, you look much better
since the last time I saw you.

402
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,550
Really?

403
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:29,262
Your mom always loves it
when anyone's good at studying.

404
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,100
Anyway, there's nothing
for you to be upset about now.

405
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,685
You now have a grandchild

406
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,812
who's very intelligent.

407
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,606
-Right?
-Yes.

408
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,984
Eun-pyo really did her
filial duty to her parents.

409
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,986
And this one is reaping the benefits too.

410
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,823
Having Eun-pyo move to the neighborhood
was like her hitting the lottery!

411
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,992
No more pork for you.

412
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,619
-Hey!
-Stop eating!

413
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,954
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

414
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:55,955
Here.

415
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,874
-Are we eating well?
-What's wrong?

416
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,875
Yes.

417
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,877
Goodness.

418
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,130
Police officers
must spend all day and night…

419
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,673
It's okay.

420
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,800
-You're so good at grilling the meat.
-Eat up.

421
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,637
-I said I can eat by myself.
-Just eat it.

422
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,974
-Come on…
-Man-su, I'm getting jealous here.

423
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,936
Eun-pyo never does
anything like that for me.

424
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,979
Yun-ju's such a lovebird.

425
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,773
That's what I'm saying!

426
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,151
He's the only one
who doesn't realize how blessed he is.

427
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,821
-Eat it.
-Jeez, I can do it myself.

428
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,365
-Just eat it!
-Jeez.

429
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,702
Look at Man-su's face.
He's turning completely red.

430
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,828
Oh, dear.

431
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,373
Su-in, I bet all those paper cranes
I folded for you

432
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,043
helped you do well on the test,
don't you think?

433
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,629
-Yes, Hye-rim. Thanks.
-Look at his face!

434
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:48,174
You still have the lucky crane
I folded for you too, right?

435
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,258
Yes.

436
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,094
Let's all say cheers!

437
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,764
-I agree, cheers!
-Cheers!

438
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:58,101
So how many times do I have to tell you

439
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:00,436
not to discriminate against the kids?

440
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,899
Why would you let such a big fish
like him get away?

441
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,276
We're the ones who put in
all the work to teach him.

442
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,195
-How did we end up like this?
-She's the one who was picking favorites.

443
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,655
Why is she so pissed at us?

444
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,198
Ma'am.

445
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:15,410
May I ask why you failed to report to me
that Su-in was going to quit?

446
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,454
If she was so smart,
you should've taken care of her better.

447
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,748
She's so shallow…

448
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,916
Seriously!

449
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,009
Look at her. She's a psycho.

450
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,594
I should've never run my mouth like that.

451
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,723
Why did I ever say
all that nonsense about luck?

452
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:40,101
I never should've said anything
about being neutral.

453
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,352
Seriously.

454
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,647
Yeong-bin didn't make it
again this time, right?

455
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,773
That's unexpected.

456
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,275
How is that unexpected?

457
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,487
He's finally starting
to show his real ability.

458
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,572
Gosh.

459
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:00,496
Was Yu-bin lying
about all that stuff then?

460
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,832
I wouldn't put it past her.

461
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,460
She goes absolutely berserk
if she doesn't come in first.

462
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,089
I bet it'll be an absolute mess
at their house tonight.

463
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,341
She'll be after her mom like crazy.

464
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,177
It's here.

465
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,262
Say "hello."

466
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,654
Kim Yeong-bin.

467
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,034
Don't be down and steel yourself, okay?

468
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,725
Didn't you use to come
in last place in your class?

469
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,060
-Dad, that was Yun-ju.
-Dad!

470
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,895
-What?
-What are you talking about?

471
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,522
-You came in the last.
-Come on, she didn't come in last.

472
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,232
-Don't listen to them.
-It's all the same.

473
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:10,983
Your grandpa and aunt are strange people.

474
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,820
If we're talking about coming in first,
it's Eun-pyo.

475
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,030
-For sure.
-Yes.

476
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,407
-That's right.
-Eun-pyo sure takes after you.

477
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,909
At least you know that much.

478
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,578
Jae-ung, I'm going out for a while,
so watch over Dong-ju.

479
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,663
Okay.

480
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,790
Come to the karaoke afterwards.

481
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,625
-Okay. See you later.
-Okay.

482
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,918
-Dong-seok, let's go.
-Bye.

483
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,670
-Bye.
-Bye.

484
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,255
-All right.
-Gosh.

485
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,097
-Hello.
-Did you just arrive?

486
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,099
Let's go in.
The consultation is about to begin.

487
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,225
Okay.

488
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,103
-Hello.
-Hello, sir.

489
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,063
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

490
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,773
Let's all head in.

491
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,316
Hello.

492
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,779
1ST PLACE IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
FOR EDUCATION FOR GIFTED STUDENTS

493
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,619
You're early.

494
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,288
Hello.

495
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,500
-Have you already eaten?
-I have no time to eat.

496
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,879
-Oh, no.
-It's important that you eat.

497
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,839
-Have you eaten?
-No, not yet.

498
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,258
-What about you?
-Yes.

499
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,010
Good. You should eat.

500
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,807
Hello. Please take a seat.

501
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,937
Let's get started.

502
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,952
SE-JUN, DONG-MIN, SEONG-UN,
YU-SEUL, MI-JIN, YEONG-BIN

503
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,288
-Se-jun is really good.
-That's amazing.

504
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,297
SE-JUN: 98.2, DONG-MIN: 85.6,
SEONG-UN: 86.6, YU-SEUL: 90.1

505
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:02,720
MI-JIN: 89.1, YEONG-BIN: 84.2

506
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,103
They said that the test this year
was a bit harder than usual.

507
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,813
Other than the grand prize winner,

508
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,524
the scores are pretty bad.

509
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,485
YEONG-BIN: 84.2

510
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,445
We're going to kick out this kid soon.

511
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,823
I tell you over and over again.

512
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,285
Only a handful of children
get into science or gifted schools.

513
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:30,039
If the kid isn't smart,
stop wasting your money on them.

514
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,124
I'm not here to turn a profit.

515
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,461
So please, be realistic
about your child's capability

516
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,297
and adjust your aspirations
accordingly, okay?

517
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,052
In place of this kid,
a new first grader will be joining us.

518
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,096
He's the grand prize winner.

519
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,432
He'll be the youngest
in our latest cohort.

520
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,770
Dong-seok's mother,
if you could please introduce yourself.

521
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:10,955
Now we're going to start going over
each student's weaknesses.

522
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,249
Oh, right.

523
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:17,295
Yeong-bin's mother,
could you please leave?

524
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,312
SUNGBEOM ACADEMY

525
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,254
Yeong-bin, wait in the car for a moment.

526
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,352
-Put your seatbelt on.
-Okay.

527
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,025
How did you know about this place?

528
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,278
How did you manage to take the test?

529
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,490
Why do you ask?
Is this a place I'm not allowed to be at?

530
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,452
Did you come all the way here
just to screw with me?

531
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,204
Didn't you hear earlier?

532
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,873
Oh, that's right.

533
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,209
You left in the middle of it.

534
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:22,086
I didn't find this place on my own.

535
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:24,380
The teacher called me personally.

536
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,299
He said gifted students should study
with other gifted students

537
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,884
for the best outcome.

538
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,303
I heard he's been doing everything he can

539
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,389
to get rid of all the non-gifted students.

540
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,436
How can you do this to me?

541
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,230
I was the one who helped you out
when you knew nothing!

542
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,902
That's something
I should be saying, not you.

543
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,905
Do you have any idea how horrible
it feels to be betrayed?

544
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,367
I'm not done being angry yet.

545
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,456
I'm going to pay you back
with the exact same pain you've caused me.

546
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:23,559
All I can do is stare at the petals

547
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:28,981
Why do they look

548
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,859
So fair and pretty

549
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:38,157
Those beautiful flowers

550
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,408
Man-su.

551
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,535
What is it?

552
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:45,247
Mr. Kim is telling me
that Mr. Yoo is really drunk.

553
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,042
He asked me to go instead
because he can't go out right now.

554
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,835
-Right now?
-Yes.

555
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,764
Okay, see you later.

556
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,186
-But…
-Yes?

557
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,487
Would it be okay
if we use your corporate card?

558
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,781
-What?
-Can't you just say

559
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,200
you dropped by a karaoke
after going out for drinks?

560
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,827
-Does that not work?
-No, that would work.

561
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:24,828
Do it.

562
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,456
-Really?
-Sure.

563
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:32,086
Then can you maybe add on an hour for us?

564
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,587
Okay, sure.

565
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,547
I'll order another round of beers too.

566
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,799
-Yes.
-All right.

567
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,258
-Okay, thanks.
-Sure.

568
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,053
Can you add on ten beers
and some dried snacks, please?

569
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,096
Sure.

570
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,181
Could you maybe add on
one hour on the house?

571
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:04,159
Welcome.

572
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,133
Hey.

573
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,635
Ma'am.

574
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,805
Can I get a shot glass?

575
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,766
-One shot glass, please.
-Okay.

576
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,692
I was planning on going to
that steamed monkfish restaurant,

577
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,278
but they're not in business anymore.

578
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,073
Thank you.

579
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,619
You liked the steamed monkfish there.

580
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,501
What's the matter?

581
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,510
I just thought of you. That's all.

582
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,606
You…

583
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,609
did a really good job
raising your daughter.

584
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,906
She got into the school
for gifted students last time,

585
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:27,159
and she won the gold prize this time.

586
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,786
I'm envious, you know that?

587
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:33,373
Gosh, it makes me look so bad.

588
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,461
We just got lucky. That's all.

589
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,590
What are you talking about?

590
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,968
She's smart because she takes after you.

591
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,807
Right.

592
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,606
Did you…

593
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,279
chase after Su-in's mom?

594
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,489
What?

595
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,326
What are you talking about?

596
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,037
Jeez.

597
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,331
What's this?

598
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,086
You really did, didn't you?

599
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,171
I mean…

600
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:25,259
When we were going out,

601
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,386
you used to only tell me
the sweetest things,

602
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,930
but it turns out you're
a real bad guy, aren't you?

603
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,611
Jeez.

604
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,369
You haven't changed one bit.

605
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,837
Why haven't you changed?

606
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,970
Why do you look so anxious
like you're the one who's done wrong?

607
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,683
I'm the one who betrayed you.

608
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:19,855
That's right.

609
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,234
I betrayed you.

610
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,453
I'm actually a really bad person.

611
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,501
You know what?

612
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,380
You can laugh at me.

613
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,471
Because I think my life is screwed.

614
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,481
I wanted to become a doctor's wife.

615
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,236
So I ditched you and got married to one.

616
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,283
But it turns out…

617
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,703
it wasn't anything special.

618
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,179
Man-su.

619
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,020
I'm sorry.

620
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:52,614
I've wanted to say this for a long time.

621
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,339
I'm sorry.

622
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:17,431
They say a fair face
may hide a foul heart.

623
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,057
That's exactly him.

624
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,561
So how much were the medications
that Man-su took worth?

625
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,521
Twenty million won.

626
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:30,360
How did you not know about it at all
when it was your department?

627
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,284
How could I have possibly known?

628
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,035
Someone like him

629
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,580
can trick anyone
if they put their mind to it.

630
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,290
I guess so.

631
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:47,878
Well…

632
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,756
I'm going to head out first.

633
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,926
Nurse Byeon, are you not well these days?

634
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,887
You've barely eaten.

635
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,974
Oh, I have gastritis.

636
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,643
Enjoy your food.

637
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:12,778
CIVIL AFFAIRS OFFICE
JEONG JIN POLICE STATION

638
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,349
I'm sorry.

639
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,853
I'll…

640
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:51,608
always be indebted to you.

641
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,887
Stop looking at me.

642
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,479
I didn't want you to see me like this.

643
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,441
I'm embarrassed.

644
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,027
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

645
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,405
If things get rough,

646
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,492
you can call me anytime.
I'll be there for you.

647
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,542
Forget about what happened today.

648
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:53,003
I just got depressed
and wanted to see you.

649
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,174
Excuse me, can you stop the car here?

650
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,851
Get out.

651
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,620
Sir…

652
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:12,874
I have to turn my kids into doctors.

653
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,641
Ma'am.

654
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,895
The price for fourth graders
is different from first graders.

655
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,898
Did you not know that?

656
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,065
Our school's chairman,

657
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:23,778
Ms. Bang Jeong-hui, will present
the awards for the lower grades.

658
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,284
Grand prize, gold prize, and silver prize.

659
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,370
Jung Dong-seok and Lee Su-in
from Sangwe Elementary

660
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,457
and Han Sang-hyeon from Uin Elementary,
please step forward.

661
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,880
These children are being awarded
for their excellent performance

662
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:44,090
at the 28th Korean Mathematics Competition

663
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:47,510
that was put together
by Sungmyung University,

664
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,889
Myeongseong Daily, and Ilpoom Foundation.

665
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:52,640
Let's give a big round of applause.

666
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,851
Congratulations.

667
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,645
You did so well.

668
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:03,276
Next up is Ms. Lee Su-in.
Let's give a round of applause.

669
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,403
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

670
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:08,990
Guys.

671
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:11,951
Let's take a picture. Smile at me.

672
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,620
One, two, three.

673
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,039
You guys look great.

674
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,958
You look great.
Let's take individual photos now.

675
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,045
Dong-seok, you go first.
Hold the flowers and look at me.

676
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,465
All right. One, two, three.

677
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:26,716
Gosh, you're so cute.

678
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,301
Hello.

679
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,763
Hello, Dong-seok's mother.

680
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,848
I see you remember my son's name.

681
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,643
Of course.
He won the grand prize today too.

682
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,521
Dong-seok really must be a genius.

683
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,815
I don't know if I'd call him that.

684
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:46,111
What type of children
have you been looking into?

685
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:53,409
Hey, Mom. Did you check
the money I wired for this month?

686
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,121
Yes.

687
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,292
Yes, so?

688
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,214
Why are you bringing that up again?

689
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,591
What did I tell you?

690
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:11,136
I said I can't move Dad
to a different home.

691
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,347
You have a daughter to look after you.

692
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:17,350
Why do you keep insisting on
moving into that lousy nursing home?

693
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:24,649
Okay, whatever.
I'll call you back later. Hang up.

694
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:27,735
Get in.

695
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,844
Why are you barking so much, Brahms?

696
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:55,722
Come here.

697
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:56,848
Good.

698
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,349
Come in.

699
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,689
It's even more delicious
because you're here.

700
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,399
-The crab stew is delicious.
-Right?

701
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,610
-Yes.
-Gosh, you're so handsome.

702
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,570
Stop it. I'm not a kid.

703
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,529
Jeez.

704
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,822
We're here.

705
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,908
Hey, you're here.

706
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,454
Ju-seok finished his surgery early.

707
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,499
He said he was starving,
so we got started first.

708
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,834
I just finished. Sit down and eat.

709
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,253
Hey, come take a seat.

710
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,465
Come on, sit.

711
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,094
I don't need to set the table again, do I?

712
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,513
-No.
-Okay.

713
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,181
Enjoy your food.

714
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,392
The crab stew is really good.

715
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:46,189
You're so lucky that my mom
is such a kind mother-in-law.

716
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,524
Jeez.

717
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,361
Only shallow people say things like that.

718
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,029
Come here, my baby.

719
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:55,031
Come on.

720
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:58,326
Clean up the table after you're done.

721
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,288
-My baby.
-Ju-seok, you want coffee, right?

722
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,540
Two, please.

723
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:04,749
All right.

724
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,546
Oh, right.

725
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,590
I heard Yu-bin didn't make it
into the school for gifted students.

726
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,342
Ju-seok told me.

727
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,680
Gosh, I told you.

728
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,975
I always said
Yu-bin wasn't a left-brain thinker.

729
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,437
Why not take this opportunity
to go into sports or arts?

730
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:31,025
I think it might be
too early to speak conclusively

731
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,069
about their abilities
considering their age.

732
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,405
If you say so.

733
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,200
Intelligence isn't really something
that gets better as time goes on--

734
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,743
I'll take care of it.

735
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,626
I know how well you raise your children.

736
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,589
But if I were to live in Gangnam like you
and let my kids take the same classes,

737
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,924
it wouldn't be so hard for me either.

738
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,677
You know that, right?

739
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,221
Don't judge a book by its cover.

740
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:05,518
You don't know how much it breaks my heart
to not be able to teach them everything.

741
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,229
The money game is where I'm losing out.

742
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:15,236
This kimchi looks delicious.
Is it store-bought?

743
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,200
I didn't know you were here.
I might've given a bad example.

744
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,287
Please consult with medical experts
before purchasing.

745
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:25,622
Pharm de Lyon.

746
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,999
But if I were to get caught
for the same thing again…

747
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:31,044
I'm worried that
I might never be able to work again.

748
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,296
I'm grateful that you've always

749
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:36,382
watched out for me financially
and emotionally all these years but…

750
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,136
I'm sorry.

751
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,680
What an annoying bastard.

752
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,744
Hello, Mr. Seong.

753
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,037
Are you busy?

754
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:08,873
I see. I'm doing well.

755
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,168
Golf sounds great.

756
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:15,713
I'm always available.
Just let me know when you're going.

757
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:18,299
By the way Mr. Seong…

758
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,260
Do you happen to have
Lee Man-su on your team?

759
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,805
I think he started working for you
about two years ago.

760
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,224
How would I have that much money?

761
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,521
I'm an old woman who's barely
getting by with my pension.

762
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:37,276
Also, this may come off as cold-hearted,

763
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,570
but some kids are just not
cut out for studying.

764
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:43,241
Stop pouring water into a broken vase.

765
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:46,160
Also, don't upset your husband

766
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,496
by asking for too much from him.

767
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,417
He looks so gaunt
because he's been working so hard.

768
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,087
Don't only think of your children,

769
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:01,676
but try and think about mine too, okay?

770
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:08,141
Baby, let's put a pretty ribbon on you.

771
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,852
Gosh, you're so pretty.

772
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,854
My baby is so pretty.

773
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:13,855
Let's see.

774
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,607
You're so pretty. Do you like that?

775
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,025
Goodness.

776
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,658
YOUR JOYCARD BALANCE IS STILL UNPAID.
PLEASE MAKE A PAYMENT IMMEDIATELY.

785
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:43,045
HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THE ACADEMY
IN FRONT OF WONDERFUL VIEWS?

786
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,964

01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,384
The teachers…

01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:54,557
I finished another bag again.

01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,351
There's none left.

01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,813
Man-su.

792
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,693
Man-su, buy me some more
shrimp chips on your way back.

793
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,241
I'll be late today, don't wait up.

794
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,077
Jeez. He's never here when I need him.

795
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,373
Gosh, my legs.

796
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,511
YOUR

797
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,974
WICKED DEEDS

798
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,482
PROPOFOL

01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,595
When Dr. Kim's wife worked as a nurse,

800
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:44,680
she killed a patient.

801
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,849
Is there anything else
that I should be aware of?

802
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:48,767
I was only trying to scare her.

803
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,521
I wanted to scare her
and drive her out of the neighborhood.

804
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,733
Did you already forget how people
treated him when we only stood up for him?

805
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,277
You should stop
keeping him cooped up so much.

806
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:01,655
Sungmyung University wants me
to start lecturing a course on aesthetics

807
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,699
because a spot just opened up!

808
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:06,911
Mom, you're unhappy because of me.

809
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:09,747
I'm not going to do it!
I'm not going to do anything!

810
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:13,959
You can tell me everything.
Why won't you say anything?

811
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:20,758
