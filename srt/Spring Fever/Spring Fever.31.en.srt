=Episode 31=

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,080
My lord.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,280
My lord.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,560
Why are you here?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,640
Where is she?

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,080
She's safe now.

7
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:31,776
The horse is over there.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,200
Let's go.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,640
Attack!

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,840
Just go, my lord.

11
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,080
Leave this to me.

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,240
Why are they endless?

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
If you surrender now,

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,480
I promise

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,320
I'll leave your corpse intact.

16
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,600
Perhaps I should leave you all
in one piece.

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,960
The Inner Bureau agents
do have sharp tongues.

18
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,560
Kill him!

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,800
(County Office)
Our men are waiting at the border.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,760
Did you think you could escape?

21
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,440
I just want you to taste hope first

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,800
before drowning in despair.

23
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:02,208
Don't let him escape! After him!

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,680
Lord Gao.

25
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,280
Who's there?

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,160
Boss! Boss! Boss!

27
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
(Shen Que...)

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,360
Ye Qinglan, the Lu family's concubine!

29
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,000
You defied feminine virtue

30
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,960
and seduced Governor-General Shen Que.

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,960
You entangled him during his return
to the capital,

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
and eloped with him,

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,640
causing his demise

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,560
and bringing imperial wrath
upon Ningzhou's people.

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,120
The Governor-General's death

36
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,160
was premeditated murder.

37
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,920
Lu Shi'an and I signed
a severance agreement long ago.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
How dare you!

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,920
Shamelessly unrepentant.

40
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,040
How heinous!

41
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,800
Will you confess now?

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Fabricated charges

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,520
need no justification.

44
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,720
I will not confess.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,080
Fine! Harder!

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,000
Is this all you've got?

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,960
You can't win, Lord Xia.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,760
Ye Qinglan,

49
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Shen Que is dead.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,920
Lu Shi'an is dead too.

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,920
In the end, I've won.

52
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,600
When I say you'll lose,

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,920
you'll lose.

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,560
Quit stalling.

55
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,840
Kill me.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,080
Killing you?

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,400
Keep dreaming.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
When the imperial censure comes,

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,320
you'll make a perfect scapegoat.

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,360
Tell me.

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,440
How would I kill you?

62
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,440
Guards!

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,080
Force her confession.

64
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,224
(Confession Letter)

65
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,000
Imprison her securely.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Keep her alive.

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,120
This brazen criminal

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,640
dared threaten the Prefect of Ningzhou.

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,960
Throw her in the dungeon

70
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,680
and guard her closely.

71
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
(Shen Que,)

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,200
(you can't be dead,)

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,000
(right?)

74
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,720
(You mustn't die.)

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,760
(You mustn't die.)

76
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,280
(Six Months Later)

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,744
(County Office)

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
Everyone, look.

79
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,840
This is Ye Qinglan,
the Lu family's concubine.

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,360
She defied feminine virtue

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,480
seduced Governor-General Shen Que,

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,080
and eloped with him.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,920
Coveted his wealth during their flight,

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,360
she colluded with bandits

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,520
and murdered him.

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,760
How vicious this woman was!

87
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,032
Defying womanly virtue,
you shamed all Ningzhou women!

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,400
- Pah!
- Pah!

89
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:16,880
- Pah!
- Pah!

90
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,200
- Pah!
- Pah!

91
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,800
Though I've never advocated
harsh punishments,

92
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,360
for one who violates all moral order,

93
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,920
and a beast beneath a human face,

94
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,680
only the harshest punishment
will appease the people,

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,400
and only a public execution
can uphold the law.

96
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,320
People of Ningzhou,
how shall I punish her?

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,280
- Burn her!
- Burn her!

98
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
I heard that Governor-General
was no good either.

99
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,160
The Prefect is virtuous and upright.

100
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,960
When bribes failed,

101
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,600
he tried framing the Prefect.

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Without the Prefect,

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,400
Ningzhou would've burned
to ashes by pirates.

104
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,960
The Prefect is our sovereign.

105
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,000
This adulterous couple
deserves their deaths.

106
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,720
- Adulterous fools!
- They deserve death!

107
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,600
- They deserve death!
- They deserve death!

108
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,120
He's no corrupt official.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
He was trying to help you.

110
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,680
- They deserve death!
- They deserve death!

111
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,720
Utter nonsense!

112
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,640
Let me heed the people's will.

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
Burn her!

114
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,240
Report!

115
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,120
My lord,

116
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,040
the Young Lord's official boat
has arrived.

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,680
What?

118
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,240
Why so sudden?

119
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,440
We didn't know
an official boat would come.

120
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,040
We thought it was just passing through.
It suddenly docked.

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
Never expected it to be Young Lord.

122
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,680
Come with me to greet him.

123
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
Hurry and wrap this up.

124
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,600
We mustn't let the Young Lord see this.

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,800
Yes.

126
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,760
Burn her!

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,800
Let's go.

128
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,960
Let me send you on your final journey.

129
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,440
Who dares block the Young Lord's path?

130
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,520
Do you want to die?

131
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,720
My lord, you misunderstood.
This woman eloped with her lover.

132
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,040
She also conspired
with bandits for wealth

133
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,160
and murdered her man.

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
Only execution will satisfy
the people's outrage.

135
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,760
My lord, I venture

136
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,200
to ask you to seek justice for me.

137
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,080
You risked death to stop my procession.

138
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,360
For whom do you seek justice?

139
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,240
I seek justice for my deceased husband.

140
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,560
Raise your head.

141
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,840
Who

142
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
is your husband?

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,280
Shen Que, the Governor-General.

144
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:31,400
(Duting Station)

145
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,160
My lord,

146
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,680
Lady Ye has finished bathing.

147
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,120
All of you, out.

148
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,560
Yes.

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,480
You have suffered so long in prison.

150
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,440
The physician says this medicinal bath
will dispel the chill.

151
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
Thank you, my lord, for saving my life.

152
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
Just gratitude for saving your life?

153
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,960
Not offer yourself to me?

154
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,400
My heart belongs to another.

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Belong to another...

156
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
Not even the iron tower?

157
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
Who are you exactly?

158
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,840
The name Shen Que
was bestowed by His Majesty,

159
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,840
so that I might serve him.

160
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:32,720
Took the surname
from the Empress Dowager.

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
I am Yin Ruxing, Duke of Xuan,

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320

I think

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,480
in this lifetime,

183
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,800
I'll never be without my skilled
makeup artist.

184

I'll give you all my gold and lands.

Enough?

187
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,400
Not enough.

188
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,840
