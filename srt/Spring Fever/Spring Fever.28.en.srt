Wife of Master Lu)

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,120
(Madam,)

4
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,640
(to maintain Ningzhou's stability,)

5
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,200
(I let you avoid
confessing your crimes temporarily.)

(The deceased)

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,680
(won't let you
erase their grievances casually.)

11
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,568
Where's Chenghuan?

12
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,448
After Grandmother passed,

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
she took poison and died too.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,240
You've fully recovered?

15
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,000
She left me the antidote
before she died.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,880
A'man,

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,760
she never truly meant to harm Jin.

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,640
She was despicable, but she...

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,960
She wasn't a good person.

20
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,360
But

21
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,720
she was a good grandmother.

22
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,160
You've just recovered.

23
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,160
You should rest more.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,800
Once matters in Ningzhou are settled,

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,040
will you take Jin away?

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,040
You'll always be Jin's father.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,520
After things are over here,

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640

If the candle goes out,
Jin might get scared.

Let's use this instead.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,760
Father, tell me a story.

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,760
When is your birthday?

51
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
March 13th.

52
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,000
March 13th?

53
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,720
Then your star sign shows

54
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,360
the ruling star of Horn Mansion.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
According to the legend,

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,960
the Horn Lord was Chang'e's brother.

57
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,920
But his wife violated celestial laws

58
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,160
and was banished to earth.

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,400
The Horn Lord couldn't bear
seeing his wife suffer on earth.

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,280
So he requested punishment

61
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,720
to accompany his wife on earth.

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,080
She's asleep.

63
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,480
Look.

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,520
The little one finally fell asleep.

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,680
Look.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Look over there.

67
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,040
Those two brightest stars.

68
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,000
One above, one below. See them?

69
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,480
Those form Jin's star sign.

70
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,560
What about mine?

71
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Yours is there.

72
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
I never thought

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,280
so many people with nothing

74
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,520
would match stars in the sky.

75
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,880
Exactly.

76
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,480
So as long as one lives,

77
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,240
they can't truly have nothing.

78
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,360
Then what meaning

79
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,240
does Jin's star hold?

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,520
When the Seven Eastern Stars
form a dragon,

81
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,360
it serves as the dragon's foot

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
and also its eye.

83
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,880
Every year at early spring dusk,

84
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,640
when dragon feet appear
on eastern horizon,

85
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,560
farmers know to begin plowing.

86
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,760
It's the so-called
"Dragon Head-raising Day".

87
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
By that logic,

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,560
I have an extraordinary daughter.

89
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,400

you slapped me back to the Lu family.

102
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,880
Now that the Lu family is useless,

103
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,920
you want me to marry someone else?

104

109
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,640
Take this.

110
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,000
What?

111
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
You dare defy me?

112
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,800

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,560

Only by obeying you

115
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,600
can I secure my position
as the lady of the Lu family

116
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
and be considered human.

117
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
But now I think differently.

118
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,480
As long as my child is born safely

119
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,960
and calls me Mother,

120
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,440
I'll be the most important person

in his world.

122
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,240
I'll never let anyone harm him.

Stop!

124
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,880
You were once
the most important person in my life.

125
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,480
But you kept reminding me

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,360
that I, a concubine-born daughter,

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,120
was just an insignificant tool to you.

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,840
Have you grown tired of living?

129

A'man.

135
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,800
Since you left,

136
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,120
I've truly become alone in this world.

137

Shi'an,

138
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,520
that's not true.

139
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,480
We can have another child.

140
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,520
A child that won't leave

141
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
and can grow up by your side.

142
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,240
Never again.

143
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,440
It will never happen again.

144
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
Jinzhi,

145
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,040
I used to hate you.

146
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,400
I hated how you looked down on me
yet married me.

147
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,480
But after all I've been through,

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,400
I realize I wronged you.

149
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,000
From the very beginning,

150
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,720
my heart belonged only to A'man.

151
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,080
When we first married,

152
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,920
you said I was your wife,

153
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,280
and we'd be harmonious partners.

154
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,160
You said that!

155
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,880
Yes, Jinzhi.

156
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,360
I said we'd be harmonious partners.

157
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,520
But I dared not said

158
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,640
I love you.

159
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,960
I indulged you

160
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
to ensure A'man's comfort in our home.

161
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,160
I wanted a peaceful home,

162
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,360
Grandmother content,

163
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,240
and Mother spared punishment.

164
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
But Xia Jinzhi,

165
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,760
I feared you.

166
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,520
I never loved you.

167
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,240
I shouldn't have married you.

168
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,760
Why?

169
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
Why when I realized I love you,

170
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,120
you stop pretending?

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,800
Lu Shi'an!

172
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
No matter what I do, you will never

173
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,680
accept me, will you?

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,480
Xia Jinzhi,

175
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,720
I've wronged you.

176
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,280

178

But between us,

my dowry in loans)

190
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
(and purchased rental properties.)

194
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
(but my heart.)

195
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,640

(Lu Residence)
(to pray for my child.)

199
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,680
(Previously, due to stubborn delusions,)

200
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
(I committed irreparable wrongs.)

201
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,000
(Today, I confess all before the gods.)

202
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,000
(I seek no divine forgiveness,)

203
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,840
(only that my sins don't harm my child.)

204
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
(May he live safely and prosperously.)
