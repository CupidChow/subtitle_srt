2
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,296
(Duting Station)

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,760
Lord Shen,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,720
don't make reckless decisions.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,760
This comes directly from His Majesty.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,080
Defying imperial orders

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,600
is a matter that could cost your life.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,680
Lord Shen, you have His Majesty's favor,
so this won't trouble you.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,520
But since I

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,800
come here twice a month,

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
please don't put me in a tough spot.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
Eunuch Gao.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,040
Well, Lady Ye.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,840
Eunuch Gao,

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,160
what's happening between you
and Lord Shen?

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,000
His Majesty

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,600
sent me to deliver an oral decree,

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,280
asking Lord Shen to return
to the capital to defend himself.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,360
But he refuses to comply anyway.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,160
Why won't he return?

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
My lady, I have an impertinent request.

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,200
Please convince Lord Shen
to return to the capital.

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,160
Disobeying His Majesty's decree

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,640
is equivalent to treason.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,280
It's a capital offense.

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,320
Moreover,

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,640
court officials are accusing him

28
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,120
of corruption, bribery,
and wife abduction.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,920
He didn't.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,040
I believe him too,

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,840
but if he doesn't return promptly
to defend himself,

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,040
letting those rumors fester unchecked,

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,280
the allegations could become confirmed.

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,920
Should His Majesty's wrath be incurred,

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,000
maybe

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,160
we'll see a decree
for execution and clan extermination.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,200
Eunuch Gao,

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,960
don't worry. I'll persuade him.

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,400
Thank you, my lady.

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,160
Thank you.

41
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:22,760
Why don't you return to the capital?

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,240
You heard it?

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
If I return now,

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
Prefect Xia will achieve what he wants.

45
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,320
Our investigations in Ningzhou
will be in vain.

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,560
But defying decrees is grave.

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,240
Return first.

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,144
Those in Ningzhou won't escape justice.

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't.

50
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,040
If I leave,

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,960
you'll be left in mortal danger.

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,080
How about you return
to the capital with me?

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
(Accusing him of corruption, bribery,)

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,160
(and wife abduction.)

55
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
I won't go.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Why?

57
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,680
I...

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,520
Is this for me?

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,080
No,

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
it's for Lu Shi'an.

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,080
He's lost both mother and grandmother.

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,880
I must stay by his side.

63
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,640
What did you say?

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,560
I'll leave you to your work.

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,880
Lady Ye,

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,560
you forgot something.

67
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,640
My lord, message from the capital.

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,000
Great!

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Great!

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,360
What good news is it

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
that makes you so happy?

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,440
These days, the Old Master

73
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,880
has been strategizing for us
in the capital.

74
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,720
Now all officials at court
impeach Shen Que.

75
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,320
His Majesty's fury is ignited,

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,240
ordering his immediate return
to defend himself.

77
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,640
He also said

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Shen Que lacks noble lineage.

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,160
He has no political foundation.

80
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,040
Now His Majesty despises him.

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,200
Whether he leaves Ningzhou alive

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,800
shall be at my discretion.

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,480
Since the court has condemned him,

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,880
let him return.

85
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,160
No.

86
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,800
He knows too much.

87
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,840
He used me to eliminate Madam Lu.

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,640
Now he'll target me next.

89
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Letting him return alive

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,000
would invite unpredictable disasters.

91
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,600
Only a corpse keeps secrets safely.

92
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,280
My lord,

93
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,800
shall we eliminate him?

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,480
My lord.

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,520
My lord?

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,440
My lord!

97
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,680
Why are you following me?

98
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,600
I want to see her.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,920
Forget about Lady Ye.

100
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,040
Worry about yourself now.

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Most of our men

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,488
have been dispatched to escort
Princess Anhe's coffin to the capital.

103
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
That foxy Prefect knows
our numbers have dwindled.

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
Today he claimed
pirates infiltrated the city

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,432
and ordered a lockdown to catch them.

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,760
He's clearly plotting something.

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,080
Moreover, His Majesty only
granted you fifteen days.

108
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
If you really don't return
and get punished by His Majesty,

109
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,880
it will be no trivial matter.

110
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,240
Prefect Xia...

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,640
He's losing composure
faster than expected.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,480
Yes.

113
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,280
You've been brooding these days.

114
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
Is this about him?

115
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,440
I've been considering

116
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,760
how to make him leave.

117
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
I have a solution.

118
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,960
Let's get married.

119
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,880
No.

120
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
Hear me out first.

121
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,080
My mother and grandmother are gone.

122
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,520
Jinzhi has left too.

123
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:22,480
Only the two of us
remain in this family.

124
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,120
Seeing this desolate residence now,

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,360
it truly pains my heart.

126
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,240
I don't want to be alone anymore.

127
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,760
You're still in mourning.

128
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,880
You're my concubine.

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,480
I merely wish to legitimize your status,

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,680
making you my principal wife.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,480
In the future,

132
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
I'll stand tall

133
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,720
and live like an honorable man,

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,280
shouldering my responsibilities.

135
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,800
This excuse

136
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,240
should be enough to fool Shen Que.

137
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,680
Don't worry.

138
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,480
If you cannot accept me,

139
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,920
I won't force you against your will.

140
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,800
We merely put on an act.

141
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,456
Stop nailing it!

142
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,160
Who ordered this sealed?

143
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,680
The new Lady of the House ordered it.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,040
New Lady of the House?

145
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,200
Which new Lady exactly?

146
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,440
Concubine Ye, of course.

147
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,720
Stop nailing it!

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
You've been avoiding me for days.

149
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,640
Now you're sealing the back gate.

150
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,200
What exactly do you mean?

151
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm marrying Lu Shi'an.

152
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
He promised

153
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,440
to make me his principal wife.

154
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,080
Ye Qinglan,

155
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,800
you dare speak thus now.

156
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,160
Do you think I'll believe this?

157
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,960
It's true.

158
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,960
Since he saved Jin,

159
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
my heart softened toward him.

160
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,880
He even took poison in my stead.

161
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,920
He risked death for me.

162
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,520
I shouldn't wrong him.

163
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
Haven't I been good to you?

164
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,880
Ye Qinglan,

165
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,440
have you no conscience?

166
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,760
Your kindness means nothing.

167
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,000
My lord,

168
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
you can't even safeguard yourself.

169
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,680
How can you ensure our wellbeing?

170
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,240
At first, I thought

171
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,800
you'd rise
through the Lu family's affairs.

172
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
I never imagined
you'd return to the capital in disgrace.

173
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,080
But I should thank you

174
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,480
for eliminating Xia Jinzhi and Madam Lu.

175
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,120
Even Shi'an's mother perished.

176
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,840
Now I alone reign
as the Lu family's matriarch.

177
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,680
Endless wealth and privilege await me.

178
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,160
Wouldn't staying here be preferable?

179
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,320
My lord,

180
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,360
don't you agree?

181
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,600
You gave this to me.
I'm returning it now.

182
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,840
With Shi'an by my side,

183
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,160
I have no further need for this.

184
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,800
Is this really what you think?

185
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,840
If you

186
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,200
retain any affection for me,

187
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,760
please

188
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
show mercy to the Lu family.

189
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,400
