2
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,280
What?

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,040
Afraid I'd poison you?

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,160
Gao Fu's medicine

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,280
can only heal people.

6
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,520
It won't harm anyone.

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,200
Why haven't you left yet?

8
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,440
Not afraid of defying decrees?

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,720
Now, do you think

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,320
I can leave Ningzhou whenever I want?

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,840
Make your decision soon, my lord.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,000
There's still time.

13
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,040
This time, I came

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,600
for her.

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,040
She's doing well.

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,960
You needn't concern yourself anymore.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,760
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,080
I won't say goodbye to her.

19
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,560
Lu Shi'an.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,000
As a man,

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,080
you must protect
your loved one and your child.

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
Promise me.

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,600
No matter what happens,

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,200
stand firmly by A'man and Jin's side.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,480
Never abandon her when she needs you.

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,160
Respect her.

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,000
Trust her.

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,240
Love her.

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,600
If you can do these things,

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,600
I'll never return to disturb you again.

31
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
Shen Que,

32
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,640
can you truly bear to let go?

33
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,168
(Lu Residence)

34
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,400
A'man,

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,720
the elders in our family
have all passed.

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,680
Let's perform the ritual
at the Goddess Temple outside town.

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Okay.

38
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
Do we still need this?

39
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,120
Of course.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,720
Uncover it at the Goddess Temple.

41
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,160
It's auspicious.

42
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,720
Okay.

43
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,400
Search the whole city!

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,520
Come on.

45
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,728
Get in the carriage.

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,280
You go now.

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,800
You?

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,040
Why are you here?

49
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,360
If you leave Ningzhou,

50
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,440
will A'man truly survive?

51
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,520
I'm incompetent.

52
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,840
I can't protect her.

53
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,080
But I have a plan

54
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,040
to get you out of the city.

55
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Gao Fu and Jin have already left.

56
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,200
They hid in the Lu merchant caravan.

57
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,200
We'll meet them at the Qizhou.

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,480
A'man.

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,280
This is our severance agreement.

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
From now on,

61
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,480
we'll have no further ties.

62
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
What about you?

63
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,080
Prefect Xia still needs me
to manage the Lu family's wealth.

64
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,600
He won't make trouble for me.

65
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:56,096
I've arranged everything
at the city gate.

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Lord Shen,

67
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,960
I entrust them to your care.

68
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
Take care of them.

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,680
Maybe you should come with us.

70
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,520
No.

71
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,640
I need to meet someone else.

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,800
A'man,

73
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,880
when Jin grows up,

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,640
tell her

75
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,280
her father wasn't a coward.

76
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,440
When she's older,

77
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
I'll make sure she knows

78
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,400
her father is a good man.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Go now.

80
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,480
Take care.

81
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,960
(A'man,)

82
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
(we were never formally
husband and wife,)

83
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,480
(but we once shared companionship)

84
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,016
(and were childhood sweethearts.)

85
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,240
(Now, it's time to say goodbye.)

86
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,600
(My cowardice and greed
wasted your youth.)

87
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,040
(I bounded you with gossip
and trapped you with our daughter.)

88
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,480
(May you find a worthy partner
after we part.)

89
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,480
(Let bridges and roads
return to their places.)

90
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,720
(A clean break brings mutual peace.)

91
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,280
(Go.)

92
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,640
(Forget everything here.)

93
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,920
(Live the life you desire.)

94
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,400
My lord,

95
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Master Shi'an's
wedding procession has left.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,320
Let them go.

97
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,320
My lord, bad news!

98
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,040
Everyone at Duting Station disappeared.

99
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,000
When?

100
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,760
When the Lu wedding procession departed.

101
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,280
What?

102
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,600
After them, now!

103
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,160
Shen Que must not leave Ningzhou alive.

104
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,600
Understood.

105
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,200
Hurry!

106
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,720
Where are Shen Que and Ye Qinglan?

107
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't know.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,560
You...

109
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,360
They're at the Goddess Temple.

110
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,080
What?

111
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Take him away.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,560
Understood.

113
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,040
Return and gather more men.
Head to the Goddess Temple.

114
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,280
Let's go!

My lord,

134
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,040
we've lost all traces of Shen Que.

135
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,840
What?

136
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,560
Useless!

137
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,160
Listen! Pursue them immediately!

138
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,000
Whichever route they take,

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,160
find them at all costs!

140
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,440
If he returns alive to the capital,

141
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,560
we'll all be dead! Understand?

142
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,168
Understood.

143
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,360
Go! Chase them!

144
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,000
Understood!

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
Faster!

146
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,320
Lu Shi'an should have met
Xia Jinzhi by now.

147
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,680
Prefect Xia's target is only me.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,640
He shouldn't harm innocent bystanders.

149
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
But I fear if Prefect Xia
grows desperate,

150
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,760
he'll be utterly unhinged.

151
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
He'll do anything.

152
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,080
Once we cross Ningzhou's border,

153
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,440
I'll secure your safety

154
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,560
and return to check.

155
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,680
Okay.

156
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,000
My lord.

157
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,000
My lord.

158
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
Finally caught up with you.

159
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,640
All set?

160
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,440
Lord Gao?

161
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,040
Lady Ye.

162
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,680
Weren't you with Jin?

163
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,040
Yes.

164
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,840
She's already been sent to Qizhou.

165
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,720
She's safe.

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
I worried about you two,

167
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,680
so I came back to meet you.

168
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,120
You're worried my death will force you

169
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,480
to atone by dying
after going back to the capital.

170
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,320
Exactly.

171
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,320
A fortune-teller once told me

172
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,760
I'm destined for wealth

173
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,640
and a long life.

174
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,720
Stick with me,

175
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,160
and no harm will come to you.

176
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,760
Fine.

177
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,440
After we return to the capital,

178
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,320
I'll personally arrange
your and A'qiong's wedding.

179
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,280
Great! I'll be sure to thank you.

180
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,880
When I have a chubby son,

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,200
how about making him
Jin's future husband?

182
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,160
That's not my decision.

183
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Ask Jin herself.

184
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,560
I will when we return.

185
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
Go.

186
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
A'man, don't come down yet.

187
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,160
What's happening?

188
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:26,800
Nothing.

189
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
Just petty bandits.

190
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,440
My lord,

191
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
with our current forces,

192
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,280
we can handle these bandits.

193
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
They're after me.

194
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,920
I'll draw them away.

195
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,440
No.

196
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,800
Gao Fu, that's an order.

197
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,080
Then I'll disobey.

198
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,960
You can flog me later if you want.

199
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,040
A'man, it's not
that I won't let you down.

200
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,960
But someone else wants you kept there.

201
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,440
Promise me. Once you leave Ningzhou,

202
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,720
wait for me.

203
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay. I promise.

204
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
Remember how to use this?

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,560
I do.

206
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,960
Gao Fu,

207
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
she matters more than me.

208
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,240
Protect her in my stead.

209
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,240
My lord.

210
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,440
Please.

211
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,360
Go!

212
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,640
Stop.

213
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,400
My lady, we're entering
Qizhou territory.

214
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,280
Shen Que hasn't caught up yet.

215
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,160
I'll go reinforce him now.

216
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,600
Once you arrive, keep moving forward.

217
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,280
Don't look back.

218
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,880
Understood.

219
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,280
They're over there!

220
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,560
- Kill them!
- These bandits never learn.

221
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,040
Will you ever stop?

222
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,840
Coming to die again?

223
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,880
Close call.

224
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,520
I almost shot you.

225
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,040
That was precise.

226
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,552
I'll make you a lighter gun next time.

227
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,160
You made this?

228
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
Learned from a master in Shouchun.

229
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,720
Oh.

230
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,360
(Duke Xuan's Mansion)
Take this token.

231
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,040
I'll go assist Lord Shen now.

232
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,360
These pirates won't dare
cross into Ningzhou.

233
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,760
If you encounter danger,

234
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,880
show this token to the local Prefect.

235
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,760
Okay.

236
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,240
My lady,

237
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,840
farewell.

238
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,160
Guards!

239
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,640
Protect Lady Ye!

240
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,400
Understood.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,320
(Why so many?)

242
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,880
(Looks like Xia Ciyi truly
wants me dead in Ningzhou.)
