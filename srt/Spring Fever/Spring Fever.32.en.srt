2
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,040
What's going on here?

3
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,320
My lord.

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,040
Today, we've gathered here

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,640
to demand from you

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,400
that female prisoner
taken under the chastity arch.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,320
She's a heinous criminal.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,280
Only her death
can appease public outrage.

9
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,680
Your haste in rallying people
to confront me.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,240
Are you afraid Madam Shen
might reveal some truth?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,360
Everyone in Ningzhou

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,840
knows Lord Shen's cause of death.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,160
You...

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,680
Don't believe

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,600
that witch's bewitching words.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,760
This vile woman seduced
the Governor-General to elope,

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,840
and conspired with pirates

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,640
to kill him for his wealth.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,920
- Yes! Kill this vile woman!
- Kill this vile woman!

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,080
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,920
Which of you witnessed it? Step forward!

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,840
Since none come forward,

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,480
this is mere hearsay.

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,040
However,

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,440
regarding Lord Shen's death,

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
I know the truth well.

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,760
Shen Que?

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,160
It is you?

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,120
I imprisoned Director Zhao
half a month ago.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,520
Lord Xia, no one can protect you now.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,240
I should've realized sooner.

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,680
Arrest him!

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,720
Understood.

34
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,960
You can't arrest me!

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You have no evidence!

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,480
Without evidence

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
or victims,

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,560
even if you are the Young Lord,
we won't be convinced!

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,240
Am I right?

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,320
- Yes!
- Yes!

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
We don't believe it!

42
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,880
Exactly right!

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,520
You lack evidence!

44
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm a victim.

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,200
Everyone, remain calm.

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,080
Give me three days,

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,320
and I'll find more victims.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,320
How will you find them?

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,080
I have an idea.

50
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,840
But I need your help.

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,760
Fellows!

52
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
People of Ningzhou!

53
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,360
The name Ningzhou

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,720
symbolizes tranquility.

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,120
This peace

56
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,600
belongs not just to Prefect Xia
and the Lu family,

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,120
but to all of us.

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,800
Prefect Xia killed innocents for merit,
forcing people into piracy.

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,560
The Lu family smuggled tribute pearls,

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,960
exploiting people of Ningzhou.

61
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,480
He tried to burn me alive

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,520
to cover his crimes!

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
The truth is

64
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,560
Princess Anhe discovered

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,360
their collusion

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,800
in oppressing the people.

67
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,840
They even dared murder Princess Anhe

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,680
and deceive everyone
for years with lies!

69
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,920
My family, friends,

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,360
and even Princess Anhe

71
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,000
all gave their lives to expose them.

72
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,400
What about you?

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Up to now,

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,560
do you still believe

75
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,240
your vanished loved ones

76
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,960
were claimed by the sea?

77
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,000
Some were forced into piracy.

78
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,480
Others had pearls ripped from them.

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
Won't you seek justice for them?

80
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,080
If you all hide in shadows,

81
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,400
the sacrifices made

82
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,040
to bring light

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,840
will never reach this land!

84
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
I know many fear stepping forward.

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,120
Your presence here today

86
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
is courageous enough.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,440
Write down your missing friends

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,800
and family members' names.

89
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,080
If you forget their names,

90
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,320
no one in this world will remember them.

91
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,680
Who will seek justice for them?

92
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,040
Please don't forget them.

93
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,680
My uncle Zhao Ji died.

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,320
And my husband Wang Shi.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,840
My missing brother Pan Shun.

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,640
Wang Shijin.

97
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,720
My sister Zou Hui.

98
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,760
Yang Yuanhe.

99
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
My father Ye Zhirong.

100
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,040
I want to find my brother Shen Yuanlang.

101
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,520
Luo Wenlu.

102
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,520
Xue Si.

103
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,800
I've checked the names listed here.

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,160
Most of them are connected
to the missing folks

105
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,840
you dismissed over these years.

106
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,280
Their identities match
those smuggled pearl corpses.

107
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Prefect Xia,

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
do you have anything left to say?

109
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Why are you here?

110
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,000
I came for the dozens of innocent lives.

111
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,320
Not long ago,

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,360
the Young Lord's guards
visited Yingzhou.

113
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,768
The Dong family upholds
impeccable morals.

114
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,840
Dong Kui's memorial tablet

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,120
has been enshrined
in Madam Dong's chamber.

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,000
Now, Madam Dong enjoys
her grandchildren's company.

117
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,440
The children all believe
their grandfather

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,400
was a well-read scholar.

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,240
He should've been recorded in history.

120
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,320
Yet he died from illness
during imperial exams.

121
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,840
I never dared

122
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,680
ask about their lives.

123
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,080
I thought

124
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
they'd long forgotten me.

125
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,040
As long as you confess your crimes,

126
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,240
tell Ningzhou's people

127
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,760
how you've deceived them these years,

128
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,640
and return the imperial funds
meant for them,

129
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,480
the Young Lord will spare the Dongs
from collective punishment.

130
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
I've lost. I won't fight anymore.

131
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,600
Don't tell them.

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,360
Don't let them know what I've done.

133
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,280
Xia Ciyi.

134
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,080
No.

135
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,920
Dong Kui.

136
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,480
This is your last chance.

137
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,720
I confess.

138
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,200
I'll tell everything.

139
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,440
Thank you.

140
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,200
Thank you, my saviors.

141
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,960
Thank you. Thank you.

142
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
He confessed?

143
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
Corrupt official!

144
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:55,720
He deserves execution.

145
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,680
Thank you. Thank you.

146
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,600
I'm Governor-General Shen Que.

147
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,640
I'm also Yin Ruxing, the Duke Xuan.

148
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,320
Ye Qinglan

149
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,280
is the daughter of Sang Huai,

150
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,720
former postmaster of Duting Station,

151
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,000
named Sang Ye'er.

152
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,480
She never eloped with me.

153
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,760
I asked her to help investigate
Ningzhou's corruption.

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,120
A delicate inner-chamber lady like her

155
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,200
battled corrupt officials and tycoons,

156
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
surviving countless dangers.

157
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,280
She carved a bloody path with wit,

158
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,440
just to clear her parents' names

159
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,080
and restore peace to her homeland.

160
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,880
She's no criminal slave.

161
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,960
She's a heroine.

162
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,040
- Great!

163
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,960
She fought postpartum hemorrhage
for months. Now, she's dying.

191
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,320
You're here.

192
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
Look.

193
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,320
I gave Shi'an a son.

194
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,640
Could you raise this child

195
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,600
for Shi'an's sake?

196
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,920
Okay.

197
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,520
Thank you.

198
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,640
From now on, you'll be his mother.

199
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,120
Don't tell him

200
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,280
he ever had me as a mother.

201
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,080
I'll raise him right.

202
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,960
But he has the right
to know who his mother is.

203
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
What happened wasn't your fault.

204
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,480
Don't worry.

205
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,920
I'll take good care of the child.

206
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,040
Let me see him one more time.

207
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,840
Thank you, Ye Qinglan.

208
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,920
I'll raise him well.

209
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Don't worry.

210
00:14:47,142 --> 00:14:52,160
(Lu Residence)

211
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,880
Come on. Congratulations
for buying the Lu Residence.

212
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
I never told you why I bought it.

213
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,920
You're not upset?

214
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,600
My wife earned this estate
through her own merits.

215
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,440
Why would I be upset?

216
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,160
This is the grandest mansion
in Ningzhou.

217
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,200
I'll turn it into a schoolhouse,

218
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,360
where every child in Ningzhou can study.

219
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Okay.

220
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,240
Mother, Father, I want to study too.

221
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,520
Xing will also go to study.

222
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,040
And the little sister
in your belly will study too.

223
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,040
Okay.

224
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,360
How do you know it's a sister?

225
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,920
A feeling.

226
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,200
But after taking down
the Lu family's plaque,

227
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,400
shall we make it the Shen Residence

228
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,920
or perhaps the Ye Residence?

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,560
Since you purchased it,

230
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,880
it should bear your family name.

231
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,720
What about this one in my belly?

232
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,240
This one takes my surname.
The next can take yours.
