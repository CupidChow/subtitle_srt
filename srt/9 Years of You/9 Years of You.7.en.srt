2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,680
11 MONTHS LATER

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,239
Yes, make a pose, please.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,200
Ready? One, two, three.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,840
<i>For colon cancer treatment,</i>

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,280
<i>we start with surgery</i>
<i>to remove the malignant tissue.</i>

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,920
<i>Then, we proceed with chemotherapy</i>

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,880
<i>to destroy any remaining cancer cells</i>

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,720
<i>and prevent them from spreading.</i>

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,040
<i>However, side effects are common,</i>

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,920
<i>including hair loss and nausea.</i>

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,160
I think I'll trim this part
to tighten the flow.

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,320
2022

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,000
But this is important information.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,720
We can wait to add a caption
to keep it engaging.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,440
The clip is only a bit over a minute,
we can't fit everything in, Dao.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,480
Then can I trim something else instead?

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,680
I'm doing this show to spread awareness.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,120
Okay. Let's keep the whole thing.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,520
Let's play the next part.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,600
- How is it?
- Looks okay.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,680
I think we should brighten it a bit
so the energy-saving label pops more.

23
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,000
Sure.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,280
Make it look nice. This client is lovely.

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,120
Alright, let's try this.

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,680
- How is it?
- Great, much better.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,120
If we run it until the year's end,
it will be more cost-effective.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,080
I'll also plug your product
in other programs

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,840
on the Better Together channel.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,760
It's worth it.
Our channel engagement keeps rising.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,480
Thank you.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,080
I'll have accounting
send over the details.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,840
- Another job closed!
- For real?

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,360
Yeah, just now.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,520
The Protex campaign we shot
is already on billboards.

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
Awesome!

37
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,440
Let me see.

38
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,600
Just now,

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,240
the client personally approved
Dao's <i>Fighting Cancer</i> campaign.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,560
Amazing!

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,280
Health content
is really trending now, Dao.

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,720
Your show gets more views than any other.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,560
Honestly,
I didn't expect it to get this popular.

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
I made it just to learn more,
and turned it into content.

45
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,280
Babe,

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,560
then let's find something relatable to us

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,440
and turn it into content too.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
You should do a series called

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,200
"How to Win Her Back."

50
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,160
I think it's gonna take a while.

51
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,360
You've been trying for six years
and still no luck.

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,480
Oh, Babe.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,480
Dao,

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
are you cold?

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,200
How's this round of chemo?

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,320
Not too bad.

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,960
It was less painful than surgery.

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
And I think there are
fewer side effects this time.

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,240
Hang in there, Dao.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,160
This is round eleven. Just one more to go.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,840
Don't worry. It's all about moral support.

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,240
Ugh, so much love.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
Do you want to see even more?

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,160
- Why?
- What now?

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,320
Come here.

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,160
- Hey!
- Look.

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,840
- Gorgeous.
- Stunning.

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
I booked Mew's hotel for you two.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,960
You can go on your honeymoon.

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,040
And make content while you're at it.

71
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,520
- Cut it out, you're always like this.
- What?

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,280
The hotel just reopened after COVID.

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,280
- They need tourists. Be understanding.
- We're friends, come on.

74
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,160
Yeah, friends.

75
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,000
But it's in less than two months,
will you really be okay?

76
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,760
What if the last chemo hits hard?

77
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,600
Stop. Don't think like that.

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
I will be fine.

79
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,240
Alright, back to work, everyone.

80
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,320
- Hey, Dao!
- Dao!

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,920
Sit down first.

82
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Let's go.

83
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,320
Why didn't you let Dao
stay at the hospital?

84
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,480
It's just nausea and dizziness, Mom.

85
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,200
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

86
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,920
But we've talked about this, Dao.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
If anything happens, you have to tell us.

88
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,520
And no pushing yourself.

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,560
I wasn't. I really felt fine this morning.

90
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,040
You're stubborn again.

91
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,360
I'll work at the studio.

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,480
And for the wedding,

93
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,000
will she be okay?

94
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm trying to keep things quiet.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
You can wake me up.

96
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,800
Dao, let's get you changed first.

97
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,760
I'll take care of the laundry.

98
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,720
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
You had to stay up with me.

100
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,840
It's okay.

101
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,120
We've still got
two more tie-ins this month.

102
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,960
And for the new ad campaign,

103
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,920
please help find a model
with a modern Chinese look.

104
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,440
- To match the product's target.
- Got it.

105
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,240
Some viewers say
the <i>Taste & Share</i> show feels a bit slow.

106
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm thinking of tightening it up
and adding more upbeat music.

107
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,360
You think that will help?

108
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
Try it. Whatever feels fun for you.

109
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,680
Dao.

110
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,000
How are you doing?

111
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,600
I brought snacks to cheer you up.

112
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,520
Dao.

113
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
I told you to rest at home.
Why did you come in?

114
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
I've been resting for days.

115
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
We gotta deliver
the invites to the elders.

116
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,280
So you don't have to come back for me.

117
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,520
- I'm not going.
- Why?

118
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,640
What are they talking about?

119
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,760
- No idea.
- No idea.

120
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,840
Why postpone?

121
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Don't you want to marry me, Ran?

122
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,440
I'm just worried about you.

123
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
But we agreed you wouldn't do this.

124
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,840
Can you make things feel normal, Ran?

125
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,120
Stop treating me like I'm about to die.

126
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,520
Get well first.

127
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,120
Once you're healthy, whatever
you want to do, I promise I'll take you.

128
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,640
I don't know

129
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,600
how much time I have left.

130
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,840
I want to marry you, Ran.

131
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,320
But this is torture.

132
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,160
It hurts so much.

133
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,160
I'm scared.

134
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,840
You have to fight through it.

135
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,040
Better Together, right?

136
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,280
And we are together.

137
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,960
I feel bad for Ran and Dao.

138
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,920
They took forever to get together,
and now this.

139
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,680
Yeah…

140
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,760
Hey.

141
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,360
I talked to Dao.

142
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,600
We'll wait and see
how she reacts to the final shot.

143
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,600
If it's too much

144
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,880
and she really can't handle it,

145
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,320
then we'll postpone the wedding.

146
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,520
Just one more shot. You'll make it, right?

147
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,880
The produce looks really fresh.

148
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,080
- Did it come in today?
- Yes, this morning.

149
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,200
- Then I'll take one papaya.
- Sure.

150
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,920
And three apples, please.

151
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,160
- Okay.
- Here you go.

152
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,800
This one.

153
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,400
- Put them in this bag, please.
- Got it.

154
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,200
Here you go.

155
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,680
Ran, tonight I'm making
steamed fish with milk.

156
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,280
It will help soothe Dao's throat.

157
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,320
If she wants anything else,
just let me know. See you later.

158
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,440
It's nothing. See you at home.

159
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,880
It's me.

160
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,240
For the newly edited
<i>Taste and Share</i> episode,

161
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,240
I watched it. It looks good.
As for the budget on Ning's show idea,

162
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,040
please set up a team meeting.

163
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,520
I want to trim a few more things out.

164
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,040
Okay.

165
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,360
Mon…

166
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,520
Mon, wait.

167
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,720
Why are you back?

168
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,840
I'm sorry, Mon.

169
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,320
How could you do this to me and our child?

170
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,280
Do you even know what we've been through?

171
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
I take full responsibility.

172
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,920
It's all my fault.

173
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,920
- I thought I could fix everything.
- With a stupid method like that?

174
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,520
I know everything now.
I know why you took out the loan.

175
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,880
What were you thinking?

176
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,560
At the time, I didn't know what to do.

177
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
I just wanted to find money
to help the company.

178
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,920
At first, it worked.

179
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,240
But before I knew it,

180
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,160
everything collapsed.

181
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,320
It wasn't just your life that fell apart.

182
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,240
Mine and our child's did too.

183
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,440
Why did you do it?

184
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,480
Why?

185
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,160
Why? Why?

186
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
You didn't care about me
or our child at all?

187
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
No calls. No letters.

188
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,280
Why didn't you reach out?

189
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,240
It's not that I didn't want to.

190
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,240
I was ashamed.

191
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,760
You know…

192
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,480
I haven't had a night
of peaceful sleep since.

193
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,080
But I've quit everything now.

194
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,440
I'm working hard to pay off the debt.

195
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,320
Our child is stronger than I was.

196
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,360
In just a few years, he paid it all off.

197
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,360
Is that the reason?

198
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,240
Because the debt is gone?

199
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,480
That's why you came back?

200
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
No.

201
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,840
Why aren't you coming inside?

202
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,120
I was just thinking about something.

203
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,160
Alright.

204
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,080
- Tonight, Dao will sleep at her place.
- Okay.

205
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,280
I just dropped her off.

206
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,840
Tomorrow, she has a meeting about
the new collection of Mr. Stone Face.

207
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,720
So let's save the meal
you planned for her for tomorrow.

208
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,640
Are you alright?

209
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,840
Yes, I'm fine.

210
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,840
Here you go.

211
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,840
No worries. I'll go myself.

212
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,200
Ran, it's okay. I'll check.

213
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,680
- It's fine. I can go.
- It's fine.

214
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,840
Mom.

215
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,560
What is it, Nay?

216
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,400
Hold on.

217
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,000
- There's a delivery for Mr. Paran.
- From where?

218
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,520
It doesn't say.

219
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,440
Please sign for it.

220
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
Thank you.

221
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,160
I sent you the email.

222
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Check it when you can.

223
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,240
What are you doing, Mom?

224
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,000
Nothing, Dear.
Just some creep sending stuff.

225
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,360
Let's go inside.

226
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,680
GRANDMA SAMAI RESTAURANT

227
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,000
Do you want anything from Chiang Mai?

228
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,520
Jew will bring it after his site visit.

229
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,880
We haven't even finished the last batch.

230
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,320
Jew looks happy with his new job.

231
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,760
Of course.

232
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,000
When a man can ease his family's burden,

233
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,280
he feels proud.

234
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,640
- Mom.
- Hmm?

235
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
- Duen.
- Hmm?

236
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,240
Is wedding planning
really that exhausting?

237
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,480
Everyone keeps telling me to postpone.

238
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Before the wedding,
you have to visit venues,

239
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,400
make sure everything's ready,

240
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,760
outfits, makeup artists,
party favors, everything.

241
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,440
The night before,

242
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,440
you'll be too excited to sleep.

243
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,120
Then you have to
get up at 3 a.m. for makeup.

244
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,760
On the day, you'll be busy with
the ceremony and greeting guests.

245
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,000
But there's one part that isn't tiring.

246
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,760
Which part?

247
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,200
Counting envelopes.

248
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,720
Mom.

249
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,000
No, no.

250
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,280
Come here.

251
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,720
Are you okay?

252
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,600
Hey, I know my food is good,

253
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,200
but you don't have to eat until you vomit.

254
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,000
Actually, it's good.

255
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,880
You'll be slimmer
and look gorgeous for the wedding.

256
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,400
Thank you.

257
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,560
You and Duen never treat me like I'm sick.

258
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,000
Because you're stubborn.

259
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,440
- Let's go to bed.
- Come on, Dear.

260
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,560
Let's go.

261
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,560
Once I'm married,

262
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,800
we won't be sleeping here
like this anymore.

263
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,520
If you miss it,
just bring Ran to stay over.

264
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,240
I'll keep your room exactly as it is.

265
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
Time for bed, Dear.

266
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,840
- Sweet dreams, Dao.
- You too.

267
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,560
MR. PARAN WATCHAWONG

268
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,120
7,000,000 - SAK

269
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,320
MR. PARAN WATCHAWONG 7,000,000

270
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,520
As for the money…

271
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,640
We'll need to ask the investor

272
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,040
how much he's willing to
lend a couple of fresh grads like us.

273
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,000
How much again?

274
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,200
Ran, I've prepared food for you.

275
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,560
Is Dao staying over tonight?

276
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,080
Yes.

277
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,880
- Pueang, can you leave first?
- Of course.

278
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,080
Mom.

279
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,920
Yesterday when you came back
from the market, you were acting strange.

280
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,320
Did something happen?

281
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,520
Why do you ask?

282
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,640
You met Dad, didn't you?

283
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,800
He just got back to Thailand.

284
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,760
Where has he been?

285
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,520
In Hong Kong.

286
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Yesterday,

287
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,680
he waited at the market to see me.
But don't worry, Ran.

288
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,440
I won't let him
interfere in your life again.

289
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,160
Aren't you happy he's back?

290
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,440
You've waited all these years.

291
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,800
But I'm more worried about you.

292
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,680
About me?

293
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,600
Not long ago,

294
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,920
I spoke to Uncle Nui.

295
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,120
About the bank loan your father took,

296
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,200
part of it…

297
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,160
He used for online gambling.

298
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,240
Dad?

299
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,160
When the company ran into problems,

300
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
he tried to find cash flow.

301
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,080
Then,

302
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,440
Uncle Kitja from his golf group
gave him the idea.

303
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
At first,

304
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,560
he actually won some.

305
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,320
So he… and in the end…

306
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,640
Ran…

307
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
Ran…

308
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,360
Online gambling? Seriously?

309
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,560
Your dad made a mistake.

310
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,160
I don't understand.

311
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,400
How could someone
as smart and capable as him

312
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,640
choose to solve things like that?

313
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,680
Ran, listen.

314
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I don't want to make you hate him more.

315
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
But I'm telling you

316
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,200
because I don't know
if he's really quit gambling.

317
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,720
He told me he has.

318
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,800
And I don't want him
to cause any more trouble in your life.

319
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,600
Why did he come back?

320
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,200
He heard from Uncle Nui

321
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,160
that you're getting married.

322
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,440
So he wanted to come to your wedding.

323
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,320
- Are you okay, Dao?
- Of course.

324
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
The final shot is finally done.

325
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,440
Others got vax marks on their arms,

326
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,600
I got chemo lines.

327
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,520
Isn't it cool?

328
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,760
You did great.

329
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,320
Do you wanna grab snacks
from downstairs again?

330
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,720
Last time was pretty good.

331
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
What kind do you want?

332
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,640
This one? One or two pieces?

333
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,200
- One strawberry, please.
- Sure.

334
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,160
And two chocolate ones, please.

335
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,120
Got it.

336
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,600
And two brownies.

337
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,600
Sure.

338
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,840
Anything else?

339
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,120
No, that's all.

340
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,040
- One moment.
- Sure.

341
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,560
Anything else?

342
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,760
- How much?
- It's 650 baht.

343
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,600
Excuse me.

344
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,400
Are you Nubdao?

345
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,679
Yes.

346
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,040
I really love your Mr. Stone Face!

347
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,080
I brought it too!

348
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,600
Can we take a photo, please?

349
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,800
- Please.
- Of course.

350
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,159
- I'll take a lot. One, two, three!
- Again! One, two, three! So pretty!

351
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,320
- My turn!
- My turn!

352
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
- Let me take one first!
- Me first.

353
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,760
- Me first.
- How about one group photo instead?

354
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,920
- Sure!
- Sure!

355
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,040
- Sorry to trouble you.
- No worries.

356
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,240
Okay.

357
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,400
Three, two, one.

358
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,640
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you!

359
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,280
I'll wait for your new collection.

360
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,800
- Alright.
- Thank you.

361
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,920
How do I look in the photo?

362
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,800
- If you're tired, you can say no.
- It's fine.

363
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,160
It feels good.
It feels like I still matter to people.

364
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,360
Dao hasn't come down yet.
She must still be sleeping.

365
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,560
She was throwing up all night.
Probably needs to rest all day.

366
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,480
Please look after her. Once I'm done
with work, I'll come right over.

367
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,200
I thought you had meetings
with Mira until evening?

368
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,680
She rescheduled.

369
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,320
She even told me to go home.

370
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,080
- Dao!
- Mom!

371
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,800
<i>- Ran!</i>
- What happened to Dao?

372
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,440
She fell down the stairs. I gotta go.

373
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,400
Dao.

374
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,520
Are you okay, Dao? Dao?

375
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,720
Pueng! Pueng!

376
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
Pueng, Dao fell down the stairs!

377
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,280
Pueng!

378
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Pueng!

379
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,320
Pueng!

380
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,960
Pueng!

381
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,200
Help!

382
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,640
Help!

383
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,840
Help!

384
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,240
Security!

385
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,560
Security!

386
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,440
Security!

387
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,840
Mon, what happened?

388
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,640
Sak, Dao fell down the stairs. Help me.

389
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Hurry up.

390
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,840
How is she, Mom?

391
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,720
We're heading to the hospital.
Your dad showed up to help.

392
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,480
Where is Ms. Nubdao Paitho?

393
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,200
Bed three, Sir.

394
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,280
Oh, Mr. Paran.

395
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

396
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,040
How is Dao?

397
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,480
We've done the X-ray.
There's nothing concerning.

398
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,120
She's just weak from the chemo.

399
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,240
Still, I'd like to keep her
overnight for observation.

400
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,080
Alright.

401
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,640
Don't worry, Mr. Paran.

402
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,840
Thank you very much.

403
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,960
A nurse will bring her
to the recovery room soon.

404
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,560
Excuse me.

405
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,360
- Thank you so much.
- Goodbye.

406
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,960
Goodbye.

407
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,920
Come on.

408
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
And…

409
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
Where is he now?

410
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,920
I asked him to leave.

411
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,200
Or do you want to see him?

412
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,800
I'll check on Dao's room.

413
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,440
Dao's awake.

414
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,040
She's okay now.

415
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,120
Please handle work today.
I won't be coming in.

416
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,520
Got it. I'll tell her.

417
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,560
Kae and everyone send their well wishes.

418
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,640
The day I had my final chemo,

419
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,960
you saw your Dad, didn't you?

420
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,560
I saw him staring at you for a while,

421
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,560
hoping you'd turn around and speak to him.

422
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,200
Don't think about anything now.

423
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,360
Just rest and get better.

424
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,320
I understand

425
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,680
you're still angry at him.

426
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,160
But if he hadn't been there today,

427
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,800
things might have been worse.

428
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,840
Please forgive him, Ran.

429
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,360
He stole six years of my life, Dao.

430
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,440
And the 20 years he gave before that,

431
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,480
do they mean nothing?

432
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm not mad that he caused debt.

433
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,440
People make mistakes.

434
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,040
But I'm mad that he was selfish.

435
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,240
He chose to run away
instead of staying to face it with us.

436
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,760
I still remember

437
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,640
how devastated Mom was

438
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,960
the day he disappeared.

439
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,960
And in the end,

440
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,640
it was Mom and me

441
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,040
who had to clean up the mess he made.

442
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
But today, you've made it.

443
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,920
The day I found out
that my Dad had someone else,

444
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,560
Mom told me

445
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,640
there are still good things about him

446
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,400
worth keeping as memories.

447
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,240
No one is perfect.

448
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,400
I hope you can do the same, Ran.

449
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Life is short.
We never know when we'll die.

450
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,440
No, Dao.

451
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,960
Don't say things like that.

452
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,280
It's the truth, Ran.

453
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,640
That's why I want you to forgive your Dad

454
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,360
before it's too late.

455
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,360
But I don't want to be hurt by him again.

456
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,680
Dodge! Throw a punch!

457
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,440
Again.

458
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,840
Same side! Jab!

459
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,800
‪Here.

460
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,320
Your film camera?

461
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,040
You said you wanted it, right?

462
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,960
I'm giving it to you so you can
take pictures at the club building.

463
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,080
One, two, three!

464
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,720
- I've got another medal, Dad.
- Good job!

465
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,800
Hey, I think
I need to buy a new medal cabinet.

466
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,960
- The old one is full already.
- Great job!

467
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,280
Thank you.

468
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,760
Come on, let's take a picture.

469
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,080
- Alright.
- Come on.

470
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,200
One, two, three.

471
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,040
It turns out your ride-hailing feature

472
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,280
is making more money
than the food delivery one.

473
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,960
But this year, be ready to hustle.

474
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,480
I spoke to Mira. We're adding hotel

475
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:00,960
and flight booking features.

476
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,320
It will become a one-stop service.

477
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,280
Dev is currently doing the research.

478
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,480
Once we've finalized everything,

479
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,080
we'll share the summary with the team.

480
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,200
You seniors are so productive,
it makes us look lazy.

481
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,360
Right? I was planning to use lunch break
to find some clothes for Ran's wedding.

482
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,920
No need to nudge. Just go.

483
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,280
Alright, that's it. Meeting dismissed.

484
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,840
- Tle.
- Yes?

485
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,720
Can you grab the stuff from my office?

486
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,000
Oh, sure.

487
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,880
How's Dao doing lately?

488
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,600
It's just a few more days
until the wedding.

489
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,960
Is she okay?

490
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,880
Her body's not at 100%,

491
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,880
but her heart is more than ready.

492
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:02,040
If she could reschedule it
for tomorrow, she would.

493
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,440
Dao must really love you.

494
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,320
Here.

495
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,600
This is our gift, from me and Tle.

496
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,120
Congrats, Ran.

497
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,360
Thank you.

498
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,160
We won't be able to make it
to the wedding day.

499
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,160
But we wish you and Dao so much happiness.

500
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,080
Thanks again, Mira.

501
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,120
And Tle too.

502
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,480
We'll head off then.

503
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,800
- Let's go.
- Alright.

504
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,880
Hey, put it properly!.
Don't let it go crooked.

505
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,120
Alright, kids, step out for a bit.

506
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,520
- I'll take a photo before the guests come.
- Move aside.

507
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,800
Sure, go ahead.

508
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,960
- Let me get one first.
- Of course.

509
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:05,880
Let me take one first.

510
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,200
Please do a mini heart.

511
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,760
- Like this?
- Show her how.

512
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,920
One, two, three. Alright.

513
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,200
- Nice.
- Duen, come here.

514
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,720
- Friends' turn?
- Wait. Hang on! Let Duen go first.

515
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,440
- Oh?
- Yeah.

516
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,320
Hurry up, hurry up.

517
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,880
Easy now.

518
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,360
Two, three.

519
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,240
Give us some love signs too.

520
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,720
Great! Everyone, look at the camera.
One, two--

521
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,200
Mon, wait.

522
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,960
Mon, move Jew this way.

523
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,160
Just the two of us here is better.

524
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,520
Thank you.

525
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,800
Mon, are you waiting for Mr. Sak?

526
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,440
Actually, I wanted to thank him too,

527
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,120
for helping Dao that day.

528
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,880
No need to thank him.
It was just a coincidence.

529
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,640
And no, I'm not waiting for him.

530
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,280
I just don't want him ruining

531
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,000
the happiest day of my son's life.

532
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:41,920
All done, thank you!

533
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

534
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

535
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,320
Shall we get a chair for the photos, Dao?

536
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,200
No. It won't look as good.

537
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,640
You'll look beautiful
whether you're sitting or standing.

538
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,880
- Can I get a chair, please?
- Sure.

539
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,080
- Thank you.
- I'll help.

540
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
Alright.

541
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,440
Please.

542
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,840
Thank you.

543
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,600
You okay?

544
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,720
- You alright?
- Yes.

545
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,680
Okay.

546
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,360
- Ran.
- Nam.

547
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,960
Thanks for coming.

548
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,920
I really admire Dao.

549
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,240
She's completed 12 rounds of chemo.
Are the cancer cells gone?

550
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,720
We still don't know. We'll have to wait
and consult with the doctor.

551
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,560
What if it's not all gone?

552
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,040
Then she'll need another chemo set.

553
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,760
Will she be able to handle that?
The first round was already brutal.

554
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,800
Exactly.

555
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,440
And where the hell did Zen go get water?

556
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,880
He's been gone for ages.

557
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,400
Hey, Ning.

558
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,600
I'll go get water for you.

559
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,720
Just stay here.

560
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,440
Ning. Ning.

561
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,360
Babe, today is Dao's wedding day.

562
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,840
Is it gonna be Zen's funeral day too?

563
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,040
- Don't even try to copy that.
- I won't.

564
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,280
Sorry, June. I forgot to shift to neutral.

565
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,520
- I was in a rush.
- It's okay.

566
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,200
See? I remembered it was your car.

567
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,880
I saw it on Instagram.

568
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:31,240
- Are you back with Ning?
- Yes.

569
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,400
That's impressive.

570
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,840
She finally forgave you.

571
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,240
I just got a new phone.

572
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,080
Can I have your LINE again?

573
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,960
If you need to reach me,

574
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,640
you can message through Ning.

575
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,920
Okay.

576
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,600
Did you come after me?

577
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:47,400
Come on. Let's go in.

578
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,560
I met the groom back
when he first started walking.

579
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,440
There was a little boy
who always ran around the print shop.

580
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,920
And when he got to middle school,

581
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,920
he brought a little girl, his friend,
to run around with him.

582
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,760
I'm truly happy to see
that boy and girl, once childhood friends,

583
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,480
grow up and care for each other now.

584
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,560
I'm confident
they will take care of one another well.

585
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,120
- Right, Ran?
- Yes.

586
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:41,160
Why are you here?

587
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,640
I told you, didn't I?

588
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,600
Don't make our child suffer again.

589
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,320
I just wanted to see him.

590
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,080
I promise I won't get in the way.

591
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,360
You've seen him now. You can go.

592
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,960
Thank you

593
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,320
for helping Dao that day.

594
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,600
Ran probably wants to thank you too.

595
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,880
But that alone

596
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,320
doesn't make up for what you did to us.

597
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,240
I know.

598
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,440
If you want to watch, watch from here.

599
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,840
Just don't let him see you.

600
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:27,600
Let's raise a toast
to the bride and groom!

601
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,480
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

602
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,400
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

603
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

604
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,760
Thank you to Mr. Nui, Patipak Iam-in,

605
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,480
former editor of <i>Add-On</i> magazine.

606
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,480
And now, let's hear a few words
from the bride and groom.

607
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,320
Let's begin with

608
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,920
the bride.

609
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,880
Thank you all

610
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,440
for making our wedding
so warm and full of love.

611
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,360
Thank you to my mom,

612
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,840
Duen, Jew,

613
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,560
Ran's Mom,

614
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:16,040
and I believe my grandma
is smiling down on me today, too.

615
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,520
She was our first true fan.

616
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,760
But the one I want to thank most

617
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,480
is Ran.

618
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:37,640
Ran has always been
my inspiration, my driving force,

619
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,960
and the one who always believed in me.

620
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,520
Many of you already know,

621
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,920
this Mr. Stone Face you all admire

622
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,200
comes from Ran.

623
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,520
Do they look alike?

624
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,200
- Oh.
- Yes.

625
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,920
On my toughest days,

626
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,880
just turning to look at Ran,

627
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,800
even with that blank face,

628
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,880
he always made my heart feel lighter.

629
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,640
Ran is my secret edition
of Mr. Stone Face.

630
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,800
Thank you.

631
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,240
Now that we've heard from the bride,

632
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,880
let's hear from the groom.

633
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,960
Thank you, everyone.

634
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,640
Dao and I missed each other many times.

635
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,320
Kae once joked

636
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,880
that maybe my guardian angel
didn't want us together.

637
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,520
Without Dao,

638
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,720
I got by,

639
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:07,400
but it was harder.

640
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,480
With her, it's better.

641
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,440
Dao is my friend,

642
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,680
my girlfriend,

643
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,440
and soon, my life partner.

644
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,880
Whether it's joy or sorrow,

645
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,120
even if the guardian angels disapprove,

646
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,240
I promise, we'll always have each other.

647
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,600
And now,

648
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:47,920
the moment you've all been waiting for…

649
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,920
- Kiss! Kiss!
- Kiss! Kiss!

650
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,240
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

651
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:03,200
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

652
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,400
This couple right here
is sweeter than the cake in front of them.

653
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,120
Next up,
the bride and groom will now cut the cake!

654
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:16,960
Wait.

655
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,000
Just one more moment.

656
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,360
There's someone else

657
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,400
I want up here with me today.

658
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,840
Dad.

659
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,840
Please give your blessing to me and Dao.

660
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:06,800
Thank you all

661
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,760
for loving and supporting my son.

662
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,840
He's far more capable than I was.

663
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,240
When he was little,

664
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,120
he once told me
he didn't want to work at my company.

665
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,960
He feared people would say
he got the job because of me.

666
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,160
But he's proved himself.

667
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:33,400
He's where he is today

668
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,520
because of who he is.

669
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,400
I'm proud of you.

670
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,000
I wish you and Dao

671
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,600
a life filled with love and care.

672
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,840
Hold each other's hand tight.

673
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,320
You'll get through anything.

674
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,480
I love you.

675
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,320
I'm sorry, Ran.

676
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,440
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, Dad.

677
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:29,280
Get ready to catch
the bouquet from the couple!

678
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,280
Let's make some noise!

679
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,920
On the count of one, two, three!

680
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,360
Zen!

681
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:13,520
Ran, this exhibition means a lot to me.

682
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,920
Dao!

683
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,720
- Dao.
- I know you've got the heart of a fighter.

684
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:30,080
But if your body can't keep up,

685
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,920
willpower alone won't get you through.

686
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,080
