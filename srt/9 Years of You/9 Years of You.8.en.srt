1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:12,680
11 MONTHS LATER

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,800
I just got home.

3
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,160
I'll tell you the details tomorrow,

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,000
but the outlook is really good.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,640
They really liked our work.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,640
that's it for now.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,560
2023

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,680
- Oh, Ran, you're back?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,120
Where's Dao, Mom?

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,920
She's been in the studio since morning.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,400
I brought her lunch
but don't know if she's eaten yet.

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
Dao?

13
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,400
Dao.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,600
Dao.

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Dao, are you okay?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,280
I probably just got tired and dozed off.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Dozed off? Or passed out?

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,440
You've been pulling all-nighters for days.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm really fine.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,840
I think I just bumped my hand
while sleeping.

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,520
Dao,

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,960
can you stop acting like
you're completely cured of cancer?

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,960
It's been nearly a year, Ran.
I feel normal now.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,680
This is your idea of normal?

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,480
It was just an accident.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Did you forget

27
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,240
what the doctor said?

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Now that the surgery's done,

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,520
and you've completed
all 12 rounds of chemo,

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
we can say the treatment is complete.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,200
- Does that mean I'm cured?
- For now, yes.

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,360
But it's not definitive.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,240
There are cases
where the cancer spreads elsewhere.

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,240
One year from now,

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,160
you'll need a PET scan to monitor things.

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
And in the meantime,
you need to take care of yourself,

37
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,720
eat well, rest enough,

38
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
and don't overwork.

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,800
All of which you're ignoring.

40
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,600
Ran.

41
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
The poster for the festival came out.

42
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,160
Isn't it pretty?

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,960
Changing the subject, huh?

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,320
Can't I just say sorry?

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
Instead of being sorry,
take care of yourself.

46
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,240
Eat lunch, too.

47
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Doctor,

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,960
there's something I want to discuss.

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
See? That's all it takes.

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
We can clean it ourselves,
no need to hire anyone.

51
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,280
You're awesome, Bro.

52
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,160
So I guess you clean all of them.

53
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,160
Hey, who's the boss
and who's the employee again?

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,360
Come on, go clean the others.

55
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,960
- Take the ladder too.
- Got it.

56
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,120
Here's the screwdriver.

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,800
- You're amazing, Bro.
- Go on, go.

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,520
I don't even know what to say anymore.

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,880
Dao's so stubborn.

60
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,520
We booked a place for our anniversary,

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,400
but I don't even know
if she'll clear her schedule.

62
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,720
Even on her birthday,

63
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,040
I had to bring the cake to her computer.

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,440
Don't stress out.

65
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,560
You can't plan life too much.

66
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Take me for example.

67
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,440
I planned to save money with Ning first,
then get married.

68
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,680
Next thing I know, I'm buying
a breast pump. We didn't even get married.

69
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,440
Why did it take this long

70
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,560
to meet a client?

71
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,480
Chill, babe.

72
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,320
I stopped to get
your favorite chiffon cake.

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,200
Alright.

74
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,120
Ran, that maternity pillow you bought me,

75
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,760
I used it last night. So comfy!

76
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,000
Really?

77
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,120
You and Dao should get on it too.

78
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,320
Our kids can be friends.

79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
How could they?

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,360
The doctor said
Dao needs a PET scan after a year.

81
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,360
If she's pregnant, she can't do that.

82
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,640
I know that! But it's almost
a year, right? I'm not dumb.

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,960
So when's she getting the scan?

84
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,880
The day after our anniversary.

85
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,160
If it shows the cancer hasn't come back,

86
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
you two better get on it.

87
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Hey, Max!

88
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Come back, let's talk, Max.

89
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,800
- Let me go, I don't want to talk!
- What's going on?

90
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
It's Dad.

91
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,440
He criticized Max's content.
They had a bit of a disagreement.

92
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,000
It wasn't just a bit of a disagreement.

93
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,760
He trashed my work.
He said I make garbage content.

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,320
I just want you
to have more social responsibility.

95
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
Even if it's just an online show,

96
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
relying on cheap drama

97
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,720
won't last.

98
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,520
I make content for people my age.

99
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,800
But if I have to follow
everything you say,

100
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,760
then it's not my work anymore.

101
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,640
- I quit.
- Max!

102
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,640
Let's talk first, Max.

103
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,200
Don't go, Max.

104
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,680
Didn't I tell you

105
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,320
to listen to the younger ones, Dad?

106
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,840
You've been a consultant for three months,

107
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,760
and two juniors have already quit.

108
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,920
But what they were doing
just didn't work, Ran.

109
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
They call it black comedy,

110
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
but it's meaningless nonsense.

111
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,320
Audiences are diverse now, Dad.

112
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
Max said from the start

113
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,680
that his content was purely for fun.

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,240
That's the problem.

115
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,840
That's why there's no good content.

116
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,600
It's not like that, Dad.

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,760
Our Better Together channel

118
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,400
aims for variety.

119
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,160
If it's informative content,
that's my doctor show.

120
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,040
If it's for fun,

121
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,160
that's Max and Kae's stuff.

122
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,080
If you can't understand the younger ones,

123
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,120
maybe it's best
you stop coming to the office.

124
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,600
If we need anything,

125
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,360
I will come consult at home instead.

126
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,800
So you're firing me now?

127
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,640
Fine.

128
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,400
Did it really have to come to this?

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,520
I should have done it a long time ago.

130
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,920
I kept quiet

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,240
because you were
the one who brought him in.

132
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,280
So it's my fault now for inviting him?

133
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,000
Dao.

134
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,160
Did you see this?

135
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,520
The collab between
Mr. Stone Face and C-Fresh.

136
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,440
Mr. Chanon says
it's getting great traction.

137
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,920
They're considering more product tie-ins,

138
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,520
so I already said yes.

139
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,040
I reserved a table for our anniversary.

140
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,400
7 p.m. But…

141
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,400
Don't drink too much wine that night.

142
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,240
You've got your PET scan the next morning.

143
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,800
Is something wrong?

144
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,920
I just rescheduled my appointment.

145
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,920
Why would you do that?

146
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,840
Dao?

147
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,920
It's just the week
we're prepping for the exhibition.

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,760
- I'll be busy.
- No matter how busy, you have to go.

149
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,960
We've waited the whole year, Dao.

150
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Don't you want to know
if you're fully cured?

151
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,320
Ran,

152
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,040
this exhibition means a lot to me.

153
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,800
Only four artists were invited.

154
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,480
Each of them
has been working for a decade.

155
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,800
I haven't even been
doing this for five years.

156
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,560
I want to give it my all.

157
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,560
So your work
matters more than your health?

158
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,240
It's not like that.

159
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,760
Right after the exhibition ends,
I'll go see the doctor.

160
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,240
- I've already made an appointment.
- When?

161
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,280
Soon.

162
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,120
So that means you haven't.

163
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,200
This is Girl Generation's
first big concert here, okay?

164
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,040
You expect a Sone like me to miss it?

165
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,520
But you've got a 38-degree fever.

166
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,680
Do you know I had to wake up
at 5 a.m. to get that ticket?

167
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,080
How can I not go?

168
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,480
They'll come again.
You can see them next time.

169
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,080
But next time won't be
their first time in Thailand!

170
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
What if you collapse
and die at the concert?

171
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
Then at least I'll die happy.

172
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,640
Dao already left?

173
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Yes. She made breakfast for you too.

174
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
Thanks.

175
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,720
Would you like something to drink?

176
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,720
- No, I've got it.
- Okay.

177
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
DON'T FORGET TO PICK UP THE STUFF

178
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,520
FROM MOM'S HOUSE, DAO.

179
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,520
Ran.

180
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,080
- How are you?
- I'm good.

181
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,320
You've really kept all of Dao's old work?

182
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,440
You used to complain
when she drew cartoons all the time.

183
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,640
I thought you threw them out.

184
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,960
Did I look that heartless?

185
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,520
Sorry.

186
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,640
Honestly,

187
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,360
I was going to throw them out many times.

188
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,840
But seeing how much effort
Dao put into it, I just couldn't do it.

189
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,760
Take a look and see
which ones you can still use.

190
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,320
Sure.

191
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Mom,

192
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,520
the herbs you asked me to get.

193
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,840
Here. These are for Dao.

194
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,560
They're for strengthening the uterus.

195
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,800
After the PET scan,
they'll help her conceive more easily.

196
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,640
Thank you.

197
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,120
Ran, is everything okay?
Did you and Dao fight again?

198
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,200
Same issue, Mom.

199
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,720
She's been working even harder
than usual for this exhibition.

200
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,480
Some nights
she falls asleep in the studio.

201
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,040
Now she's even postponed her scan.

202
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,400
Doesn't she want to know
if she's cancer-free?

203
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,840
And when will I get to hold my grandchild?

204
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,200
But honestly,
she's always worked this hard

205
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,040
partly because of me.

206
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,600
I've compared Dao to Duen her whole life.

207
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,320
She grew up feeling like
she had something to prove.

208
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,839
But now that she's come this far,

209
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,760
I don't know why she still feels
like she has to prove anything.

210
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,200
But it's her dream, right?

211
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,240
And now that her dream is coming true,

212
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,000
I think
she just wants to give it her all first.

213
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
Ran, you're back?

214
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
- Yes.
- I've got some good news.

215
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,600
Come on, sit down.

216
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,440
Do you remember Uncle Kitja?

217
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,240
The owner of the Kitja Group hotel chain?

218
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,360
Yeah.

219
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,360
He sees great potential in your company,

220
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,640
your online shows, your ad work,

221
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,400
it's all doing great.

222
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,920
So,

223
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,920
he's interested in acquiring your company.

224
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,360
You mean buying Better Together?

225
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,640
Yes.

226
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,120
I did a rough valuation.

227
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
Your profits

228
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,520
have been growing
an average of 20% annually.

229
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
At a PE ratio of 12,

230
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,600
your company's worth 120 million baht.

231
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
But Kitja

232
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,880
is offering a PE of 13,

233
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,320
that's 130 million.

234
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
You should sell.

235
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
You were away the last few days

236
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,440
because you went to meet Kitja?

237
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,040
He asked me to go.

238
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,520
He really loves your company, Ran.

239
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,640
Ran,

240
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,360
130 million baht is pure profit.

241
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,240
Alright.

242
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,280
Let me arrange a signing meeting with him.

243
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,360
You haven't learned your lesson
with this guy, Dad?

244
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,040
But he has money.

245
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,440
It's 130 million baht.

246
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Just think, how many more years
would you and your friends have to work

247
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,320
to make that kind of money?

248
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm not handing over the company I built
to someone like him.

249
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,520
Dear,

250
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,960
please stop interfering with his company.

251
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,440
- I just want to help.
- No need.

252
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,920
Remember when I told you

253
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,120
he's more capable than you are?

254
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,280
Did you forget

255
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,200
that I repaid
all your debts within five years?

256
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,480
I believe that if he runs into a problem,

257
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,480
he'll solve it better than you could.

258
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,920
And he doesn't need Kitja for that.

259
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,280
So I screw up once,

260
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,200
and I'm suddenly the failure now?

261
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,320
Ran,

262
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,360
I just don't want you to end up like me.

263
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,120
When I ran the magazine,

264
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,960
I thought it would keep going strong.

265
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,240
Then

266
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,840
disruption hit,

267
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,040
and I couldn't respond fast enough.

268
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,240
And you think your work

269
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,040
won't be disrupted too?

270
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,880
Thanks for worrying,

271
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,720
but I already have a plan.

272
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
What plan?

273
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,240
I'm still in the middle of it.

274
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,800
It's not final yet.

275
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,840
Dad!

276
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,920
What you went through

277
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,720
taught me plenty.

278
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,960
And if I ever run into trouble,

279
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,240
I'll face it head-on.

280
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,320
Just like you taught me.

281
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
Not like what you did.

282
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,920
Say what you want.

283
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,480
Don't hold back just because he's my dad.

284
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,600
Okay.

285
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,760
I think your dad's out of line.

286
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,160
Our company isn't his <i>Add-On Magazine.</i>

287
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,600
He can't just do whatever he wants.

288
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,840
Right. And wasn't that Kitja the one
who got your dad into online gambling?

289
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,680
And he totally disrespected us,

290
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,800
offering only 13x PE?

291
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,400
Why didn't you just tell your dad
what you're planning?

292
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,320
Because if I tell him now and it fails,

293
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
he'll think he was right all along.

294
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,560
I want to wait until it's solid.

295
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,920
Your dad's stubborn. Your wife's stubborn.

296
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,440
You must be having a rough time.

297
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,680
Let's go make merit.
maybe things will turn around.

298
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,920
Seriously,

299
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,840
you two never have any issues at all?

300
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,760
I say one word,
and the whole family is peaceful.

301
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,880
Yes.

302
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,520
What word?

303
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,760
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

304
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,880
Try remembering that and use it.

305
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,760
Trust me, that word is magical.

306
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
Try it if you don't believe me.

307
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,280
Oh my.

308
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,320
Why would you put the veggies
on top of the eggs?

309
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,720
Ugh, this is chaos.

310
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,080
And who cuts avocados like that?

311
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,480
Just leave it.

312
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,720
I was just trying to help.

313
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,280
The more you help, the slower it gets.

314
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,160
It's fine. Here, let me make a new one.

315
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,160
No.

316
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Don't.

317
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,920
You've got heavy hands.
The more you touch, the messier it gets.

318
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,120
I'll do it myself.

319
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
Then,

320
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,400
I'll help pour the orange juice.

321
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,400
I said you don't need to do anything.

322
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,520
I've got this.

323
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,120
See?

324
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
The more you help, the messier it gets.

325
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,120
Just go sit down, please.

326
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,680
So everything I do is wrong?

327
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,840
You want me to just sit around all day
like someone who's completely useless?

328
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Yes.

329
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,640
I already called the technician.

330
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,320
Right now?

331
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,040
But I've got dinner plans.

332
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,920
Fine, I'll swing by quickly.

333
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,040
- Where's Mr. Ran?
- Over there.

334
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
Sorry, Ran.

335
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,040
The exhibition team called.
I had to go talk to the technician.

336
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,280
I only talked for ten minutes, though.

337
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,760
Traffic was bad.

338
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,400
Would you prefer red or white wine?

339
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,920
Just water, thanks.

340
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,440
- You may serve it.
- Yes, Sir.

341
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,760
Happy anniversary.

342
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,000
Thanks, Ran.

343
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,640
I saw you
looking it up online all the time.

344
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,280
Did you see it?

345
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,800
I don't just work all the time, you know.

346
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Thank you.

347
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,320
Before I left home,

348
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,920
Dad and Mom were arguing again.

349
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,920
I feel bad for Dad.

350
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,920
He hasn't been involved
in the company much lately.

351
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,680
- He must be bored.
- Don't go there, Dao.

352
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,720
I know.

353
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,760
I didn't expect him to

354
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,080
want to sell the company either.

355
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,480
Here's our appetizer tonight,
Trio of the Sea,

356
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,640
featuring shrimp, scallop, and sea bass,

357
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,000
served with a honey lemon sauce.

358
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,000
Please enjoy.

359
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,040
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

360
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,400
Why just water tonight?

361
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,720
I've been tired lately.
I didn't feel like drinking.

362
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,600
Let's eat.

363
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,800
Have you rebooked your PET scan yet?

364
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,280
Not yet.

365
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,200
Then when will you?

366
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,280
If you don't, I will.

367
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,840
Ran, wait.

368
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,840
- I'll do it myself.
- When?

369
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,760
After the exhibition ends.

370
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,480
So you'll wait a whole week?

371
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,840
It's just a week.

372
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,200
Dao.

373
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,680
Hello?

374
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,160
No, not that one.

375
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,440
Yes, I think having them
placed next to each other looks better.

376
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,560
Dao.

377
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,280
Stop talking on the phone.

378
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,320
Okay. I gotta go.

379
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,360
This is not the time to work.

380
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
Now you're coughing

381
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,560
and still refusing to get checked up?

382
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,160
- I just choked on water. Don't overreact.
- Dao.

383
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,320
I know you've got the heart of a fighter.

384
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,800
But if your body can't keep up,

385
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,600
willpower alone won't get you through.

386
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,360
Go get it checked.

387
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,920
So we can have a baby.

388
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,040
Let's go back inside.

389
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,520
Can you stop already?

390
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,040
You've had this
running-away-from-problems thing

391
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,960
since we were kids and never fixed it.

392
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,160
Yes, I run from problems.
I'm scared, I'm a loser, I'm selfish.

393
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,640
I always think of myself first.

394
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
That's just how I am. Alright?

395
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,560
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.

396
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,680
Shall we take a photo?

397
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,840
Sure.

398
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,080
Here, let me help.

399
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,280
I'll turn it a bit this way.

400
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,720
Right here.

401
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,240
Ready? One, two, three.

402
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,680
How about a smile?

403
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,000
Smile a little bit.

404
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,120
Alright.

405
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,640
Big smiles, one, two.

406
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're now at the exhibition of Nubdao,

407
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,360
a Thai artist and
creator of the iconic Mr. Stone Face.

408
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,480
Over the past few years,

409
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,200
her work has been
a source of healing for many.

410
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,360
And today, Ms. Nubdao

411
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,560
will unveil the world's only

412
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,160
giant version of Mr. Stone Face,

413
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,960
now available for auction.

414
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,560
And this

415
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,680
is the one and only giant Mr. Stone Face

416
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,560
ready for bidding.

417
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
Now let's take a look

418
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,760
at the full atmosphere
of the event together.

419
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,080
Let's go.

420
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,040
I knew my friend was popular,

421
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,000
but I didn't know you were this popular.

422
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,120
Traffic out front was crazy.
It took forever to find parking.

423
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,040
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

424
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

425
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,560
Hey, Dao, if you've got time,

426
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,760
can you sign this for me?

427
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,160
Are you gonna flip it for profit again?

428
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,800
Even your friends aren't safe, huh?

429
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,360
Hey, in this economy,

430
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,800
you can't be picky
if you don't want to go broke.

431
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
- Alright, I'll sign it.
- Okay.

432
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,640
Where's Ran?

433
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,640
He went to pick up Mom and Duen.

434
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,840
HAVING A STONE FACE
DOESN'T MEAN FEELING NOTHING

435
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,240
I think this one's great.

436
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,680
Look how she painted the colors.

437
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,240
- So detailed.
- Those lines are so sharp.

438
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,000
And the cat's hair,

439
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,760
each stroke so intricate,
like etched patterns.

440
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,200
You can tell right away
whose work this is.

441
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,600
Look. This is cute.

442
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,560
That bird is adorable.

443
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,720
- So is that one.
- Hello.

444
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,640
- Hi there!
- How'd you get here?

445
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,080
The drama crew cancelled,
so I was able to come.

446
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,160
Whoa, this one is so cute.

447
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,360
Prang and Pao would love it.

448
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,560
Dao.

449
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,719
- Mom.
- Dao.

450
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,040
Here.

451
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,480
Congratulations, Sweetie.

452
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,960
Wow, I never imagined
your exhibition would be this big.

453
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,199
You really are the best.

454
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,440
You've earned the title of
Mom's favorite child.

455
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,320
She kept asking over and over

456
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,800
what to wear to your event.

457
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,800
You'd look great in anything, Mom.

458
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,280
Just the fact that you came
makes me happy.

459
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,800
Dao,

460
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,679
you don't need to prove anything anymore.

461
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,960
I've always known that my daughter

462
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,880
is the best.

463
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,840
From now on,
just take care of your health,

464
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,960
so you can be with me for a long time.

465
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,280
- Okay
- Congratulations, Dao.

466
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,000
Thank you, Jew.

467
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,360
Dao,

468
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
try working a bit less.

469
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
I feel bad for Ran.

470
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,520
Teacher Parn!

471
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

472
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,560
- Hello, hello.
- I'm so glad you came.

473
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,400
Congratulations, Nubdao.

474
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,160
Thank you so much.

475
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,920
Mom, this is Teacher Parn.

476
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

477
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,240
My work turned out so well
because I got a lot of guidance from him.

478
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,080
I'm actually a fan of your work too.

479
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,840
Too bad I didn't bring
anything for you to sign today.

480
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,480
Thank you for liking it.

481
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,640
- Thank you for taking care of my daughter.
- My pleasure. I'm really glad.

482
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,560
Teacher,

483
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,720
this is Ran.

484
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,480
- My husband.
- Oh.

485
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
- Hello.
- Hello.

486
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,040
So you're the real Mr. Stone Face, right?

487
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,160
Yes.

488
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,840
Po,

489
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,720
it looks amazing in person.

490
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,520
Look at the details in the hair.
It's like it stepped out of a painting.

491
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,920
Do you know

492
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,720
this large version of Mr. Stone Face

493
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,000
- is the only one in the world.
- Seriously?

494
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,480
Yes. I wonder who's going to win it today.

495
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,120
Right.

496
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,480
- Oh my.
- What should we do?

497
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,480
Gorgeous.

498
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,040
- I want it.
- I want it.

499
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,680
We just got great news today.

500
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,800
Mr. Chanon confirmed
he'll invest in Better Together.

501
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,160
- Yes!
- Great!

502
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,280
Cheers!

503
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,560
That's amazing, Ran.

504
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,920
With a PE ratio of 18,

505
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,080
our company's valuation is 180 million.

506
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,680
Of the three offers,

507
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,000
this one is the best.

508
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
They'll invest 49%,

509
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,480
around 88 million baht.

510
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,280
Half the money
will go to expanding the company,

511
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,320
the other half
will be distributed among shareholders.

512
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,120
And they won't interfere in management.

513
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,920
We'll still run the company ourselves.

514
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,280
- Honey.
- Yes?

515
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,720
Now we'll have the money
to renovate the hotel for you.

516
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,680
- Are you happy?
- Very.

517
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,480
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

518
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,000
My little baby,
you don't need to live in a condo anymore.

519
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,160
I'll use the money to buy a house,

520
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,840
so you can have space to run around.

521
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,360
How about we go
reserve the house tomorrow?

522
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,720
Ran,

523
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,920
Mr. Chanon has arrived.

524
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,240
- Hello, Mr. Chanon.
- Hello, Mr. Ran.

525
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,280
These are my friends,
partners in Better Together.

526
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,800
Kae.

527
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,080
- Mew.
- Hello.

528
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,280
- Zen.
- Hello.

529
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,640
- Ning.
- Hello.

530
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,640
Nice to meet you.

531
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,240
Looks like we'll be partners soon.

532
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,040
Looking forward to it.

533
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,680
Ran just told us the good news.

534
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,640
We promise we won't let you down.

535
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Better Together
is going to be bigger than ever.

536
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,960
Dao.

537
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,400
Oh, Mr. Chanon.

538
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,480
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Nubdao.

539
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,760
- That's him.
- Dear.

540
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,600
That's Mr. Chanon,

541
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,560
eldest son of Chairman Surachai.

542
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,840
Yes.

543
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,760
He's the one whose brand collaborated
with Dao's cartoon series.

544
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,400
Ran was the one who made that deal happen.

545
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,240
With the way they toasted just now,

546
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,840
looks like more projects are coming.

547
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,800
I told you he's talented.

548
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,280
Mom, Dad,

549
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
come here with me.

550
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,320
- Mr. Chanon.
- Yes?

551
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
These are my parents.

552
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

553
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,240
This is Mr. Chanon from SC Corporation.

554
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,280
He's investing in Better Together.

555
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,000
Just so you know,

556
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm a big fan of <i>Add-On.</i>

557
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
I've bought every volume.

558
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,920
Now I get why Ran is so capable.

559
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,120
He takes after his amazing dad.

560
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,480
Thank you.

561
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,800
Now, we have a bid from Mr. Chanon.

562
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
Four million
and eight hundred thousand baht.

563
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,000
Four million and eight hundred thousand.
Anyone higher than that?

564
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,960
Five million, anyone? Five million baht?

565
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,800
Do we have five million?

566
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
Anyone for five million baht?

567
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,920
Five million baht?

568
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,680
Anyone higher for five million?

569
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,080
Anyone…

570
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,800
We now have a bid from Mr. Thakolkiet.

571
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,680
Five million baht from Mr. Thakolkiet.

572
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,120
Anyone higher than five million?

573
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,960
More than five million?

574
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,440
Anyone?

575
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,440
If not, I'll begin counting.

576
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,240
Five million from Mr. Thakolkiet.

577
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,560
Do I hear more?

578
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,280
Five million going once.

579
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,840
Five million going twice. Five million…

580
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,440
Here we are.

581
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,120
Mr. Pongsathorn.

582
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,160
Five million and five hundred thousand.

583
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,800
Mr. Phongsathorn raises it to 5.5 million.

584
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,400
Five million and five hundred thousand?

585
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,840
Anyone higher than 5.5?

586
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,280
More than 5.5 million?

587
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,960
Anyone?

588
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,560
If not, I'll start counting again.

589
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,840
Mr. Pongsathorn.

590
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,880
Five million and five hundred thousand,
going once.

591
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,560
Five million and five hundred thousand,
going once.

592
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,920
Anyone else?

593
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
Five million and five hundred thousand,

594
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:12,880
going…

595
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,080
twice. Anyone?

596
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,000
Five million and five hundred thousand.

597
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,560
Five million and five hundred thousand

598
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,560
going three times.

599
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,320
Thank you!

600
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,640
Mr. Stone Face model,

601
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,840
standing 50 cm tall,
a one-of-a-kind in the world,

602
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,480
has just been sold

603
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,400
for 5.5 million baht.

604
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:42,640
And the winning bidder is
Mr. Pongsathorn Thamwattana

605
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,840
of JP Toys!
Please come up to the stage for a photo.

606
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,000
- Mr. Pongsathorn, right this way, please.
- Congratulations.

607
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,200
And let's welcome the artist as well.
Ms. Nubdao, please join us on stage.

608
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,200
Photographers, this way please.
Photographers.

609
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,240
- Thank you.
- Over here.

610
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,840
- Yes, thank you.
- Center stage, please.

611
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,480
In the center.

612
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,760
The proceeds from today's auction

613
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,920
will be donated to
the Cancer Research Foundation.

614
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,080
A good cause for all.

615
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,440
Everyone here is a giver today.

616
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,680
Now let's hear from the artist herself,
Ms. Nubdao, anything you'd like to say?

617
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,840
- Please take good care of Mr. Stone Face.
- Of course, I'd be happy to.

618
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,040
Having a stone face

619
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,920
doesn't mean feeling nothing.

620
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,520
That's my girl.

621
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,640
Dao.

622
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,880
- Dao.
- Dao.

623
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,320
Dao.

624
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,720
CHAKRAWECH HOSPITAL

625
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,320
Ms. Dao's coughing and nosebleed

626
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,480
are caused by a nasal infection.

627
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
Also,

628
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,200
you haven't been getting enough rest.

629
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,280
Does this have anything to do with cancer?

630
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,720
I don't think so.

631
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,000
Most likely due to PM2.5 dust particles.

632
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,240
December

633
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,880
tends to have high pollution.

634
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,400
However,

635
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,640
we currently can't do a PET scan.

636
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,200
Would you like to tell Mr. Paran yourself?

637
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,840
I believe

638
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,920
he has the right to know now.

639
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,560
I'm two months pregnant.

640
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,880
Congratulations.

641
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,040
How long have you known?

642
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,680
Since last week.

643
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,520
Why didn't you tell me?

644
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,760
I consulted with the doctor and found out
I can't do a PET scan while pregnant.

645
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,240
So I came to ask what I should do.

646
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,760
But you didn't consult me.

647
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
You already had enough problems.

648
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,400
I didn't want to add more stress for you.

649
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,960
Having a baby isn't a problem, Dao.

650
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,640
But you're the one who said
you'd make me lie down and do nothing.

651
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,400
So you didn't tell me

652
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,680
because you were afraid
I wouldn't let you work?

653
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,600
Isn't that a bit much?

654
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,920
It's not like I'd actually
force you to lie still all day.

655
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,640
I planned to tell you
after the exhibition.

656
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,360
And when I saw the doctor,

657
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,960
he told me that even without a PET scan,

658
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,960
there are still other ways
to monitor my condition.

659
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,920
So I thought it was okay.

660
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,880
That's not the issue.

661
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,600
The issue is that you didn't tell me.

662
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,600
You let me worry for days.

663
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,440
Well, now you know.

664
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,600
- So stop nagging already?
- How can I stop?

665
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,680
You know when you nag,
you stress everyone else out too.

666
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,000
You sound like an old man.

667
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,840
Are you trying to be like my dad now

668
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,240
because I said I liked guys like my dad?

669
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,520
Yes.

670
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,360
If you won't take care of yourself,

671
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,040
then I'll be your dad too.

672
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,960
You're acting like my dad, my uncle,
my grandpa, even my great-grandpa now.

673
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,320
We're about to have a baby.

674
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,520
Why are we even arguing?

675
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,320
Who started it?

676
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,520
With a dad this naggy,
I can't imagine how naggy the kid will be.

677
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,720
And with a mom this stubborn,

678
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,120
the kid will be twice as bad.

679
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,920
Dao,

680
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,720
your life doesn't just
belong to you anymore.

681
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,120
If anything happens to you,

682
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,320
how will the people who love you go on?

683
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,040
How will I go on?

684
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,000
But the doctor already said

685
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,760
there are still other options.

686
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,640
The point is,

687
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,320
when we have problems,

688
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,640
we don't solve them alone,

689
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,920
we solve them together.

690
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,680
Don't forget.

691
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,080
Better Together, right?

692
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
Right.

693
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,720
Now we're together as three.

694
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,760
Dad,

695
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,360
we haven't boxed together in forever.

696
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,040
Bring it on.

697
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,200
Ran,

698
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,720
how long have you been
talking to Mr. Chanon?

699
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,920
Well,

700
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,840
since mid-year.

701
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,440
During our peak.

702
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,080
It reminded me of when you made <i>Add-On.</i>

703
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,920
At the time,

704
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,560
was there any sign of what was coming?

705
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,960
None.

706
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,520
Back then,

707
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,120
everything was going great.

708
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,440
Wherever I went,

709
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,680
people had <i>Add-On</i> in their hands.

710
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,440
Whenever I reached out
to someone for a cover feature,

711
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,920
they'd say yes right away.

712
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,360
I was so proud of my success

713
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,240
that I forgot

714
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,800
the world was changing.

715
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,200
By the time I realized it,

716
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,000
the smartphone could do everything.

717
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,920
But I'm glad

718
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,320
you learned from my mistakes

719
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,000
and turned them into something valuable.

720
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,360
You and I

721
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,720
come from different generations.

722
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,440
That's why we think differently.

723
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,360
I think

724
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,160
we just need to find balance,

725
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,120
the right middle ground.

726
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,640
And I wouldn't be able to do any of this

727
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,480
if you hadn't raised me
the way you did, Dad.

728
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,240
I'm sorry, Ran.

729
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,040
I'm sorry too,

730
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,760
for the way I spoke to you.

731
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,520
<i>One year really flew by</i>
<i>didn't it, listeners?</i>

732
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
<i>And now we're at the end of it!</i>

733
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,160
<i>If you're going out to countdown,</i>
<i>DM me and tell me all about it.</i>

734
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,400
<i>But if you're staying in,</i>

735
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,720
<i>you can always chill with me,</i>
<i>DJ Ong, right here on EFM 94.</i>

736
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,640
After dropping this
what did the client say?

737
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,680
Is it good?

738
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,400
Smells amazing in here!

739
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,640
Bacon fried rice.

740
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,440
But don't eat just yet.
There's a lot more coming, just wait.

741
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

742
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

743
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,520
Alright, sure.

744
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,320
Eat up, sweetheart.

745
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,880
We've gotta keep our baby strong.

746
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:42,360
Hey everyone!

747
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,880
Let's raise our glasses to all
the good things waiting for us in 2024!

748
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

749
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,240
This one's for
the two heirs of Better Together.

750
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,000
And this one's for

751
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,160
Better Together.

752
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,880
- A greater one!
- Not yet.

753
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,760
They'll sign the deal after New Year.

754
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,720
It's practically a done deal.

755
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,160
Mr. Chanon's
obsessed with Ran at this point.

756
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,040
Cheers!

757
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,640
- Cheers!
- Everyone.

758
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,000
Don't look so shocked.
Everyone's wearing one.

759
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,320
Alright.

760
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,480
Thank you.

761
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,720
- Thank you, Mom.
- Nice one.

762
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,560
Grapes are ready!
Come have some sweet grapes, everyone.

763
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,760
They're so sweet.

764
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,240
Let's go.

765
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,440
Are you hungry?

766
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,440
This year you don't have to
eat under the table anymore, Babe.

767
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,400
Why were you eating under the table again?

768
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,480
It's a TikTok New Year tradition, Mom.

769
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,280
You eat 12 grapes under the table

770
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,640
from 11:59 to 12:01.

771
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,800
- And your wish will come true.
- Oh really?

772
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,480
I did it last year…

773
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,840
and all I got was this guy.

774
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,840
Should've skipped it, honestly.

775
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,000
Well in that case, I'm doing it this year.

776
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,600
I'll wish for a grandson.

777
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,160
How about a granddaughter, Morn?

778
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,000
A grandson, please.

779
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,200
A granddaughter would be adorable.

780
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,440
- But a boy's more fun to play with.
- You can dress a girl up.

781
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,080
Grandson.

782
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,760
Mom, please, don't fight over it yet.

783
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,560
I'm only three months in.

784
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,120
Wait, where are Ran and Dad?

785
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,440
Why aren't they back yet?

786
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,240
Probably a long queue.

787
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,600
Here it is.

788
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,520
Sorry it's a bit slow.

789
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,760
Sure.

790
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:32,240
LHAO CHAROENROS

791
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,640
Wait a sec, Dad.

792
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,040
So many people ordered ahead.

793
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,880
Why didn't you just use Wiman?

794
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,960
It's New Year's Eve. Lots of customers.

795
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,520
I didn't want to fight for a slot.

796
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,200
Besides, when I was little,

797
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,560
you and I always came

798
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,400
to this roast duck shop on New Year's.

799
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,720
Today…

800
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,080
It seems like old times.

801
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,640
And

802
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,000
while I was away,

803
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,920
did you ever bring Mom here?

804
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,400
Never.

805
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,040
This is the first time I've come back.

806
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,560
Well then,

807
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,320
from now on,

808
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,240
let's come here every year.

809
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,800
And next year,

810
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,840
I'll bring my grandchild with me.

811
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,360
Absolutely, Dad.

812
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,920
It reminds me of when you were a kid.

813
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,000
I used to drive you to school every day.

814
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,520
And Mom would pack you
a rice box to eat in the car.

815
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,880
You'd spill it everywhere!

816
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,880
<i>Hurry back!</i>

817
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,600
Dao said hurry back, Dad.

818
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,360
Tell Dao we'll be home soon.

819
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,280
Sure.

820
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,960
Dad?

821
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,720
Dad.

822
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,360
Dad.

823
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,840
What's wrong?

824
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,160
Dad, Dad!

825
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,400
Dad!

826
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,040
It's sad!

827
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,520
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

828
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,560
I brought you flowers.

829
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,680
Do you like them?

830
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,200
- Parcel for Ms. Nubdao.
- I didn't order anything.

831
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,160
It's from Mr. Paran.

832
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,680
