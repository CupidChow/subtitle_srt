1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,400
FOUR HOURS LATER

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,680
<i>- Let's go.</i>
<i>- Happy New Year!</i>

3
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,120
Happy New Year, Baby.

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,640
Happy New Year, my little one.

5
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,080
Happy New Year, Mew.

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
2024

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,560
It's a new year, Mon.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,160
We'll make it through everything together.

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,800
Eat something first.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,840
You only ate a little earlier.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,720
Mom, let's have some snacks.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,800
It's okay.

13
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,080
Want some drinks?

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,160
Happy New Year.

15
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,960
Are you hungry?

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,440
<i>The other patient was severely hit.</i>

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,920
<i>His ribs were fractured</i>
<i>his lung was punctured his,</i>

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,120
<i>and he has a brain hemorrhage.</i>

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,920
<i>We've performed surgery</i>
<i>to remove the blood,</i>

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,120
<i>but he's suffering from brain swelling.</i>

21
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,920
<i>We'll need to wait</i>
<i>until he regains consciousness</i>

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,920
<i>before we can</i>
<i>evaluate his condition again.</i>

23
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,400
Ran…

24
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,120
Ran, you have to be okay.

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,000
Don't leave me too.

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,600
Don't leave me and the baby.

27
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,960
We're both waiting for you.

28
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,240
I brought you flowers.

29
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
You'll wake up
to something bright and beautiful.

30
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,440
Here.

31
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,440
Do you like them?

32
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,280
That's what you get
for stuffing yourself at a buffet.

33
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,560
You're the one who invited me.

34
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Join me now.

35
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,480
Parcel for Ms. Nubdao.

36
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,600
I didn't order anything.

37
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,240
It's from Mr. Paran.

38
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,560
<i>Your photo with me</i>
<i>is now part of our digital footprint.</i>

39
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,280
I love Ran.

40
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,480
PAITHO FAMILY

41
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,080
My condolences, Mon.

42
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,160
The team from Add-On came too.

43
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,640
Thank you so much. Thank you all.

44
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,880
Let me take you to your seat.

45
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,120
- Hello.
- My condolences.

46
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,640
Thank you.

47
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
The first day is always packed.

48
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
Hang in there, Morn.

49
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
It's alright, Mon.

50
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,240
You're the one
who hasn't eaten all day, right? Come sit.

51
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,840
Fish congee.

52
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,560
It's still warm.

53
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
It's Sak's favorite dish.

54
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,400
We lived together every day,

55
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,280
but I never knew about it.

56
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
I should have taken better care of him.

57
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,640
Mon,

58
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,720
acute heart failure happens suddenly.
No one sees it coming.

59
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,520
Don't blame yourself.

60
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,240
You have to stay strong.

61
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,800
If Ran wakes up

62
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,200
and sees you've fallen apart too,

63
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
he'll be devastated.

64
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Okay?

65
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,440
Now, eat while it's still warm.

66
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,040
Thank you, everyone.

67
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,280
Dao, come sit and rest a bit.

68
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,000
Sit here.

69
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
Thank you.

70
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,400
Be careful.

71
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,280
‪Here.

72
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,520
Thank you, Ning.

73
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,880
You're really strong, Dao.

74
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Mom's hurting like this.

75
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,560
I can't afford to fall apart.

76
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,800
Mr. Chanon
called earlier to ask about Ran.

77
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,360
When I said he's still in a coma,

78
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,320
he said he wanted to talk.

79
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,720
He's coming to the office to see us.

80
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,400
What's he going to talk about?

81
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
I have no idea.

82
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,120
But judging by his tone,

83
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,600
it didn't sound like anything good.

84
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,640
Are you okay, Dao?

85
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,600
Do you want me to stay over with you?

86
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,240
It's alright.

87
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,720
Duen will sleep over tonight.

88
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,160
Okay.

89
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,520
Still awake?

90
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm not sleepy yet, Duen.

91
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
What's that?

92
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,880
A New Year's gift

93
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,760
Ran secretly prepared to surprise me.

94
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,120
It's an eight-piece jigsaw puzzle.

95
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
I'm working on the second one,

96
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
our wedding photo.

97
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,760
But you didn't wear that dress
on your wedding day.

98
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,320
This picture

99
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,360
was from a print ad shoot
I dragged Ran to do at my old office.

100
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,840
Seven years ago, I think.

101
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,000
The day I broke up with Ton.

102
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm not letting you have her.

103
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,800
Let me help.

104
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,360
Let's see…

105
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,320
Where should we start?

106
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,720
- Start from the corner.
- Okay.

107
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,680
I don't know which one.

108
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,360
Who's this?

109
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,720
Is this you, Dao?

110
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,560
That's my face.

111
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,120
- Where's your smile?
- Look at this.

112
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,320
It must be graduation day.

113
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,800
Even though we were delayed a year,
you still didn't graduate, Kae.

114
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,440
Are you trying to
max out the eight-year quota?

115
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,560
- Yeah.
- I really wanted to graduate.

116
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,240
But maybe
the professors missed me so much,

117
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,680
- they wouldn't let me go.
- Whoa.

118
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,960
Dao, where's Ran? Why isn't he here yet?

119
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,520
No idea. If he comes, you'll see.

120
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Hey, Ran! Over here! Hurry!

121
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,640
Sorry.

122
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,000
I worked until daylight last night.

123
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,120
Come on, let's take a photo.

124
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,360
Jack, help me take a photo.

125
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,720
- Sure.
- Come on.

126
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,560
- Alright. One, two.
- Wait.

127
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,680
Dao, come stand here.

128
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,040
- Let's switch places.
- Hey.

129
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,960
Alright.

130
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,079
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

131
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,520
One, two, three, beautiful.

132
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,440
One, two, three,
get closer, those in the back.

133
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,319
One, two, three, change pose.

134
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,800
One, two, three.

135
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,960
The year we graduated

136
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,280
was the year King Rama IX passed away,

137
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,160
so our ceremony got postponed a year.

138
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
At that time, I was fighting with Ran,

139
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,760
so we weren't really talking.

140
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,920
That time,

141
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I had just started dating Ken,

142
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,000
and Ran was starting something with Mira.

143
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,000
- Okay.
- See you.

144
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,320
- What? That's it?
- Huh?

145
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,720
I still haven't found Mom and…

146
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,920
I still haven't found Mom.

147
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,840
I'm going.

148
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,840
Hey, Ran.

149
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,120
What's his deal?

150
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,400
No wonder

151
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,440
Ran never came to our place that year.

152
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,800
Grandma asked for him,
and I didn't know what to say.

153
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,840
I'm not sleepy yet.

154
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,640
Let's open another box.

155
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,000
What do you think the fourth photo is?

156
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,600
The first was from 2016.

157
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Second from 2017.

158
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,040
Third from 2018.

159
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,160
So the fourth should be from 2019.

160
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,800
Maybe it's that one…

161
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,120
Because that year,

162
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,840
we barely saw each other.

163
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,160
I thought you weren't coming.

164
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,120
How could I not?

165
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,360
So you're really going to China?

166
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,560
Do you even know a Chinese word?

167
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,080
Xièxiè.

168
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,800
Is that a swear word?

169
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
That means thank you.

170
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,760
Thanks for coming.

171
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,480
Good luck, Dao.

172
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,920
It's probably hard
for someone like you to live all alone,

173
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,320
but I know you'll get through it.

174
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,520
I'll be cheering your success.

175
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's sing.

176
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,040
The others are cursing you out already.

177
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,480
Let them.

178
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,960
I'm just stopping by quickly.

179
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,480
I gotta get back to Mira.

180
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,200
Alright.

181
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,480
See you.

182
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Wait, Ran.

183
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,640
Let's take a selfie.

184
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
That day, we did the right thing.

185
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,680
We wanted to hug so badly,

186
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,160
but we couldn't.

187
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,080
Because Ran was already married to Mira,

188
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,720
and they were expecting a baby.

189
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,040
I think you're really strong, Dao.

190
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,240
If it were me,

191
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,920
I would have cried my eyes out.

192
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,240
Who said I didn't cry?

193
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,560
After Ran left,

194
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,280
I cried my heart out with Ning.

195
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,680
But at least you got to say goodbye.

196
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,040
Ran's always like that.

197
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,160
He never really leaves me.

198
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,240
He's always cared about my feelings.

199
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,320
And this time, too.

200
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,320
If he hasn't said goodbye,

201
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,320
he has to come back.

202
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,920
Yes.

203
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,400
Yes.

204
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,600
He'll come back.

205
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,760
He'll come back.

206
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,320
He'll come back.

207
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,720
He'll come back. He'll…

208
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,480
- He'll come back.
- He'll come back.

209
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,960
They forgot to turn off the AC again?

210
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
That was me.

211
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,160
I was the last one to leave last night.

212
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,080
Then use this app.

213
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,520
DEVICE

214
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Download it.

215
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,440
You can schedule the AC
to turn on and off.

216
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,280
Everyone,

217
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,840
Mr. Chanon is here.

218
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,320
- Hello.
- Hello.

219
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
Hello.

220
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,920
Our board of directors

221
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,480
is a bit concerned
about Mr. Paran's condition.

222
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,840
It puts me in a difficult spot too.

223
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,880
Is there a problem?

224
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,800
I'll be direct.

225
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,200
The reason we decided
to invest in Better Together

226
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,440
was because we believed in

227
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,360
Mr. Paran's vision and creativity.

228
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,320
But if his condition remains uncertain,

229
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,520
the board wants to
postpone signing the contract

230
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,200
until Mr. Paran is able to return to work.

231
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm truly sorry.

232
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,800
I knew it.

233
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,320
The moment Mr. Chanon
asked about Ran and wanted a meeting,

234
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,720
I had a feeling it would be this.

235
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,120
We'll stay at the condo for now, my baby.

236
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,880
So that means without Ran,

237
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,000
Mr. Chanon won't invest in us, right?

238
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,000
Don't say that. Ran will wake up soon.

239
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm sorry, Dao.

240
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,040
Even though Ran hasn't woken up yet,

241
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,440
his body is responding gradually.

242
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,480
I believe

243
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,080
it won't be long before he's back.

244
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,240
I'm so stressed.

245
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,560
Is there anything to eat?

246
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,040
Aren't you gonna invite me?

247
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Then come.

248
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,320
Ning?

249
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,960
What's wrong?

250
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,720
- Hey!
- Babe?

251
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,360
What do we do?

252
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,840
- I don't know.
- Ow!

253
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,640
- Hospital.
- Hospital! Wait, wait!

254
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,680
Call them! I'll go call right now!

255
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
Dao, what do we do?

256
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,480
I don't know!

257
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,800
Hang in there, I'll come in with you.

258
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,080
- You got this. I'll be waiting outside.
- Okay.

259
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,920
When Ran wakes up, he'll see my baby.

260
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,880
You've got this, Ning! You can do it!

261
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,000
Are you alright?

262
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
I'm fine.

263
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,920
You're amazing, Ning.

264
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,160
Here comes my baby.

265
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,880
Her nose is like Zen's,
but her mouth looks just like yours, Ning.

266
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,800
Good thing she doesn't look like her dad.

267
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,920
Her dad's got a foul mouth.

268
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,000
Babe,

269
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,600
bring the baby over here.

270
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Alright.

271
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,840
Zen,

272
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,440
if you're gonna use that much,

273
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,840
you might as well just bathe.

274
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,080
Mama's baby.

275
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,160
So, what is her name?

276
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,200
- Sand.
- New.

277
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,760
What? Babe…

278
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
My name is Ning,
so the baby should be "New".

279
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,440
Why does she have to be named after Mom?

280
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,400
Why not after Dad?

281
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,360
Zen and Sand, see?

282
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,120
- I carried her for nine months.
- I helped make her too.

283
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
- I gave birth, okay?
- Whoa, whoa.

284
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm starting to feel bad for your kid.

285
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,120
You can't even agree on her name.

286
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,360
Let me take a photo.

287
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,640
I want to show Ran.

288
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,360
Ning and Zen's baby is so cute, Ran.

289
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,720
She's beautiful just like Ning.

290
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,240
Our baby will be this cute too.

291
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,320
Right?

292
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,520
It's been three days, Ran.

293
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,600
Why are you sleeping so long?

294
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,040
Are you trying to catch up on rest?

295
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
Hey…

296
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,560
I've finished four of
the puzzle pictures you gave me.

297
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,600
Wake up.

298
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,920
Just tell me already.

299
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,480
Why did you choose those pictures for me?

300
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,160
What are you trying to say?

301
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,240
Even if you don't say it,

302
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,440
I think I get it now.

303
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,440
I understand…

304
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,040
I understand.

305
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,520
If the person you love is gone,

306
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,720
how are you supposed to keep going?

307
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,040
I miss you, Ran.

308
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,200
No one is here to remind me to eat.

309
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,720
No one nags me anymore.

310
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,000
The house is so quiet. Do you know that?

311
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,440
I feel so lonely.

312
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,720
And it's not just me who's waiting.

313
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Our baby is waiting too.

314
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,400
Good evening, Mom.

315
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,880
Thank you.

316
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,120
My condolences, Mom.

317
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,480
These are my colleagues from work.

318
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

319
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,080
Thank you so much for coming.

320
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
So…

321
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,040
How's Ran doing now?

322
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,640
Same as before.

323
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,800
He still hasn't woken up.

324
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,080
Aunt Waew is here.

325
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,360
- I'll go greet her.
- Okay.

326
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,440
Let me take them inside.

327
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,160
This way, please.

328
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,280
Are you okay, Ms. Dao?

329
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,800
Yes.

330
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,520
But whatever happens,
you have to take care of your health.

331
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,320
When Ran found out,

332
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,080
he must have been so happy.

333
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,560
He loves you so much.

334
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,200
And I believe
he'd never leave you and the baby behind.

335
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,320
You two have been through
so much together to get to this point.

336
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,800
This too will pass.

337
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,720
Thank you.

338
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Are you tired?

339
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,680
I didn't sleep much last night.

340
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,760
Do you want to go back and rest?

341
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,440
Are you sure

342
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,800
you'll actually sleep tonight?

343
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,080
Idiot…

344
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Anyway,

345
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
I want to hold you for a long time.

346
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,280
We've got so many days left to cuddle.

347
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,080
Or do you only want to do it today?

348
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,000
Just two days,

349
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,200
today and every day after.

350
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,240
So how do we tell Zen and the others?

351
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,880
- I told them in the group chat.
- What?

352
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,760
What did you say?

353
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,040
Just that we're together now.

354
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,600
I didn't mention what happened last night.

355
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,400
Oh, Zen's asking for proof.

356
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,040
Let's take a photo.

357
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Why?

358
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,560
Is that a heart?

359
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,920
- Wait.
- Here.

360
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,880
Alright.

361
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,840
Move over there.

362
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,280
Hey!

363
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,000
- Sorry.
- Look at you.

364
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,840
Sorry.

365
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
There's sand on your face.

366
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,480
Really?

367
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
This is our…

368
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,000
one-of-a-kind
Mr. Stone Face secret edition.

369
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,400
The only one in the world.

370
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,680
Isn't he cute?

371
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,080
You haven't finished it yet?

372
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,880
There's one box left.

373
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,360
Ran's actually pretty romantic
when he wants to be.

374
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,400
We've been friends forever,

375
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,040
and I only just found out

376
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,520
about this side of him.

377
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm heading to bed.

378
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,960
You should rest too.

379
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,400
You've had a long day.

380
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Okay.

381
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,240
You're amazing.

382
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,920
It's almost done.

383
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Do you like it?

384
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,120
I do.

385
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,480
So,

386
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,600
why did you choose these pictures for me?

387
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,160
They're pictures from each year,

388
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,240
from the year we realized
our feelings were more than friendship.

389
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,160
This one was the beginning of everything.

390
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,360
Even though we'd known
each other for ten years,

391
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,680
that day was the first time
we both realized how we truly felt.

392
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
But our timing wasn't right.

393
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,360
Whose fault was it?

394
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
Who was the one who said,

395
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,240
"I don't want you
to suffer with me right now"?

396
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,720
Alright.

397
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,440
Then came this photo.

398
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,720
The first time
we truly followed our hearts.

399
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,720
We always said it, "Better Together."

400
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,200
Being together is better.

401
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,840
It took years to get there.

402
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,320
But once we finally were…

403
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,040
some days we didn't make them count.

404
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,360
Our first anniversary…

405
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,400
If only we hadn't fought that day.

406
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,840
You always say "If only."

407
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,320
I promise,

408
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,600
from now on, I'll make every day count.

409
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,920
Make it worth everything
we've been through.

410
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,200
Ran?

411
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,160
Ran?

412
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,840
Ran?

413
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,160
Ran?

414
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,960
Ran?

415
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,680
Ran?

416
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,560
Ran?

417
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,360
Ran?

418
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,680
Where are you, Ran?

419
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,200
Ran!

420
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,720
Ran!

421
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,320
Ran!

422
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,720
Ran!

423
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,000
Yes, nurse?

424
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,720
Yes?

425
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,280
My condolences, Mom.

426
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,320
Thank you.

427
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,800
Thank you for coming.

428
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,800
This way, please.

429
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,960
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

430
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,600
Hello.

431
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,920
Thank you for coming, Mr. Chanon.

432
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,240
My deepest condolences again.

433
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,600
Thank you.

434
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,840
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

435
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,360
Hello.

436
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,040
Thank you, Nui.

437
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,120
Hello.

438
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,920
Dao.

439
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,880
It's time.

440
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,600
Let's go, Mon.

441
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,480
Thank you all

442
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,040
for attending today's cremation

443
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,640
of a man we all loved deeply.

444
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,920
Now, we'll have a eulogy for the departed.

445
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,720
Thank you all
for coming to send off my father today.

446
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,040
It's been 50 days since he passed,

447
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:54,960
but…

448
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,400
I believe the memories of him
are still vivid in all our hearts.

449
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,120
My lasting memory of Dad

450
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,920
is him sitting in his room, full of books.

451
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,600
Since I was his only son,

452
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,440
we were very close when I was young.

453
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,600
We had a tradition,
we hugged each other every day.

454
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,320
Even when he was busy,

455
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,760
and didn't have time,

456
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,920
just one hug…

457
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,920
was enough to make me feel
like he was never far from me.

458
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,240
My dad wasn't perfect.

459
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,440
He had his flaws.

460
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,520
But…

461
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,560
no matter what,

462
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,320
he was the father
who made me who I am today.

463
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,280
And I'm proud to be his son.

464
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,240
MR. RONNASAK WATCHAWONG BORN: JUNE 7, 1966

465
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,240
DIED: JANUARY 1, 2024, 58 YEARS OLD

466
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:11,800
TEN MONTHS LATER

467
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,520
Okay, thank you, everyone.

468
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,920
Let's give it our all.

469
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,440
- Yes.
- Yes, Boss.

470
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,720
Whoa, Ran.

471
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,760
Is this

472
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,720
the secret to looking young?

473
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,400
Want to try it?

474
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,240
Maybe people will stop calling you old.

475
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,120
Ran,

476
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,080
did you see the news about Dao's ex, Ken?

477
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,640
FAMOUS BUSINESSMAN ARRESTED FOR
ILLEGAL GAMBLING SITE AND MONEY LAUNDERING

478
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,360
- He got arrested?
- Yes.

479
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,240
For gambling and money laundering.

480
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,440
No wonder he was so rich.

481
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,000
What a complete scumbag.

482
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,800
Good thing I never let him
have shares in Wiman.

483
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,160
Everyone, the board is ready to meet.

484
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:08,960
Okay.

485
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,120
In addition to what I shared earlier,

486
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,640
next year we're expanding into streaming.

487
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,920
Besides our regular shows,

488
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,720
we're producing our first series.

489
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,920
<i>NINE YEARS OF YOU</i>

490
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,760
It's been pitched to three platforms,

491
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
and they're all interested.

492
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,920
We're just waiting on the best offer.

493
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,120
I believe in you, Mr. Ran.

494
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,000
Thank you.

495
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,200
We'll give it our all.

496
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,120
When I first decided
to invest in Better Together,

497
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,120
some people said it was overpriced.

498
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,760
But today,

499
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,320
you've proven

500
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,320
it's worth every bit.

501
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,280
So, should we go public next year?

502
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,080
Easy now.

503
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,160
Let's make a hit series first.

504
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,520
As for the new product collab
with Mr. Stone Face,

505
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,560
let's schedule a meeting later,
alright Ms. Nubdao?

506
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Chanon.

507
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,480
I'll have to postpone for now.

508
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,840
I want a bit more time with my family.

509
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,920
I understand.

510
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,960
Just let me know when you're ready.

511
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
Sure.

512
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,360
Mawin loves you guys!

513
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,240
Peek-a-boo!

514
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,520
- Oh, Mom and Dad are here.
- Thank you, Mom.

515
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,600
- Here you go.
- Mawin, come to Mommy.

516
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,400
- But Dao, you can go back to work.
- How are you?

517
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,560
It's okay, I'll babysit him.

518
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,720
No need to fight over him.

519
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,280
I'll take care of him.

520
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,840
Come, come to Daddy. Come here.

521
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,120
Come?

522
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,360
No?

523
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:04,760
- Come?
- No?

524
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,960
- Wow.
- Come on.

525
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,960
Mom, if you like babysitting,
I've got one too.

526
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,920
- Sure.
- I'll bring her next time.

527
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,800
- Of course.
- Great. Then we'll finally get some sleep.

528
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,160
Looks like Mom's happy to babysit.

529
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,640
What about one more?

530
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,840
Perfect timing, Ran's all healthy now,
and Dao's check-up came back clear.

531
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,480
You can totally have another.

532
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,480
Oh, Mom, let me rest first, please.

533
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,040
Right, Mawin? Do you want a sibling?

534
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,920
- Do you want a baby sibling? Do you?
- Oh.

535
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:44,640
- What do you think?
- He said he wants a sibling.

536
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,800
Do you?

537
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,920
Do you?

538
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,160
Ugh.

539
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,120
I can't do it anymore.

540
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,040
What?

541
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,200
I can't do it anymore. I'm tired.

542
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,760
You're tired already?

543
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,920
You'll fail PE at this rate.

544
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,000
You can't just be good at art.

545
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,560
I'm tired, okay?

546
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,160
Not everyone can be like you.

547
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,200
Smart, athletic.

548
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,840
Are you human or Superman?

549
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,720
Then let's rest.

550
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,800
There's a vending machine up ahead.
Let's go.

551
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,360
Hey, Dao?

552
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,640
I can't. My legs are about to fall off.

553
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,720
You really are a cursed soul
disguised as a friend.

554
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,800
This reminds me of when we used to
come running back in eighth grade.

555
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,000
Your memory is too good.

556
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,520
The weather's nice today, huh?

557
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,040
So, don't you regret

558
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,600
turning down Mr. Chanon's offer?

559
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,920
I'd regret not spending time
with you and Mawin more.

560
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,160
Right, Mawin?

561
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,040
Right?

562
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,480
Mr. Stone Face wants to join us too.

563
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,640
Soon it'll be New Years again, Ran.

564
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,960
Those eight pictures,

565
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,760
I meant them to represent
our memories, year by year.

566
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,920
And there aren't just eight.

567
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,160
This is year nine.

568
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,720
And there'll be a tenth,

569
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,880
and many more.

570
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,040
- Let's see.
- Who's that?

571
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,480
Wait, let's look at the big picture.

572
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,880
Here.

573
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,240
- Is it right? No.
- Yes, it is.

574
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,840
- Am I good?
- Okay, good job.

575
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,840
You're amazing.

576
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:12,520
This one goes here.

577
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,760
Nope, that one goes on top.

578
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,040
See? The right side is complete.

579
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,800
- This one too.
- Alright.

580
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,760
Do you like it?

581
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,040
I do.

582
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,440
Every year, it will be us.

583
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,040
And we'll have each other every year.

584
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:37,920
LOVE YOU, MUAH!

585
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,880
