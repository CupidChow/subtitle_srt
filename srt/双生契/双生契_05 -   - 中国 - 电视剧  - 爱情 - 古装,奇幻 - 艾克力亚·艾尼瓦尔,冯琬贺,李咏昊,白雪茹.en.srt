(Three Golden Feathers)

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,800
If you don't believe me

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,440
and insist on seeing the scar,

5
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,040
we'll do it right here.

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,720
Is that enough?

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
How could it be?

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,000
You!

9
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,920
(You want to pin the crime of treason
on me in front of His Majesty?)

10
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,920
(Then I'll make you dig your own grave)

11
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
(before everyone.)

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,880
Yuanying, have you found that scar?

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,120
Please

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,440
look carefully.

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,520
If I'm using her identity,

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,720
I should go all out.

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,480
(What you see)

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,640
(is what I want you to see.)

19
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,360
(All the effort
you put up on this stage.)

20
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,160
(What a shame.
I still caught the attention.)

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,480
Your Majesty

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,520
and Father have no doubts,

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,120
do you?

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,440
I never had any doubt.

25
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,040
Who is he?

26
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,520
Your Majesty, he's my guard.

27
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,280
Qingci's identity

28
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,360
must not be questioned anymore.

29
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,400
Come.

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,880
Take Miss Qingci downstairs to change.

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,160
Don't catch a cold.

32
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,960
(Guard?)

33
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,160
Feng.

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,680
What has gone into you, Chi Yu?

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,040
You tied me up last night.

36
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,120
I... I...

37
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,160
I had no choice.

38
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,760
Actually,

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,600
I...

40
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,760
Chi... Chi Yu.

41
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,840
Chi Yu.

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,920
I'm sorry, Lord Divine Beast.

43
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,440
Didn't you say you were hit
by the bewitching spell?

44
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,920
This is clearly Ji Yuanying's plot.

45
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,640
If I hadn't tied you up,

46
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,960
she would've accused us

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,360
of being in the same room
when she found us.

48
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,240
Besides,

49
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,320
it was raining last night.

50
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,560
The rain could calm you.

51
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,440
It's nothing. Just a flesh wound.

52
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,160
It not only weakens
Ji Yuanying's influence,

53
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,400
wins the pity

54
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,920
of Lord Yi and His Majesty,

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,760
but also proves my identity
as Ji Qingci.

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,920
A good deal.

57
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,480
You're scheming indeed.

58
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,960
You do everything to reach your goal.

59
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
Ji Yuanying is vicious.

60
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,320
I must plan every step

61
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,400
to secure my footing soon

62
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
and gather evidence

63
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,760
to clear the Mu family's name.

64
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
Also,

65
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,320
I could hand myself over to you
in one piece sooner.

66
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,000
You're arrogant.

67
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,760
How will you ensure your own safety?

68
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,680
Well...

69
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,960
How long will you keep hugging me?

70
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:07,720
I... I didn't mean it.

71
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,720
Stop sneezing.

72
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,760
It's not that.

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,240
I couldn't help myself.

74
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,760
I just saw

75
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,680
Ji Qingci sneaking out

76
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,000
through the backyard.

77
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,480
She went out alone?

78
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,600
Seems like my dear sister

79
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,560
has many secrets.

80
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,840
Today is the Ghost Festival.

81
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,320
Isn't she afraid of

82
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,880
running into evil spirits outside?

83
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
If that happens,

84
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,800
she may never return.

85
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,560
(Father,)

86
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,160
(Mother,)

87
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,760
(I will clear the Mu family's name)

88
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,200
(using Ji Qingci's identity.)

89
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,400
Xue.

90
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,840
Xue.

91
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,960
Xue, you're back.

92
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,480
Father.

93
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,120
Father.

94
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,600
Come here.

95
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,760
Xue, let me hold you.

96
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,280
Father, come chase me.

97
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,480
Careful, Xue.

98
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,680
Don't fall.

99
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Slow down.

100
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Come on.

101
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,800
I can't catch up with you.

102
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,640
Xue, come here.

103
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,480
I made you a new pair of shoes.

104
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,280
Try them on.

105
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
Come on.

106
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,160
Father, Mother,

107
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,960
come out.

108
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
I miss you.

109
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,800
Father, Mother,

110
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:14,521
I'll definitely clear your name.

111
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,280
(The sky lanterns are bright.)

112
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,960
(Father and Mother)

113
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,480
must be watching me from above.

114
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,680
No one can threaten

115
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,840
my position as heiress anymore.

116
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,840
The poisoned needle
isn't from the mortal realm.

117
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,200
Once pierced,

118
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
the victim won't last
more than three days.

119
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,000
Don't move,

120
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,880
or the poison will spread faster.

121
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,680
This is bad.

122
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,480
There's no time.
