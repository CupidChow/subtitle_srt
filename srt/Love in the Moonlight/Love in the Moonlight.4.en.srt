1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,817
Proceed with
the Crown Prince's coronation!

2
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,290
Your Majesty, this is...

3
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:23,423
All of my authority
other than over the military,

4
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,493
- shall be granted...
- Your Majesty.

5
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:35,935
I am deeply moved
by His Highness' desire,

6
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,905
to share your burden.

7
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,307
Thank you.

8
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,079
Your devotion pleases me.

9
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,414
However,

10
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,152
choosing an interim king
is an important decision,

11
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,054
as the nation's reputation is on the line.

12
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:58,858
In the past, Joseon suffered
through two great wars,

13
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,162
after violating the pact with the Qing.

14
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:06,199
Thereafter, our relationship
went from being brothers,

15
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,234
to ruler and subject.

16
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:14,240
Having an interim king
will change the diplomatic head,

17
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:19,346
and thus we must receive
approval by the Qing.

18
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,917
Please understand, Your Majesty.

19
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,887
Please understand, Your Majesty.

20
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,956
Please understand, Your Majesty.

21
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:52,979
I am very surprised at your explanation.

22
00:01:55,081 --> 00:02:00,186
I wish to lighten your burden
this very moment,

23
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:05,558
but as Councilor Kim states,
this is an important matter that changes

24
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,595
the diplomatic head,
and thus we must be cautious.

25
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,768
I heard the foreign envoys will be coming...

26
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,404
...to celebrate Your Majesty's birthday.

27
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,477
Please heed the concerns
of your subjects,

28
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,182
who care for the nation,
and postpone your decision,

29
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,018
so that I may become the interim king
with the Qing's blessing, Your Majesty.

30
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,929
Please postpone your decision, Sire.

31
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:47,701
Please postpone your decision, Sire.

32
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,651
Donggungjeon Library

33
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:22,842
Silver Spoon.

34
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,706
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,511
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,147
I am running an errand.

37
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,388
Have you seen the Crown Prince?

38
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,790
I was told he would be here.

39
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,830
What?

40
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
No.

41
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:52,265
I am relieved. I was very anxious.

42
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,503
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,940
This library is for the Crown Prince only.

44
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,842
Come out if you are done.

45
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,183
Hurry now.

46
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,513
Yes, Master.

47
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,056
Silver Spoon.

48
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,259
You heard him, didn't you?

49
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,327
Let's get out of here.

50
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,796
Only the Crown Prince can come in here.

51
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:29,942
What are you waiting for?

52
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,672
Let's go now.

53
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,275
Let's go before
we run into the Crown Prince.

54
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,380
Why do you not tell him?

55
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,682
He'll find out eventually.

56
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:51,825
I am concerned as a friend,

57
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,293
so heed my warning.

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,800
A friend?

59
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,664
Since when have we become friends?

60
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,800
If we are not friends, what are we?

61
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:13,747
What about you? What is your name?

62
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,120
Wait.

63
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,390
You once asked for my name.

64
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,460
Lee Yeong.

65
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,462
That is my name.

66
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,644
Silver Spoon.

67
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:20,647
This robe.

68
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,615
Look at this.

69
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,551
Isn't this the Crown Prince's robe?

70
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,753
Yes.

71
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:30,423
You really... What if someone sees?

72
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,026
This is a place only for the Crown Prince.

73
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,390
What...

74
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:46,506
How...

75
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,842
How...

76
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,811
Silver Spoon. How...

77
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,716
Your Highness!
I have committed a mortal sin!

78
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,221
Do you mean it?

79
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:04,391
Pardon? No, Your Highness.

80
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,192
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

81
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,887
Shall I kill you or spare you?

82
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,494
Are those the only two options?

83
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,565
After all,

84
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,002
we're friends.

85
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,579
What?

86
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,843
Isn't that what you said?

87
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,246
You asked what are we

88
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,048
if not friends.

89
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:26,673
CHAPTER FOUR After the Play Ends

90
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,110
He threatened you?

91
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:32,445
He did.

92
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,116
"Isn't that what you said?"

93
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:40,253
"You asked what are we if not friends."

94
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:44,924
Why would he not?

95
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,194
Surely he must've been angry.

96
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,232
They say that half
of the Crown Prince's blood

97
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,767
is that of a beast
and the other half human.

98
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,136
And he doesn't know when he should

99
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,672
and shouldn't bark like a mad dog.

100
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,482
That is enough.
You will damage the pillar.

101
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,652
I am worse than this pillar.

102
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,356
To think how rude I was
to the Crown Prince...

103
00:09:21,828 --> 00:09:24,497
Are you truly a palace guard?

104
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,867
Are you hiding anything from me?

105
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,170
I am not.

106
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,675
I think he is.

107
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,882
Your Highness, did you wake up?

108
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,951
He often night-travels,

109
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,820
so asking once or twice
will not be enough.

110
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,855
You must ask persistently.

111
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:53,727
Stay with me.
Ask him over and over again.

112
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,296
You may go in when he clears his throat.

113
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,098
Yes, but Master.

114
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:04,304
I swear I do not complain about my tasks.

115
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,908
Yes. You are the person
the Donggungjeon needed.

116
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:12,445
However, I have a good reason this time.

117
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,547
You may send me anywhere for any task.

118
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,084
Can you please assign me
to a different place?

119
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,757
You do not like me, do you?

120
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:25,865
Do you hate me that much?

121
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,394
- Pardon?
- Do you?

122
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,430
Well, it is not because of you, Master.

123
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,399
- Think about it.
- Then?

124
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,434
Is it because of me?

125
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,594
Speak.

126
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,968
The reason why
anywhere but Donggungjeon is fine.

127
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,606
It is nothing.

128
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,578
How could I dare be choosy
about whom I serve?

129
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,059
And calling the one you serve a pig,

130
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,963
biting his finger,
and acting out of drunkenness

131
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,204
are fine?

132
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:47,307
Of course, they are not.

133
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,511
I deserve to be punished
for all my rude acts

134
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,813
without knowing you're the Crown Prince.

135
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,418
Do you regret being close to me?

136
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,726
Yes.

137
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,596
I regret it, Your Highness.

138
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,568
You resent me.

139
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,608
If you had told me the truth sooner,

140
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:26,846
I would've never said
something as reckless

141
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:29,182
as asking you to be friends.

142
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,288
That is why I did not tell you.

143
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,293
It was obvious you would act that way

144
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,295
if you knew I was the Crown Prince.

145
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,298
Excuse me?

146
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,367
I am sorry for not telling you sooner.

147
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:53,139
Did you order everyone else to leave

148
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,810
so you could tell me this?

149
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,280
Was it not to punish me?

150
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:02,515
When we are alone,

151
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,818
you may continue
to treat me as your friend.

152
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,521
No. I command you to do so.

153
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:11,758
Do you understand?

154
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,831
Do you know anything

155
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,801
about this person coming as the envoy?

156
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,275
Yes.

157
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,906
He's highly loyal
to the Emperor and has his favor,

158
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,344
but he's known to be vicious
to the people of Qing.

159
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:41,848
Is it true that he demanded
a generous coffer

160
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:43,883
filled with silver when he comes?

161
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,320
He said it jokingly over drinks,

162
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,422
but given his acts in the past,

163
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,392
I do not think it was completely a joke.

164
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,596
Seeing how he openly demands a large sum,

165
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,032
I can only imagine how ruthless he is.

166
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,604
Once the envoy comes, set up a dinner.

167
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,175
I don't think it'll benefit you
to be close to him.

168
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,713
It is for the nation.
Not everything can be beneficial.

169
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:18,852
I understand you are concerned
for your grandfather.

170
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:20,893
Yes, Grandfather.

171
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,293
I must go to the palace
to prepare for the festival.

172
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,862
Sure. Go ahead.

173
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,904
Let us give him whatever he asks.

174
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,940
We can give him everything
and butter him up first.

175
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:44,611
Then let's ask him
not to approve the Crown Prince.

176
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:50,417
Politics is not very different
from winning over a maiden's heart.

177
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,653
A relationship you gain
by giving whatever they want

178
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,490
will last no more than one night.

179
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:01,494
Then how do you plan to...

180
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:06,499
How do you think
our temperamental Crown Prince

181
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,203
would react before an envoy like him?

182
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,206
My... With his unpredictable temper?

183
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,842
We would be lucky
if he does not throw a punch.

184
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,683
Do you mean we should get them
to fight each other?

185
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,987
The pompous envoy
and the hot-tempered Crown Prince.

186
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,691
They may just do our job for us.

187
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:41,534
You are very wise. Very wise.

188
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:50,110
Do you not miss the outside?

189
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,783
I would be lying if I say I do not.

190
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,985
What do you miss?

191
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:05,925
The busy town,
the steam from the fresh rice cakes,

192
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,729
and exciting gambling games.
I miss everything.

193
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,767
The palace is full of things we cannot do.

194
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,368
That is right.

195
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,105
You must be so frustrated
after being so free.

196
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:23,209
Yes, trainees like me
cannot go outside freely.

197
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,478
You poor thing.

198
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,784
Get ready to go out.

199
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,553
I will be generous
and take you out of the palace.

200
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:37,057
Do you mean it?

201
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,627
How are you

202
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:44,898
just like Master Jang said?

203
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,834
You cannot.

204
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,204
He warned me
that if I follow you out and lose you,

205
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,273
I'd be punished severely.

206
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,542
Fine. Forget it.

207
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:02,349
My stomach.

208
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:06,119
Are you trying to lie
about having a stomachache?

209
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,323
No way.

210
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:13,293
Not our pretty Crown Prince.

211
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:18,898
I will go to the library.
Take the books and follow me.

212
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,176
Your Highness.

213
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,847
I checked them all,
but I do not see the one you seek.

214
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,351
Can you still not remember the title?

215
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:42,155
There are too many books here
for me to find it,

216
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,624
especially when the letters
have been smudged.

217
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,894
Please answer me...

218
00:18:49,663 --> 00:18:50,563
When we are alone,

219
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,566
you may continue to treat me
as your friend.

220
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,269
No. I command you to do so.

221
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,972
What... What are you doing?

222
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,442
I don't know.
His Highness told me to say it.

223
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,979
- I am losing my mind.
- What?

224
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,714
You are losing your mind?

225
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,018
Eunuch Hong, go find your mind!

226
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,287
Are you really cracking a joke right now?

227
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:17,657
I am only doing what His Highness ordered.

228
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:22,395
Setting up the Jagyeongjeon
for the festival

229
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,799
- will be Eunuch Ha's job.
- Yes, Master.

230
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,235
You two come with me.

231
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,773
The kitchen asked for two people.

232
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,912
Tell them to manage
with the ones they have!

233
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,514
Look how much there is to do.

234
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,484
We only have these ones left.
Oh, my. My Lord.

235
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,421
You should have just sent someone.

236
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,557
You did not have to come here all the way.

237
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,061
I plan to send
some damaged folding screens

238
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,763
to the Office of Art,

239
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,297
but I guess you are very busy.

240
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,201
It's fine. I will have to use
people we have as well.

241
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,136
We are not busy.

242
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,240
Do you not see them standing by idly?

243
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,310
Hong Samnom. Come here.

244
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,724
Is this the place?

245
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,293
Yes.

246
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,829
I heard he is staying here
after his exile.

247
00:20:31,631 --> 00:20:33,667
Hello. Welcome.

248
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:38,905
Are you here to see Master Jeong?

249
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,044
Check over there.
He's in the middle of a quarrel.

250
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:59,659
It's literally a dog fight.

251
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:03,597
I think it is better
to meet him alone today.

252
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,665
Yes, Your Highness.

253
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,436
Will it be ready in time?

254
00:21:09,636 --> 00:21:11,938
Yes, of course. Don't worry.

255
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:13,840
Please take extra care.

256
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,810
It is going to the palace.
What could be nicer?

257
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,650
Raon.

258
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:55,755
Take that off.

259
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:56,956
No.

260
00:21:58,018 --> 00:21:59,152
Just for today.

261
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:01,494
Please, Mother.

262
00:22:03,657 --> 00:22:04,925
You are not a girl.

263
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:07,060
You are a boy.

264
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,596
Do you not understand?

265
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,117
My goodness!

266
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:35,121
You look as fine and pretty
as a porcelain vase.

267
00:22:35,889 --> 00:22:37,557
But you are so picky on choosing items.

268
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,127
Let us go, Eunuch Hong.

269
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:43,663
Yes, My Lord.

270
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:51,905
But...

271
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:55,008
What is it now?

272
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:56,376
About this...

273
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:06,019
He is finally back. I mean Master Jeong.

274
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,557
Are you here to see me?

275
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:21,001
My Lord, let me carry that pouch.

276
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:25,138
This is nothing. It's not heavy anyway.

277
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:13,587
Are you all right?

278
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:15,589
Yes, My Lord.

279
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:31,371
Put this on.

280
00:24:32,072 --> 00:24:32,912
Pardon?

281
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,243
Why are you giving a man a woman's robe?

282
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,347
Look at the rain.

283
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,683
Just consider it a tool
to escape from the rain.

284
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,224
No.

285
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:54,494
You said it is a gift
for a special person.

286
00:24:57,631 --> 00:24:58,531
It is.

287
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:03,236
But it's not the right time.

288
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:07,874
I think I need to wait
until she can accept this

289
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,343
with a happy heart.

290
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:15,054
So please take it.

291
00:25:17,317 --> 00:25:18,551
I am fine.

292
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:48,815
I shall go buy an umbrella.

293
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:51,351
Wait right here.

294
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:01,988
You have never been
in the rain before, have you?

295
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,625
Have you, Mother?

296
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:11,665
Yes, just like the fresh grass
drenched in rain.

297
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,042
What is it? Do you not like it?

298
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:24,110
That is not it,

299
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,813
but the rain came so suddenly.

300
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,615
We do not have proper shoes
or an umbrella.

301
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:31,017
That is why it is a great opportunity.

302
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,594
Mother!

303
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,706
Mother, you are the Queen,

304
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:54,874
and I am the Crown Prince,

305
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:56,977
so why are you...

306
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,945
Why not?

307
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:00,480
Sorry?

308
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:02,882
Why do queens and crown princes

309
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:05,118
always require so much preparation?

310
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:08,154
Did someone say it is against the law

311
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:10,523
if we walk barefoot in the rain?

312
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,373
It looks like it will stop soon,

313
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:36,610
so you should wait.

314
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:39,852
Pardon?

315
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:44,884
It is fun to be out in the rain,

316
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,554
but the cold lasts a long time.

317
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:50,824
Do you not agree?

318
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:56,930
You are correct.

319
00:30:14,347 --> 00:30:15,315
Are you not the Crown Prince?

320
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,722
Your Highness,
are you travelling in disguise?

321
00:30:24,624 --> 00:30:25,464
Do you not know?

322
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,130
It ends as soon as I see someone I know.

323
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:32,666
My apologies.

324
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,037
I am with someone,
so I could not just walk by.

325
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:39,478
With someone?

326
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,516
Are you a palace worker?

327
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:46,012
Lift up your head.

328
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,990
She is my woman, Your Highness.

329
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:08,335
She seems startled to meet
Your Highness so unexpectedly.

330
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:18,745
Who else would be more unwelcome
than me outside the palace?

331
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,850
I do not know her,
but please tell the lady

332
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,086
that I will leave you alone,

333
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,989
so she need not be startled
as if she saw a monster.

334
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:04,391
So you need the Qing's approval

335
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:07,327
to take the throne in the interim.

336
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,063
Yes.

337
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:13,633
They will surely try to make me look bad

338
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:15,802
in front of the Qing envoy to prevent it.

339
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:19,506
Then do not look bad.

340
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:25,445
He will not oppose you
if he thinks you are obedient.

341
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:29,149
What I wanted to know was a way

342
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:30,917
to be accepted as an equal diplomat,

343
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:33,820
not a way to win an approval.

344
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:36,423
But the reality is

345
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:43,196
that the King and the Crown Prince

346
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,433
cannot stop the councilor
of their own nation.

347
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:50,537
You must...

348
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:58,945
...cut off the councilor's head first.

349
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,218
People from the same nation

350
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:07,220
killing each other
in order to survive and win.

351
00:33:11,224 --> 00:33:12,959
Had I known that would be your advice,

352
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,597
I would have gone
to a skilled assassin instead of you.

353
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:20,267
I guess my expectations were too high.

354
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:22,802
My apologies for troubling you.

355
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,741
My apologies for wasting your trip.

356
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:29,676
Goodbye.

357
00:33:34,347 --> 00:33:35,415
But, Your Highness.

358
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,922
You do not need to spill blood to win.

359
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:48,261
You can kill them with sweet honey.

360
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:50,430
Why would you need poison?

361
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,443
Office of Music Instrument Storage

362
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:09,883
Your Highness.

363
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,587
Why did you come here at such late hour?

364
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,190
You can kill them with sweet honey.

365
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:20,293
Why would you need poison?

366
00:34:21,995 --> 00:34:25,599
Yes. If I can bring them to their knees
with music and dance,

367
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:30,503
I would not need to draw my sword.

368
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:44,718
I cannot believe this is happening!

369
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,653
How can those lowly kisaeng

370
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,756
walk around in the sacred palace?

371
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,563
They selected the best kisaeng
in the country.

372
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,500
The Crown Prince must be indulging
in sexual pleasure.

373
00:35:00,867 --> 00:35:03,904
He said he would plan
the King's birthday festival.

374
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:07,307
Is he planning to fulfill his pleasure?

375
00:35:07,674 --> 00:35:10,043
We should not let him get away with this.

376
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:19,319
The person who will give
the last performance

377
00:35:21,521 --> 00:35:22,989
is Aeshim from Hanyang.

378
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:30,230
Now, hand out the choreography
for the dance.

379
00:35:34,601 --> 00:35:35,969
Hong Samnom.

380
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,807
You shall follow me around from now on

381
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:43,610
and document the entire preparation.

382
00:35:45,111 --> 00:35:45,951
Is that understood?

383
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,020
Yes, Your Highness.

384
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,059
What?

385
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:33,760
That was not right.

386
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:39,866
Wrong! Do it again.

387
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:43,075
Again.

388
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,381
Stand up.

389
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:52,785
I said...

390
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:03,890
You must be aware of the significance

391
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:05,692
of the last performance.

392
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:07,861
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:37:16,536 --> 00:37:19,639
This is enough for today. You may leave.

394
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,842
Yes, Your Highness.

395
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:24,778
Oh, no. Your Highness.

396
00:37:27,647 --> 00:37:29,716
Give her a pat on the back, Your Highness.

397
00:37:38,558 --> 00:37:40,360
What a scene!

398
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,396
When he takes the throne in the interim,

399
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,566
many kisaeng's lives
will change completely.

400
00:37:48,635 --> 00:37:50,837
Please tell my father not to worry.

401
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,441
Because he will enjoy watching

402
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:58,445
the scene in front of the envoy that day.

403
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:11,731
Your Highness.

404
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,863
You said everyone
should silently count to 50

405
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,332
after Aeshim's solo dance.

406
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,368
Yes.

407
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:24,704
There will be no music or dance
while they count to 50.

408
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:27,440
What are you planning to do?

409
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,044
You will see.

410
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,814
That is when the real performance begins.

411
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:42,189
What are you doing?

412
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:43,496
What?

413
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,562
You told me to draw
the moves of the palace dance.

414
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:49,935
That is right.

415
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:53,733
I told you to draw
all the dance moves in here.

416
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:55,802
But you are drawing
without looking at this.

417
00:38:56,903 --> 00:39:00,307
I didn't need to see it
because I remember the moves.

418
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:04,945
All those dance moves are in your head?

419
00:39:05,278 --> 00:39:06,118
Yes, Your Highness.

420
00:39:06,646 --> 00:39:09,583
I may not be good
at memorizing difficult words,

421
00:39:09,649 --> 00:39:12,786
but I never forget a dance or song.

422
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,156
How dare you try to fool me?
Bring it to me now.

423
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,036
Did you really memorize
all this by seeing it once?

424
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,907
Your Highness. Are you awake?

425
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:23,383
Your Highness.

426
00:41:25,552 --> 00:41:27,420
What was that? Is that a new signal?

427
00:41:28,021 --> 00:41:31,424
Your Highness. Are you awake?

428
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:37,297
Your Highness, I am coming in.

429
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:39,099
No. No.

430
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:57,951
Do not wake me. Come back an hour later.

431
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:02,055
Yes, Your Highness.

432
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,920
You get scared easily for a boy.

433
00:42:58,378 --> 00:43:00,780
Byeongyeon, it is you. Did you sleep well?

434
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:07,020
You must be wondering why I did not come.

435
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:09,990
Do not even ask me.

436
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:16,763
The Crown Prince gave me
so much work to do last night.

437
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:18,204
It is true.

438
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:20,967
I worked all night long.

439
00:43:21,902 --> 00:43:22,742
I did not ask.

440
00:43:23,503 --> 00:43:24,343
Pardon?

441
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:27,847
Right.

442
00:43:29,176 --> 00:43:32,913
Do your best to help him.
It is very important to him.

443
00:43:34,514 --> 00:43:37,517
Many are trying to ruin the event.
It must be hard.

444
00:43:38,585 --> 00:43:41,488
But it's the King's birthday festival.

445
00:43:41,588 --> 00:43:42,789
Who would dare to do that?

446
00:43:43,557 --> 00:43:44,591
There are some people

447
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:49,262
who are waiting to find fault
with the Crown Prince.

448
00:43:57,103 --> 00:43:59,005
How are you preparing
for the reception of the envoys?

449
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,977
I was trained
at the eunuch training institute in Qing.

450
00:44:04,678 --> 00:44:06,646
I made sure every little thing

451
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,049
from the bedding to all the food

452
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,618
meets the envoys' preferences.

453
00:44:11,952 --> 00:44:14,387
Your confidence makes me worry even more.

454
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:18,431
They are here.

455
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:28,468
Greetings, Your Excellency!
Thank you for coming all the way here.

456
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:35,735
We will do our utmost
to make you feel at home.

457
00:44:36,376 --> 00:44:39,679
I am the envoy serving
His Majesty the Emperor's command.

458
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:44,151
I should be able to speak
your language for diplomacy.

459
00:44:44,684 --> 00:44:46,253
Of course.

460
00:44:49,289 --> 00:44:50,891
It has been a long time.

461
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,093
Welcome.

462
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:55,394
You must be tired after a long journey.

463
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:57,164
This way, please.

464
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:03,637
How... impressive of you.

465
00:45:47,314 --> 00:45:49,216
Right before your performance begins,

466
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,786
a palanquin will be waiting
at the back door.

467
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:55,789
Sneak out of Jagyeongjeon,

468
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:57,691
and get in the palanquin.

469
00:45:58,959 --> 00:45:59,960
Pardon?

470
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:03,964
If I ruin the festival,
I will be executed.

471
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:07,901
I hear you became a kisaeng
to support your family.

472
00:46:09,703 --> 00:46:13,607
Your family has always been
a burden to you.

473
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,208
Do you want me
to make all of them disappear?

474
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:22,782
The performance will begin shortly.

475
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:23,917
Are you ready?

476
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:25,352
Yes.

477
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:55,382
What?

478
00:46:57,117 --> 00:46:58,018
How could that happen?

479
00:46:58,485 --> 00:46:59,686
I will look for her.

480
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:09,635
What is the problem?

481
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:11,698
Well...

482
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,301
Next is the solo dance performance,

483
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:15,602
but the dancer cannot be found.

484
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:17,370
What?

485
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,674
This cannot happen at this solemn event.

486
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,043
I might lose my life for this.

487
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:25,912
That will not happen.
I will look for her, too.

488
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,415
Thank you, My Lord. Where is Aeshim?

489
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,330
Oh, my. Eunuch Hong,
you are unexpectedly sly.

490
00:47:44,664 --> 00:47:45,966
He just barged in.

491
00:47:46,466 --> 00:47:48,168
I wonder what he wanted to see.

492
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,037
You are mistaken.
I was looking for the dancer

493
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:52,439
for the solo dance performance.

494
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:53,346
Do you mean Aeshim?

495
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,109
- Yes.
- She was here just now.

496
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:57,911
Where is she?

497
00:47:58,411 --> 00:48:00,113
Isn't this her stage outfit
for her solo dance?

498
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,581
Yes.

499
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:02,749
This is her outfit, is it not?

500
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,071
Stand up.

501
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:31,678
You must be aware of the significance

502
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:33,647
of the last performance.

503
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,083
Do your best to help him.

504
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:39,686
It is very important to him.

505
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:42,789
Many are trying to ruin the event.

506
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:44,457
It must be hard.

507
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:47,794
But it's the King's birthday festival.

508
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:49,062
Who would dare to do that?

509
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:50,797
There are some people

510
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:55,602
who are waiting
to find fault with the Crown Prince.

511
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:07,914
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

512
00:50:21,254 --> 00:50:25,725
The Crown Prince prepared for this
with all his heart,

513
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:28,295
but there seems to be a problem.

514
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:30,997
There is music without a dancer
to dance to it?

515
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:34,801
My goodness. That is what I am saying.

516
00:50:35,669 --> 00:50:37,304
It must be because
of his lack of experience.

517
00:50:37,804 --> 00:50:39,639
Please forgive him.

518
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,575
This amuses me.

519
00:50:43,577 --> 00:50:48,181
Let us see how capable
your Crown Prince is to the end.

520
00:52:34,387 --> 00:52:36,790
Mother, you are the Queen,

521
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:38,225
and I am the Crown Prince...

522
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:39,993
Why not?

523
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,862
Did someone say it is against the law

524
00:52:41,995 --> 00:52:44,531
if we walk barefoot in the rain?

525
00:54:12,185 --> 00:54:13,987
There will be

526
00:54:14,654 --> 00:54:17,858
a celebratory speech for the King.

527
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:35,976
I cannot hide my joy

528
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,045
that I was able to offer His Majesty

529
00:54:39,279 --> 00:54:42,883
a successful festival
with music and dance.

530
00:54:44,684 --> 00:54:47,654
Thus, I shall give someone the honor

531
00:54:47,787 --> 00:54:50,223
to give the speech full
of all people's hearts.

532
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,029
Chief State Councilor Kim Heon.

533
00:54:57,531 --> 00:55:00,000
Come and accept this honor.

534
00:55:24,724 --> 00:55:27,527
There will be no music
or dance while they count to 50.

535
00:55:27,794 --> 00:55:29,930
What are you planning to do?

536
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:31,237
You will see.

537
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:34,367
That is when the real performance begins.

538
00:55:39,973 --> 00:55:41,708
Who will be performing?

539
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:44,978
I have someone.

540
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:50,050
He has no idea that he is performing.

541
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:09,136
"The King has edified us for 30 years."

542
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:12,739
"We congratulate on the King's birthday."

543
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:17,310
"May the King live as long
as Mount Nam stands."

544
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:22,115
"The subjects have realized
his great intentions."

545
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:26,987
"The King's greatness
cannot be surpassed."

546
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:32,392
"We are moved by his grace
and shout as follows,"

547
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,930
"May the King remain
the sole light of the East"

548
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:41,601
"forever and ever."

549
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,318
It was not a feast to just eat and drink.

550
00:57:00,153 --> 00:57:01,221
What do we do now?

551
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:06,293
Everyone is swearing their loyalty
in front of the Qing envoy.

552
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:10,530
How could we dare oppose it?

553
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:12,933
He got us.

554
00:57:14,134 --> 00:57:15,969
He totally got us this time.

555
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:21,675
Long live the King!

556
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:25,812
Long live the King!

557
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:30,917
Long live the King!

558
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:35,689
Long live the King!

559
00:57:35,956 --> 00:57:39,359
Long live the King!

560
00:57:39,993 --> 00:57:43,230
Long live the King!

561
00:58:37,617 --> 00:58:38,785
Who are you?
