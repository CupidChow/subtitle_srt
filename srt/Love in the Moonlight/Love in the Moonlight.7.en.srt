1
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:12,089
You may go.

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,180
I shall escort you to Donggungjeon,
Your Highness.

3
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:18,641
Do you not see that
he is about to drop dead?

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,827
I am fine, Your Highness.

5
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:29,281
Your Highness! Your Highness.

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,199
Where did you go after making that scene?

7
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,372
I... What?

8
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,871
Did you really save Eunuch Hong?

9
00:00:37,966 --> 00:00:40,536
-Are you not hurt?
-Ask one at a time.

10
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:43,055
-Your Highness...
-Starting tomorrow.

11
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,883
We will get going, Your Highness.

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,819
I will see you again at Donggungjeon.

13
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,160
Your Highness.

14
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:16,414
Byeongyeon.

15
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,576
Did you get hurt again because of me?

16
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,784
It's my job. It's not because of you.

17
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,955
That is not right.
You always worry about me.

18
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:35,263
You saved my life and nursed me
all night long when I was ill.

19
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,665
I told you already that it was not me.

20
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,302
If it had not been you,
who could it have been?

21
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:43,769
The only ones who live in Jahyeongdang...

22
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:49,346
How did you know
that I parted with my mother?

23
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,585
I dreamed of the day I parted with my mom.

24
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,199
Byeongyeon.

25
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,136
It is amazing.

26
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,872
Now that I am back here,

27
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,574
I feel so at peace.

28
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,012
You said before, right?

29
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,075
That no one likes the palace.

30
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,054
But that if you come to like
someone in the palace,

31
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:37,624
it becomes a decent place to live in.

32
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,660
That sounds familiar.

33
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,297
You must be tired. Go to sleep.

34
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,575
Byeongyeon.

35
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,044
You know...

36
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:04,884
I am worried that I will grow to like
the palace more.

37
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:23,136
CHAPTER 7 Confession

38
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,277
Why that...

39
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,318
Eunuch Hong.

40
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,123
My Lord.

41
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:45,759
What brings you here?

42
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,277
I needed to check something.

43
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:49,705
Sorry?

44
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:51,059
Are you not hurt?

45
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:55,035
No, I am fine.

46
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,093
Were you worried?

47
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:01,675
Yes. Please do not make me worry again.

48
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:05,278
You are very special to me.

49
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:07,632
Sorry?

50
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,551
You're the only eunuch
who made me run in the palace.

51
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,234
You are so funny.

52
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:23,920
I am glad you are safe, Your Highness.

53
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,974
I heard from Byeonyeon
that you played a big part...

54
00:04:29,453 --> 00:04:32,156
...in bringing the censor from Qing.

55
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,475
It was very important to me as well,

56
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,644
so I helped out a little.

57
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,482
Important enough
to defy your grandfather...

58
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,622
I guess you mean not to worry
since it was not for me.

59
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:51,925
Yes, Your Highness.

60
00:05:02,661 --> 00:05:04,799
I shall get going now, My Lord.

61
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,123
Your Highness.

62
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:28,003
May I ask what is making you laugh?

63
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,662
Is it not interesting?

64
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:35,355
Why is he being so generous
only to that eunuch?

65
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,828
Since when did the Crown Prince
care for his subjects?

66
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:45,306
That is why strange rumors
are floating around,

67
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,866
questioning whether he likes men.

68
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,417
What is that?

69
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:53,673
That is absurd.

70
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,038
That eunuch's name is Samnom, correct?

71
00:05:58,958 --> 00:05:59,959
Yes, Your Highness.

72
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:16,610
My apologies, Your Highness.

73
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:18,650
It is difficult already,

74
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,016
and you expect me
to drink this you gagged at?

75
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:27,487
I... I have committed a mortal sin,
Your Highness.

76
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:29,389
I... I have been having
stomach problems lately.

77
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:32,025
I do not want to hear it.
Drag her out of here.

78
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,193
Yes, Your Highness.

79
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,487
Your Highness, please spare me.

80
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:39,332
Please spare me, Your Highness.

81
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,837
Your Highness. Your Highness!

82
00:07:02,995 --> 00:07:04,830
Are you sure it's safe to use?

83
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,560
This plant makes you swell up
if you touch it.

84
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:08,834
Exactly.

85
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,998
I put in just a little
to smooth out the wrinkle.

86
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,334
It'll make the forehead round
and tighten under the eyes.

87
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,270
It may be poisonous,

88
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:20,431
but it is helpful if it's used properly.

89
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,712
And he is a specialist in poisons.

90
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,749
Have you heard?

91
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,020
I hear the palace's furnace
is hot these days.

92
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,590
What? The weather is too hot
to light the furnace.

93
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:38,129
Why is it hot?

94
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:41,744
Nobody goes there. How nice is that?

95
00:07:41,966 --> 00:07:45,736
I hear lonely eunuchs
and female palace attendants

96
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:49,254
visit there every night.

97
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:52,143
They hide in there.

98
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:54,844
And what?

99
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:01,652
My... The sun is setting already.

100
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,853
-What?
-Shall we go?

101
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,321
-Yes, we should go.
-Let us go.

102
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,690
-Where are you going?
-Bye.

103
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:08,125
Don't go hiding!

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,295
By any chance, do they hide...

105
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,764
-And...
-...and eat meat?

106
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:20,137
The Queen was already concerned
with the rumors

107
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:22,973
and she did this in front of Her Highness.

108
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:26,143
I can't believe her.

109
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:31,849
His Majesty has not visited
the court ladies in years.

110
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:33,818
If it is not the King,

111
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,555
it must be a royal family member
or a palace guard.

112
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,356
Who knows?

113
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,461
There are some eunuchs
who come alive again.

114
00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:48,032
Things must be hectic
among the female palace attendants now.

115
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:51,969
The Queen has ordered that we bring in,

116
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,339
any eunuchs who look suspicious.

117
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,345
We shall conduct a test...

118
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:04,915
...on all of the eunuchs.

119
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:09,012
That is a wise decision.

120
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:14,091
Let us use this chance
to quell the rumors about the eunuchs.

121
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,863
What should we do
about the trainees who just came?

122
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,870
Why have you not touched your meal?

123
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:30,541
The Crown Prince
does not eat without a taster.

124
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,378
Where did the taster go?

125
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:36,080
I shall go get her.

126
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:37,782
You can do it.

127
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,720
Come close and sit.

128
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:52,463
Do you want me to taste the food?

129
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,127
It is not poisoned, Your Highness.

130
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:31,639
It is salty.

131
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:37,514
It is fishy.

132
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,128
Goodness. He is still picky.

133
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:43,253
I cannot eat it.

134
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,282
You eat it.

135
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:49,879
Please think of the palace workers
who prepared it.

136
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,666
If you do not want it,
I will have them remove it.

137
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:53,612
-Come in!
-I will eat it.

138
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,095
I will eat.

139
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,479
Here.

140
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:38,803
Where did all of these go
in that tiny body?

141
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,142
Pardon me.

142
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,273
According to my grandfather,
wise men must not hesitate to ask.

143
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:56,566
All right. Just ask.

144
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,686
Well...

145
00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:09,184
What do you mean by staying by you?

146
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:13,007
It means as it is.

147
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,021
What's wrong with
wanting to keep my favorite eunuch?

148
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,972
Oh, I see.

149
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:38,820
You're already five steps away from me.

150
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,953
Pardon me?

151
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:47,775
Yes, Your Highness.

152
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:36,871
Are you back, My Lord?

153
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,207
Is Yunseong inside?

154
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,323
Were you reading?

155
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,158
Yes, Grandfather.

156
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:52,028
I spoke about your marriage...

157
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,065
...with the Minister
of Culture and Education.

158
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:59,903
After the marriage, someone in the family
will be the Crown Prince's wife.

159
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:03,907
Pardon? I am not ready yet.

160
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:06,877
This isn't about finding
the right partner for you.

161
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:09,478
Until when are you going to be
that leisurely?

162
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:10,680
Grandfather, I...

163
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:12,783
Just do as I say.

164
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:18,221
Don't worry.
She's known to be beautiful and wise.

165
00:14:27,097 --> 00:14:28,198
Go in for a minute.

166
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,567
-I do not want to.
-Just go in for a minute.

167
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,208
Did I not tell you to end it?

168
00:14:39,109 --> 00:14:42,579
Don't you know
the pregnant court lady disappeared?

169
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:46,183
That is why I will be careful for a while.

170
00:14:46,983 --> 00:14:50,921
I do not want to keep meeting you
in secret like this.

171
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:53,824
What else can we do with our status?

172
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:56,093
Everyone meets each other secretly.

173
00:14:58,128 --> 00:15:01,064
Can you say in front
of others that you like me?

174
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:03,166
Have you lost your mind?

175
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,935
What if something bad happens to you?

176
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:10,140
Our love would only hurt each other.

177
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:16,069
You...

178
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:33,330
You're such a coward.

179
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:35,265
Wait.

180
00:15:36,533 --> 00:15:37,401
Wolhee.

181
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:39,942
Wolhee.

182
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:46,443
Master Ma.

183
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:48,827
It was not my intention
to be in the scene.

184
00:15:49,146 --> 00:15:50,213
You.

185
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:53,389
I suggest you keep quiet for your sake.

186
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:09,790
How many did I do?

187
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,241
You did 25 times.

188
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:18,675
Are there many attendants
around the Crown Prince?

189
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,217
Yes.

190
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:26,416
He must want to spend time alone at times.

191
00:16:29,171 --> 00:16:33,008
He takes a walk alone
in the garden sometimes.

192
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:35,555
The garden?

193
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:38,829
How many did I do?

194
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:46,503
Where did she go?

195
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,545
Are you not the Crown Prince?

196
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,337
You do remember me, right?

197
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:41,625
I remember you.

198
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:45,259
What brings you here?

199
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,532
I was on my way to see the Princess...

200
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,200
Did you get lost again?

201
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,040
Such beautiful flowers led my way here.

202
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:01,211
It is not a place where you can be led.

203
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:06,583
Did Myungeun tell you about
the hole that led you here?

204
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:08,085
Pardon me?

205
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:14,191
You don't think
I came through a hole, do you?

206
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,738
It all went wrong.

207
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:34,811
My plan was to pretend
that I ran into you accidentally.

208
00:18:35,812 --> 00:18:37,581
That you ran into me accidentally?

209
00:18:38,982 --> 00:18:41,585
There's nothing I can do now
that you found out.

210
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:51,661
According to "Classic of Changes,"

211
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,265
training one's body and mind is important,

212
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:57,667
but one must rest when it gets dark.

213
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:01,338
"Book of Documents" says
one must guard oneself from complacency,

214
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:04,875
but must know the difficulties first.

215
00:19:07,144 --> 00:19:08,678
You mean I should fully rest
when I am resting?

216
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,650
Yes.

217
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,450
If it is all right with you,

218
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,453
why don't you
take a walk with me for a while?

219
00:19:57,394 --> 00:20:01,198
"No, thank you.
There is no specific reason"?

220
00:20:01,865 --> 00:20:03,333
I feel terrible.

221
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:07,838
Why then did he smile in the first place?

222
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:10,907
It was too charming.

223
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:32,573
I...

224
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:35,999
I am Ma Jongja.

225
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:41,792
Jongja? Get me some food.

226
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,142
I said I am Ma Jongja!

227
00:20:54,418 --> 00:20:55,258
Come out.

228
00:20:57,928 --> 00:20:59,289
Come out now!

229
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,342
Please come out, Wol...

230
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:14,671
He is crazy.

231
00:21:15,605 --> 00:21:17,274
I can't believe him.

232
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,245
Why are you following me?

233
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:25,949
You'd better leave Wolhee alone.

234
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,404
It's just that...

235
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,376
...I was worried about you.

236
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:34,068
You are in no position to worry about me.

237
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:36,121
You're pretending.

238
00:21:41,298 --> 00:21:42,299
Are you okay?

239
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:54,877
It's fine as long as you're not dead.

240
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,314
Act like a man.

241
00:22:11,128 --> 00:22:13,630
Byeongyeon,
once a girl becomes a court lady,

242
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:15,265
can she not take it back?

243
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:17,601
I'm talking about the palace attendants.

244
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:21,004
It's impossible
without the King's permission.

245
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:27,210
I will pretend that I did not hear it,

246
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:29,246
so do not mention it again.

247
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,050
Did you hear everything?

248
00:22:34,685 --> 00:22:37,654
-There must be a way...
-That is against the law.

249
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:42,859
Yes, it is against the law,

250
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:48,699
but you can do nothing about
where your heart wants to go.

251
00:23:23,266 --> 00:23:24,106
You.

252
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:29,673
You ran away after hitting my neck.

253
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:30,819
Do you wish to die?

254
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,764
I did not hit you.

255
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:37,014
You made the worst decision that day.

256
00:23:37,528 --> 00:23:40,417
You went to her place
after drinking and shouted,

257
00:23:40,784 --> 00:23:42,552
-"Come out, Wol..."
-Stop it.

258
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:50,093
What do you want to do, Master?

259
00:23:50,727 --> 00:23:51,728
Who?

260
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:53,169
Me?

261
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:55,728
What can I do?

262
00:24:00,952 --> 00:24:02,587
I cannot do anything.

263
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:11,733
Do you want me to help you?

264
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,088
Do you want me to be killed?

265
00:24:18,106 --> 00:24:20,308
What if I have a good idea?

266
00:24:27,682 --> 00:24:31,419
The Office of Famine Relief
got attacked and robbed.

267
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,024
And Minister Kim of Taxation
wishes to resign?

268
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:41,696
It was the right decision
as the person in charge.

269
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:45,887
I heard he smuggled rice
stored for emergency,

270
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,802
making people resent him.

271
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:52,140
Why are these facts not written in here?

272
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,644
Why are you blinded
by what ignorant people say,

273
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:59,847
focusing only on small mistakes
the officials made?

274
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:03,451
Have you not heard...

275
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:06,788
...who attacked the Office of Famine Relief?

276
00:25:08,483 --> 00:25:11,018
Tell me who they are.

277
00:25:11,518 --> 00:25:14,696
Those who caused
the recent suspicious attacks...

278
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,865
...were wearing this mask.

279
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,136
The pivotal figure of the group...

280
00:25:23,204 --> 00:25:24,706
...is Hong Gyeongnae.

281
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,514
He is already dead.

282
00:25:33,748 --> 00:25:39,754
That is why they're desperately looking
for his children.

283
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:41,089
What did you say?

284
00:25:42,223 --> 00:25:45,727
Are those men looking for his children,

285
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,829
to make them as the new pivotal figures?

286
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:52,500
I could not tell you until now,
because I was concerned about your health.

287
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:57,939
But the group
is moving suspiciously lately.

288
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:00,708
Arrest all of them.

289
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:05,847
What happened in the past
must never repeat itself.

290
00:26:14,462 --> 00:26:17,198
Jahyeondang

291
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,943
Byeongyeon.
Are you worried about something?

292
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,786
Sewing is the best to get rid
of unnecessary thoughts.

293
00:26:45,219 --> 00:26:47,055
-Could you help...
-Be quiet.

294
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:52,160
Fine, I didn't expect
you would help me anyway.

295
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:55,430
And this is not as easy as you think.

296
00:26:56,331 --> 00:27:00,234
You probably can't put
a thread through a needle.

297
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:24,158
You are really amazing.

298
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,961
You know how to use your body.

299
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,266
-Turn off the lights so we can sleep.
-Byeongyeon.

300
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:36,437
When a man puts
a thread through a needle once...

301
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:40,174
Could you also do this one?

302
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,615
Come on, Byeonyeon!

303
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:57,158
How could you say that?

304
00:27:57,558 --> 00:27:59,494
-My...
-Stop it at once.

305
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:04,966
Your Highness.

306
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:20,315
You are not going to speak no matter what.

307
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:21,822
Is that what you mean?

308
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,157
That is fine, if you cannot trust me.

309
00:28:30,245 --> 00:28:31,526
Where shall I send you?

310
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:33,393
Office of Eunuch Attendants?
Department of Justice?

311
00:28:38,251 --> 00:28:41,602
-Bring Chief Eunuch Han.
-Your Highness.

312
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:45,807
Some ignorant eunuchs
were talking nonsense.

313
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:49,043
They must've criticized me
instead of talking nonsense.

314
00:28:49,777 --> 00:28:52,080
The Crown Prince
cannot be complimented all the time.

315
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,816
Tell me.

316
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:58,152
They said...

317
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:02,790
...the Crown Prince... likes men.

318
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:09,581
How could they say
something so blasphemous?

319
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,641
Goodness.

320
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:21,609
That is not serious.

321
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,411
It's all right.

322
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:26,080
You did not have
to fight for such a thing.

323
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:29,317
They say you look
at Eunuch Hong so warmly.

324
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,952
I said it is all right.

325
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,754
They say the rumor
is all over the palace.

326
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,197
They say you treat him
like he is your lover.

327
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,190
Enough!

328
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:40,128
As you will be taking
the sovereignty soon,

329
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:43,865
I was worried it might harm you.
I had to defend you.

330
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:46,834
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

331
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:22,203
What is this?

332
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:24,339
It is nothing.

333
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,275
Tell me what this is.

334
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:44,258
What are you trying to do?

335
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:46,659
If you do not tell me
in the count of three...

336
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:51,666
It will tell the truth
so that no one gets hurt.

337
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:56,638
I warned you not to care about
Eunuch Ma's business.

338
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:59,707
I will not do anything against the law.

339
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,712
It is useless.

340
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,585
Showing how you feel
will not change anything.

341
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:16,958
You don't stretch your arms

342
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:18,559
thinking you will reach the sky.

343
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,867
Everyone knows the court ladies
are for the King.

344
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:30,905
Then?

345
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,008
I know it is useless,

346
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,311
but you can't help
falling in love with someone.

347
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,147
Even if nothing changes,

348
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:41,950
you still hope that person
knows your feelings.

349
00:31:50,438 --> 00:31:54,262
Professing your love
only to make yourself at ease,

350
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:57,632
is such a selfish thing to do.

351
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:04,038
Is it wrong to profess for someone
you cannot be with?

352
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:09,944
A proper farewell is as sincere as love.

353
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:12,814
Who knows if the memory of being loved,

354
00:32:14,358 --> 00:32:18,019
could give you strength
to go on with your life?

355
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:28,396
You would never understand
how it must feel, though.

356
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:53,717
Goodness. You say whatever you want to say

357
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:56,971
and you cannot stand losing to a man.

358
00:32:57,592 --> 00:32:59,861
What should I do with you?

359
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:03,631
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

360
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,971
Who would adore
a pampered daughter-in-law like you?

361
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,275
A daughter-in-law?

362
00:33:25,887 --> 00:33:26,821
My Lord.

363
00:33:30,892 --> 00:33:33,194
I needed to sit under this tree as well.

364
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:38,800
Who is it? Who upset you so much?

365
00:33:42,036 --> 00:33:45,340
It is myself who makes me angry the most.

366
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:53,514
I think I only burden His Highness.
I feel terrible.

367
00:33:56,351 --> 00:33:58,586
As a eunuch, do you mean?

368
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:01,595
Of course.

369
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:08,563
It may be because you do not belong there.

370
00:34:10,537 --> 00:34:14,335
That eunuch's attire
does not suit you, either.

371
00:34:26,658 --> 00:34:27,849
My Lord.

372
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:31,686
Aren't these you bought
for someone special?

373
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,454
That is right.

374
00:34:34,856 --> 00:34:38,860
I was waiting for the day
for her to accept gladly.

375
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:41,743
Why did you bring it?

376
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:47,235
I am planning to ask her today.

377
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:01,049
Do you not wish to live as a woman?

378
00:35:07,468 --> 00:35:09,557
Did Councilor Kim suggest that?

379
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,651
Do not be surprised.
You are no longer a child.

380
00:35:16,655 --> 00:35:19,992
Councilor Kim has such
a reliable grandson.

381
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:25,789
You have not given him the answer,
have you?

382
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:28,767
What is it? Do you not want to marry him?

383
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,305
I am baffled as it is unexpected.

384
00:35:37,326 --> 00:35:38,427
Father.

385
00:35:39,327 --> 00:35:41,429
If I must marry someone,

386
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,666
I would like to marry someone I want.

387
00:35:58,163 --> 00:36:01,199
I am comfortable living like this.

388
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:05,888
Even if you keep pretending,
it's too dangerous here.

389
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:08,043
You know that.

390
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:15,933
I will help you leave the palace
and live as a woman.

391
00:36:17,421 --> 00:36:18,455
I mean...

392
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,073
Could you let me do that for you?

393
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:29,181
I have wanted to tell you this
since the day I bought these clothes.

394
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:35,353
My Lord, I...

395
00:36:37,055 --> 00:36:42,694
I will wait until you understand
what you truly want.

396
00:37:13,374 --> 00:37:16,244
The Court Lady's Man

397
00:37:16,328 --> 00:37:19,831
Dohwa is the prettiest girl
in the entire country.

398
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:24,269
She becomes a court lady
to be the king's woman.

399
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:30,108
I, Dohwa, do not like an easy man!

400
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:34,212
For ten years, the king doesn't visit her.

401
00:37:34,746 --> 00:37:40,018
Instead, Eunuch Wang
chases her wherever she goes.

402
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:46,992
Stop. Do not come any closer to me.

403
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,030
Do you think I came
to the palace to see a eunuch?

404
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:59,838
However, the only one she can rely on
in the palace is Eunuch Wang.

405
00:38:10,048 --> 00:38:12,217
-She is here.
-Is she here?

406
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:31,870
What are they so excited about?

407
00:38:31,937 --> 00:38:34,239
The off-duty court ladies
gathered together.

408
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:37,375
Some eunuch trainees
are performing for them.

409
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:41,680
I cannot believe it.
In times like these...

410
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:43,548
Who are they?

411
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,252
You know him.
I think his name was Hong Samnom.

412
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:49,020
The one who used to be
in a performance troupe.

413
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,190
Hong Samnom?

414
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:53,658
Yes, Master.

415
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:02,841
Finally, she has been chosen by the king.

416
00:39:03,311 --> 00:39:08,082
But all she can think of is Eunuch Wang.

417
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:17,015
You used to tell me how much you like me.

418
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:19,211
Why can't you say it?

419
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:22,734
Why can't you say I am your woman?

420
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:25,661
What can I do?

421
00:39:26,562 --> 00:39:28,029
A court lady and a eunuch
cannot be together.

422
00:39:30,128 --> 00:39:32,431
Are you sure you can live
without seeing me?

423
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:34,572
I will see you.

424
00:39:35,872 --> 00:39:38,908
We both are meant
to live in the palace until we die.

425
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:44,337
I am leaving.

426
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:47,108
I will not come back to you.

427
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:49,880
Fine. Go!

428
00:39:50,275 --> 00:39:51,643
Go and live however you'd like.

429
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:55,821
You'll only die if you stay with me!

430
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:01,801
But...

431
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:07,646
I wanted to tell you this
for the last time.

432
00:40:11,299 --> 00:40:15,003
I wanted to say this out loud
in front of people!

433
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:21,847
I love you!

434
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:30,355
I love you with all my heart!

435
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:41,123
Did you hear me?

436
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:44,004
Did you hear how much I care about you?

437
00:40:53,979 --> 00:40:58,750
You are only one
of many court ladies to His Majesty.

438
00:41:02,654 --> 00:41:04,122
But to me,

439
00:41:04,656 --> 00:41:07,259
you mean the whole world!

440
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,111
You heard me, right?

441
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:43,628
Is it wrong to profess
for someone you cannot be with?

442
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:49,000
A proper farewell is as sincere as love.

443
00:41:50,035 --> 00:41:51,436
Who knows if the memory of being loved,

444
00:41:52,838 --> 00:41:56,274
could give you strength
to go on with your life?

445
00:42:32,295 --> 00:42:34,163
What are you doing right now?

446
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:37,482
Are you not aware of the situation?

447
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:42,354
Whoever planned this, step forward.

448
00:43:17,456 --> 00:43:20,425
What brings you
to Junggungjeon at this hour?

449
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,796
You never came to see me,

450
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:27,132
even when I summoned you.

451
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:32,704
I took the bait you threw at me
and here I am.

452
00:43:34,806 --> 00:43:36,475
Now that you saw my face,

453
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:40,145
I will take him with me.

454
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:42,896
Get him up.

455
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:46,952
That cannot be done.

456
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,192
He, a mere eunuch trainee,

457
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:57,829
has done something presumptuous.

458
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:08,673
Do you not know every court lady
is for the King?

459
00:44:47,546 --> 00:44:48,980
Please do not be upset.

460
00:44:51,883 --> 00:44:54,152
A love story between
a eunuch and a court lady

461
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,955
is very common for a revue as you know.

462
00:45:00,004 --> 00:45:01,293
They even say that the King...

463
00:45:02,144 --> 00:45:06,281
...is a fool who lets the Queen control him
like a puppet and that he is a womanizer.

464
00:45:07,811 --> 00:45:09,813
Would you like to punish all of them?

465
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:12,137
Crown Prince!

466
00:45:14,372 --> 00:45:15,373
Stand up.

467
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,516
I do not deserve your mercy,
Your Highness.

468
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,618
I said, stand up!

469
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:32,224
His Majesty cannot sleep
as riots increase every day.

470
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:40,899
Are you not afraid
of the rumors about you?

471
00:45:50,308 --> 00:45:51,243
I think that is enough.

472
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:56,548
It was a mistake
a mere eunuch trainee made.

473
00:45:57,582 --> 00:45:59,484
If you keep showing
your emotions like that,

474
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:04,656
it will make things complicated.

475
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:15,000
Let's go.

476
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,612
Your Highness, are you all right?

477
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:31,083
Those aren't the eyes for a eunuch.

478
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,319
They are the eyes

479
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:38,123
of a man looking at his lover.

480
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:53,205
Your Highness,
you did well in refraining from anger.

481
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:56,108
The Queen intended
to provoke you with Eunuch Hong.

482
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:00,746
Anyway, I am relieved, Your Highness.

483
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:29,741
What's wrong with wanting to keep
my favorite eunuch?

484
00:47:32,377 --> 00:47:34,946
As you will be taking
the sovereignty soon,

485
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:39,718
I was worried it might harm you.
I had to defend you.

486
00:47:41,586 --> 00:47:44,589
Are you not afraid
of the rumors about you?

487
00:47:58,670 --> 00:47:59,805
Do you think this is a joke?

488
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:02,174
Are you trying to tease me?

489
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:05,811
You must take off your pants
for the test.

490
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:07,913
This is frustrating.

491
00:48:09,514 --> 00:48:10,515
In fact...

492
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,986
Master Sung,
I have something to tell you.

493
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,788
No, you don't.

494
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:22,828
I said take off your pants right now.

495
00:48:24,496 --> 00:48:27,566
In fact, I am...

496
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:30,535
I am...

497
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,074
What is it now?

498
00:48:37,843 --> 00:48:38,844
It is nothing.

499
00:48:41,313 --> 00:48:42,814
Someone sent croakers as a gift.

500
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:46,197
The Queen said to send it
to Premier Kim's house.

501
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:48,858
-Never mind. I will go...
-Stop.

502
00:48:50,756 --> 00:48:51,890
Why would you go there?

503
00:48:52,824 --> 00:48:54,359
I am the eunuch serving the Queen.

504
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,660
I thought you were busy.

505
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:56,801
My...

506
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:01,933
Examine his body for me.

507
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:04,275
Check everything.

508
00:49:04,736 --> 00:49:05,737
Yes.

509
00:49:29,407 --> 00:49:30,675
Pass

510
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:50,015
How long have you known about this?

511
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:52,417
Since the King's birthday festival.

512
00:49:58,457 --> 00:49:59,491
I am sorry.

513
00:50:01,593 --> 00:50:04,496
I accept your apology.

514
00:50:08,066 --> 00:50:09,067
Thank you.

515
00:50:15,911 --> 00:50:18,944
Watching you two brought me comfort.

516
00:50:20,345 --> 00:50:21,346
Why?

517
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,818
You got away with it this time,

518
00:50:27,385 --> 00:50:30,722
but the palace
is not safe even for the King.

519
00:50:32,057 --> 00:50:33,058
You know that, right?

520
00:50:35,927 --> 00:50:36,928
Yes, Master.

521
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:40,665
I guess I should leave...

522
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,901
...if I could.

523
00:51:14,299 --> 00:51:16,902
Straighten up your shoulders
and look at me.

524
00:51:19,638 --> 00:51:22,741
Your Highness,
this is how a eunuch must stand.

525
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:24,209
I know.

526
00:51:25,644 --> 00:51:27,479
Did anyone scold you

527
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:30,549
for walking next to me
and looking at me in the eyes?

528
00:51:32,947 --> 00:51:34,015
No, Your Highness.

529
00:51:34,152 --> 00:51:35,153
If not,

530
00:51:36,169 --> 00:51:38,205
I assume you are upset with me.

531
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,304
Your Highness.

532
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:55,874
Do not be too kind to me.

533
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,816
I cannot be your friend or anything else.

534
00:52:06,017 --> 00:52:11,323
You cannot be my friend or anything else.

535
00:52:13,191 --> 00:52:17,629
I was told that a eunuch
must be one step behind you,

536
00:52:18,764 --> 00:52:22,300
and that I must not go
any closer or farther.

537
00:52:24,035 --> 00:52:25,537
You are my person.

538
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:29,641
Who can decide the distance between us?

539
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:36,681
Please treat me
as you treat other eunuchs.

540
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,020
That will make me grateful enough.

541
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,475
I know it is useless,

542
00:53:03,716 --> 00:53:05,785
but you can't help
falling in love with someone.

543
00:53:06,643 --> 00:53:08,045
Even if nothing changes,

544
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:10,902
you still hope the person
knows your feelings.

545
00:53:39,676 --> 00:53:41,645
Do you not wish to live as a woman?

546
00:53:44,715 --> 00:53:48,652
I guess I should leave if I could.

547
00:54:19,374 --> 00:54:22,210
Your Highness, did you wish to see me?

548
00:54:42,306 --> 00:54:44,107
I told a lie.

549
00:54:48,645 --> 00:54:50,214
When I told you to stay by me,

550
00:54:51,982 --> 00:54:53,951
I wasn't talking to a eunuch.

551
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:06,897
Why in the world did I say that to you?

552
00:55:11,568 --> 00:55:14,004
I needed to calm
this outrageous confusion,

553
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:19,009
so I questioned myself endlessly
every night.

554
00:55:22,112 --> 00:55:23,680
And I have found the answer.

555
00:55:39,163 --> 00:55:40,197
Your Highness.

556
00:55:41,331 --> 00:55:43,634
What are you doing?

557
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:49,706
I am the Crown Prince,

558
00:55:51,875 --> 00:55:53,043
and I am a man.

559
00:55:54,778 --> 00:55:56,046
I am also a human.

560
00:56:01,285 --> 00:56:02,352
I...

561
00:56:03,754 --> 00:56:05,189
I love you.

562
00:56:10,727 --> 00:56:11,962
That is my answer.

563
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:22,806
Wait... But...

564
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:25,909
What are you doing?

565
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,112
Silver Spoon, you are the Crown Prince.

566
00:56:29,746 --> 00:56:32,616
How could you like a man?
I mean, a eunuch?

567
00:56:33,283 --> 00:56:34,418
You must not.

568
00:56:36,086 --> 00:56:38,088
Do not say my feelings are wrong.

569
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,627
You said so yourself

570
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:47,197
that you can't do anything about

571
00:56:48,632 --> 00:56:50,701
where your heart may go.

572
00:56:51,902 --> 00:56:52,903
Sorry?

573
00:56:56,373 --> 00:56:57,374
Yes, I did.

574
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:00,310
But...

575
00:57:02,146 --> 00:57:07,251
Even with love,
there is good love and bad love.

576
00:57:08,185 --> 00:57:10,954
This is... Anyone can see...

577
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:14,057
No one will bless...

578
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:17,461
-It is forbidden...
-I know.

579
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:19,863
However,

580
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:22,900
I plan to do it.

581
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:26,403
That bad love.
