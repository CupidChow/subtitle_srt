1
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:11,521
Did you know?

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,391
That is right.

3
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:19,719
Did you...

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,990
At the garden...

5
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,503
You knew everything.

6
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,673
Were you teasing me?

7
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,352
Hong Samnom.

8
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,955
She is in the palace now.

9
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,760
She was sold off by the creditors.

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,667
I am sorry.

11
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,041
However,

12
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,977
I did not do that out of disrespect.

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,689
At first, I resented you,

14
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,854
but then I was happy.

15
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,858
And then I could not say anything.

16
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,471
When I sat comfortably in a palanquin,

17
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,706
you walked.

18
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,743
When I walked,

19
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:53,819
you held the parasol
until your arms failed.

20
00:01:56,889 --> 00:01:58,791
I sat on silk,

21
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,410
but you sat on dirt.

22
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:06,774
How could I say
I cherished you as a woman?

23
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,673
I am a eunuch that serves you,

24
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:23,611
so it is only natural.

25
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:34,354
But it is not how a man treats his lover.

26
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:49,405
I will now treat you like
the most precious lady in the world.

27
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:58,667
I shall block the wind
and the sunlight for you.

28
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,018
I shall cherish you.

29
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,477
May I do that?

30
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,069
Yes,

31
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:30,403
I am a woman.

32
00:04:33,843 --> 00:04:34,877
But...

33
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,906
...I have never lived as a woman.

34
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,621
You can live that way from now on.

35
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,343
I cannot.

36
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,493
I was where I did not belong

37
00:04:58,828 --> 00:05:00,563
and did what I shouldn't have.

38
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:02,393
I am sorry.

39
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:05,563
I do not wish to harm...

40
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,790
I am not blaming you.

41
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:10,571
I am blaming myself
for not recognizing you sooner.

42
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:12,070
-So...
-Your Highness.

43
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:22,584
I must go now
to the Office of Eunuch Discipline.

44
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:58,671
I will now treat you like
the most precious lady in the world.

45
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes,

46
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:09,459
I am a woman.

47
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:12,730
But...

48
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,486
I have never lived as a woman.

49
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:29,080
Jahyeondang

50
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:30,424
There is a rumor
Hong Gyeongnae's daughter is alive.

51
00:07:31,142 --> 00:07:32,210
If it is true,

52
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:34,952
we must find her

53
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,094
before Councilor Kim.

54
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:40,765
You must find her before anyone else.

55
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:44,751
It will help recollect
the power that has split up.

56
00:07:45,023 --> 00:07:47,102
Do not be like that.

57
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,993
I like you, Byeongyeon.

58
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:15,086
CHAPTER 9
When the Heart's Lock Is Opened

59
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,189
Jahyeondang

60
00:08:37,742 --> 00:08:40,979
Byeongyeon, do you have
something on your mind?

61
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:44,700
I do not.

62
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:48,353
I have a question.

63
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,724
What is it?

64
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:57,729
What did you do
before you became a eunuch?

65
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,801
Did I not tell you
that I was in a performance troupe?

66
00:09:03,735 --> 00:09:04,736
Before then?

67
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,806
I lived with my mother.

68
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,209
What about your father?

69
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,915
I was told he passed away...

70
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,750
...when I was very young.

71
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:22,754
I do not even know his name.

72
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,831
All I have is my mother in my memory.

73
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:33,765
It must have been difficult.

74
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,405
Why do you ask about my past?

75
00:09:41,573 --> 00:09:42,574
Do you still...

76
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,045
...like the palace?

77
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:04,557
Hong Samnom.

78
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,198
What nonsense is that?

79
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:10,502
We are swamped because
the Crown Prince became busy.

80
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,971
I am sorry, Master.

81
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,450
I thought you would last longer.

82
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,343
What? You cannot stand it?

83
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,844
Should I transfer you?

84
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:23,481
We can't vacate the spot
without his permission.

85
00:10:24,388 --> 00:10:26,684
I shall try to fill that vacancy.

86
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,353
May I chip in as well?

87
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,189
You brats are clueless.

88
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,233
None of the officials
appeared at the first assembly

89
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:35,984
after the Crown Prince
took the throne in the interim.

90
00:10:39,034 --> 00:10:41,103
What did I tell you?

91
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,399
Did I not say being the interim king

92
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,105
could be his demise
if he does not do well?

93
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:48,773
Eunuch Sung!

94
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,932
Did you hear that?

95
00:10:54,546 --> 00:10:58,149
Acts like these
bring criticism to His Highness.

96
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:02,087
I shall keep that in mind.

97
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:08,660
Your Majesty!
The exam held every three years...

98
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,864
...is the only way for men
from suburbs to prove themselves.

99
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,500
Please conduct
the state examination as scheduled,

100
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:19,037
and let us show the skills
we have gained.

101
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:21,821
Please be understanding, Your Majesty!

102
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,776
Please be understanding, Your Majesty!

103
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:27,912
Do you not feel
the sorrow of these students...

104
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,781
...who looked only to the exam?

105
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,484
Crown Prince.

106
00:11:33,084 --> 00:11:36,087
Is there any way to console them?

107
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:39,390
When you open a path,

108
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,260
you must open the gate at the end of it.

109
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,631
How can you call the exam an opportunity,

110
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,631
when the successful applicants
have been predetermined?

111
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,904
Your Highness. Please be prudent.

112
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:56,908
The future of hundreds
depends on your whim.

113
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,685
Donggungjeon

114
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:25,670
I do not see Eunuch Hong.

115
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:29,464
That is what I would like to say.

116
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,087
You cherished him all this time.

117
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:34,947
How did you scold him?

118
00:12:35,994 --> 00:12:36,995
Why?

119
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:39,493
Did he refuse to come to Donggungjeon?

120
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:40,997
Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,781
He's volunteering
for all the harsh assignments,

122
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,873
to work outside of Donggungjeon.

123
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:49,147
And?

124
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:52,289
Where is he now?

125
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:56,402
Hide while I count to ten.

126
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,671
One.

127
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:01,407
My lady.

128
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,544
Did you run out of paper and brushes?

129
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,681
I have brought them.

130
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:14,219
Are you playing right now?

131
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,457
I will wait, so go on and hide.

132
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,260
Here I come.

133
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,538
Princess, please come out.

134
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:11,110
Princess, where are you? Princess!

135
00:15:04,874 --> 00:15:06,365
I heard from Eunuch Jang.

136
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:12,858
Did you try to run away from me?

137
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:17,642
Yes, Your Highness.

138
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,613
Why is that?

139
00:15:23,615 --> 00:15:26,351
I deceived the Office of Eunuch Attendants
and the palace.

140
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,754
Now that you know everything,

141
00:15:31,656 --> 00:15:33,525
I do not know how to face you.

142
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,329
I just can't.

143
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:40,999
Do you not know,

144
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:47,639
that I want you to take a step closer
as yourself and not as eunuch?

145
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:52,911
And do you truly not know?

146
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,615
How could someone as lowly as I am,

147
00:15:57,849 --> 00:16:00,619
pretending to be a man
and defying palace laws,

148
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:07,359
stay by your side, if not as a eunuch?

149
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:11,663
That is...

150
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:17,747
Princess!

151
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:19,604
Princess!

152
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,706
Princess!

153
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:25,410
Have you still not found the Princess?

154
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:28,313
No. I shouted several times

155
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,482
for her to come out, but she has not.

156
00:16:31,771 --> 00:16:33,785
Where did you see her last?

157
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,954
Princess!

158
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:37,656
Princess!

159
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:39,858
Princess!

160
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:41,560
Princess!

161
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,694
Princess!

162
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:44,396
Princess!

163
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:51,903
Princess.

164
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:14,426
Princess?

165
00:17:24,469 --> 00:17:27,405
Princess. It's me, Eunuch Hong.

166
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,608
Princess!

167
00:17:58,436 --> 00:17:59,276
Princess!

168
00:18:00,138 --> 00:18:02,607
Princess! Are you all right?

169
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:03,732
Princess!

170
00:18:08,977 --> 00:18:11,149
She could not even ask for help.

171
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,819
She must have been very frightened.

172
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,442
I am so relieved that Eunuch Hong
found her at last.

173
00:18:24,924 --> 00:18:30,730
She used to be so cheerful
and chatter away like a bird.

174
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,587
It must be frustrating for her
not being able to speak.

175
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:47,396
She was able to smile and be this well
because you taught her how to write.

176
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,288
Three Years Earlier

177
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:06,758
I will write it once,

178
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:08,909
so guess what it is.

179
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:12,134
This time,

180
00:19:12,747 --> 00:19:15,504
I will write your favorite season.

181
00:19:43,497 --> 00:19:48,638
Does she still not remember
anything from that day?

182
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,551
No.

183
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,856
It must have been
too difficult for this small body...

184
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,457
...to fight the illness,

185
00:19:59,126 --> 00:20:00,927
seeing how she erased...

186
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:03,697
...those few days that she was ill
with a fever.

187
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,477
Yunseong.

188
00:20:20,614 --> 00:20:22,482
Where are you going?

189
00:20:23,383 --> 00:20:24,684
I am going to the palace.

190
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,454
What? To the palace?

191
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,159
Everyone vacated the palace
to tame the Crown Prince.

192
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:33,860
What are you talking about?

193
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:37,197
Thus, I want to go.

194
00:20:38,665 --> 00:20:40,233
How dare you?

195
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:42,969
Yunseong.

196
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,447
Do you pity the Crown Prince
who used to be a friend?

197
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:57,818
I believe his decision is right.

198
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,820
I see.

199
00:20:59,986 --> 00:21:03,090
Everyone thinks that justice
is right at first.

200
00:21:03,156 --> 00:21:04,324
However,

201
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,495
what is right is not always
the best for the people.

202
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:14,668
To be honest, I disagree.

203
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:21,875
How does expanding our family's power
help make the people happy?

204
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:27,080
Do you think people can coexist
by sharing the power?

205
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:30,584
It will only create unnecessary fights.

206
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:35,055
Politics is not about
becoming friends with the people.

207
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:40,127
Those with power must reign
and lead the people.

208
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:45,766
Is becoming in-laws with Minister Cho
another means to maintaining that power?

209
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,602
It is.

210
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,039
Please find other means.

211
00:21:53,373 --> 00:21:55,108
I do not wish to marry her for that.

212
00:21:57,878 --> 00:22:00,147
I wish to marry a woman
with whom I can converse,

213
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,916
and share my feelings.

214
00:22:07,821 --> 00:22:09,956
I shall excuse myself, Grandfather.

215
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:34,481
I kept visiting the bookstore
at the market,

216
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:39,119
so the Princess lent me books
from the palace library.

217
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:43,657
That is right. You said you enjoy reading.

218
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,630
But there is more...

219
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:52,866
...to why I come to palace.

220
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:55,714
Sorry?

221
00:22:56,618 --> 00:23:02,075
The man I told you about before
is in this palace,

222
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:05,145
and is very close to you.

223
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:15,622
The Crown Prince.

224
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:39,579
Why do you not speak?

225
00:23:39,913 --> 00:23:41,348
Are you that surprised?

226
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:46,753
Yes, I am surprised.

227
00:23:47,354 --> 00:23:51,124
He says only what he must and leaves.

228
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:54,394
I am exhausted from finding excuses.

229
00:24:11,878 --> 00:24:15,015
That. I saw that as well.

230
00:24:19,553 --> 00:24:22,422
They say if you share the bracelets,

231
00:24:22,489 --> 00:24:25,492
you will meet again
even if you are parted.

232
00:24:28,061 --> 00:24:31,998
I did not know it held such a meaning.

233
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:36,370
Did you receive it
without knowing the meaning?

234
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,108
Whoever it is,
she must be as clueless as I,

235
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,444
giving a man a gift like this.

236
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:14,608
I will now treat you like
the most precious lady in the world.

237
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:20,480
-Try it.
-It is my turn.

238
00:25:21,782 --> 00:25:23,483
I am very good at this.

239
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:25,685
Your turn.

240
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,269
How long must I live as a boy?

241
00:25:44,622 --> 00:25:45,489
Keep it down.

242
00:25:45,972 --> 00:25:48,341
Until I am 10? 20?

243
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:50,068
Until I die?

244
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:52,913
Raon.

245
00:25:53,447 --> 00:25:55,115
It is not time yet.

246
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:59,086
I told you to wait a little while longer.

247
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,455
Tell me why.

248
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,943
When will you tell me?

249
00:26:04,722 --> 00:26:06,991
Will you not tell me that
before I die, either?

250
00:26:42,806 --> 00:26:46,276
I guess word spread
that the Royal Court is a mess.

251
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:49,003
Yes.

252
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:52,539
Because you canceled
the state examination,

253
00:26:53,560 --> 00:27:00,560
the students' days supposedly
begin and end with cursing you.

254
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:09,408
Do you plan to conduct
the special exam as planned?

255
00:27:11,585 --> 00:27:13,320
I have already begun this battle.

256
00:27:14,994 --> 00:27:17,396
You cannot lose
since you are the Crown Prince.

257
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,208
My grandfather used to say,

258
00:27:23,802 --> 00:27:30,677
"Fighting with your spouse to win
is a shortcut to the family's demise."

259
00:27:32,412 --> 00:27:34,748
Why are you bringing up
the fight with your spouse?

260
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:37,050
I am sure you wanted at first...

261
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:39,512
...to correct the wrongs
of the state examination,

262
00:27:39,603 --> 00:27:41,922
and pick competent people
who would help you.

263
00:27:44,566 --> 00:27:46,067
But what about now?

264
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,177
Is the objective of this fight victory...

265
00:27:54,401 --> 00:27:55,469
...or change?

266
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,641
It is...

267
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,546
It is very difficult not to lose your way.

268
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:35,642
Princess, it's me, Eunuch Hong.

269
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,561
I came to speak about myself,
so you may tell me to go if I annoy you.

270
00:28:46,353 --> 00:28:48,221
When you do not wish to speak,

271
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:51,525
why don't we exchange signals
with our hands?

272
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:54,728
Here. When you are happy, this.

273
00:28:55,107 --> 00:28:56,142
When you are unhappy...

274
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:08,975
Never mind.

275
00:29:10,043 --> 00:29:13,613
Even if I ask a question,
you do not need to answer me.

276
00:29:14,648 --> 00:29:15,649
The truth is...

277
00:29:18,281 --> 00:29:21,655
There are a lot that I am hiding as well.

278
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:31,498
I do not know what it is,

279
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:35,802
but I think I understand a little
how you feel.

280
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,261
You know why?

281
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:45,360
Because I am still trapped as well.

282
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,716
I am forced to hide,

283
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:55,856
and I shake in fear
that someone will open the door...

284
00:29:58,187 --> 00:29:59,693
And that I will be found.

285
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:13,314
When will we be able to open
the door ourselves and step out?

286
00:30:20,814 --> 00:30:22,983
How does it feel to be here?

287
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:26,987
Each department is busy with emergencies,

288
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:29,923
but it is so quiet here, is it not?

289
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,661
Did you summon me here to ask how I feel?

290
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:38,498
We will hold the state examination
as planned,

291
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,768
so why don't you return?

292
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:45,972
Do you mean it, Your Highness?

293
00:30:46,773 --> 00:30:48,441
Do you think I am lying?

294
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:54,047
I wanted to conduct a new examination,

295
00:30:54,547 --> 00:30:56,282
only to accomplish the goal
of the state examination,

296
00:30:56,402 --> 00:30:58,785
which was to find
the most qualified people.

297
00:30:59,986 --> 00:31:01,621
It was not to hinder the political affairs...

298
00:31:01,855 --> 00:31:03,790
...by causing a power struggle
with the officials.

299
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:07,093
Your Highness.

300
00:31:08,528 --> 00:31:13,466
Ignoring the process
in order to obtain the desired goal...

301
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:15,835
...is not the proper method.

302
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:22,575
If you would make the wise decision
to conduct everything as required,

303
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:28,948
we will surely return
and serve Your Highness.

304
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,451
Do not worry.

305
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:37,264
I will conduct the state examination
as you wish.

306
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:50,837
Here comes the question!

307
00:31:52,842 --> 00:31:55,575
Whose nation is Joseon?

308
00:32:06,115 --> 00:32:07,483
Wait.

309
00:32:07,587 --> 00:32:08,588
But...

310
00:32:12,647 --> 00:32:16,280
All rise for the Crown Prince!

311
00:32:48,097 --> 00:32:50,030
Here is the question!

312
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,642
What is this?

313
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:05,845
"An opposition to opposition."

314
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:07,714
"How will you convince the other?"

315
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,255
There is no set answer.

316
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:19,521
Be convincing with your ideas.

317
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,590
I desperately wait
for diverse and novel ideas...

318
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:28,819
...for the future of Joseon.

319
00:33:31,516 --> 00:33:32,517
Proceed.

320
00:33:40,642 --> 00:33:41,777
An opposition to opposition.

321
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:46,036
You are skillful...

322
00:34:47,644 --> 00:34:50,047
...at avoiding me.

323
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:54,767
You know me better than anyone,

324
00:34:56,391 --> 00:34:57,425
so if you mean to hide,

325
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,473
I have no way of finding.

326
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,543
There are too many eyes,

327
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:07,680
and too many ears on you, Your Highness.

328
00:35:09,014 --> 00:35:10,316
If you are with me,

329
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:13,853
you will not have a moment's peace.

330
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,821
Then...

331
00:35:17,823 --> 00:35:19,492
Do you think I will be at peace...

332
00:35:21,694 --> 00:35:22,862
...without you?

333
00:35:28,738 --> 00:35:29,739
Your Highness.

334
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:35,704
When I served you as a eunuch,

335
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:40,855
I felt I was useful a tenth of my time.

336
00:35:42,313 --> 00:35:43,414
But now,

337
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,244
I do not feel that way.

338
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,765
I am afraid...

339
00:35:52,423 --> 00:35:58,195
...I might put you in trouble
or cause you harm.

340
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:06,814
I am too worried
to take a single step closer to you.

341
00:36:33,496 --> 00:36:34,897
It is shameless to ask you this,

342
00:36:36,216 --> 00:36:37,751
but if you would let me leave the palace,

343
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:43,178
I shall be ever grateful.

344
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,865
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

345
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:55,673
Is that truly what you want?

346
00:36:59,621 --> 00:37:00,656
Yes, Your Highness.

347
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:05,976
There are thousands of things
I can and want to do for you.

348
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:10,247
But that is all you want from me.

349
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:15,305
Is running away to live without seeing me,

350
00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:18,032
the only thing you will ever ask of me?

351
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:25,670
Yes, Your Highness.

352
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,028
I understand.

353
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,750
You may go now.

354
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:17,429
Three Years Earlier

355
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:23,299
What is that?

356
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:54,318
What were you going
to deliver to the Crown Prince?

357
00:39:56,521 --> 00:40:01,356
Why? Is there anything
you do not want him to see?

358
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:04,028
If you believe,

359
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:07,532
you can bury the truth by killing me,

360
00:40:08,677 --> 00:40:10,234
do as you wish.

361
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:45,903
I shall stay here...

362
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:50,641
...even after I die.

363
00:40:51,809 --> 00:40:53,611
And I shall reveal the truth...

364
00:40:57,191 --> 00:41:02,520
...about the unjust death...

365
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,556
...of the Queen.

366
00:41:44,562 --> 00:41:45,763
Your Highness!

367
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,465
Your Highness!

368
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:49,534
Your Highness!

369
00:42:08,257 --> 00:42:10,388
Is that true? Is she unharmed?

370
00:42:10,655 --> 00:42:13,391
Yes, Your Highness. Her Highness is safe.

371
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:15,760
Let us go to Jipbokheon.

372
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:23,835
Your Highness.

373
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:27,705
Why did you really go there?

374
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,882
I am asking because
you disappeared suddenly,

375
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:40,885
so you do not have to answer
if you do not want.

376
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,851
You said before that you wonder

377
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:13,638
when we will be able to open
the door on our own and step out.

378
00:43:55,226 --> 00:43:56,360
I regret it.

379
00:44:01,365 --> 00:44:03,034
I should have pretended I did not know.

380
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:11,442
Had I known you'd always be looking
for a way out...

381
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:15,346
Had I known,

382
00:44:16,681 --> 00:44:20,485
I would not have struggled
with you being a eunuch or a woman.

383
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:25,957
I would have thought...

384
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:29,460
...about...

385
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:34,298
...how to keep you with me
as long as possible.

386
00:44:46,077 --> 00:44:48,045
I could not understand you better.

387
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,349
For that, I am sorry.

388
00:44:56,754 --> 00:44:58,022
Good day,

389
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:00,291
Your Highness.

390
00:45:10,601 --> 00:45:11,669
But...

391
00:45:21,363 --> 00:45:27,069
Could you not stay despite all of that?

392
00:45:33,758 --> 00:45:34,926
Can you not...

393
00:45:37,498 --> 00:45:38,499
...stay here...

394
00:45:42,191 --> 00:45:43,192
...beside me?

395
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:17,134
You are all grown up now, My Lord.

396
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:19,971
I did not expect you to pass the exam.

397
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:22,140
Dalbong.

398
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:25,676
Will I be all right in the palace
without you?

399
00:46:25,977 --> 00:46:28,513
You need to watch out
for the one at Mount Mongmyeok.

400
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:36,787
The Princess does not know my face.

401
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:39,123
You need to be careful not to get caught.

402
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:41,459
I shall do that.

403
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,928
Let me hug you.

404
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:46,097
Hold on.

405
00:46:46,264 --> 00:46:47,899
-You go this way.
-Yes, My Lord.

406
00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:49,367
I will go that way.

407
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,402
No, this way.

408
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:09,393
Your Highness!

409
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:11,823
Are you all right?

410
00:47:27,038 --> 00:47:28,105
I am fine.

411
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,587
She looks very familiar.

412
00:47:42,753 --> 00:47:46,524
She looks cold-hearted
with the sharp face.

413
00:47:46,924 --> 00:47:50,394
A maiden should look like the Princess.

414
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,698
With a pleasantly plump face.

415
00:47:53,798 --> 00:47:55,666
Why are you making me want to cry?

416
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:57,468
-Go on now.
-That hurts, My Lord...

417
00:48:00,403 --> 00:48:01,873
The exam was done well.

418
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:06,611
I heard you changed
the question on that day...

419
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:09,914
...and posed the final essay question.

420
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:14,452
Despite my efforts to make the exam fair,

421
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:16,858
7 out of 33 people who passed the exam,

422
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:19,235
are from your family.

423
00:48:22,195 --> 00:48:26,864
I am surprised that your family
has so many talented people.

424
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,496
Your Highness thinks
of my family so highly.

425
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:33,805
I am grateful, Your Highness.

426
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:37,900
I promise you...

427
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:46,289
...that I shall continue
to keep my principles,

428
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:47,993
and not accept any corruption.

429
00:48:49,273 --> 00:48:51,108
Based on their abilities alone.

430
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:11,397
Has every official
returned to the palace now?

431
00:49:12,343 --> 00:49:13,611
Yes, Your Majesty.

432
00:49:14,879 --> 00:49:20,251
They have been attending
every court assembly since then.

433
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,321
I am relieved.

434
00:49:24,922 --> 00:49:25,923
Chief Eunuch Han.

435
00:49:27,558 --> 00:49:31,662
Do you know why
I became an incompetent king?

436
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,468
It is because I did not have people.

437
00:49:38,302 --> 00:49:39,604
My people.

438
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,492
That is not true, Your Majesty.

439
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:46,944
It is true.

440
00:49:47,812 --> 00:49:50,915
There is no one
I can trust in this palace.

441
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:57,255
The six ministers, commanders,
censors, remonstrance officials.

442
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:00,280
They are all Councilor Kim's people.

443
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:08,402
I cannot let the Crown Prince
become like me.

444
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:13,070
I have to find people
who are truly loyal to him.

445
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,277
Chief Eunuch Han.

446
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:25,969
Prepare the marriage of the Crown Prince.

447
00:50:32,657 --> 00:50:34,892
Your Highness, where are you taking me?

448
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:36,494
Please tell me.

449
00:50:42,767 --> 00:50:43,768
Your Highness!

450
00:51:32,324 --> 00:51:35,564
It is useful to write in the Korean
you taught me.

451
00:51:35,655 --> 00:51:38,691
But Eunuch Hong's hand signals
are even better.

452
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:43,060
If everyone in the palace
learns the hand signals,

453
00:51:43,394 --> 00:51:45,096
you would not need this notebook any more...

454
00:51:45,586 --> 00:51:48,599
...since they would understand
what you want to say.

455
00:51:51,285 --> 00:51:53,220
Then please teach me.

456
00:52:00,949 --> 00:52:01,950
I...

457
00:52:04,286 --> 00:52:05,320
Like...

458
00:52:08,286 --> 00:52:09,453
You.

459
00:52:17,595 --> 00:52:18,596
No.

460
00:52:20,898 --> 00:52:22,266
I love you.

461
00:52:35,213 --> 00:52:36,280
So please...

462
00:52:57,347 --> 00:53:00,593
Eunuch Hong,
what hand signal should I use,

463
00:53:00,684 --> 00:53:02,353
when I ask someone not to leave?

464
00:53:09,147 --> 00:53:10,448
How about this?

465
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:11,816
Please watch me.

466
00:53:16,198 --> 00:53:17,321
Do not leave me.

467
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:19,390
Do not leave me.

468
00:53:26,105 --> 00:53:27,732
Stay with me.

469
00:53:31,435 --> 00:53:32,804
Stay with me.

470
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:20,651
Your Highness, what does this mean?

471
00:54:24,689 --> 00:54:26,424
It means you should stay away from me.

472
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:28,159
Yes, Your Highness.

473
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:05,663
When will we...

474
00:55:07,566 --> 00:55:10,735
...be able to open the door ourselves
and step out?

475
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:21,412
Tell me why.

476
00:55:22,307 --> 00:55:24,209
When will you tell me?

477
00:55:25,046 --> 00:55:26,184
When I am 10?

478
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:27,919
Twenty?

479
00:55:28,452 --> 00:55:30,955
Will you not tell me that
before I die, either?

480
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:42,960
Until you can protect yourself.

481
00:55:44,936 --> 00:55:47,939
When you're big enough
to be fine without me.

482
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,872
Then you can live as a girl.

483
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,229
Could you not stay...

484
00:56:09,501 --> 00:56:11,903
...despite all of that?

485
00:56:13,831 --> 00:56:18,770
Can you not stay here...

486
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,307
...beside me?

487
00:56:27,278 --> 00:56:28,279
Mom.

488
00:56:29,241 --> 00:56:30,809
I am good now, right?

489
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:33,918
For the past 10 years,

490
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:37,450
I did fine without you.

491
00:56:38,306 --> 00:56:41,909
I am all grown up now

492
00:56:42,342 --> 00:56:43,810
and capable of protecting myself.

493
00:57:53,835 --> 00:57:58,039
What shall I call you as a lady?

494
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,865
I am Hong Raon,

495
00:58:05,702 --> 00:58:06,770
Your Highness.

496
00:58:10,993 --> 00:58:12,695
Hong Raon.

497
00:58:24,398 --> 00:58:25,238
Raon.
