1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,771
I can never understand
young people these days.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,741
It used to be so difficult
to get in back in my days.

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,144
Isn't it frustrating?

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,680
He would've passed
if he'd written anything down.

5
00:00:14,193 --> 00:00:15,482
But he submitted a blank sheet,

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,317
saying he couldn't find the answer.

7
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:20,597
When is he leaving, then?

8
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:23,702
He will be removed
from the palace this afternoon.

9
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:26,468
What was the question?

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,800
Your Highness.

11
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,300
You need to go somewhere right now.

12
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,246
Pardon?

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,245
The Princess?

14
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,255
I've committed a mortal sin!

15
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,190
So you know.

16
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,563
Your Highness.

17
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:06,372
Yes.

18
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,369
I will kill you as you request.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,280
Stop.

20
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,224
Your Highness!

21
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,482
You will hurt your hand.

22
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,283
Hand it to me.

23
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,990
Yeong.

24
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,894
What are you doing?

25
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,497
Drag him to the Department of Justice!

26
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,831
Yes, Your Highness!

27
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,299
The Department of Justice?

28
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,903
Don't nine out of ten
come out of there dead?

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,340
We must find out
what he did to the love letters

30
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,813
you exchanged with Master Jung.

31
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,749
Then...

32
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,253
...everyone will know about this.

33
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,956
I will request the King
to issue a harsh punishment.

34
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,926
Pardon? You will tell Father?

35
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,163
Drag him out of here!

36
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,497
Yes.

37
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,801
Please don't do that!

38
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:57,944
I don't want things
to get blown out of proportion.

39
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,613
Then...

40
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,883
What should we do with him?

41
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:21,001
Would it make you feel better
if you killed him here?

42
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,939
You're not someone who can harm others.

43
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,044
Let us go.

44
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,525
Your Highness.

45
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,064
This is my fault.

46
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,735
I had no idea...

47
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,374
...that writing love letters
on someone's behalf,

48
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,044
could hurt people's feelings like this.

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,147
I apologize.

50
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,268
From the bottom of my heart.

51
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,108
Why do you not tell him?

52
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:37,210
He'll find out eventually.

53
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,081
Exactly.

54
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,921
Then he will become
one more of my many servants.

55
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:02,535
I'd be disappointed
if he looked at me like they do.

56
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,417
Listen carefully. We have received

57
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,020
the evaluations for your answers.

58
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,822
If I call your name,
come up and receive the result.

59
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,826
It's okay. It's finally over.

60
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:37,537
Everyone is at his feet
and he can have everything,

61
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,607
but he looks as though
he longs for something.

62
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,847
"How could a lowly man
like myself fill that void?"

63
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:50,884
Maybe you've never been hungry before,

64
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,019
but it seems like
you've undergone many heartbreaks.

65
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:58,692
The richest person in heart
across the country is me.

66
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,896
So I'll give you this
as a piece of affection.

67
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,468
Answer Sheet, Eunuch Trainee Hong Samnom

68
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,007
Your Highness, I can stamp it myself.
Why did you...

69
00:06:15,383 --> 00:06:16,651
"Pass"?

70
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,582
Why did you give a pass to a blank sheet?

71
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:26,386
I've already heard his answer before.

72
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,489
What was that answer?

73
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,025
A chicken leg.

74
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,561
Next.

75
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,105
Hong Samnom!

76
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,680
Yes, Master.

77
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,584
Pass.

78
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,947
Thank you! I...

79
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,616
Pardon?

80
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,286
Pass? Not fail, but pass?

81
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:06,426
Wait. Why? I submitted a blank sheet.

82
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,994
How could I pass? How?

83
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:09,162
Tell me about it.

84
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,532
I just can't understand the Crown Prince.

85
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,034
The Crown...

86
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,337
Was...

87
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,207
...this question for the Crown Prince?

88
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,344
Hong Samnom.
You are assigned to Jipbokheon.

89
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:25,879
Report there tomorrow morning.

90
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,985
If you hit the target once, you pass.

91
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:36,256
However, your arrows will either avoid me,

92
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,059
or go through me.

93
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,696
- Oh, no!
- What if he gets hurt?

94
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,297
Oh, no!

95
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,639
Shoot!

96
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:54,908
Oh, no!

97
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,781
You can't go home if everyone fails!

98
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:03,956
Next! Shoot!

99
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:15,104
I thought my heart was going to stop.

100
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,063
That's nothing.
I guess you haven't seen him before.

101
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,865
His nickname is Almighty Byeongyeon.

102
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,767
I've seen him before.

103
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,936
He looked so handsome in his hat,

104
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,772
when accompanying the Crown Prince.

105
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:29,934
He's almighty since he looks good
even on that hat.

106
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:41,987
It's strange.

107
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:47,227
You tend to tailor the trainings
to make yourself look good.

108
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,030
Almighty Byeongyeon.

109
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,303
You are mistaken, Your Highness.

110
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:12,958
Your Highness.

111
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,360
Your Highness.

112
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:18,758
They met.

113
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:21,261
Incredible! Your Highness.

114
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,233
Hey, Puppy.

115
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,236
You should greet your master.

116
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:34,941
I may bite again,
so don't come any closer.

117
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,712
I am in a bad mood, so I am dangerous.

118
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,014
My goodness. How frightening.

119
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:43,883
Please maintain a distance.

120
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:50,357
Where are you going?

121
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,827
To Donggungjeon.
I must meet the Crown Prince.

122
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:58,932
For what?

123
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,968
I need to ask him
why he's doing this to me.

124
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:03,776
Out of my way.

125
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,740
Is he someone
you can meet just because you want to,

126
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,675
His Highness?

127
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,148
I guess.

128
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,052
He's too high up there, right?

129
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,829
I'm ruined because of the Crown Prince.

130
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,070
What did I...

131
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,469
What did His Highness do?

132
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:41,107
I am not qualified to become a eunuch.

133
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,779
But I'm trapped
in the palace because of him.

134
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:50,850
Why did he hold onto you
if you are not qualified?

135
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,621
The truth is...

136
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,457
I've committed a huge sin,

137
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,793
so I think he wants to torment me.

138
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,636
What are you supposed to do
when you are resented...

139
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,471
...for saving his life?

140
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,508
Shall I kill him?

141
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,646
Both of you, follow me.

142
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,655
I didn't know the palace was this big.

143
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,659
You say you are not qualified
to become a eunuch.

144
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,260
Pardon?

145
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,998
Yes, that's correct.

146
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,602
What right does a man

147
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,539
whose home is this palace have?

148
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,645
The palace is home?

149
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,949
What I mean is...

150
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,786
I've never had a place to call home.

151
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:05,525
Thinking back,
I've never called any place home.

152
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,233
What's there to a home?

153
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,002
Wherever I sleep, that's my home.

154
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,005
It's not like anyone likes the palace.

155
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,042
But if you like someone in the palace,

156
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,878
it becomes a worthy place to live.

157
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,582
Is that true?

158
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:32,953
Then, do you think

159
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,555
that could happen for me, too?

160
00:12:49,617 --> 00:12:56,057
CHAPTER THREE I Am Standing Behind You

161
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:15,729
Your Majesty!

162
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,799
You must escape, Your Majesty!

163
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,501
What is going on?

164
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:24,070
The rebels are storming the palace.

165
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,143
Just a moment.

166
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,846
Which department are you with?

167
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,915
I've never seen you before.

168
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,162
You murderer.

169
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,860
You killed 2,000 innocent lives.

170
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:48,928
No. No!

171
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,654
They are the enemy. They are the rebels!

172
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:53,533
The people's blood you shed...

173
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,536
...shall become the tears of Joseon,

174
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,305
and come back to you as a curse!

175
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,174
Murderer.

176
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,776
- No. No!
- Murderer.

177
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,611
- Murderer.
- No.

178
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,513
- Murderer.
- Stop! Stop!

179
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,682
Stop!

180
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,699
Jipbokheon Consort Park's residence

181
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:43,183
Your Highness, I am Eunuch Hong.
I was assigned here.

182
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,487
Eunuch Hong, it is nice to meet you.

183
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,588
The pleasure is mine, Your Highness.

184
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,162
Are you all right, Your Highness?

185
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:08,475
Would you help my child
tend to the garden for me?

186
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,919
Princess Yeongeun

187
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:15,849
Yes, Your Highness.

188
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:22,100
I think the King is getting
more sensitive these days.

189
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,559
He must have had that nightmare again.

190
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:30,897
Yes. My health isn't the same
due to my pregnancy,

191
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:34,000
and he can't sleep
through the night. It's killing me.

192
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:39,506
It is exhausting and draining.

193
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,443
Until my morning sickness subsides,
I want to sleep alone...

194
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:50,150
Particularly In times like these,
you must stay closer

195
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,485
and keep a close eye on him.

196
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:56,089
It will quiet down soon,

197
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:59,559
so you must be strong and not do anything...

198
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,062
...that may stir up trouble.

199
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:04,597
Yes,

200
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,233
Father.

201
00:16:32,146 --> 00:16:34,382
Seven Years Earlier

202
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,736
Your Highness.

203
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,642
I've been looking for you.

204
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,180
I am fine.

205
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,651
Does it not hurt?

206
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,452
I said I'm fine.

207
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:04,190
How could Mother rest in peace,

208
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,761
if I cannot handle such minor wounds?

209
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:09,896
Yes, Your Highness.

210
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,399
You are very strong.

211
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,638
However,

212
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,808
the Queen...

213
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:26,012
...has asked me to relay a message
when no one's around.

214
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,381
My mother?

215
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:30,650
What is it?

216
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:33,553
She said crying when you are sad

217
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,122
takes great courage as well.

218
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,361
She also asked me to lend you
my arms to cry in...

219
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:43,129
...if you are...

220
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:46,399
...ever in deep sorrow.

221
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:52,138
Is that true?

222
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,877
Then please,

223
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,114
lend me your arms.

224
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:07,921
I am in such sorrow.

225
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,558
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,649
This weed is so stubborn, isn't it?

227
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,820
That's what it takes for them to survive.

228
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,711
It's stubborn because it can survive,

229
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:18,799
even on a ray of sunlight
or a sip of water this way.

230
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,791
That's why.

231
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,428
They're not like people
born with silver spoons...

232
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,973
I was just reminded of someone I know.

233
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,713
He is so picky and fussy
because of his background.

234
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,856
If his temper was half as nice
as his looks...

235
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,524
Then what?

236
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,861
Then it would've been a little more...

237
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:11,912
What brings you here, Silver Spoon?

238
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:17,017
What about you? What are you doing here?

239
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,253
I'm working.

240
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,990
But seriously,

241
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,494
what exactly do you do?

242
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,797
Do you want to know?

243
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:32,399
I do.

244
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:35,869
You went from a eunuch to a palace guard.

245
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,405
And now, you look like a playboy.

246
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,310
You should be careful.

247
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,779
Of what?

248
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:52,652
You might upset the higher masters
for playing around so much.

249
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:01,027
I am concerned as a friend,
so heed my warning.

250
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,330
You're so thick-headed.

251
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,667
A friend?

252
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,937
Since when have we become friends?

253
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,342
If we are not friends, what are we?

254
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,446
Master and Puppy.

255
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,284
Stop that! Stop calling me Puppy.

256
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:26,052
I am Hong...

257
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,457
I have a name. Hong Samnom.

258
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:33,026
Do you call Samnom a name?

259
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:38,865
What about you? What is your name?

260
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:45,438
Your Highness, are you awake?

261
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,075
The Crown Prince is here to see you.

262
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:19,472
What is a boy doing with these?

263
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:25,345
You are so strange.
I don't like it at all.

264
00:22:25,946 --> 00:22:27,514
What are you...

265
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:34,421
If you don't want to tell me,
just say so.

266
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,562
My goodness. My goodness.

267
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,968
Look who this is.

268
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:50,770
It's been a while, Princess Yeongeun.

269
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,389
You came all the way here yourself.

270
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,558
I feel bad refusing you.

271
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:16,029
Your Highness, His Majesty is waiting.

272
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,732
Tell him you didn't see me.

273
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:22,369
I'm always away from my place anyway.

274
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:26,864
Yes, I am aware of it, Your Highness.

275
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,808
Even two nights ago,

276
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:32,712
I came here with His Majesty.

277
00:23:34,401 --> 00:23:35,469
Why?

278
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:38,533
Did he have something else
to scold me for?

279
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:42,835
That morning,

280
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,970
His Majesty...

281
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,386
...saw you visit the Royal Office and leave.

282
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:54,502
Please forgive me for saying this,

283
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,704
but the Analects of Confucius state,

284
00:23:57,639 --> 00:23:59,841
"The father conceals
the misconduct of the son,"

285
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:03,645
"and the son conceals
the misconduct of the father."

286
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:06,781
Will the two of you...

287
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,786
...look at each other's backs forever?

288
00:24:26,701 --> 00:24:27,869
Did you send for me?

289
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:34,542
I feel like I am losing my mind.

290
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:37,712
I keep hearing things.

291
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:44,085
Even yesterday. I do not remember,

292
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:46,087
how much of it was a dream.

293
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:55,530
Prepare yourself.

294
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:57,999
I will soon,

295
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:01,803
order that you take
the throne on my behalf.

296
00:25:06,107 --> 00:25:07,208
I do not want to.

297
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:11,679
This is not something
you do because you want to.

298
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:17,452
Before being my son,
you are the Crown Prince.

299
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,391
Crown Prince.

300
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,859
That is correct.

301
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:29,030
I had no choice in being the Crown Prince.

302
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:34,702
However, it is up to me to decide,

303
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,838
what kind of crown prince I will be.

304
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:08,603
This is a letter to the King.

305
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:11,239
Please relay it
to the eunuch at the Royal Palace.

306
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,575
Yes, Your Highness.

307
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:24,118
Eunuch Hong,
please give that letter to my father.

308
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:30,658
Eunuch Hong,
please give that letter to my father.

309
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,961
Of course.

310
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,138
Do not worry. I promise.

311
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:50,745
What is this?

312
00:26:50,945 --> 00:26:52,147
Can you not tell?

313
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,682
It is His Majesty's response, his letter.

314
00:26:54,949 --> 00:26:55,850
Pardon?

315
00:26:56,518 --> 00:26:59,087
How do you have his response already?

316
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,389
He has not read the letter yet.

317
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:03,725
Have you not heard?

318
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:05,994
Heard what?

319
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:15,136
You must pretend
if you want to do a good job.

320
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,178
He always gives
a blank letter in response,

321
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:26,047
so we prepared it
in advance for convenience.

322
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:27,816
Take it and give it to her.

323
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:33,421
What does that mean?
Please give that back.

324
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:36,257
Why you... Do as you are told.

325
00:27:36,357 --> 00:27:37,759
What do you take me for?

326
00:27:38,693 --> 00:27:40,228
What is the ruckus?

327
00:27:50,004 --> 00:27:53,608
So how is Consort Park's health?

328
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:58,179
I do not know for sure,
but she suffers from coughs.

329
00:27:58,746 --> 00:28:01,649
She must have the energy
to write letters, though.

330
00:28:03,184 --> 00:28:04,024
Pardon?

331
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:06,488
Come closer.

332
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:24,105
Is it because of the pregnancy?

333
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:27,742
Even little things annoy and bother me.

334
00:28:29,511 --> 00:28:32,547
I will not repeat myself,
so listen carefully.

335
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:34,549
Shut your mouth,

336
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:39,053
and take the letter the eunuch gives you.

337
00:28:45,693 --> 00:28:46,533
Go.

338
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:48,496
Go.

339
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:07,816
Master.

340
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:11,052
Do you have some time right now?

341
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:13,521
You need to go with me.

342
00:29:14,222 --> 00:29:15,590
Where do you mean?

343
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:17,625
You will see. Come.

344
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:24,065
Well...

345
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:26,034
Is this the place?

346
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,303
Why...

347
00:29:29,938 --> 00:29:30,939
No reason.

348
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:33,842
Life in palace will be difficult.

349
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:35,543
At times like that,

350
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:38,680
you should take a break here.

351
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:42,584
Are you telling me
to sneak away from work?

352
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:45,753
You look like you need that right now.

353
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:59,968
You always show up...

354
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:02,737
...whenever I am in trouble or weary.
It is amazing.

355
00:30:03,705 --> 00:30:05,740
Do not beat around the bush.

356
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,644
You call that fate.

357
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:16,684
Do you know what
I am most grateful to you?

358
00:30:17,285 --> 00:30:18,286
I do.

359
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,557
You do?

360
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:25,994
Pretending not to know.

361
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:28,863
Am I right?

362
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:31,866
You are.

363
00:30:34,002 --> 00:30:35,804
If a lady does not wish to tell,

364
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,839
a man should pretend not to know.

365
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:40,881
What do you mean a lady?

366
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:45,113
Naturally, keeping another man's secret,

367
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,115
is also a man's duty.

368
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,689
Anyway, thank you...

369
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:57,225
...for not asking.

370
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:01,229
Let us rest.

371
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:03,765
When you sneak away,

372
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:06,634
you must enjoy it.

373
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,234
I must give this to him
for my day's work to end.

374
00:31:41,903 --> 00:31:44,973
Should I just take the other letter?

375
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:51,246
Are you all right?

376
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:53,181
Where is your head?

377
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:54,249
I am sorry.

378
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:56,751
These are appeals for His Majesty.

379
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:58,486
I am...

380
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:40,311
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

381
00:32:49,255 --> 00:32:52,106
Your Highness,
I heard His Majesty took long...

382
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:54,809
...to write his response
after reading your letter.

383
00:32:58,413 --> 00:33:00,415
Is that true?

384
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:03,051
Yes, I am positive, Your Highness.

385
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:08,156
I even smell the nice scent in the letter.

386
00:33:26,374 --> 00:33:27,214
Your Highness.

387
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:31,083
I guess

388
00:33:31,988 --> 00:33:34,382
I should stop bothering him now.

389
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:38,987
He must have wanted,

390
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:44,094
to relay his thoughts clearly through you.

391
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:48,198
Is it...

392
00:33:53,136 --> 00:33:54,203
This is my fault, Your Highness.

393
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,812
It is not your fault.

394
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:00,249
You may go.

395
00:34:14,657 --> 00:34:15,725
Eunuch Hong.

396
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:20,196
Would you do me one more favor?

397
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,536
I am a fool and cannot let go.

398
00:34:27,937 --> 00:34:30,073
I cannot get myself to do it.

399
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:34,644
Please take these,

400
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:37,866
and burn them.

401
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,151
Your Highness.

402
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:12,182
What is all these?

403
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:19,240
They are letters that Consort Park,

404
00:35:19,896 --> 00:35:21,191
asked me to destroy.

405
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,261
Did you deliver the letters?

406
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,835
His Majesty is so mean.

407
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:36,039
How can he always send
blank responses to her letters?

408
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:47,784
These are not His Majesty's responses.

409
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:52,389
Consort Park's letters
never reach him anyway.

410
00:35:55,792 --> 00:35:57,193
Not this time.

411
00:35:58,161 --> 00:36:01,731
His Majesty ordered me directly
to deliver it to her.

412
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:08,038
If he were going to send
the same blank letter,

413
00:36:08,571 --> 00:36:10,240
why did he call me personally?

414
00:36:11,241 --> 00:36:13,243
Why do you think he did that?

415
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:15,578
How did you deliver her letter to him?

416
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:18,048
Well,

417
00:36:18,782 --> 00:36:21,418
I sneaked it into one of the appeals.

418
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:26,623
And yet, he sent a blank letter?

419
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,012
Yes.

420
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,564
You nipped any little hope
that remained in her.

421
00:36:35,832 --> 00:36:36,672
You.

422
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,117
Consort Park's health is not well.

423
00:36:55,085 --> 00:36:56,886
Please visit the Jipbokheon.

424
00:36:59,823 --> 00:37:01,057
I will send the physician.

425
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:04,451
I can do that much.

426
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,720
How would my visit help?

427
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:12,302
Merely seeing you
will be of great help for her.

428
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:14,838
That is something...

429
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:17,807
...only you can do, Father.

430
00:37:23,113 --> 00:37:25,915
The Queen is sensitive
because of her pregnancy.

431
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:28,718
I will wait for a good time,

432
00:37:29,712 --> 00:37:30,987
and think it over.

433
00:37:36,993 --> 00:37:38,094
What are you afraid of?

434
00:37:41,364 --> 00:37:44,167
What are you so afraid of
that you cannot do anything?

435
00:37:44,868 --> 00:37:45,869
No.

436
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:47,837
You will not do anything.

437
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:54,311
You did the same,

438
00:37:56,132 --> 00:37:58,014
when Mother passed away, too.

439
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:06,323
Father.

440
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,859
Why did Mother suddenly pass away?

441
00:38:11,361 --> 00:38:16,232
The Queen passed away
due to an unknown illness.

442
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,169
I have heard what
the palace workers were saying.

443
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,204
They said it was not an illness!

444
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:25,041
- Who murdered Mother?
- Yeong!

445
00:38:25,611 --> 00:38:29,045
You must not say that out loud ever again.
Understand?

446
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:30,597
Father.

447
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:32,956
Please uncover the truth.

448
00:38:33,717 --> 00:38:34,985
Please find them.

449
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:39,790
Please punish those who hurt Mother!

450
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,391
Yeong!

451
00:38:44,733 --> 00:38:46,035
You could not do anything.

452
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,785
You did not do anything and told me...

453
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:53,489
...to just wait.

454
00:38:57,174 --> 00:38:59,209
Even if nothing was going to change,

455
00:38:59,653 --> 00:39:00,988
even if it was all useless,

456
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:05,658
you had to do something
instead of hiding in fear.

457
00:39:09,841 --> 00:39:10,942
Because you are...

458
00:39:14,457 --> 00:39:15,792
...the King of Joseon.

459
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:54,650
Since she asked me to burn this,
I shouldn't keep it.

460
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:57,767
Why can't you burn it?
It's not yours anyway.

461
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:00,370
I know.

462
00:40:03,406 --> 00:40:06,309
It breaks my heart because it smells good.

463
00:40:07,944 --> 00:40:09,212
Are you saying it's scented paper?

464
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:10,647
Yes.

465
00:40:11,514 --> 00:40:13,650
It smells like a sweet apple.

466
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:29,599
What brought you at such a late hour,
Your Highness?

467
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:34,170
I told you I'd visit you
until you recover.

468
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:36,640
What if I'm not recovering

469
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:39,576
because I want to see you every day?

470
00:40:51,855 --> 00:40:55,458
I threw away all the blank letters.

471
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,663
It's been almost seven years,

472
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,942
since I last met His Majesty,

473
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,635
and I started sending
those letters to him.

474
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:11,641
I should have stopped long time ago.

475
00:41:16,046 --> 00:41:17,614
Seven years ago,

476
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:22,786
you consoled me warmly
when I lost my mother.

477
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:30,293
You have grown up so much.

478
00:41:31,795 --> 00:41:33,964
Please give me a chance
to repay the kindness...

479
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:36,967
...you showed me that day.

480
00:42:24,981 --> 00:42:26,216
Oh my goodness!

481
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:29,786
If you have something to say,
please just say it.

482
00:42:48,738 --> 00:42:51,875
How could this happen?

483
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,110
It's written with apple vinegar.

484
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:55,778
The letters appear only
when it's near fire.

485
00:42:59,015 --> 00:42:59,983
My goodness!

486
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:03,353
I have such a brilliant friend.

487
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,591
I never allowed you to be my friend.

488
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:11,159
Please don't be like that.

489
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,919
I really like you, Byeongyeon.

490
00:43:39,322 --> 00:43:41,643
Silver Spoon, I found out the truth.

491
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:45,371
The King's letters turned out
to be secret letters.

492
00:43:45,462 --> 00:43:49,265
- What?
- Anyway, I'll talk to you later.

493
00:43:50,133 --> 00:43:50,973
Hey, wait!

494
00:43:58,341 --> 00:44:00,810
Your Highness, please allow me to come in.

495
00:44:01,277 --> 00:44:02,214
What is all this commotion?

496
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:03,874
Your Highness, it's Eunuch Hong.

497
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:06,900
Let him in.

498
00:44:10,574 --> 00:44:12,175
Your Highness,
you need to go out right now.

499
00:44:12,322 --> 00:44:14,257
His Majesty is waiting for you.

500
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:18,662
I don't understand.
Tell me what that means.

501
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:40,450
Consort Park, half of me
hopes you'll read this letter.

502
00:44:41,117 --> 00:44:45,822
The other half hopes
you will never find out.

503
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:51,027
I am an incompetent king,
a powerless husband,

504
00:44:51,465 --> 00:44:53,797
and a faint-hearted father.

505
00:44:54,636 --> 00:44:56,333
I beg for your forgiveness,

506
00:44:56,424 --> 00:44:58,626
for expressing my feelings only this way.

507
00:45:01,233 --> 00:45:02,268
Waiting for you...

508
00:45:02,736 --> 00:45:06,240
...to finally read my letter,

509
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:10,253
I go to Aeryun Garden every night,

510
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,749
where we used to walk together.

511
00:45:44,226 --> 00:45:46,028
Even if it was useless,

512
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:50,220
you had to do something
instead of hiding in fear.

513
00:45:53,536 --> 00:45:54,804
Because you are...

514
00:45:58,428 --> 00:45:59,729
...the King of Joseon.

515
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,042
I... I cannot do anything!

516
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:13,889
I should not do anything!

517
00:46:19,649 --> 00:46:21,484
Only then I can keep you safe.

518
00:46:22,819 --> 00:46:23,887
It is to keep you safe.

519
00:46:29,993 --> 00:46:31,828
When I tried to do something as the King,

520
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,069
I lost 2,000 people.

521
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:39,035
I even lost the Queen.

522
00:46:41,771 --> 00:46:44,641
I lost all of my teachers and friends...

523
00:46:45,575 --> 00:46:47,210
...the same way.

524
00:46:49,379 --> 00:46:50,614
Because I am incompetent,

525
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:56,453
this is the only way
I can protect my people.

526
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:01,524
I must...

527
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:04,995
I must not do anything.

528
00:47:16,706 --> 00:47:20,777
I am very happy
that Consort Park finally found out...

529
00:47:21,411 --> 00:47:22,569
...His Majesty's feelings for her.

530
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:36,192
I wonder why
he had to write a secret letter.

531
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:41,965
His Majesty is the one
who rules over the world.

532
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:46,836
What could make him afraid
and hide things?

533
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:50,940
I have just realized it now, too.

534
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:55,045
He's not just a king
with a crown on his head,

535
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:58,615
but also a husband of a beloved wife,

536
00:47:59,482 --> 00:48:03,520
and a father who cannot be replaced.

537
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:14,698
All you ever say is,
"It cannot be done, Your Majesty."

538
00:48:16,466 --> 00:48:18,868
When I say left, you say right.

539
00:48:19,235 --> 00:48:21,237
When I say right, you say left.

540
00:48:22,172 --> 00:48:24,574
You are always against me.

541
00:48:24,808 --> 00:48:28,111
You always say what I say is all wrong.

542
00:48:28,178 --> 00:48:29,679
Your Majesty.

543
00:48:29,746 --> 00:48:31,514
All of you!

544
00:48:32,082 --> 00:48:35,285
It is not my decision
that you do not like.

545
00:48:37,988 --> 00:48:40,624
You do not like my sitting on the throne.

546
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:43,627
It isn't true, Your Majesty.

547
00:48:48,665 --> 00:48:51,901
I suggest Premier Kim
to sit on this throne...

548
00:48:52,168 --> 00:48:54,437
...since all the officials and people,

549
00:48:56,006 --> 00:48:58,241
admire and respect him greatly.

550
00:48:59,509 --> 00:49:03,913
Your Majesty, please calm yourself.

551
00:49:04,881 --> 00:49:06,549
Why? Do you not want it?

552
00:49:09,819 --> 00:49:10,920
Well then,

553
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:13,421
Minister of Finance,
would you like to take the throne?

554
00:49:15,859 --> 00:49:16,760
Your Majesty.

555
00:49:17,794 --> 00:49:19,596
Minister of Government Administration,
how about you?

556
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:22,065
Your Majesty.

557
00:49:26,102 --> 00:49:27,337
I almost forgot.

558
00:49:27,871 --> 00:49:31,174
We have the Crown Prince
who is young and smart.

559
00:49:31,274 --> 00:49:32,609
That is right.

560
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:33,977
Chief Eunuch Han!

561
00:49:34,311 --> 00:49:35,612
Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:39,115
Bring in the Crown Prince right now!

563
00:49:59,536 --> 00:50:02,472
Oh, you're here. I'm glad you're here.

564
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:06,982
As you all know,

565
00:50:07,203 --> 00:50:11,340
my incompetency
got this country in all sorts of troubles.

566
00:50:11,915 --> 00:50:13,416
As I bemoan this situation,

567
00:50:14,684 --> 00:50:17,787
I shall let the Crown Prince
rule in the interim.

568
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:26,363
Tell me your opinions.

569
00:50:27,364 --> 00:50:28,365
Your Majesty.

570
00:50:36,506 --> 00:50:40,610
He's nagging for comfort.
Let's give him what he wants.

571
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:47,193
Please revoke your decision, Your Majesty.

572
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:51,168
There has been no record of a Crown Prince...

573
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:53,549
...taking the throne in the interim
at such young age.

574
00:50:54,013 --> 00:50:55,915
Please revoke your royal command!

575
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:59,562
Please revoke your royal command!

576
00:51:01,598 --> 00:51:02,999
Premier Kim, do you agree with them?

577
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,939
If the Crown Prince
is determined to take it,

578
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:15,111
I would be more than happy for him.

579
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:24,721
Crown Prince, tell me what you think.

580
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:31,795
I am so startled
that I don't know what to do.

581
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,971
I may appear to be a grown-up
because of the attire,

582
00:51:41,771 --> 00:51:44,074
but I am still a mere child.

583
00:51:46,543 --> 00:51:48,712
Why are you giving me this challenge,

584
00:51:50,217 --> 00:51:53,156
when I am still afraid to leave the nest?

585
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:06,029
Like father, like son.
Look how he's shaking in fear.

586
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:10,133
He acted like he's strong.
I feel pity for him now.

587
00:52:21,077 --> 00:52:22,078
However,

588
00:52:23,013 --> 00:52:24,180
on second thought,

589
00:52:25,548 --> 00:52:26,850
there is no reason...

590
00:52:29,052 --> 00:52:30,553
...I can't take the job either.

591
00:52:41,931 --> 00:52:42,932
Your Majesty.

592
00:52:43,867 --> 00:52:45,001
It would be...

593
00:52:46,036 --> 00:52:47,816
...my great joy,

594
00:52:48,972 --> 00:52:50,006
to receive your command.

595
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:56,980
Both of them are out of their minds.

596
00:52:57,747 --> 00:52:58,715
They're out of their minds.

597
00:53:07,857 --> 00:53:09,259
I have something to tell you.

598
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:14,898
I will share your burden, Your Majesty.

599
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,568
At tomorrow's court assembly,

600
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:21,037
please command me to rule in the interim.

601
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,476
However, there is something I need
in order to do this.

602
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:31,648
I see. What is it? Tell me what you need.

603
00:53:32,782 --> 00:53:34,017
I need a person to rely on,

604
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:36,086
when I am weak...

605
00:53:38,588 --> 00:53:39,428
...and afraid.

606
00:53:44,794 --> 00:53:45,829
I need a father.

607
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:56,673
Yeong.

608
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:27,137
You will serve Prince Dung from today.

609
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:31,608
You should have done
a better job at Jipbokheon.

610
00:54:39,554 --> 00:54:40,503
Hong Samnom.

611
00:54:40,617 --> 00:54:41,618
Yes, Master?

612
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,477
You survived in the haunted place
that everyone avoids.

613
00:54:45,645 --> 00:54:46,612
Why would you be so startled?

614
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:50,909
I was not able to cast out all the ghosts.

615
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:52,760
Instead I became friends with them.

616
00:54:53,262 --> 00:54:56,048
Great. I was looking
for someone as brave as you.

617
00:54:56,225 --> 00:54:58,027
We need someone like you in Donggungjeon.

618
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,051
First, put these books
in the library in the backyard.

619
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:05,609
The Crown Prince is reading a book there.

620
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:07,113
So be quiet.

621
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,350
Yes, Master.

622
00:55:10,747 --> 00:55:14,133
Master Jang, did you say
the Crown Prince is there?

623
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:16,117
I cannot go there...

624
00:55:44,848 --> 00:55:45,715
Silver Spoon.

625
00:55:47,784 --> 00:55:48,652
What are you doing here?

626
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:53,456
What are you doing here?

627
00:55:55,058 --> 00:55:56,059
I am running an errand.

628
00:56:00,664 --> 00:56:03,620
Have you seen the Crown Prince?

629
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:05,702
I was told he would be here.

630
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:07,444
What?

631
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:09,932
No.

632
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:14,177
I am relieved. I was very anxious.

633
00:56:17,514 --> 00:56:18,415
What are you doing here?

634
00:56:20,483 --> 00:56:22,886
This is the library
for the Crown Prince only.

635
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:24,897
Come out if you are done.

636
00:56:25,562 --> 00:56:26,563
Come out now.

637
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:28,654
Yes, Master.

638
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:38,488
Silver Spoon.

639
00:56:40,257 --> 00:56:42,693
You heard him, didn't you?
Let's get out of here.

640
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:45,208
Only the Crown Prince can come in here.

641
00:56:51,715 --> 00:56:52,782
What are you waiting for?

642
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:55,018
Let's go now.

643
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:57,687
Let's go before
we run into the Crown Prince.

644
00:57:01,382 --> 00:57:02,692
Why do you not tell him?

645
00:57:03,193 --> 00:57:04,427
He'll find out eventually.

646
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:14,170
I am concerned as a friend,

647
00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:15,672
so heed my warning.

648
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,197
A friend?

649
00:57:18,131 --> 00:57:20,139
Since when have we become friends?

650
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:23,213
If we are not friends, what are we?

651
00:57:32,689 --> 00:57:35,625
What about you? What is your name?

652
00:57:41,264 --> 00:57:42,532
Stop.

653
00:57:44,034 --> 00:57:45,702
You asked for my name once.

654
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:26,771
Lee Yeong.

655
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:28,587
That is my name.

656
00:59:02,646 --> 00:59:04,174
Love In The Moonlight

657
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:07,448
You may treat me as your friend
when we are alone.

658
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:08,985
I mean, I command you to do so.

659
00:59:09,182 --> 00:59:11,821
What relationship do you think we are in?

660
00:59:12,122 --> 00:59:14,190
A relationship that shares a secret.

661
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:16,126
Did you mean to make them
fight each other?

662
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:19,029
The pompous envoy
and the hot-tempered Crown Prince.

663
00:59:19,296 --> 00:59:21,731
Aeshim will be doing
the final dance at the festival.

664
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:23,833
The upcoming festival
is important for His Highness.

665
00:59:23,934 --> 00:59:26,569
He must be tired
from all those nitpickers.

666
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:31,841
The final dance starts soon
and she's not here.

667
00:59:31,908 --> 00:59:32,842
What?

668
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:35,412
Isn't this Aeshim's costume
for the final dance?
