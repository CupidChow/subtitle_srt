1
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:04,525
What shall I call you as a lady?

2
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:11,271
I am Hong Raon,

3
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,340
Your Highness.

4
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:18,995
Hong Raon.

5
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
Raon.

6
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,411
Raon means enjoyment, does it not?

7
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:53,467
Yes.

8
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:59,453
My father named me that,
hoping I enjoy my life.

9
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,356
Your name suits you very well.

10
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:24,711
CHAPTER 10 Like a Fairy Tale

11
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,776
Your Highness, have you woken up?

12
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,816
I have. Come in.

13
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,497
How is the weather outside,

14
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,281
Raon?

15
00:03:22,354 --> 00:03:23,194
Pardon?

16
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,043
The sunlight is strong.

17
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,512
Okay.

18
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,615
Did you pack the books to bring with me,

19
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,634
Raon?

20
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,987
Yes, Your Highness.

21
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,524
But will you continue to call me that?

22
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,794
I am merely calling Raon, "Raon". Why?

23
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,097
What if someone hears?

24
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,935
I will call you that when we are alone,

25
00:03:57,151 --> 00:03:58,151
Raon.

26
00:04:02,776 --> 00:04:06,079
I will make up for the times
I could not call you that.

27
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,682
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,639
Tell me as a relationship expert.

29
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,845
Does not every woman dream
of being in love with the Crown Prince?

30
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,189
You could not find her?

31
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,626
The neighbor could not remember anything.

32
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:31,258
Not even her looks, her name,
or anything?

33
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:33,495
No.

34
00:05:36,405 --> 00:05:37,406
I see.

35
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,070
I understand.

36
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,515
What will you do when you find her?

37
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,884
We must protect her as our own.

38
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:54,840
Why do you ask?

39
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:57,138
Nothing.

40
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,872
I will keep looking.

41
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,474
Stop!

42
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,243
Stop!

43
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,040
Get them!

44
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,652
Out of our way! Move!

45
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,620
Stop! Get them!

46
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,589
"The cries of the hungry..."

47
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,325
"...are heard from thousands of homes."

48
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:35,829
"The nation does not belong
to the incompetent king,"

49
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,264
"but to the people who live its history."

50
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,868
"Hong Gyeongnae's child will lead the way."

51
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:45,585
"We will not repeat our failure
from 10 years ago."

52
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,500
They are saying it is time.

53
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:50,731
They refuse to repeat
the failure from 10 years ago,

54
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,523
and they are instigating the people.

55
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:54,752
Your Majesty.

56
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,951
Leave this to me and do not worry.

57
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,620
I am worried you will get sick.

58
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,525
They wish to drag me down,

59
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:05,894
and put Hong Gyeongnae's ghost
on the throne.

60
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:12,465
What are the royal guards doing,
not quashing the rebels?

61
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:16,030
We have every royal guard
searching everywhere,

62
00:07:16,531 --> 00:07:18,800
so we will find the culprit soon.

63
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,242
Even the palace is not safe.

64
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:25,740
They will attack my bed soon as well.

65
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,458
Search everyone in the palace.

66
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:32,882
If they are even remotely suspicious,

67
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,083
they shall be punished harshly by the law.

68
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,240
Byeongyeon.

69
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,767
Yes, Your Highness.

70
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:01,858
I have been hoping
things would be stable for my father,

71
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,951
but situations seem dire.

72
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:13,026
Have you heard anything else
about Hong Gyeongnae's child yet?

73
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,342
No, Your Highness.

74
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,266
Nothing else yet.

75
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:24,666
Councilor Kim. Hong Gyeongnae.

76
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,706
And Father.

77
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,478
I will end the wretched relations
among them.

78
00:08:34,725 --> 00:08:36,193
Please help me.

79
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,720
Yes, Your Highness.

80
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,836
Do you think this is a sudden change?

81
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:05,068
What is it you wish to say, Premier?

82
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:12,752
Anxiety seeps in
through the weakest point.

83
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:20,093
Anxiety befell us because I,
who is weak, am the interim king?

84
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,465
Your will to bring change is commendable,

85
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,301
but it is only bringing chaos in reality.

86
00:09:30,171 --> 00:09:31,105
In difficult times,

87
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:34,607
you will need the assistance
of experienced subjects.

88
00:09:36,273 --> 00:09:38,441
Why don't you pretend to give in...

89
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:41,929
...and take refuge under my tree?

90
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,312
I am not sure.

91
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:48,471
I cannot be blind...

92
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:51,645
...to the mud beneath my feet
just to stay in the shade.

93
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,068
Open them all.

94
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:22,096
Master Jang.

95
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,992
What is going on?

96
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:28,028
Do not get me started.
It is not only eunuchs.

97
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:34,134
They are searching every room,
including guards and court ladies.

98
00:10:34,436 --> 00:10:37,872
What did the flyers say
for them to do all this?

99
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,830
It supposedly said to remove the King,

100
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:44,929
and create a world where the people rule.

101
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:46,180
- What?
- Be quiet.

102
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,409
Isn't that treason?

103
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,160
When the riot occurred 10 years ago,

104
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:55,255
there was a rebel within the palace
but no one knew.

105
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,125
Anyway, be careful.

106
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:04,264
At times like these, it does not matter
whether you are guilty or not.

107
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:06,837
They will tie you and me together
and drag us away.

108
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:10,170
They will burn us with irons
and we will just die.

109
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,215
- Will we die?
- Of course.

110
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,747
You are finally back.

111
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:32,125
Yes.

112
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,698
You must be upset with the hectic palace.

113
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:40,998
I am.

114
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:44,020
I could not see you all day long.

115
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,545
Lie down and rest, Your Highness.

116
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,724
Okay.

117
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,998
You have not been sleeping well, have you?

118
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:31,377
Shall I tell you a fun story
until you fall asleep?

119
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,587
Go ahead.

120
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:38,667
I read this in a book

121
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:41,663
that came from the West,
when I lived near the market.

122
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,420
Do you remember when you said,

123
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:52,524
that every woman dreams
of being in love with the Crown Prince?

124
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:58,431
This story is about one of those.

125
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:02,924
A mermaid living in the sea...

126
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,286
...falls in love with a prince.

127
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,345
Is he as handsome as I?

128
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,883
That prince in the story.

129
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,084
Sorry?

130
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:19,455
I guess so,

131
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:23,739
since the mermaid
fell in love at first sight.

132
00:14:25,384 --> 00:14:26,719
Like you?

133
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,672
The mermaid, who is in love,
sacrifices her voice for legs,

134
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,325
and goes to be with the prince.

135
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:48,593
However,

136
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:53,933
she cannot tell him
who she is or anything else.

137
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,011
Go on,

138
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:02,094
Raon.

139
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:13,472
Chief Eunuch Han.

140
00:15:14,584 --> 00:15:17,420
The Crown Prince just became
the interim king,

141
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,859
and they are attacking him already.

142
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,872
What is to come next is obvious.

143
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,161
They will join forces
and try to bind his hands and feet,

144
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,382
as they have mine.

145
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,460
Your Majesty.

146
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,584
Shall we defer
the Crown Prince's marriage,

147
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,904
which you mentioned earlier?

148
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,526
No.

149
00:15:44,802 --> 00:15:47,405
We must expedite the process.

150
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,743
His marriage is a celebration
for the nation.

151
00:15:53,815 --> 00:15:56,218
We must capture
the wavering hearts of the people.

152
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,354
We must make sure everyone knows

153
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:01,181
that the royal family remains strong.

154
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,314
If so,

155
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,334
is there a family you have in mind?

156
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:16,176
Call Minister Cho Manhyeong discreetly.

157
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:21,897
Yes, Your Majesty.

158
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:30,107
Your Highness.

159
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:32,401
He is Jung Deokho, who came in first...

160
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,227
...in the state examination this year.

161
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:37,007
Your Highness,

162
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:41,638
I shall do my utmost
for the progress of the nation,

163
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,670
and work myself to the bone and give...

164
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,134
That is not necessary.

165
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,510
Since you showed an aptitude
and interest in strategy,

166
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,521
I assigned you to
the Crown Prince Protection Office,

167
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,414
so show me what you are capable of.

168
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:57,034
Yes, Your Highness. I shall.

169
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:14,765
Jung Dor...

170
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:24,611
"I beg for forgiveness for loving someone..."

171
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:27,518
"I should never have."

172
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,484
Please tell her that.

173
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,588
Do you know each other?

174
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,290
- Yes. Pardon?
- No, Your Highness.

175
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,860
We saw each other
a few times at the market.

176
00:17:41,112 --> 00:17:42,380
Yes, that...

177
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,840
Fine. You are excused.

178
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:06,086
Sam... Samnom.

179
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,555
You... You cannot...

180
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,664
No. Samnom will not say a word.

181
00:18:11,831 --> 00:18:12,699
Do not worry.

182
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:14,354
Okay.

183
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:16,817
But how did you come in first?

184
00:18:17,903 --> 00:18:19,371
Did you really?

185
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,501
Yes, it is true.

186
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,260
I cannot believe it, either.

187
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,752
First in the state examination,
not an eating contest.

188
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:28,470
- Isn't it funny?
- It is not.

189
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:32,734
Eunuch Hong!

190
00:18:34,123 --> 00:18:35,091
Princess?

191
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,593
Eunuch Hong.

192
00:18:51,259 --> 00:18:54,029
I am sure you were
with someone a moment ago.

193
00:18:59,266 --> 00:19:00,566
Why are you so surprised?

194
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,314
Sorry?

195
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:07,181
My apologies. You look so different.

196
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:11,912
Did you always have such a high nose?

197
00:19:13,982 --> 00:19:14,983
Is it?

198
00:19:16,876 --> 00:19:20,546
I only recently discovered
that I have a high nose.

199
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,033
I will see you again.

200
00:19:25,301 --> 00:19:26,836
Yes, Your Highness.

201
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,043
How...

202
00:19:38,707 --> 00:19:40,943
Why has she become so skinny and sickly?

203
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,436
You will be in the palace often
from now on.

204
00:19:43,784 --> 00:19:45,319
What will you do?

205
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:49,844
If the Princess recognizes me,
it would be a disaster.

206
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:52,733
I will have to avoid her.

207
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:54,516
What choice do I have?

208
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:58,507
She is so skinny, though.

209
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:21,221
A lantern that makes your wish come true.

210
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:25,347
What wish would you make?

211
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:30,315
My wish is that
I could meet the King just once.

212
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,710
My Lord!

213
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,419
What brings you to the palace?

214
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:50,764
Are you here to see the King?

215
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,325
I came with my father who decorates bags.

216
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:02,327
Your...

217
00:21:11,475 --> 00:21:13,878
Give the snacks for the Crown Prince...

218
00:21:14,513 --> 00:21:15,881
...to this child.

219
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,067
Your Majesty.

220
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,843
May I ask
why you called me in discreetly?

221
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:41,635
I will ask you directly.

222
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:46,690
Please help me and the Crown Prince.

223
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:53,619
I wish to have your daughter
marry the Crown Prince.

224
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,952
Please become
one of the Crown Prince's people.

225
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:04,318
The Crown Prince's marriage.

226
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,817
He wants to talk to Minister Cho
to make his daughter the future queen.

227
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:13,413
Are you saying
the Crown Prince is to be wed?

228
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:15,030
Yes.

229
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:21,107
Then was he delaying his daughter's
marriage to Yunseong because...

230
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,277
...the King wishes to calm
the chaotic nation...

231
00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,813
...with the Crown Prince's wedding.

232
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,900
Now that he is the interim king,

233
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:30,584
if he gets married as well...

234
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:31,668
We must stop it.

235
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:34,010
If Minister Cho and the Crown Prince

236
00:22:34,236 --> 00:22:37,606
join forces and they beget an heir...

237
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:42,677
We cannot waste
this great opportunity for us,

238
00:22:44,778 --> 00:22:48,148
when we have the Queen carrying a child.

239
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,337
Do not worry.

240
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,910
The King cannot decide on his own.

241
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:06,747
Do you have a good idea
for stopping the wedding?

242
00:23:10,461 --> 00:23:13,931
How old is your youngest daughter?

243
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,671
Eunuch Hong. Lift both of your legs.

244
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,773
- It does not hurt. It is fun.
- Let us go.

245
00:23:28,864 --> 00:23:30,443
Let us go like this all the way.

246
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,578
What is so much fun?

247
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:40,359
Your Highness, Eunuch Hong
sprained his ankle.

248
00:23:41,538 --> 00:23:44,941
Yes, so we were bringing him safely...

249
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:53,403
Thank you.

250
00:24:05,854 --> 00:24:07,222
Good going.

251
00:24:08,943 --> 00:24:11,712
I climbed the persimmon tree and fell off.

252
00:24:12,063 --> 00:24:13,364
Good going.

253
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,298
You put your arms around anyone,

254
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:18,333
laugh in front of anyone,

255
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:20,541
and then get hurt.

256
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:29,273
Do not get hurt again.

257
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,370
It is an order.

258
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:34,353
It is not like I wanted to get hurt.

259
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:37,459
Do not laugh in front of others.
Hold it in.

260
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:40,061
That is also an order.

261
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:42,882
I refuse.

262
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:45,984
What? You refuse?

263
00:25:23,192 --> 00:25:24,193
That is your punishment...

264
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:26,954
...for defying the Crown Prince's orders.

265
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,011
Me?

266
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,739
We were discussing marriage
with Councilor Kim's family.

267
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,332
What shall I do?

268
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:55,025
Father.

269
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,909
Please obey the King's orders.

270
00:25:59,412 --> 00:26:01,681
It is not that simple.

271
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,573
I heard the Crown Prince is struggling

272
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,300
because of servants
who are not loyal or trustworthy.

273
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,861
I was wondering
how I could be of comfort.

274
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:18,412
Do you have such feelings
for the Crown Prince?

275
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,258
I wish to be of help

276
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:23,919
even if it is not me he needs,

277
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:27,042
but this family.

278
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:30,459
It does not matter.

279
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:34,292
Are you sure?

280
00:26:35,142 --> 00:26:39,180
If you fail to be selected as his wife
because of Councilor Kim's tactics,

281
00:26:39,884 --> 00:26:42,687
you will have to live alone
for the rest of your life.

282
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:47,704
Yes.

283
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:51,211
I will not regret it
regardless of the outcome.

284
00:27:12,503 --> 00:27:15,341
Do not budge. Stay here until I return.

285
00:27:16,186 --> 00:27:18,347
Master Jang will be looking for me.

286
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:20,024
That is why.

287
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:22,753
If you walk around to work,

288
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:25,316
it may get worse.

289
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,482
It is not that bad.

290
00:27:29,676 --> 00:27:32,713
Will you defy my order again?

291
00:27:36,548 --> 00:27:37,549
No, Your Highness.

292
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:41,561
Fine, Your Highness.

293
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:26,806
Father.

294
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:31,729
I am discussing your marriage
with Minister Cho.

295
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:33,680
Please withdraw your order.

296
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:36,919
I thought long and hard
before making my decision.

297
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,198
It's the only family left
in Joseon dominated by the Kim

298
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:46,040
that can help us without
being controlled by Councilor Kim.

299
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:47,594
It is the best option.

300
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:50,397
You will only create more enemies.

301
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,535
Your marriage will bring
the royal family stability

302
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,036
and unite the hearts
of the confused people.

303
00:28:57,113 --> 00:28:58,981
The moment they see you waver,

304
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:03,206
the people will be manipulated
by the rebels.

305
00:29:09,077 --> 00:29:10,912
My apologies, Your Majesty.

306
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:16,056
I do not wish to marry someone
in order to gain political power.

307
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,346
- Crown Prince!
- I shall win my people

308
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:21,628
my own way.

309
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:24,497
So please withdraw your order.

310
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,674
How could I lie down peacefully

311
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:39,106
after hearing something so outrageous?

312
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:43,917
Why is the Crown Prince's marriage
such a big deal?

313
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:45,927
Father.

314
00:29:47,687 --> 00:29:50,957
Do you not consider the prince
inside my womb?

315
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:54,794
That is why the Crown Prince is rushing.

316
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:59,477
They know time is of the essence as well.

317
00:30:00,033 --> 00:30:02,702
What if someone from the Cho
becomes the queen?

318
00:30:03,036 --> 00:30:04,804
You were a kisaeng.

319
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,642
But I made you the Queen.

320
00:30:10,343 --> 00:30:11,544
Father.

321
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:16,383
I am saying this so that you do not worry

322
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,718
and focus on giving birth safely.

323
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:20,787
Do you understand?

324
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:33,466
I am discussing your marriage
with Minister Cho.

325
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:41,341
It's the only family left in Joseon.

326
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,682
We must unite the hearts
of the confused people.

327
00:30:57,557 --> 00:31:00,594
Do not budge. Stay here until I return.

328
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:05,799
Let us stop here.

329
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,801
You are excused.

330
00:31:10,133 --> 00:31:10,973
Yes, Your Highness.

331
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:37,197
You ordered me not to budge.

332
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:40,967
How could you come so late?

333
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,576
How can you laugh right now?

334
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,050
Get on my back.

335
00:31:57,651 --> 00:31:58,652
Excuse me?

336
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:04,357
How could a eunuch
get on the Crown Prince's back?

337
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:05,825
I cannot.

338
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,528
Do not be confused.

339
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:11,665
I would do this for Hoonnam
if he hurt his leg.

340
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,801
I refuse.

341
00:32:16,736 --> 00:32:17,771
It is an order.

342
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,175
You said to treat you as a friend
when we are alone,

343
00:32:22,266 --> 00:32:24,678
but you always say, "It is an order."

344
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:25,674
What?

345
00:32:27,213 --> 00:32:28,748
Are you refusing to obey?

346
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:45,532
Why are you so light like a feather?

347
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,368
Do you mean it?

348
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:52,673
Your arms seem to be shaking slightly.

349
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,779
What if somebody sees us?

350
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:02,716
Do not worry.

351
00:33:04,344 --> 00:33:09,816
I know countless paths in this palace
that nobody takes.

352
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:16,376
You know,

353
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:20,842
the story about the mermaid
you told me before...

354
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:26,045
So in the end,
what happens to the two of them?

355
00:33:28,108 --> 00:33:31,478
You fell asleep and did not hear
the end, did you?

356
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:33,622
That is right.

357
00:33:35,005 --> 00:33:38,442
The prince does not realize
the mermaid loves him

358
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:40,644
and marries someone else,

359
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:44,728
so she turns into sea-foam
and disappears forever.

360
00:33:49,964 --> 00:33:51,432
It is a sad story.

361
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:57,389
Your Highness.

362
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:01,552
We are almost at Jahyeondang,
so please let me down.

363
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,551
No.

364
00:34:08,305 --> 00:34:09,873
Let us return to Donggungjeon.

365
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:11,925
Sorry?

366
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,923
Your Highness,
you must let me down there, okay?

367
00:34:17,035 --> 00:34:19,506
No. We will return to Jahyeondang.

368
00:34:19,681 --> 00:34:21,194
Your Highness!

369
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,358
What if somebody sees us?

370
00:34:48,631 --> 00:34:49,899
Eat up.

371
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:54,557
You are a lucky wench,
being treated so well

372
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:56,804
after getting pregnant as a court lady.

373
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:00,087
Thank you, Your Highness.

374
00:35:00,876 --> 00:35:01,944
But...

375
00:35:04,544 --> 00:35:07,710
What will happen to me and my baby?

376
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:10,710
Nothing bad will happen
if you keep your mouth shut,

377
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:11,912
so do not worry.

378
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:29,810
It is definitely a prince.

379
00:35:30,784 --> 00:35:34,221
If it's not right,
there will be fury to deal with.

380
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:35,213
Are you positive?

381
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:39,953
Yes, I feel an energy
that is strong and intelligent.

382
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,898
After checking again,

383
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:55,464
are you sure it is not a son?

384
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,458
No, Your Highness.

385
00:35:57,982 --> 00:36:01,252
It is definitely a princess.

386
00:36:02,442 --> 00:36:05,345
I have waited six years to get pregnant.

387
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,929
Do you think I will give up

388
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:13,420
an opportunity that has been given me?

389
00:36:20,227 --> 00:36:22,462
I will create a new prince

390
00:36:24,477 --> 00:36:26,345
to inherit the Kingdom of Joseon,

391
00:36:27,282 --> 00:36:28,817
no matter what it takes.

392
00:36:37,522 --> 00:36:39,657
Stop. Silence.

393
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:41,570
Look here.

394
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:45,709
First, if you have time to kill,

395
00:36:45,847 --> 00:36:46,687
I want you to volunteer.

396
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:51,425
I see whether you are tired
or rested. You.

397
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,569
You look well fed. You are selected.

398
00:36:58,877 --> 00:36:59,978
Where am I going?

399
00:37:00,124 --> 00:37:03,449
You're assigned to where
we prepare royal family's weddings.

400
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:05,338
Is someone getting married?

401
00:37:06,229 --> 00:37:08,967
Who else? Your Prince Dung.

402
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:10,677
Pardon?

403
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:14,309
Out of my way.

404
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:32,299
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

405
00:37:41,274 --> 00:37:42,442
You know,

406
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,495
the story about

407
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:47,381
the mermaid you told me before...

408
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:50,718
So in the end,

409
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,362
what happens to the two of them?

410
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:57,734
The prince does not realize
the mermaid loves him

411
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:00,335
and marries someone else,

412
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:04,572
so she turns into sea-foam
and disappears forever.

413
00:38:08,802 --> 00:38:10,103
It is a sad story.

414
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:31,312
Eunuch Hong.

415
00:38:33,885 --> 00:38:34,725
My Lord.

416
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,501
Please do not stand up.

417
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:44,022
I just needed to take a rest for a while.

418
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,910
You are very tempting.

419
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:50,249
Pardon?

420
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:53,889
Whenever I see you,

421
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:55,689
you make me want to sit on my behind.

422
00:38:59,043 --> 00:39:00,878
I assume you are very busy.

423
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,524
Yes, I am. I have to prepare
for the marriage of...

424
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:09,306
I heard about it as well.

425
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,545
You mean the marriage
of the Crown Prince, right?

426
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:13,411
That is right.

427
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:17,627
So many events take place in the palace.

428
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,286
We have so much to do.

429
00:39:39,373 --> 00:39:40,908
I wanted to pretend I did not know,

430
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:44,529
but it is all written on your face.

431
00:39:45,398 --> 00:39:46,532
I have no choice.

432
00:39:53,418 --> 00:39:55,887
I will pretend to be busy then.

433
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:59,361
I will leave you alone so you can rest.

434
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,492
Be as sad as you wish.

435
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,438
Cry as much as you need,

436
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:29,886
suffer from a broken heart...

437
00:40:31,401 --> 00:40:32,602
...and then come to me.

438
00:40:43,992 --> 00:40:46,561
If I promise to take your side,

439
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:50,525
you will appoint me as a high official.

440
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:52,472
Is that what you are suggesting,
Your Highness?

441
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:56,772
I did not say that you will be my person
when you are on my side.

442
00:40:57,343 --> 00:41:01,180
If that is the case,
what do you expect from me?

443
00:41:02,505 --> 00:41:03,807
I expect you to be an earnest worker.

444
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:09,354
I need you to be strong enough
to keep the truth alive.

445
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:14,285
I need you to be sure enough
not to be blinded by anything.

446
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:16,190
Your Highness.

447
00:41:18,024 --> 00:41:22,462
A string that is pulled too tight on a bow
is bound to break.

448
00:41:24,976 --> 00:41:25,977
That is right.

449
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,744
As you did just now,

450
00:41:28,714 --> 00:41:30,549
teach me right from wrong.

451
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:35,812
That is what I ask of you.

452
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:43,732
You said you have two things to tell me.
What is the other one?

453
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:48,958
It is about a lady.

454
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:52,880
A lady?

455
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,081
Yes.

456
00:41:57,216 --> 00:41:59,185
I need your help

457
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:02,710
so that I do not lose her.

458
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:26,996
What were you doing?

459
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:31,575
Master Sung told me
to deliver the book to you, Master.

460
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,159
And then?

461
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,731
I saw the white egret flower

462
00:42:39,674 --> 00:42:41,676
embroidered on your handkerchief.

463
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:42,970
I see.

464
00:42:45,757 --> 00:42:47,692
You must know much about flowers.

465
00:42:48,416 --> 00:42:52,286
Not many people know
the name of this flower.

466
00:42:53,815 --> 00:42:55,817
My mother used
to like this flower, Master.

467
00:42:56,902 --> 00:42:58,404
She said it is not only pretty,

468
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:00,930
but also it has a good meaning.

469
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:07,679
This flower was embroidered
on the handkerchief

470
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:10,363
that my old friend used to carry
with him all the time.

471
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:16,088
He said it was given by his wife
he had parted with.

472
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:25,964
If you are finished,
I will excuse myself, Master.

473
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:29,034
Sure.

474
00:43:49,304 --> 00:43:51,205
Are these truly not yours?

475
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:54,059
No, My Lord. I do not know what they are.

476
00:43:59,331 --> 00:44:00,699
We found them in your wagon.

477
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:02,801
Will you keep lying to me?

478
00:44:03,068 --> 00:44:05,204
No, My Lord. I do not know what they are.

479
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:07,973
It is clear that she is one of the rebels.

480
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,708
Take her to
the Department of Justice right now!

481
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:12,144
- Yes, My Lord.
- Please. No, My Lord!

482
00:44:36,547 --> 00:44:40,220
Show me the proof of treason
I have committed.

483
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:42,315
We have confirmed

484
00:44:42,706 --> 00:44:45,009
that you have been providing
the rebels with supplies.

485
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:46,979
How dare you!

486
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,875
Is giving away food to the poor treason?

487
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:54,794
They are neither rebels nor rioters.

488
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,940
They are poor peasants
who are suffering from hunger.

489
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:03,500
Would you say it is an act of patriotism

490
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:09,465
to do nothing
and watch the innocent die of hunger?

491
00:45:24,573 --> 00:45:26,208
Father...

492
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:05,090
Do you mean...

493
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:08,570
...you lost your parents
during the riot 10 years ago?

494
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:10,624
Yes, Master.

495
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,965
I parted with my mother then.

496
00:46:14,407 --> 00:46:16,977
How old are you?

497
00:46:17,914 --> 00:46:18,982
I am 18 years old.

498
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:31,316
She is only 10 years old.

499
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:32,466
Because she is young,

500
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,709
they must have thought
she could deceive us easily.

501
00:46:36,921 --> 00:46:40,257
We cannot be sure how many rebels

502
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:43,271
are hiding behind this girl.

503
00:46:44,157 --> 00:46:46,259
She must have done it

504
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,946
for a little money. No, for a little food.

505
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:52,747
She doesn't even know how to read.

506
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:56,208
How could she have known
how serious it was?

507
00:46:57,142 --> 00:46:59,478
She should not be punished as a traitor.

508
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:02,047
Please reconsider your decision,
Your Majesty.

509
00:47:02,593 --> 00:47:05,529
Crown Prince, the moment
you let your guard down,

510
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:08,004
the security of the palace gets breached.

511
00:47:09,316 --> 00:47:11,785
Do not forgive her
and make an example of her.

512
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,654
Punish her severely.

513
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,185
I want

514
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:38,620
to stay here a little longer.

515
00:47:40,028 --> 00:47:41,362
I wonder...

516
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:45,878
What has captured your heart

517
00:47:47,025 --> 00:47:48,827
enough for you to take the risk?

518
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,335
I do not give permission.

519
00:47:55,022 --> 00:47:56,123
He belongs to me.

520
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:11,159
May I speak to you for a moment,
Your Highness?

521
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:12,251
Come in.

522
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:20,378
I contemplated hard...

523
00:48:21,187 --> 00:48:22,889
...whether I should ask you a favor
as your subject,

524
00:48:23,691 --> 00:48:24,659
or warn you

525
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:26,905
as your friend.

526
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:32,010
So, what is your decision?

527
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:36,214
It depends on your reaction,
Your Highness.

528
00:48:39,146 --> 00:48:40,247
I will hear you out.

529
00:48:42,538 --> 00:48:45,007
The preparation
of your marriage has begun.

530
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:47,492
And?

531
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,562
There is a person who is heartbroken
watching every step of it.

532
00:48:52,148 --> 00:48:53,115
But...

533
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:56,028
The person must pretend
to be all right and smile

534
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,430
in front of you.

535
00:49:01,867 --> 00:49:03,569
What are you trying to say?

536
00:49:04,503 --> 00:49:05,604
That person.

537
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:09,756
I love that person.

538
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:20,352
I do not want to see her
suffer from a broken heart

539
00:49:22,321 --> 00:49:23,655
because of your greed.

540
00:49:24,623 --> 00:49:25,463
No.

541
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,427
I shall not let it happen.

542
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:41,940
I am here, My Lord.

543
00:49:51,243 --> 00:49:54,313
Hong Raon.

544
00:49:59,268 --> 00:50:00,603
Why did you not tell me?

545
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:05,755
Did you mean to let
the Crown Prince have her?

546
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:08,973
No, My Lord.

547
00:50:09,668 --> 00:50:10,736
Then...

548
00:50:12,271 --> 00:50:13,405
Was it Councilor Kim?

549
00:50:16,575 --> 00:50:19,044
She has been through a lot.

550
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,015
So I did not want her to know

551
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:27,720
the pain I went through.

552
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:35,594
She knows nothing.

553
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:39,509
She cannot give us
any information of Hong Gyeongnae.

554
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,341
So...

555
00:50:42,357 --> 00:50:46,428
Can we not let her live
without ever knowing the truth?

556
00:50:50,727 --> 00:50:52,562
When I sent you to the Crown Prince,

557
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:54,883
I told you many times

558
00:50:56,067 --> 00:50:59,570
to do as you are told
without making judgements.

559
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:02,424
I told you there is
nothing more dangerous

560
00:51:02,515 --> 00:51:04,445
than a spy who acts on his own free will!

561
00:51:10,498 --> 00:51:11,733
Stop!

562
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,552
Your Highness, this is a letter
from Master Jeong.

563
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:56,365
Your Highness, I found a way
to do what you asked before.

564
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:59,565
Please arrange a meeting with her.

565
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,543
Would you like to come with me?

566
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:05,827
Is this man...

567
00:53:07,179 --> 00:53:09,114
...the leader of Baekwoon Group?

568
00:53:16,221 --> 00:53:18,757
Were you the one
who brought me here 10 years ago,

569
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:21,959
Chief Eunuch Han?

570
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:24,036
That is right.

571
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:27,844
I have been watching you.

572
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,577
On the day when there is
a meeting of the Baekwoon Group,

573
00:53:35,274 --> 00:53:37,142
when everyone is watching,

574
00:53:39,411 --> 00:53:41,413
I will bring Hong Gyeongnae's daughter.

575
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:16,181
Are you smiling
because you are glad to see me?

576
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:18,990
Yes, Your Highness.

577
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,356
I am happy whenever I see your face.

578
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:26,892
I cannot help it.

579
00:54:38,337 --> 00:54:39,838
Why did you pretend you did not know?

580
00:54:44,476 --> 00:54:45,544
I mean...

581
00:54:47,346 --> 00:54:49,314
Why are you pretending to be all right?

582
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:55,254
Your Highness.

583
00:54:56,655 --> 00:54:58,390
Please do not try so hard.

584
00:55:01,927 --> 00:55:03,929
There is nothing you can do about it.

585
00:55:05,731 --> 00:55:07,833
You cannot keep crying over it.

586
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:13,439
What is it?

587
00:55:15,908 --> 00:55:17,843
Are you planning to disappear...

588
00:55:18,844 --> 00:55:20,979
...like sea-foam
after pretending to be all right?

589
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:47,005
I have found a way
to keep you with me as a woman.

590
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:56,036
Pardon?

591
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:57,962
I do not like the story you told me.

592
00:55:59,182 --> 00:56:01,150
I will change the ending of the story.

593
00:56:03,555 --> 00:56:04,690
The two of them

594
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:09,762
will live together happily ever after.

595
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:13,265
Like us.

596
00:56:17,936 --> 00:56:18,937
Your Highness.

597
00:56:45,676 --> 00:56:47,345
We need to meet someone.

598
00:56:47,788 --> 00:56:50,490
Let's meet at seven
in the morning at the gate.

599
00:57:32,938 --> 00:57:33,939
Master Han.

600
00:57:34,825 --> 00:57:37,194
What brought you here?

601
00:57:38,127 --> 00:57:42,965
I have spent
a long time trying to find you.

602
00:57:43,989 --> 00:57:45,024
Pardon?

603
00:57:46,992 --> 00:57:48,394
Have you been looking for me?

604
00:57:51,423 --> 00:57:53,592
I have something to tell you.

605
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:56,588
Raon.

606
00:58:04,743 --> 00:58:07,780
How do you know my name?

607
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:14,766
How do you know that name?

608
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:23,662
Hong Raon.
