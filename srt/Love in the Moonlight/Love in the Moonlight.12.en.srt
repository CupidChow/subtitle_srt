1
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:19,737
You have a guest.

2
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,359
Did you go to Supyo Bridge again?

3
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,265
Yes.

4
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:37,404
I've been having strange dreams
since I saw someone who looked...

5
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,407
...just like my child
at the Lantern Festival.

6
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:45,830
If you face...

7
00:00:48,646 --> 00:00:50,414
...a very difficult situation,

8
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,653
and must let go of something,

9
00:00:59,132 --> 00:01:00,934
it must not be me.

10
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:04,694
Can you promise me?

11
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:16,730
Yes, Your Highness.

12
00:01:20,134 --> 00:01:21,135
Good.

13
00:01:22,937 --> 00:01:23,938
Now,

14
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:26,740
I think my wish has been granted.

15
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:31,879
What do you mean, Your Highness?

16
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:38,452
My wish...

17
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:41,522
...for your wish to be granted.

18
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:55,363
I found your mother.

19
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:10,872
Mom.

20
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,544
Raon.

21
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,415
I am sorry for being so late.

22
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,918
Mom.

23
00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,121
Mom.

24
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,624
Mom... Mom...

25
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:35,930
I am sorry, Raon.

26
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:51,513
Mom.

27
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,836
Why are you hiding it?

28
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:30,315
What do you mean?

29
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,798
Hong Raon's mother.

30
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,264
You know they're searching
for one another.

31
00:04:41,796 --> 00:04:43,064
Why are you...

32
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:45,967
...keeping silent?

33
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:50,617
If she is her mother, what will you do?

34
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:53,197
Obviously, I must help them reunite.

35
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:59,314
What if it causes you harm
if she finds her mother?

36
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,588
If you just bury the truth,

37
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,106
you and Raon...

38
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,991
...may be able to live happily together.

39
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:15,809
I do not know what that danger is,

40
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,003
but I will not separate them
for my own gain.

41
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,821
CHAPTER 12 Faith Becomes Destiny

42
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,505
It must have been so hard.

43
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,895
I have forgotten all about it.

44
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:06,606
I thought I would never see you again,

45
00:06:07,463 --> 00:06:09,131
but here we are together again.

46
00:06:22,943 --> 00:06:23,944
But...

47
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,035
...what happened?

48
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:30,171
How are you a eunuch?

49
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:33,374
I will tell you over time.

50
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,244
Do not worry.

51
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:40,081
I met good people and am doing well.

52
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:43,418
The Crown Prince is good to me too.

53
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:49,724
The Crown Prince...

54
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:56,664
Are you saying that man
is the Crown Prince?

55
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,225
I made a promise,
so I will not ask anymore.

56
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,482
I am curious and worried
about what you said,

57
00:07:21,022 --> 00:07:24,592
but thank you
for letting me choose first.

58
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,662
Your Highness.

59
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:33,701
Destiny can neither be created
nor avoided just because you wish.

60
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:37,372
That is exactly what I wanted to say.

61
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:01,262
I will send her to you soon officially,

62
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,218
so do not be too disappointed.

63
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:08,636
Yes, Your Highness.

64
00:08:15,577 --> 00:08:16,778
I will see you soon.

65
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,225
I trust you, Grandpa.

66
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:32,660
Do not drink too much.

67
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,545
You rascal.

68
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,483
Do I look like a grandpa to you?

69
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:44,539
Let us go.

70
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:15,999
It is now up to Raon to decide.

71
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:20,378
This is not a matter of her deciding.

72
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,548
The palace?

73
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,580
And next to the Crown Prince
of all people.

74
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:27,569
This cannot be.

75
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,813
You know that, do you not?

76
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:43,998
Your Highness.

77
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:53,942
I don't think it will stop soon.

78
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,637
No.

79
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:00,654
Your Highness, wait here.

80
00:10:01,116 --> 00:10:02,817
I will fetch an umbrella.

81
00:10:04,352 --> 00:10:05,353
Go ahead.

82
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:09,624
Did you expect me to say that?

83
00:10:13,027 --> 00:10:14,028
Me?

84
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,525
Can you walk more quickly?

85
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:50,064
The Crown Prince never runs
in the palace, correct?

86
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,667
Never.

87
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:56,438
Yes, I know.

88
00:11:00,236 --> 00:11:01,170
But what?

89
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:05,180
Do you think the Crown Prince
has ever liked a eunuch?

90
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:09,818
It all just happened somehow.

91
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,848
Book of Records

92
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,573
Are you all right, Your Highness?

93
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,189
What if you catch a cold?

94
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:23,344
I am frightened.

95
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,150
Of what?

96
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,821
Because I am so happy.

97
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:42,764
What if someone else's happiness
came to me as well?

98
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:45,767
And so,

99
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:49,671
what if they take it back?

100
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:56,277
Are you that happy
to see your mother again?

101
00:14:58,913 --> 00:15:04,285
I have a person I want to be with
both in and out of the palace.

102
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:06,788
How could I not be happy?

103
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:11,793
If you are happy, I am happy.

104
00:15:14,062 --> 00:15:15,163
However,

105
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:19,501
you speak as if you will be happy
outside without me.

106
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,603
I am hurt.

107
00:15:24,706 --> 00:15:26,474
Do not worry, Your Highness.

108
00:15:27,742 --> 00:15:31,346
I will not go anywhere
without your permission.

109
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:34,115
Do you mean it?

110
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:35,817
Of course.

111
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:53,835
I left it in Donggungjeon
as you ordered, but...

112
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,504
Good work.

113
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:01,476
If this keeps happening,
they'll increase security.

114
00:16:02,243 --> 00:16:03,611
Will you be all right?

115
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:06,648
If I were not going to act,

116
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,269
there would be no reason to hide.

117
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,689
We must show him...

118
00:16:16,124 --> 00:16:19,627
...that he is being judged
by the people nearby.

119
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:24,966
You may go.

120
00:16:27,368 --> 00:16:28,436
Yes, Master.

121
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,177
When will you tell her?

122
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:39,647
Hong Raon.

123
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:42,650
I am waiting...

124
00:16:44,886 --> 00:16:47,589
...until the Crown Prince
becomes incapable.

125
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:25,560
Do you know what these are?

126
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:28,763
What are they?

127
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:32,167
They are appeals
reporting your corruption.

128
00:17:34,235 --> 00:17:35,270
But...

129
00:17:36,037 --> 00:17:38,239
Why are there so many here now,

130
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:41,810
when I never saw a single one before?

131
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,480
Chief Royal Secretary.

132
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:47,615
Tell me.

133
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,189
Your Highness,

134
00:17:54,656 --> 00:18:00,895
unconfirmed appeals
are merely attempts to slander.

135
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:11,334
I guess this person
expected that response,

136
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:16,344
so he sent evidence along with it.

137
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,751
Book of Records

138
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:28,957
This is a list of people
who paid you for their posts.

139
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,498
Book of Records

140
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:41,970
It details who paid whom,

141
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,006
how much, when, where
and for what position.

142
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:49,544
Your Highness, this is unfair.

143
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:50,812
Chief Royal Secretary.

144
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,483
I asked you to confirm
with the people on the list.

145
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,053
What happened?

146
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:02,490
They all confessed that it is true.

147
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:10,999
Your Highness,

148
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:14,502
I am being framed.

149
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,977
You took bribes in exchange
for official appointments.

150
00:19:18,284 --> 00:19:20,519
You corrupted the Royal Court.

151
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:22,711
Remove Kim Uigyo...

152
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,280
...from his office.

153
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:27,749
Yes, Your Highness.

154
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,584
I will do as you ordered.

155
00:19:29,718 --> 00:19:31,052
Remove me?

156
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:34,322
Please withdraw your order,
Your Highness.

157
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,327
You must decide with caution,

158
00:19:39,728 --> 00:19:43,298
after conducting a thorough investigation.

159
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:46,468
You are correct.

160
00:19:49,003 --> 00:19:51,272
I am investigating this thoroughly.

161
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:54,709
I will question and hold those accountable,

162
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,512
who kept silent about it all this time.

163
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:13,097
It is the book that
disappeared when I was robbed...

164
00:20:13,188 --> 00:20:15,337
...by the Baekwoon Group that time.

165
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,488
But...

166
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,436
...how did it end up
in the Crown Prince's hands?

167
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,605
My point exactly.

168
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:28,910
So he ordered your removal from office?

169
00:20:32,647 --> 00:20:34,182
My Lord, it is I, Choolsung.

170
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:35,550
Come in.

171
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:44,503
Did you look into it?

172
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,396
I went to meet the man
with the information,

173
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:50,156
but he was already dead.

174
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:58,239
I think they eliminated him.

175
00:20:58,306 --> 00:20:59,374
What?

176
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:02,410
Did you not find out anything else then?

177
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,081
Hong Gyeongnae's daughter
used to be called...

178
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,016
...Hong Raon.

179
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,321
Hong Raon.

180
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:19,761
She could not have used that name openly.

181
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:25,367
Keep digging until you find out more.

182
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:26,801
Yes, Master.

183
00:21:48,713 --> 00:21:50,715
Hello, Master Kim.

184
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:52,828
Tell His Highness
I wish to discuss the date

185
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:54,820
for the first process
of the princess selection.

186
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,433
Yes, but His Highness is in the library.

187
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,235
Shall I relay the message?

188
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:05,073
No. I will go there myself.

189
00:22:05,507 --> 00:22:06,541
Yes, Master.

190
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:28,256
Do you see me even with your eyes closed?

191
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,397
You smile so much even as you sleep.

192
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:39,367
Yes, Your Highness.

193
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:43,071
I was dreaming of you.

194
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:00,188
What was the dream about?

195
00:24:01,289 --> 00:24:04,726
I dreamed about the day

196
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:09,557
you first called me, "Raon".

197
00:24:14,469 --> 00:24:17,439
Sleep more, Raon.

198
00:24:20,975 --> 00:24:21,976
Raon?

199
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,115
Hong Gyeongnae's daughter
used to be called...

200
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:29,117
...Hong Raon.

201
00:24:29,651 --> 00:24:30,652
Raon.

202
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:33,154
Hong Raon.

203
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,828
Donggungjeon?

204
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:43,365
The Crown Prince is being arrogant.

205
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:45,834
We cannot let him be.

206
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,839
We must scare him good
so that he cannot dare talk back.

207
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,777
But that is treason, is it not?

208
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,982
I have a good idea.

209
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:16,064
Frame the rebels.

210
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:18,867
Is that it?

211
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:22,537
The rebels have been active lately anyway,

212
00:25:22,904 --> 00:25:24,939
so why not?

213
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:31,513
Get me some quick and ruthless men.

214
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,649
Once everything is over,

215
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:38,920
they will leave this mask
and go into hiding.

216
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,289
It is killing three birds with one stone.

217
00:25:42,157 --> 00:25:44,358
We can expedite
the Crown Prince's wedding,

218
00:25:44,449 --> 00:25:47,095
heighten their fear
of the Baekwoon Group,

219
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,433
and make the arrogant Crown Prince
bow at our feet.

220
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,603
We shall make him kiss our boots.

221
00:25:58,973 --> 00:26:01,543
What about Councilor Kim?

222
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:04,345
It is not like we can hide it from him.

223
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:07,582
But it is not like he would stop us, either.

224
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:57,432
What... What... What brings you here?

225
00:26:57,932 --> 00:26:59,901
I am sure I told you if I saw you again,

226
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:02,680
I would not forgive you.

227
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:04,861
Your Highness, the truth is...

228
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:08,033
What were you doing
in front of the Princess' quarters?

229
00:27:08,124 --> 00:27:10,393
Tell me right this instant.

230
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:14,215
The sun behind the clouds is so nice...

231
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:23,792
The truth is I could not forget
the beautiful lady...

232
00:27:24,793 --> 00:27:26,594
...who used to live here. So I came.

233
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:32,033
Someone who used to live here?

234
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,669
Not me, but someone else who's beautiful?

235
00:27:37,343 --> 00:27:38,344
Does he mean Wolhee?

236
00:27:38,954 --> 00:27:40,222
Now, she is...

237
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:46,815
I mean, she is no longer here.

238
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,387
What is that? Bring it to me.

239
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:00,655
I remembered what she used to like,

240
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,198
so I brought them.

241
00:28:03,898 --> 00:28:04,899
Awesome.

242
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:13,763
Wolhee did not like things like this.

243
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,511
Take them back.

244
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,781
Out of sight, out of mind.

245
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,021
Whoever she is,

246
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:29,124
you must have liked someone
with similar taste as mine.

247
00:28:30,525 --> 00:28:31,793
I apologize for mistaking you.

248
00:28:32,527 --> 00:28:33,561
You may go.

249
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:38,133
Yes, Your Highness.

250
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:39,327
What brings you here?

251
00:29:44,966 --> 00:29:45,967
Byeongyeon.

252
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:50,705
Are you inside?

253
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,110
Your Highness.

254
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:10,719
How have you been?

255
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:16,491
I thought if I met his family,

256
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:22,263
I would at least find out if he was alive.

257
00:31:23,003 --> 00:31:26,473
This is why I have stayed out of touch.

258
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,933
Have you ever thought about
how Raon and I lived...

259
00:31:31,606 --> 00:31:36,044
...during those 10 years
while he was preparing for rebellion?

260
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:37,612
From now on,

261
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,382
we shall protect you two.

262
00:31:41,683 --> 00:31:42,851
I do not want that.

263
00:31:43,518 --> 00:31:45,653
What are you planning
to do with Raon this time?

264
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:49,324
Please help us.
Let the thousands of deaths...

265
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:51,359
...count for something.

266
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,165
We know nothing about it.

267
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:00,602
Please...

268
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:05,240
Stop trying to get us involved.

269
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,053
Your Highness.

270
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:30,832
Byeongyeon.

271
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,072
Are you hurt?

272
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,846
Yes, Your Highness. I had an accident.

273
00:32:46,514 --> 00:32:50,385
One of the trainees
made a mistake while training.

274
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:54,889
You could have been hurt badly.

275
00:32:58,493 --> 00:32:59,728
Is the injury...

276
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:02,130
...not serious?

277
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,367
I am fine, Your Highness.

278
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,314
Did you say Chief Kim left the palace?

279
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:21,583
So soon?

280
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:22,884
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:26,955
He said he was too ill
to attend the training.

282
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:29,624
Was he injured badly
during yesterday's training?

283
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:32,027
Your Highness,
there was no training yesterday.

284
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:37,032
There was no training?

285
00:33:37,632 --> 00:33:38,833
That is right, Your Highness.

286
00:33:53,848 --> 00:33:55,650
My Lord, is that you?

287
00:33:57,686 --> 00:34:00,655
I am on my way to your house, My Lord.

288
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,792
Why are you going there
at such a late hour?

289
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,394
We finally found out the truth...

290
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:09,564
about the girl, Hong Raon.

291
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:17,272
What did you find out about her?

292
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,868
That bold wench is living in the palace.

293
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,113
In the palace?

294
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,751
Are you certain?

295
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,052
Yes, My Lord.

296
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,122
I must tell Councilor Kim
so that we can take her first.

297
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:38,927
So you have not
told this to anyone yet, correct?

298
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:40,495
No, My Lord.

299
00:34:41,196 --> 00:34:42,297
I just...

300
00:34:43,732 --> 00:34:45,834
...found out myself.

301
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,571
I see. Then you should go first.

302
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,539
I will go home later.

303
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:52,807
Yes, My Lord.

304
00:35:17,932 --> 00:35:18,967
My Lord.

305
00:35:19,334 --> 00:35:21,503
I forgot to tell you something.

306
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:24,339
Yes, My Lord.

307
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:29,911
You see...

308
00:35:50,058 --> 00:35:52,114
(Hong Raon is working as a eunuch
in the palace by the name Hong Samnon)

309
00:36:50,392 --> 00:36:51,459
Hurry up.

310
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,442
Please forgive me for visiting so late.

311
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:11,513
If it is about Samnom,
do not say anything.

312
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,083
If there is anything she needs,

313
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,053
I shall help her.

314
00:37:18,586 --> 00:37:19,688
No, Your Highness.

315
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:21,656
I must tell you.

316
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:25,860
What Eunuch Hong needs right now,

317
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:28,897
is to leave the palace.

318
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,334
Kim Yunseong.

319
00:37:33,268 --> 00:37:35,503
I already told you
that is not your concern.

320
00:37:35,737 --> 00:37:37,772
She should not be here.

321
00:37:38,106 --> 00:37:39,808
-The palace is...
-I shall...

322
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:43,111
...find a way.

323
00:37:44,312 --> 00:37:45,814
As long as you two stay together,

324
00:37:47,315 --> 00:37:49,317
you will be in danger as well,
Your Highness.

325
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:58,693
What if it causes you harm
when she finds her mother?

326
00:38:02,764 --> 00:38:04,766
What is the danger...

327
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:07,736
...that I will be in?

328
00:38:16,845 --> 00:38:17,779
Forget it.

329
00:38:20,348 --> 00:38:22,450
If such things were going
to change my mind,

330
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:24,786
I would not even have started this.

331
00:38:27,122 --> 00:38:28,390
So leave now.

332
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:48,677
They must have begun by now.

333
00:39:18,607 --> 00:39:19,708
Who is out there?

334
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:22,644
Is anyone out there?

335
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:54,142
Who is out there?

336
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,187
Who are you?

337
00:41:16,024 --> 00:41:17,425
As you can see, I am unarmed.

338
00:41:20,195 --> 00:41:21,830
I do not know what you want,

339
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:23,865
but let him go...

340
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,301
...before we begin.

341
00:43:53,748 --> 00:43:54,816
Is it you, Byeongyeon?

342
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:17,606
Yes, Your Highness.

343
00:44:18,106 --> 00:44:19,207
Please forgive me for being late.

344
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:41,696
Your Highness.

345
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:43,598
Your Highness.

346
00:44:44,966 --> 00:44:45,967
Your Highness.

347
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:51,840
Your Highness.

348
00:45:00,048 --> 00:45:01,049
Your Highness...

349
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:03,585
Your Highness...

350
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:07,956
Your Highness...

351
00:45:09,658 --> 00:45:13,461
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

352
00:45:17,499 --> 00:45:18,566
Your Majesty.

353
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,869
Councilor Kim.

354
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:23,338
What should we do?

355
00:45:23,872 --> 00:45:27,575
Is it true that the masked thieves
attacked the Crown Prince?

356
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:28,877
Yes, Your Majesty.

357
00:45:30,545 --> 00:45:33,715
You have to stay strong
in times like these.

358
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:38,119
Such terrible things happened to my son,

359
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:43,258
but all I am doing is preventing
word from getting out.

360
00:45:43,558 --> 00:45:46,194
You must want to call
the Chief of the Palace Guards

361
00:45:46,294 --> 00:45:47,963
and have him interrogate the thieves,

362
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:51,933
but it is not good
to let others know about it.

363
00:45:57,339 --> 00:46:00,842
They will stir up
the people for bigger riots.

364
00:46:02,377 --> 00:46:04,145
I shall take care of this matter

365
00:46:04,546 --> 00:46:07,482
so the people will not get agitated,
Your Majesty.

366
00:46:30,305 --> 00:46:32,007
Is everything done for certain?

367
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,142
Of course, Master.

368
00:46:34,909 --> 00:46:37,779
His Majesty himself ordered
not to speak about it.

369
00:46:38,113 --> 00:46:39,981
It is fortunate.

370
00:46:40,982 --> 00:46:43,718
Even so, do not let your guard down.

371
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:48,156
Yes, we are aware of that.

372
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:52,459
We will excuse ourselves, Master.

373
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:05,707
What should we do?

374
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:07,409
We sent ten assassins.

375
00:47:07,475 --> 00:47:08,910
But there were only nine bodies.

376
00:47:09,444 --> 00:47:11,546
He must have run away, right?

377
00:47:14,015 --> 00:47:16,885
What should we do?
Report to him or hide it from him?

378
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:39,074
Master, I am a eunuch
serving the Crown Prince.

379
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,876
May I see His Highness for a moment?

380
00:47:42,243 --> 00:47:44,112
-No, you may not.
-Please wait.

381
00:47:45,213 --> 00:47:47,449
Is His Highness all right?

382
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:50,585
Please tell me, Master.

383
00:47:51,052 --> 00:47:52,287
Move aside!

384
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:04,633
Please...

385
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,436
Be strong, Your Highness.

386
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:19,307
When will you be back, Your Highness?

387
00:49:42,964 --> 00:49:45,967
Your Highness, can you recognize me?

388
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:58,380
There was so much blood
and bodies in Donggungjeon,

389
00:49:58,813 --> 00:50:00,815
so we moved you here for treatment.

390
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:05,587
His Majesty ordered
not to let anyone else in here

391
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,989
except for the royal physicians.

392
00:50:11,559 --> 00:50:14,362
Your Highness, you should not move yet.

393
00:50:17,165 --> 00:50:19,301
I need to get something
from Donggungjeon.

394
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:22,837
Bring someone from Donggungjeon.

395
00:50:36,918 --> 00:50:37,919
Your Highness.

396
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:41,790
I am here.

397
00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:51,833
Are you all right?

398
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:04,479
Your Highness.

399
00:51:07,215 --> 00:51:08,984
Do you remember...

400
00:51:10,285 --> 00:51:11,886
...that I said I was afraid

401
00:51:13,255 --> 00:51:14,623
because I was too happy?

402
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:24,833
When I saw you collapse,

403
00:51:27,702 --> 00:51:29,704
I was terrified.

404
00:51:33,141 --> 00:51:34,309
I thought...

405
00:51:37,012 --> 00:51:41,616
...they were taking back this happiness.

406
00:51:42,984 --> 00:51:44,519
That is what I thought.

407
00:51:49,424 --> 00:51:51,927
Please never let go of my hand.

408
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,938
I shall never let go, either.

409
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:37,439
How impertinent.

410
00:52:40,609 --> 00:52:42,043
No one...

411
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:46,081
...will take away your happiness
without my permission.

412
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,488
So do not cry.

413
00:52:58,593 --> 00:52:59,694
I will...

414
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,163
...never let go of this hand.

415
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,548
When will you return?

416
00:53:55,617 --> 00:53:56,918
I will return before the curfew bell...

417
00:53:57,218 --> 00:53:58,186
No.

418
00:53:59,988 --> 00:54:01,323
Return before sunset.

419
00:54:05,627 --> 00:54:09,531
You must be here before the sun sets.

420
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:14,069
Do you understand?

421
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:18,707
Yes, Your Highness.

422
00:54:27,649 --> 00:54:29,951
Where would the two of you go?

423
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,489
How could she be in the palace
near the Crown Prince?

424
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:37,359
This happened while I was away,

425
00:54:37,592 --> 00:54:39,060
because I was too afraid.

426
00:54:40,428 --> 00:54:42,931
How can I do nothing again?

427
00:54:56,945 --> 00:54:59,981
Raon and the Crown Prince

428
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:05,086
fell in love with each other.

429
00:55:05,854 --> 00:55:08,556
Do you really not know what that means?

430
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:31,112
Is it that late already?

431
00:55:31,446 --> 00:55:32,614
Yes, Your Highness.

432
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:35,450
It is almost nightfall, Your Highness.

433
00:55:37,152 --> 00:55:39,554
Okay. Go and make the preparations.

434
00:55:39,821 --> 00:55:41,056
Yes, Your Highness.

435
00:55:47,228 --> 00:55:49,764
I told her to return before sunset.

436
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:57,138
I tried so hard to free her

437
00:55:57,372 --> 00:55:59,174
from that wretched fate.

438
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,078
I beat that sweet child

439
00:56:05,213 --> 00:56:08,316
and made her live as a boy.

440
00:56:12,187 --> 00:56:15,790
I cannot leave her
in the palace for another minute.

441
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:21,096
What if someone finds out

442
00:56:22,163 --> 00:56:24,633
that Raon is Hong Gyeongnae's daughter?

443
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:53,094
Jahyeondang

444
00:57:10,145 --> 00:57:11,446
If you face...

445
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:15,984
...a very difficult situation

446
00:57:17,485 --> 00:57:19,421
and must let go of something,

447
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:26,628
it must not be me.

448
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,565
Can you promise me?

449
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,102
Do not worry, Your Highness.

450
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:39,040
I will not go anywhere
without your permission.

451
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:48,650
Did you wait long, Your Highness?
