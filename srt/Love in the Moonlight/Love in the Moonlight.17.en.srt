1
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:27,705
Byeongyeon.

2
00:00:34,113 --> 00:00:36,081
Arrest them right now!

3
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:42,712
Do not... Do not move!

4
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,856
His Highness' safety is top priority.

5
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,925
Clear a path at once!

6
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,596
Raon.

7
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:37,400
It may be a very difficult battle,

8
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:45,004
but I think I need
to find out what exactly Baekwoon is,

9
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:49,799
and what is the wall
between me and the people.

10
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,903
It is probably
on the other side of that wall.

11
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,545
What?

12
00:03:01,728 --> 00:03:05,465
The nation that you wish to create.

13
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:09,883
Is it?

14
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:18,081
I hope I can see it, Your Highness.

15
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:22,807
Then I will need your help.

16
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:28,886
Please...

17
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:34,093
Forgive me, Your Highness.

18
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,147
Byeongyeon.

19
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:42,635
I believe the world that Baekwoon wants

20
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,259
is not so different from the world

21
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:50,788
that you want, Your Highness.

22
00:03:56,944 --> 00:03:59,747
I really want to see the nation

23
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:06,643
beyond that wall
between you and the people...

24
00:04:11,905 --> 00:04:13,473
...that you will create.

25
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:39,054
Do not withdraw your sword.

26
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:43,971
The moment you do,

27
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,360
I will lose you.

28
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:57,573
Your Highness.

29
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,000
Do not withdraw your sword.

30
00:05:03,758 --> 00:05:04,826
It is an order.

31
00:05:10,797 --> 00:05:11,899
I...

32
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:17,663
...cannot comply.

33
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,465
I am sorry, Your Highness.

34
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,289
No.

35
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,947
No. No.

36
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,541
Stop!

37
00:06:40,362 --> 00:06:41,363
Byeongyeon!

38
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,146
Move.

39
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,347
Your Majesty.

40
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,444
Take His Majesty inside!

41
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:03,654
I said, step aside!

42
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:51,114
Byeongyeon.

43
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,151
Do not forget.

44
00:08:01,743 --> 00:08:02,877
If I had...

45
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,836
...just one person in the world
I could trust,

46
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,045
it would still...

47
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,171
...be you.

48
00:08:26,096 --> 00:08:27,364
Thank you...

49
00:08:32,621 --> 00:08:33,989
For believing...

50
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:42,907
...in me.

51
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:11,861
Byeongyeon...

52
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:21,932
Byeongyeon.

53
00:09:25,052 --> 00:09:26,053
Byeongyeon...

54
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,760
May we be nothing but friends
in our final moment.

55
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,488
May we be...

56
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,972
...nothing but friends...

57
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:00,162
...in our final moment.

58
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:17,293
Freeze.

59
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:24,714
Why are you exiting
the palace at this hour?

60
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:32,716
Open the gate.

61
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:43,601
It is the King's order to take the prisoner.

62
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:46,174
But... Master Han.

63
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:48,596
Yes, Master.

64
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:50,206
Open the gate.

65
00:10:58,245 --> 00:11:00,436
They are rebels! Close the gate!

66
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,667
Get them!

67
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,234
Please hurry.

68
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,107
Let us hurry.

69
00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,512
What are you doing? Come out!

70
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,571
I will buy you some time.

71
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:28,506
Master Han.

72
00:11:30,405 --> 00:11:32,106
Hurry. Take him.

73
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,366
Let us go.

74
00:11:35,457 --> 00:11:36,457
Hurry.

75
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:05,900
We must go.

76
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:27,959
Wait a moment. A moment is all I need.

77
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,050
Just a moment.

78
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:42,657
Look here. I am an old friend of his.

79
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:45,987
Would you let me take his body?

80
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,090
- No.
- Wait.

81
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,215
Come on.

82
00:13:01,895 --> 00:13:02,895
Chief Kim.

83
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:46,168
CHAPTER 17 An Ending for a Beginning

84
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,198
One Month Later

85
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,422
Your Highness, are you awake?

86
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:56,295
Your Highness,

87
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,420
are you awake?

88
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:06,076
Your Highness, are you awake?

89
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:09,876
Your...

90
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:14,368
Your Highness.

91
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,330
Of course, you can't be
since you are not here.

92
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,728
I assume you do not need
to use the restroom.

93
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,348
It is fine.

94
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:30,618
I shall take the scolding,

95
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,376
so do not worry.

96
00:14:34,736 --> 00:14:36,503
Time to get scolded.

97
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,959
Scolded.

98
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:55,489
This is your first time
visiting us, is it not?

99
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:58,258
Is it?

100
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:01,233
I am drunk often,

101
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,706
so I do not remember.

102
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:07,681
Please come by often.

103
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:11,173
I will think about it.

104
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:21,486
Did the Crown Prince
skip the meeting again?

105
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:25,343
He challenged your order
to execute the prisoner,

106
00:15:25,434 --> 00:15:27,013
and went against your order last time.

107
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:31,404
Now, he has no regard
for his role as the interim king.

108
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,670
Your Majesty, those appeals

109
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,421
are just some of the letters
from the scholars,

110
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:40,946
asking the Crown Prince to be dethroned.

111
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:45,416
I said I would not address that again.

112
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:46,843
You must, Your Majesty.

113
00:15:48,307 --> 00:15:52,641
Please do not place
this nation's welfare in jeopardy.

114
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,909
The Crown Prince
is not the person who placed

115
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,434
this nation's welfare in jeopardy.

116
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,768
You hindered everything he tried to do,

117
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,134
mentioning Baekwoon
when it was not yet certain.

118
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:10,686
You kept on gathering
the scholars to protest,

119
00:16:10,776 --> 00:16:13,816
so that everyone could know about it.

120
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:16,007
That is why I am saying this.

121
00:16:18,575 --> 00:16:19,708
Your Majesty.

122
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,876
The Crown Prince has lost all credibility.

123
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:27,174
He visits kisaeng's parlors
more often than the court.

124
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,233
It is only too obvious.

125
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,455
Please do not confuse
the matters of the state,

126
00:16:33,931 --> 00:16:35,532
and dethrone the Crown Prince.

127
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,746
It is only proper
to appoint a new crown prince.

128
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,203
Please be understanding.

129
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:47,000
Please be understanding.

130
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,808
Please be understanding.

131
00:16:51,871 --> 00:16:54,071
Please be understanding.

132
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:02,342
Please come back, Master.

133
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,025
He is so cold. He's as cold as ice.

134
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:08,149
Look here.

135
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,639
Come and talk to me.

136
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:27,136
How is the Prince? Is he well?

137
00:17:28,228 --> 00:17:29,595
Yes, of course.

138
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:32,546
He's getting healthier by the day.

139
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,462
Good. He should.

140
00:17:36,114 --> 00:17:38,243
He will be a new crown prince soon.

141
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,009
He must be healthy.

142
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,102
That is also a great virtue.

143
00:17:44,673 --> 00:17:45,806
Excuse me?

144
00:17:47,342 --> 00:17:50,011
Father, what...

145
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:52,109
What did you just say?

146
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,258
Why are you so surprised?

147
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,976
Donggungjeon will soon need a new master,

148
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,395
so you should get ready.

149
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:02,942
Do you mean it?

150
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,209
Yes.

151
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,319
It is almost finished.

152
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:09,369
Yes.

153
00:18:10,118 --> 00:18:11,452
Yes, Father.

154
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:25,976
It is about

155
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:29,592
a new-born baby
that was sneaked out of the palace.

156
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,226
What if the baby is alive and not dead?

157
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,532
Would that change things?

158
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,420
Your Highness, it is I, Eunuch Sung.

159
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,052
Enter.

160
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,076
Byeongyeon,

161
00:19:13,105 --> 00:19:14,339
I am here.

162
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:24,019
When will you...

163
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:27,871
...respond back to me?

164
00:20:13,534 --> 00:20:17,101
Is Byeongyeon okay?

165
00:20:18,996 --> 00:20:21,763
His physical wounds are almost healed.

166
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,156
He must want to rest more.

167
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,829
He's had a tough life.

168
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:36,660
He is probably preparing to see you.

169
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:46,641
Have you not heard from Raon at all?

170
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:50,004
No.

171
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:55,896
Are you disappointed?

172
00:20:57,605 --> 00:20:58,772
No.

173
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:01,810
Thanks to that,

174
00:21:02,122 --> 00:21:07,889
I am having fun playing
the "catch the tail" game.

175
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:15,243
I am closely monitoring land deeds, money,

176
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:18,568
and people coming in
and out of the Kim Family.

177
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:21,063
I see.

178
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:23,839
However,

179
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:27,574
the hunt does not end
even when you catch the tail.

180
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,982
They may cut it off and run away,

181
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,974
so be careful.

182
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:37,046
Yes, I shall remember that.

183
00:21:43,018 --> 00:21:45,051
I am almost prepared.

184
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,830
Please prepare to fill,

185
00:21:47,237 --> 00:21:50,604
the great void in the Royal Court
that is soon to come.

186
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,949
Did you look into it?

187
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:08,258
Well...

188
00:22:09,637 --> 00:22:10,804
My goodness.

189
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:16,276
Tell me the truth.

190
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:17,974
Your Highness,

191
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:22,586
I am afraid that what Kim Yunseong
said is true.

192
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:25,254
What?

193
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:33,571
Are you saying that baby is really alive?

194
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,212
Yes.

195
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:42,221
There really is a baby
that the kisaengs are raising.

196
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,214
Being dethroned
is not necessarily a bad thing.

197
00:23:06,348 --> 00:23:09,576
Many princes in the past
lived a long and happy life

198
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:12,302
after they were dethroned.

199
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:18,630
It may be better

200
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:21,067
than claiming the kingship.

201
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,073
It sounds enticing,

202
00:23:26,842 --> 00:23:30,743
but there is one thing that's stopping me.

203
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,877
It is, none other than, you.

204
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:49,846
I don't think I can leave
with you still in the court.

205
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:13,263
Grandpa.

206
00:24:17,212 --> 00:24:18,713
Were you followed?

207
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,590
No. I checked several times,

208
00:24:21,681 --> 00:24:22,881
but there was no one following me.

209
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,237
I see.

210
00:24:28,648 --> 00:24:30,282
You have been through so much.

211
00:24:33,576 --> 00:24:35,576
I heard from Mother.

212
00:24:36,926 --> 00:24:40,326
Is Byeongyeon really here?

213
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:45,785
Is he really alive?

214
00:24:47,937 --> 00:24:51,337
He's still not conscious,
but he is recovering.

215
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,528
I am glad.

216
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:58,924
I am so glad.

217
00:25:02,263 --> 00:25:03,430
Come with me.

218
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:17,994
Byeongyeon.

219
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:21,887
It's me, Samnom.

220
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:26,988
Will you still lie in bed when I am here?

221
00:25:33,082 --> 00:25:35,649
You must have been tired from suppressing

222
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:38,153
and hiding all these years.

223
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:42,504
Is that why you are resting for so long?

224
00:25:48,556 --> 00:25:51,656
Autumn will pass at this rate.

225
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:58,472
Please wake up
before all the leaves fall.

226
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:13,772
Byeongyeon.

227
00:26:15,843 --> 00:26:17,344
What is the palace like

228
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:20,483
when the first snow falls?

229
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,940
If snow collects on Jahyeondang's big yard

230
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:30,478
and on top of the lower roof,

231
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:34,835
it must be very beautiful.

232
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:38,789
It is pretty.

233
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:45,645
Very.

234
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,549
Byeongyeon!

235
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,570
Are you awake?

236
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:54,887
You annoying punk.

237
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,570
You still talk too much.

238
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,890
Byeongyeon!

239
00:27:06,431 --> 00:27:07,564
It hurts.

240
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Byeongyeon.

241
00:27:33,567 --> 00:27:38,334
Jahyeondang

242
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,520
All right.

243
00:27:57,947 --> 00:28:01,014
The richest person in heart
across the country is me.

244
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:03,831
I give you this

245
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:05,642
as a piece of affection.

246
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:16,148
Do you know what
the Crown Prince's nickname is?

247
00:28:17,203 --> 00:28:18,437
My goodness.

248
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:22,176
What is it? Pretty Prince?

249
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:23,679
Prince Dung.

250
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:28,009
See? Everyone knows about it.

251
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,940
Darn it.

252
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,810
Did you just laugh?

253
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:38,435
I thought he had a problem
with his facial expression.

254
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,287
Were you disappointed

255
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:18,293
that it was me?

256
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:20,302
No.

257
00:29:21,935 --> 00:29:23,436
I was just surprised.

258
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:28,591
To be honest,
I was struggling alone lately.

259
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:30,985
Was it because of the wedding?

260
00:29:32,342 --> 00:29:34,843
I found out who the person

261
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:38,052
that you love is.

262
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,323
I became the Crown Princess
as a transaction.

263
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,571
If I wanted more now,

264
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:53,469
it would be absurd.

265
00:29:57,067 --> 00:30:01,001
So, I plan to be true to my role.

266
00:30:04,114 --> 00:30:07,314
I cannot comfort you as she did,

267
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:10,717
but I will remain as your assistant

268
00:30:11,436 --> 00:30:13,370
to help you protect your throne.

269
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:20,255
Because I am the person
who will be with you

270
00:30:21,976 --> 00:30:23,109
until the end.

271
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:53,402
Why did you want to see me?

272
00:30:54,455 --> 00:30:55,956
Do you really not know?

273
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,060
Once the Crown Prince is dethroned,

274
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:03,300
my son will become a new crown prince.

275
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:05,667
How long will you challenge him and me?

276
00:31:07,788 --> 00:31:09,022
Your Highness.

277
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:12,406
No. Aunt.

278
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:17,837
I have been silent
after knowing the truth,

279
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,544
because of this sickening blood
that we share,

280
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,760
as much as I hate to admit it.

281
00:31:27,435 --> 00:31:30,102
I thought you would want
to see her at least once.

282
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:35,776
Your and His Majesty's child,

283
00:31:36,222 --> 00:31:38,289
whom you have abandoned
in exchange for power.

284
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:43,374
Shut it.

285
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:46,172
Confess it yourself.

286
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,513
That's the final courtesy

287
00:31:50,371 --> 00:31:51,872
I have for you.

288
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,109
Your Highness,
you cannot delay any longer.

289
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:49,236
Please head to the Royal Office.

290
00:32:50,954 --> 00:32:52,354
Wait a minute.

291
00:32:54,864 --> 00:32:56,031
Your Highness.

292
00:32:56,122 --> 00:32:59,168
Master Jung Deokho is here to see you.

293
00:33:08,285 --> 00:33:10,485
So how did it go?

294
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,040
He was caught
as he was trying to leave the city.

295
00:33:14,349 --> 00:33:16,783
We checked and confirmed
that he was the one

296
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,740
who gathered the assailants.

297
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:23,971
I am ready.

298
00:33:25,449 --> 00:33:26,449
Let us go.

299
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:34,109
He has not repented for his misbehavior,

300
00:33:34,496 --> 00:33:36,550
but rather he visits
kisaeng's parlors often

301
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,575
and even gambles.

302
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:40,902
He is not fulfilling his duties
as the Crown Prince,

303
00:33:40,992 --> 00:33:42,967
and is ruining the Royal Family image.

304
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:46,011
It must be stopped at once.

305
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,564
Your Majesty, His Highness is here.

306
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:02,135
Tell him to come in.

307
00:34:29,783 --> 00:34:30,783
Crown Prince.

308
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:34,378
Did you sneak out again last night?

309
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,041
Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,562
Where did you go?

311
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:43,842
As the Minister stated,

312
00:34:44,138 --> 00:34:47,505
I went to kisaeng's parlors
and gambling dens.

313
00:34:57,302 --> 00:35:00,136
They say a good king
lends his ear to the people.

314
00:35:01,819 --> 00:35:03,420
I cannot hear anything

315
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:04,912
from within the palace.

316
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:06,814
Thus,

317
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:11,151
I spent the night with the people
and heard stories and requests.

318
00:35:11,482 --> 00:35:12,782
Are those people

319
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,509
kisaengs and gamblers?

320
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:20,979
That is correct.

321
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:24,380
Why? Is that a problem?

322
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,518
Your Majesty.

323
00:35:27,894 --> 00:35:30,828
I cannot remain silent on this.

324
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:34,613
The scholars of all levels

325
00:35:34,704 --> 00:35:37,335
requested the Crown Prince's dethronement.

326
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:42,163
Your Majesty, I request that you dethrone

327
00:35:42,254 --> 00:35:45,688
the Crown Prince and exile him.

328
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,940
Please be understanding.

329
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:51,665
Please be understanding.

330
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,609
Please be understanding.

331
00:36:02,847 --> 00:36:04,880
I understand what you want.

332
00:36:06,021 --> 00:36:08,955
But before I leave,

333
00:36:09,738 --> 00:36:11,402
I wish to share some stories

334
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:13,867
that I heard at the parlors
and gambling dens.

335
00:36:17,182 --> 00:36:18,783
Would you like to hear them?

336
00:36:21,732 --> 00:36:25,066
- I really enjoyed it.
- Please come again, Master.

337
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,844
You look so thin.

338
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:31,963
I could not look after you
when you gave birth...

339
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,587
Be careful with your words.

340
00:36:39,911 --> 00:36:43,211
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

341
00:36:45,976 --> 00:36:47,710
Where is the baby?

342
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,784
What do you mean, Your Highness?

343
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:55,386
The baby whom the kisaengs are raising.

344
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,454
I do not understand
why you are looking for the baby...

345
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:04,068
You are not...

346
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,274
That cannot be.

347
00:37:09,251 --> 00:37:10,518
It is not true, is it?

348
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,924
Where is the baby?

349
00:37:15,917 --> 00:37:17,217
Earlier today,

350
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:22,728
someone took the baby,
saying he was from the palace.

351
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:24,945
Someone from the palace?

352
00:37:40,122 --> 00:37:42,990
Crown Prince, what are you doing?

353
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:49,925
Your Majesty, please allow me some time.

354
00:37:53,452 --> 00:37:54,619
I give you my permission.

355
00:38:00,872 --> 00:38:04,673
Look closely to see
if there is anyone familiar.

356
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:13,735
Your Highness,

357
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:17,203
why are their eyes closed?

358
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:19,008
Well...

359
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:21,751
What do you think?

360
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:29,873
It is because they all died.

361
00:38:37,931 --> 00:38:39,534
They died because of what they said.

362
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:42,442
Some of them died
even before they started talking.

363
00:38:43,546 --> 00:38:45,780
I assume the killer
thought they wouldn't be able

364
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:47,649
to talk once they are dead.

365
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:49,780
I was surprised, too,

366
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:53,352
by how much proof they left behind.

367
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,192
I looked into the assailants
who attacked Donggungjeon.

368
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:03,243
I discovered who gathered the assailants,

369
00:39:03,595 --> 00:39:06,196
paid them, and gave them the order.

370
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:12,442
We already know it was Baekwoon Group.

371
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,611
We can just ask him.

372
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:16,984
Let him in.

373
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:46,068
Is the person who asked you
to gather assailants here?

374
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:03,414
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,303
Point him out.

376
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:21,585
They are the ones.

377
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:35,027
The money and farmland
given to the assailants,

378
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:36,740
to whom did those belong?

379
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:41,104
We confirmed
those were Minister Kim Uigyo's.

380
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:44,862
These are his secret ledgers.

381
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,400
My goodness.

382
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,410
This is absurd.

383
00:40:57,683 --> 00:40:58,917
Tell the truth right now.

384
00:40:59,255 --> 00:41:02,455
Who hired them
and disguised them into Baekwoon?

385
00:41:03,398 --> 00:41:06,431
They are Ministers
Kim Uigyo and Kim Geungyo.

386
00:41:07,297 --> 00:41:09,430
I don't deserve your mercy, Your Highness!

387
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:17,767
Ministers Kim Uigyo and Kim Geungyo!

388
00:41:18,678 --> 00:41:21,235
Is what the Crown Prince said really true?

389
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:22,368
Your Majesty.

390
00:41:22,926 --> 00:41:25,143
His words are not trustworthy

391
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,068
since he heard them
from kisaengs and gamblers.

392
00:41:28,358 --> 00:41:31,276
This is a conspiracy!

393
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:32,970
Are you still denying it?

394
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:35,801
- Chief Magistrate.
- Yes, Your Highness.

395
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:39,517
Arrest the two this instant
and interrogate them.

396
00:41:39,608 --> 00:41:41,385
Find out everything they have done.

397
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:42,643
Yes, Your Highness.

398
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,602
Your Majesty, this is unfair.

399
00:41:45,868 --> 00:41:47,901
Let go of me!
How dare you treat me like this?

400
00:41:47,968 --> 00:41:50,274
Your Majesty, I have done nothing wrong.

401
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:52,866
Your Majesty, I am innocent.

402
00:41:53,732 --> 00:41:55,132
Your Majesty!

403
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,843
Let go of me! Let go!

404
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:59,523
This is unjust!

405
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,202
You said the hunt does not end
even when I catch the tail.

406
00:42:30,787 --> 00:42:33,221
What do you think
I should do to prevent him

407
00:42:34,422 --> 00:42:35,956
from cutting off his tail and run?

408
00:42:37,541 --> 00:42:41,142
It's not easy to catch
a large tiger in one try.

409
00:42:43,512 --> 00:42:46,413
Cut off his right arm first
and then his left arm.

410
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:50,412
Lastly, cut off his head.
Until you finish all this,

411
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,840
you must never let your guard down.

412
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:12,706
I have something else to show you,
Councilor Kim.

413
00:43:22,172 --> 00:43:26,239
This is a court lady who was killed
secretly not long ago.

414
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:32,565
She gave birth to a baby
right before she died.

415
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:39,652
However, I could not find her baby.

416
00:43:41,488 --> 00:43:43,322
I wonder what the story behind this is.

417
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:49,030
Are you not curious about this woman?

418
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:08,268
The baby is adorable.

419
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,801
Look at me.

420
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:16,079
It is all right.

421
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:18,468
How cute!

422
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:20,969
- Baby.
- She's so cute.

423
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:24,469
Did you see that? Smile.

424
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:26,001
Smile.

425
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,589
Earlier today,

426
00:44:29,237 --> 00:44:32,771
someone took the baby
saying he was from the palace.

427
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,404
Did you say the Crown Prince
brought this baby?

428
00:44:43,884 --> 00:44:44,951
Yes, Your Highness.

429
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:49,353
He said he has to keep her
for a while for some reason.

430
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:52,620
He asked a Donggungjeon
court lady to take care of her.

431
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:54,768
She was so cute when I first saw her,

432
00:44:54,939 --> 00:44:57,273
so I asked His Highness
to let me bring her here.

433
00:44:59,217 --> 00:45:00,284
I see.

434
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,564
Please take a look.

435
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:10,091
Is she not pretty?

436
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:34,051
Does it still hurt?

437
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:38,536
I am fine, Your Highness.

438
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:41,212
You slept for so long.

439
00:45:42,786 --> 00:45:45,287
Maybe I was too ashamed to see you.

440
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:53,569
You protected me and the maiden I love.

441
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:58,562
But above all,

442
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:02,056
thank you for coming back.

443
00:46:17,576 --> 00:46:18,576
She...

444
00:46:20,784 --> 00:46:22,518
...comes here from time to time

445
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:25,019
to attend to me.

446
00:46:32,004 --> 00:46:36,438
When I am done with everything,
I shall bring her back to my side.

447
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:42,188
I shall make her laugh and chat

448
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:43,645
by my side just as she used to.

449
00:46:44,918 --> 00:46:46,918
I shall make her happy again.

450
00:46:51,484 --> 00:46:52,918
I am almost there.

451
00:46:56,215 --> 00:46:57,215
When it is all over,

452
00:46:58,406 --> 00:46:59,406
shall the three of us

453
00:47:01,456 --> 00:47:03,424
sit around together at Jahyeondang

454
00:47:04,967 --> 00:47:05,935
and have a drink?

455
00:47:42,441 --> 00:47:44,008
Pardon?

456
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,864
I asked why we should put him
on the throne.

457
00:47:48,485 --> 00:47:49,485
After all,

458
00:47:50,194 --> 00:47:52,528
he is not the King's son.

459
00:47:57,471 --> 00:47:59,205
How could you say such nonsense?

460
00:48:01,501 --> 00:48:04,035
Do not scorn the Royal Family of Joseon.

461
00:48:05,066 --> 00:48:07,334
What else could disgrace
the Royal Family more

462
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,534
other than ruining its legitimacy?

463
00:48:11,105 --> 00:48:13,606
The baby is the King's son,

464
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:16,226
whom I gave birth to.

465
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:17,567
That is good.

466
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:21,454
You will have to keep making efforts

467
00:48:21,545 --> 00:48:23,879
to make everyone in the palace believe it,

468
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:27,458
keeping them from having a doubt.

469
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:31,265
Father.

470
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:33,865
If you fail,

471
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:37,523
you will have to pay with your life.

472
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:40,909
Councilor Kim.

473
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:46,821
Please sit down.

474
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:57,620
Do you think you will be safe?

475
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:03,489
Are you threatening me, Your Highness?

476
00:49:05,517 --> 00:49:06,684
I have no choice.

477
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:10,159
I am aware of who you are.

478
00:49:11,368 --> 00:49:14,202
You have my life in your hands.

479
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,510
You are also my savior,

480
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:20,001
who made a lowly girl like me
become the Queen.

481
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:27,734
However, you should know that your life
is in my hands for the same reason.

482
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,111
You made me the Queen

483
00:49:32,776 --> 00:49:37,776
when I did not even know my father
while growing up among kisaengs.

484
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:43,076
What else other than this

485
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:46,367
could disgrace the Royal Family more?

486
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:48,754
Shut...

487
00:49:50,241 --> 00:49:51,875
...that mouth.

488
00:49:54,238 --> 00:49:56,139
When you threaten me next time,

489
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,313
you better brace yourself.

490
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:16,338
When I was little
and did not know anything,

491
00:50:17,172 --> 00:50:19,006
I was jealous of you, Your Highness.

492
00:50:21,237 --> 00:50:23,404
I thought even though
I was from a family of power,

493
00:50:24,805 --> 00:50:26,938
I would only be one of your subjects.

494
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:30,414
I know that.

495
00:50:31,501 --> 00:50:32,501
That is why

496
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:35,832
I always wanted to have friends.

497
00:50:38,537 --> 00:50:40,537
No matter how hard we tried to be close,

498
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,420
I am...

499
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:46,233
You are the Crown Prince
whom I must serve.

500
00:50:48,056 --> 00:50:49,123
Is that why

501
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,976
we ended up like this?

502
00:50:56,446 --> 00:50:57,446
You,

503
00:50:58,298 --> 00:50:59,298
Byeongyeon,

504
00:51:00,327 --> 00:51:01,327
and I.

505
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:06,998
Why must we fight against each other?

506
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:12,162
From my grandfather

507
00:51:13,512 --> 00:51:15,512
and from my position
as the successor of my family,

508
00:51:17,062 --> 00:51:18,763
I have always wanted to run away.

509
00:51:21,968 --> 00:51:23,435
You might not believe me, though.

510
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,630
I do.

511
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:33,367
I wanted to run away many times as well

512
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,493
from my position if I could.

513
00:51:48,055 --> 00:51:51,055
I shall do what I have to do.

514
00:51:53,884 --> 00:51:55,852
Please do what you believe is right.

515
00:51:57,655 --> 00:51:58,655
However,

516
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:02,746
I am worried

517
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:05,591
I might hurt you.

518
00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:10,709
I am worried too

519
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:13,852
that I might want to protect my family.

520
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:22,091
Thus,

521
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,637
even if something happens,

522
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:29,178
there is no need to feel apologetic.

523
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:32,129
Neither of us needs to feel sorry.

524
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:38,071
We started this knowing what could happen.

525
00:53:12,634 --> 00:53:15,435
Eight Years Earlier

526
00:53:20,372 --> 00:53:21,372
Did you see him?

527
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:26,364
Yes, Master.
I took a close look at the Crown Prince.

528
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,912
Tell me what you think.

529
00:53:29,234 --> 00:53:31,759
I could feel the dignity
of the Royal Family

530
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,484
in his face.

531
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:36,510
However,

532
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:39,576
there is one thing...

533
00:53:39,877 --> 00:53:40,877
What is it?

534
00:53:41,142 --> 00:53:42,843
Do not hesitate and tell me.

535
00:53:43,633 --> 00:53:44,666
Actually,

536
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:48,373
he's destined to die young.

537
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:53,571
I also felt an uncommon energy

538
00:53:53,662 --> 00:53:55,896
from one of his friends.

539
00:53:59,238 --> 00:54:00,238
Yunseong.

540
00:54:01,123 --> 00:54:02,123
Grandfather.

541
00:54:02,765 --> 00:54:06,399
He has the face of someone

542
00:54:07,163 --> 00:54:10,230
who is destined to become a sage king.

543
00:54:11,442 --> 00:54:14,043
He was wearing a headgear
embroidered with a crane.

544
00:54:18,043 --> 00:54:21,510
If the next king
is not from the Lee Family,

545
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,377
I should put
the right person on the throne.

546
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,740
Did you want to see me, Grandfather?

547
00:55:27,038 --> 00:55:30,438
Your Highness, the Crown Princess is here.

548
00:55:32,938 --> 00:55:33,938
Escort her in.

549
00:55:56,999 --> 00:55:58,933
What brings you here at such a late hour?

550
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,040
Your Highness.

551
00:56:01,767 --> 00:56:04,900
I heard the royal physicians
make you medicinal herbs,

552
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:07,863
but you keep refusing them.

553
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,002
Please drink it.

554
00:56:48,778 --> 00:56:50,545
- Crown Princess.
- Please...

555
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:54,044
...help me fulfill my duties

556
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:56,129
as the Crown Princess.

557
00:57:19,991 --> 00:57:22,253
Wait. Do not drink it!

558
00:58:07,864 --> 00:58:08,864
Your Highness.

559
00:58:09,145 --> 00:58:11,345
Your Highness!

560
00:58:11,534 --> 00:58:13,001
Your Highness! Your Highness!

561
00:58:13,425 --> 00:58:14,867
My goodness, Your Highness.

562
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:16,418
Your Highness.

563
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:18,237
Your Highness.
