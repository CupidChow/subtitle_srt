1
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:04,980
I tried so hard to free her...

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,927
...from that wretched fate.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:12,545
I cannot leave her in the palace
for another minute.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,731
What if someone...

5
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:21,635
...finds out that Raon is
Hong Gyeongnae's daughter?

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Every time I had to dress like a boy
against my will,

7
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,500
to run away countless times and to hide,

8
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,834
I wanted to know why.

9
00:01:08,634 --> 00:01:09,801
Raon.

10
00:01:13,888 --> 00:01:16,689
Now, I understand how you felt.

11
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:26,568
You couldn't tell me because
everyone in the world knew him.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,400
You didn't want me
to live as the daughter...

13
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:36,435
...of a rebel who made thousands die.

14
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:45,268
Don't hate your father too much.

15
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,099
He wanted to give you
a better world to live in.

16
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:52,800
That's why he did it.

17
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,935
Why didn't you keep it from me forever?

18
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:04,530
No.

19
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,661
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

20
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,835
Raon,

21
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,534
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:23,133 --> 00:02:24,333
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,367
Mom.

24
00:02:39,634 --> 00:02:41,168
Let me go.

25
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:46,501
Raon.

26
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,568
I'll be back soon, so please.

27
00:02:52,701 --> 00:02:53,801
Raon.

28
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,367
No. No. You cannot.

29
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,300
He is waiting.

30
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,769
He does not know anything.

31
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,735
Jahyeondang

32
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,034
Did you wait long, Your Highness?

33
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:33,335
I was determined not to smile
when I saw you.

34
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:38,834
It is way past the appointed time.

35
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:43,335
It is. Will you punish me again?

36
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:48,934
You seem like you want it.

37
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:09,233
I will forgive you
since you came back safely.

38
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:39,834
CHAPTER 13 Tenderly Goodbye

39
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,467
But... Why is nobody else here?

40
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:55,834
Did they give you all the work?

41
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:00,001
I said I would do it all.

42
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,300
You have so much to do already.

43
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:09,501
I volunteered to take all the posts
at Donggungjeon for a few days.

44
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,401
When you were ill,

45
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,801
I could not see you for days.

46
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:28,235
They said to be wary of jealous women.

47
00:06:28,837 --> 00:06:30,571
If you want to hog me so much,

48
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:36,366
I will permit it.

49
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:40,901
Your Highness.

50
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:47,369
I have a request.

51
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,867
What is it?

52
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:57,535
May I stay within one step from you
all day today?

53
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,368
You may.

54
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:07,186
May I rest my head on your shoulder
and on your lap?

55
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:08,528
You may.

56
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,977
I will beg you to look at me only,
not the books.

57
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,077
It is my turn now.

58
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,475
Are you prepared?

59
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:34,780
Pardon?

60
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:39,371
What is it?

61
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,145
Do not make requests...

62
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,312
...since I will do anything for you.

63
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,770
Your Highness.

64
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:55,471
I can't believe assailants
broke through and attacked you.

65
00:08:55,838 --> 00:08:58,439
I am speechless.
It is beyond comprehension.

66
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,049
I ordered your removal from office,

67
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:04,670
and you are back as if nothing happened.

68
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:09,421
What if I say that is more shocking
and disturbing?

69
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,868
He is a loyal servant
who worked while you were ill.

70
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:20,267
However, disobeying his order
to leave his position

71
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,396
is an act of disloyalty.

72
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:39,358
I was ordered to leave office,
but a shocking danger befell the palace.

73
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:43,104
How could I not fulfil my duties?

74
00:09:43,586 --> 00:09:44,653
That is correct.

75
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:49,007
His Majesty acknowledged that
and reinstated him,

76
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:51,472
so please be understanding.

77
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,422
Your Highness.

78
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,673
Please be understanding.

79
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,834
Please be understanding.

80
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:13,635
When the drums echoed
and the guards gathered,

81
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:16,235
there were only
nine assailants' bodies left.

82
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:18,768
Nine.

83
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,067
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:22,901
If only we had arrested one alive,

85
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,501
we could have questioned him
and uncovered the truth.

86
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:27,667
Our apologies, Your Highness.

87
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,567
They could not have passed
the palace walls unnoticed.

88
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,435
Someone must have helped them
on the inside.

89
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:44,135
We must find the remaining rebels.

90
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:45,853
Yes, Your Highness.

91
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:13,931
Eunuch Hong.

92
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,367
It must be uncomfortable for you
with an injured hand.

93
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:29,601
The way you look at me
is more uncomfortable.

94
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,501
Pardon?

95
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
You must have been frightened that day.

96
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:41,035
I am fine.

97
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,301
I did not get hurt.

98
00:11:45,334 --> 00:11:47,084
How is the Crown Prince?

99
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:48,434
I am fine...

100
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:56,409
As you can see.

101
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't know when it started,

102
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,067
but I could not see you
simply for yourself.

103
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,368
It is probably because I am...

104
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,367
...the sole successor of the Kim Family.

105
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,669
I am sure that played a part.

106
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,153
But when I saw you...

107
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,901
...grab the sword
with your bare hand to protect me,

108
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,301
I felt sorry.

109
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,902
Perhaps, I was making it
all too complicated.

110
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,731
I owed you much from my heart.

111
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:09,467
May I think I have absolved myself
a little now?

112
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:19,235
I shall no longer wait, be considerate,

113
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,268
or make requests.

114
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:27,867
I will not stop you.

115
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,002
You must do all that you can...

116
00:13:33,868 --> 00:13:35,335
...before you can give up.

117
00:13:55,236 --> 00:13:57,470
Your Highness, listen carefully.

118
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,402
The books that require drying are here.

119
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,167
The ones with scratch papers are here.

120
00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:07,455
And the books that need transcribing
are here.

121
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,347
Must I know that now?

122
00:14:13,378 --> 00:14:15,979
And you did not have to do it
all at once.

123
00:14:16,434 --> 00:14:18,068
You should not have bothered.

124
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:26,768
Whether I do it all at once or over time,

125
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,267
it is something I have to do anyway.

126
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:41,201
Your Highness.

127
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,067
Shall I write down the stories I tell you...

128
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:47,360
...whenever you cannot sleep?

129
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,450
There is no need.

130
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:58,701
I can just call you
when I want to hear them.

131
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:03,581
You are correct.

132
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:19,467
Raon.

133
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:40,467
Your Highness.

134
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,868
I wish to stay like this for a little while.

135
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,101
You may stay like this...

136
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:02,006
...for a long time.

137
00:16:59,534 --> 00:17:02,901
I hear the Crown Prince
is holding meetings again.

138
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:05,080
Yes, my lady.

139
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:10,188
Eunuch Hong,

140
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:17,947
His Highness did not accept
my feelings for him.

141
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,984
So I decided not to reveal my feelings...

142
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,379
...in order to stay by his side.

143
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:33,555
In order to stay by his side,
you will hide the truth?

144
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:39,934
That way, I may not be loved,

145
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,447
but I can be a person of help.

146
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,788
Will it not be painful?

147
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,667
I think it will be very painful.

148
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:59,135
But maybe a day will come...

149
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:01,635
...when he accepts my feelings for him.

150
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,434
I am pathetic.

151
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:17,800
No, my lady.

152
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,168
Please take good care of him.

153
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:28,402
Someone like you is perfect for him.

154
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,433
I feel like you're my friend now.

155
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,763
May I call you here
for a chat when I get upset?

156
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,831
I should go.

157
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:55,683
I stood here for too long,

158
00:18:55,774 --> 00:18:57,710
hoping to catch
a glimpse of His Highness,

159
00:18:57,801 --> 00:18:59,402
and my legs are sore now.

160
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,228
Excuse me, my lady.

161
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,310
Where did you go without...

162
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:53,722
What brings you here?

163
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:56,187
My apologies.

164
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:58,402
I had to tell you something,

165
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:00,989
so I used my friendship with someone.

166
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:06,856
How is your wound, Your Highness?

167
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:08,879
It is fine.

168
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:10,748
It is much better.

169
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:19,991
You told me
that there is a woman you like.

170
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:24,248
I thought a lot about it.

171
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:31,335
Are you refusing to get married
because although you like her,

172
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:34,468
she's someone you cannot marry?

173
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,934
What do you wish to say?

174
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:45,215
I will be your nest.

175
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,701
You cannot push off the marriage forever.

176
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,635
If you cannot avoid it,

177
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:57,233
how about placing someone
who can help you...

178
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:00,068
...and His Majesty in that place?

179
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,133
Are you saying that person is you?

180
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:08,334
Yes.

181
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,767
Please use me and my family
so you can take wings,

182
00:21:15,744 --> 00:21:18,011
and accomplish your worthy goals.

183
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,202
What's the matter?

184
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,668
Why do you look at me like that?

185
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:38,556
You seem angry.

186
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:47,868
I am angry at myself
for always being one step behind.

187
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,233
However,

188
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,267
I cannot be late this time.

189
00:21:58,033 --> 00:22:01,267
Not for my sake, but for your sake.

190
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,967
I do not understand...

191
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:08,634
You must leave this place.

192
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,114
You must leave His Highness as well.

193
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:27,401
I cannot give you my heart.

194
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:38,735
I am not pathetic enough to beg for love...

195
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:41,234
...from a man in love with another woman.

196
00:22:44,601 --> 00:22:48,734
Then why do you wish to become my wife,

197
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,300
knowing you will be treated coldly?

198
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:59,234
It is for my family's future.

199
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:02,201
Your family may prosper,

200
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,034
but you will be terribly lonely.

201
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:08,767
I do not care...

202
00:23:09,868 --> 00:23:11,535
...since it is merely a transaction...

203
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,401
...for mutual gain.

204
00:23:27,234 --> 00:23:29,001
I am not asking you to come to me.

205
00:23:29,634 --> 00:23:33,901
I simply want to help you be safe
as soon as possible.

206
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:40,701
I will leave.

207
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:47,035
So please pretend you don't know a thing.

208
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,435
The more you know about me,

209
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:53,601
the more dangerous it will be for you.

210
00:23:56,546 --> 00:23:57,679
Eunuch Hong,

211
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:02,268
what do you mean?

212
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:04,901
Do you...

213
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:09,135
I just asked you to pretend not to know.

214
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:14,267
That is not as easy as it sounds.

215
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,268
I shall go now, My Lord.

216
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,533
This is bad.

217
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:46,500
The man who escaped
from Donggungjeon was captured,

218
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,535
and is being transported
to the Department of Justice.

219
00:24:51,567 --> 00:24:54,268
If he tells the truth
during interrogation...

220
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:57,135
What are you talking about?

221
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:03,701
I just asked what you are talking about.

222
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:08,467
Master.

223
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,434
We sent ten assailants
to Donggungjeon that night,

224
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:15,734
but only nine bodies were found.

225
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:21,702
Are you saying that
the one who fled was captured,

226
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:23,401
and is being brought
to the Department of Justice?

227
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,201
Yes, that is correct.

228
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,134
Was it not Baekwoon?

229
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,168
No, Your Highness.

230
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:43,068
They appear wearing white masks
and leave letters behind,

231
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,367
or write messages on the walls.

232
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,067
I know that.

233
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:50,834
Yes, I see.

234
00:25:51,868 --> 00:25:55,035
They do not wear masks
to hide their identities,

235
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,034
but rather to spread awareness
of their group.

236
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:02,268
Spread awareness.

237
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,376
Thus, they always leave evidence...

238
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:09,467
...of their objective
at the site of the attack.

239
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:10,934
How?

240
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:12,335
Like this.

241
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:15,268
Baekwoon

242
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:19,147
Was there any evidence in Donggungjeon?

243
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,928
No evidence was found,

244
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:26,267
other than the fact
that they tried to harm you.

245
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,835
Your Highness, it is Byeongyeon.

246
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,568
You must come right away.

247
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,905
Why did you break into Donggungjeon,

248
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:20,734
and try to harm the Crown Prince?

249
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:23,667
Please spare me.

250
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:27,368
I only did as I was told.

251
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:30,901
Who ordered you to do it?

252
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,834
Continue with the torture.

253
00:27:51,534 --> 00:27:52,667
Stop.

254
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,268
Stop the torture,

255
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,302
and question him again.

256
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,067
Stop.

257
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,788
I ask again.

258
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:31,613
Who hired you to harm the Crown Prince?

259
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:42,235
Can you say that
in front of the Crown Prince?

260
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,434
Can I trust you?

261
00:28:46,701 --> 00:28:48,435
If I do as you say...

262
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,333
Yes.

263
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:57,502
That is the only way
you can save your life,

264
00:28:57,767 --> 00:28:59,401
as well as your family's.

265
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,400
Baekwoon...

266
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,600
Did someone open the gate,

267
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:36,434
and let you in that night?

268
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,534
Yes.

269
00:29:48,234 --> 00:29:49,234
Tell me.

270
00:29:52,567 --> 00:29:53,767
There is...

271
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,867
...a member of the Baekwoon Group
in the palace.

272
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:01,734
What?

273
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,834
Hong Gyeongnae died,

274
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:15,135
but his daughter
who has his blood and ideals

275
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,535
is in the palace,

276
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,767
and is preparing a rebellion.

277
00:30:31,334 --> 00:30:32,268
Who is that?

278
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:35,135
She is...

279
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,140
She is...

280
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,133
Councilor Kim!

281
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:18,769
He admitted to committing treason.

282
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:22,802
Even though he is guilty of treason,

283
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:26,968
you have no right to kill people
without the King's permission!

284
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,001
His Majesty and Your Highness...

285
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:32,301
...keep hesitating, so I had no choice
but to step in.

286
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:49,601
You killed a man in front of me,
the Crown Prince.

287
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,601
Do you not know that is also treason?

288
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:58,101
If my act endangered the nation,

289
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,101
please slit my throat
with your sword right now.

290
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:11,368
Your Highness, please refrain yourself.

291
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:14,502
Your Highness, please refrain yourself.

292
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:20,001
If there is a group that endangers
the nation or incites the people,

293
00:32:20,801 --> 00:32:23,035
you must punish them swiftly.

294
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:28,811
That is why I cannot withdraw
my sword right now.

295
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:36,102
Your Highness, please refrain yourself.

296
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:47,272
Your Highness.

297
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:48,834
Let go.

298
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:41,335
Office of Eunuch Attendants

299
00:33:51,226 --> 00:33:52,094
Have you heard?

300
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:53,968
About what?

301
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,101
The assailant who attacked
Donggungjeon confessed,

302
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,968
and he said Hong Gyeongnae's child
was behind it.

303
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:05,129
Did something happen in Donggungjeon?

304
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:08,849
Stop the nonsense and eat.

305
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:19,668
That flyer incident happened
for a reason.

306
00:34:23,222 --> 00:34:24,322
There is also this rumor...

307
00:34:26,566 --> 00:34:28,936
...that Hong Gyeongnae's daughter
is in the palace,

308
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,477
and she opened the palace gate for them.

309
00:34:33,227 --> 00:34:34,067
Enough!

310
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,401
Stop that nonsense!

311
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:37,921
We will eat.

312
00:34:42,354 --> 00:34:44,288
- Is that true?
- It is true.

313
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:23,072
This is me.

314
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:30,935
"To my love, who is and is not there."

315
00:35:32,453 --> 00:35:33,853
"Jung Deokho".

316
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:36,567
Deokho. Jung Deokho.

317
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:42,334
Jung Doryung?

318
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,901
Yes, that is correct.

319
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:58,701
Is it you again?

320
00:35:59,501 --> 00:36:00,935
I am Jung Deokho.

321
00:36:02,695 --> 00:36:03,695
Me.

322
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Jung Doryung?

323
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,535
Yes, Your Highness.

324
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:19,734
Was not Wolhee the one you loved?

325
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:23,901
What... What...

326
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,168
What do you mean?

327
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:28,635
This is insane.

328
00:36:28,701 --> 00:36:30,235
I... I...

329
00:36:30,634 --> 00:36:31,734
I...

330
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:34,735
I... I love...

331
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,767
How dare you touch me?

332
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:39,868
That is not it. The person I love...
She is...

333
00:36:40,267 --> 00:36:42,567
- Enough!
- I...

334
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:44,501
It is...

335
00:36:44,634 --> 00:36:45,634
Hey!

336
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:54,501
It is you. You.

337
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,467
The person I love.

338
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,294
We found the man
who met Choolsung before he died.

339
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:32,467
If we meet him,

340
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,768
we will be able to find out...

341
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:36,481
...what information he had that day.

342
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,667
Hong Raon.

343
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:45,801
That bold wench is living in the palace.

344
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,334
Yunseong.

345
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:02,702
Yes.

346
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,068
What did you say, Grandfather?

347
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:12,333
I said, visit the Queen
before she gives birth.

348
00:38:13,934 --> 00:38:14,934
Yes, Grandfather.

349
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,703
What happened?

350
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:35,832
She just gave birth and it is a boy.

351
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:45,568
Gag him if you must,

352
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,968
but do not let his cries be heard.

353
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,367
Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:39,033
Good.

355
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,133
Kick all you want.

356
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:46,535
Resent and hate as much as you want.

357
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,034
Oh my goodness.

358
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:59,468
Your... Your Highness.

359
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,477
The Section Chief of Culture
and Education is here.

360
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:18,032
Welcome.

361
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,667
Are you all right, Your Highness?

362
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:24,567
I am fine.

363
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:31,235
What brings you to Junggungjeon?

364
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:37,601
Grandfather scolded me
to visit you before you give birth.

365
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,166
Councilor Kim.

366
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:56,001
Is it true that you cut off
the culprit's head...

367
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:58,567
...during the Crown Prince's interrogation
a few days ago?

368
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:00,935
Yes, Your Majesty.

369
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:05,500
It is unusual for you
to act so recklessly!

370
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:07,967
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

371
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:09,634
However,

372
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,334
I was too busy to see
if what he said was true...

373
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:15,002
...that I couldn't tell you sooner.

374
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:21,135
Are you saying you found out
something about the spy?

375
00:41:21,834 --> 00:41:22,735
Yes, Your Majesty.

376
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,501
What the culprit said turned out
to be true.

377
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:31,601
I also found out the name of the spy.

378
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,101
Hong Raon

379
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,867
Hong Raon?

380
00:41:47,801 --> 00:41:51,402
Is she Hong Gyeongnae's daughter?

381
00:41:52,234 --> 00:41:53,267
Yes, Your Majesty.

382
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,502
All we have to do now is to find her.

383
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:18,032
They are well aware
of how influential the name,

384
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,400
Hong Gyeongnae, is,

385
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:24,201
even though he no longer exists.

386
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,200
Then...

387
00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:29,301
...what are you planning to do
with Hong Raon?

388
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,334
I shall protect her
in the name of the Baekwoon Group.

389
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:38,535
It is too late for her to decide.

390
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:42,243
Are you saying you will kidnap her?

391
00:42:42,334 --> 00:42:43,174
We cannot...

392
00:42:44,265 --> 00:42:46,634
...expose her to danger any longer.

393
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:51,500
Tomorrow,

394
00:42:52,801 --> 00:42:55,068
we will take her out to our headquarters,

395
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,701
without anyone noticing us.

396
00:43:05,434 --> 00:43:09,201
A massive search will begin
from tomorrow morning.

397
00:43:09,934 --> 00:43:14,067
Baekwoon Group must have placed
more than one spy in the palace.

398
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:17,134
As we dig, we'll be able
to find those spies.

399
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:22,601
Then there will be
a bloodbath in the palace.

400
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:27,201
We must find and have Hong Raon first.

401
00:43:28,033 --> 00:43:29,333
If we have her,

402
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,101
she will be a very useful card
in the future.

403
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:38,101
Of course, that goes without saying.

404
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,901
Were you waiting for me?

405
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,367
I have a favor to ask.

406
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:18,901
From me?

407
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,447
- What is...
- It is about her.

408
00:44:24,821 --> 00:44:27,588
Did you say it is about Eunuch Hong?

409
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:29,568
Last time,

410
00:44:30,341 --> 00:44:34,374
you went against Councilor Kim
to save her.

411
00:44:41,501 --> 00:44:43,268
Please take her out of the palace.

412
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:50,601
Take her to somewhere no one can find.

413
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:53,600
Can you do that?

414
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:15,873
How can I fall asleep...

415
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:18,929
...when you are sitting there?

416
00:45:21,667 --> 00:45:24,501
You already look very sleepy,
Your Highness.

417
00:45:27,434 --> 00:45:30,834
I told you. You do not need
to stay up all night.

418
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:36,201
It is because I want to see your face
all night long.

419
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,268
You can see me all day long tomorrow.

420
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:56,600
You see, there are moments
when ordinary things...

421
00:45:57,734 --> 00:46:02,201
...and daily chores
suddenly feel very precious.

422
00:46:06,467 --> 00:46:08,600
You feel that way when you think...

423
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:11,092
...it is the last time.

424
00:46:13,012 --> 00:46:14,112
Pardon?

425
00:46:18,988 --> 00:46:21,755
Yes, Your Highness. That is right.

426
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:29,869
You suddenly feel...

427
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:34,368
...the ordinary things
and tedious daily chores,

428
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:38,101
to be very special.

429
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:42,801
Once you think it is the last time.

430
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,400
All right.

431
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:53,767
I understand.

432
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:01,567
Come closer and see my face.

433
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:56,233
Your Highness.

434
00:48:00,434 --> 00:48:06,701
If I had been born into a noble family...

435
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,333
...and had come to you,

436
00:48:13,701 --> 00:48:15,834
would you have loved me?

437
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,094
There is no need to ask.

438
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:26,418
Then, Your Highness.

439
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,901
Do you think we were still meant
to meet each other...

440
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:36,002
...even if I didn't go to Mount Mongmyeok,

441
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:40,977
pretending to be a nobleman?

442
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:44,534
What do you think?

443
00:48:47,234 --> 00:48:50,301
There is no doubt about it, either.

444
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:10,502
I already told you...

445
00:49:12,801 --> 00:49:15,769
We are meant to meet each other,

446
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:19,335
one way or another even when we're apart.

447
00:49:38,734 --> 00:49:39,734
Then...

448
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:44,534
Your Highness, would you...

449
00:49:45,758 --> 00:49:49,456
...not regret that you met me,

450
00:49:52,164 --> 00:49:53,522
even after you find out...

451
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:57,068
...that I'm a traitor's daughter?

452
00:50:00,634 --> 00:50:04,034
Would you miss...

453
00:50:06,434 --> 00:50:11,668
...this moment at least once?

454
00:52:35,267 --> 00:52:42,235
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

455
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:01,067
Raon.

456
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:10,167
Raon.

457
00:53:16,734 --> 00:53:17,734
Eunuch Hong.

458
00:53:21,968 --> 00:53:23,435
Is anyone out there?

459
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:25,635
Yes, Your Highness.

460
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:33,200
Are you awake already, Your Highness?

461
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,363
Where is Eunuch Hong?

462
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,300
Eunuch Hong...

463
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:41,135
I have not seen him this morning,
Your Highness.

464
00:54:09,834 --> 00:54:11,934
Good morning, Your Highness.

465
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:16,335
Why is it so chaotic in the palace?

466
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:19,701
Have you not heard of the King's order,
Your Highness?

467
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:21,501
The King's order?

468
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:24,102
Tell me what it is.

469
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,367
We are searching the rebels
in the palace.

470
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:32,597
You heard that Hong Gyeongnae's
daughter is in the palace...

471
00:54:32,801 --> 00:54:34,568
...as a spy for the Baekwoon Group,
Your Highness.

472
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:39,635
We finally found information
regarding her.

473
00:54:40,092 --> 00:54:41,092
Is that true?

474
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,233
So you are searching
the young palace attendants first?

475
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:46,868
Yes, Your Highness.

476
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:51,335
I see. You may go now.

477
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,501
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:54:57,601 --> 00:54:58,601
Wait.

479
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:02,501
What about the information?

480
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:07,111
Did you find out what she looks like?

481
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,034
No, Your Highness.

482
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,101
She is about 18 years old,

483
00:55:12,419 --> 00:55:14,233
and she lived in Pyongan Province,

484
00:55:14,367 --> 00:55:15,968
before she lost her mother
during the riot.

485
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,469
Her name is Hong Raon.

486
00:55:26,033 --> 00:55:29,867
So we summoned all female
palace attendants aged 18...

487
00:55:39,834 --> 00:55:40,834
What did you...

488
00:55:41,901 --> 00:55:42,968
...just say?

489
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:51,001
We summoned
all female palace attendants...

490
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:53,067
...aged 18 for the investigation.

491
00:55:53,133 --> 00:55:54,133
No.

492
00:55:55,601 --> 00:55:56,701
What did you say her name is?

493
00:56:01,834 --> 00:56:03,867
Hong Raon, Your Highness.

494
00:56:08,868 --> 00:56:13,135
The spy used to be called Hong Raon
when she was a child.

495
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,034
She must have changed her name, though.

496
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:25,634
Good day, Your Highness.

497
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:16,301
What should I call you as a lady?

498
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:21,401
It is Hong Raon, Your Highness.

499
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:24,277
Raon.
