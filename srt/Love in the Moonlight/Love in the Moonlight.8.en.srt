1
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:21,621
I wanted to hide my feelings
from everyone,

2
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:27,784
because I thought it was the only way
to make you stay with me.

3
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,334
Is it wrong to profess
to someone you cannot be with?

4
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:39,640
A proper farewell is as sincere as love.

5
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:43,129
Who knows if the memory of being loved,

6
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,314
could give you strength
to go on with the rest of your life?

7
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,664
That eunuch's attire
does not suit you, either.

8
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:11,295
Do you not wish to live as a woman?

9
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,386
Your words gave me courage...

10
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,417
...to profess my feelings,

11
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,759
which may put me in danger,
or force me to lose you.

12
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,656
Do not say my feelings are wrong.

13
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,128
You said so yourself.

14
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,765
You said you cannot do anything...

15
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,868
...about where your heart may go.

16
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,504
Sorry?

17
00:04:00,507 --> 00:04:01,808
I will do it.

18
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,545
That bad love.

19
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:32,165
CHAPTER 8 You Do Not Know Anything

20
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:45,745
Did something happen?

21
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,751
Byeongyeon, please watch what you say.

22
00:05:53,392 --> 00:05:54,258
Me?

23
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,018
Asking that when nothing happened...

24
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,562
That is rude.

25
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:02,907
It is?

26
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:04,725
I apologize.

27
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:07,767
Byeongyeon.

28
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,359
May I ask you something?

29
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:14,923
What is it?

30
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:17,559
From what I know,

31
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:22,097
you are the person
the Crown Prince cherishes the most,

32
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:24,799
and then Eunuch Jang.

33
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:33,675
Has he ever had affections for a maiden?

34
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,880
Ever? All this time?

35
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,349
No, he has not. Not once.

36
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,222
He has not.

37
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,491
He has not.

38
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:57,399
I plan to let you leave the palace.

39
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,735
I shall delete all your records here.

40
00:07:01,303 --> 00:07:02,604
Will you leave and live together?

41
00:07:05,006 --> 00:07:06,007
Yes, Your Highness.

42
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,414
If you go here,
he will find you a home and work.

43
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:16,484
Oh my. How could you...

44
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:24,893
Thank you for teaching me
that true love can make miracles.

45
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:30,599
Live a long and happy life together.

46
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:34,088
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

47
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,711
Master Ma.

48
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,581
You must be happy together, okay?

49
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:50,018
You are the 30th couple I put together.

50
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,392
Don't just worry about
putting others together,

51
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,396
and look around you.

52
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,408
Not one person, but two.

53
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:58,590
Do you not see?

54
00:08:08,737 --> 00:08:11,540
It is the list of those who passed,

55
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:12,998
and test writers over the past 10 years.

56
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,746
Test writers are from the Kim family.

57
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,881
Those who passed are from the Kim Family.

58
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,984
They are all Kim.

59
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:27,188
How interesting.

60
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,099
These are the questions
and answers for the exam.

61
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:46,381
I can't believe these dull answers
were passed.

62
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:51,813
But then again,
it did not matter what they wrote.

63
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:56,595
The applicants are chosen
by family name anyway.

64
00:08:58,586 --> 00:08:59,621
What do you think?

65
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,922
Do you want my thoughts
as someone from the Kim Family,

66
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:05,093
or as the Section Chief
of Culture and Education?

67
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:09,230
You mean your reply changes accordingly.

68
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,033
As a member of the Kim Family,
I'd appreciate the reproach.

69
00:09:13,668 --> 00:09:16,537
As an official,
I'd use it to correct anything wrong.

70
00:09:17,772 --> 00:09:18,806
Do you mean it?

71
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:22,810
If I say I do, would you believe me?

72
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:28,549
Councilor Kim would have a fit
if he heard.

73
00:09:29,884 --> 00:09:32,220
I will take a look. You are excused.

74
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:06,326
Eunuch Hong.

75
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:09,954
Would you make some time for me?

76
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:11,276
Sorry?

77
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,396
- I was...
- Samnom, come here.

78
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:20,230
Yes, Your Highness.

79
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:26,220
Thank you, My Lord.

80
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:48,686
You are correct.

81
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:53,802
A eunuch is not befitting for me.

82
00:10:56,994 --> 00:10:59,863
I should leave the palace
as soon as possible, but...

83
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:03,451
But?

84
00:11:06,892 --> 00:11:07,893
I...

85
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,615
I do not want to leave.

86
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,495
It is strange, is it not?

87
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:24,166
I thought it over and over,
but it is the same.

88
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:31,240
I want to stay here a little longer.

89
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,347
Forgive me, My Lord.

90
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,318
I wonder...

91
00:11:46,488 --> 00:11:52,461
...what has captured your heart
so much so that you'd take that risk.

92
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:11,613
Are you saying you'll go to a temple
in a mountain to lose weight?

93
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:13,549
That is right.

94
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:17,986
If I only eat what the monk gives me
for two weeks,

95
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:21,557
my face will shrink in half.

96
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,460
Who told you that?

97
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,129
Can you trust them?

98
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,264
The Love Story of Joseon
That We Don't Know of

99
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,234
He wrote this book.

100
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:35,804
There is nothing
he does not know about relationships.

101
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:40,142
This book!

102
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:45,314
May I borrow it for a while?

103
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:55,657
What is it about?

104
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,762
There is a rumor that
Hong Gyeongnae's daughter is alive.

105
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:03,732
Have you heard?

106
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:06,702
No, I have not.

107
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:08,904
With one word from Councilor Kim,

108
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,940
my father's anxiety has worsened.

109
00:13:20,282 --> 00:13:23,619
This mask is the same mask
I saw at his feast.

110
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:24,787
Do you remember?

111
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,357
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,125
You need to look into it.

113
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:33,962
Who are they?

114
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:36,265
Are they searching
for Hong Gyeongnae's daughter?

115
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:37,666
If so, why?

116
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,971
Yes, Your Highness.

117
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:44,573
If it is true,

118
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:50,379
we must find them before Councilor Kim.

119
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:18,507
It is heavy. Give it to me.

120
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,675
I cannot.

121
00:14:21,343 --> 00:14:22,711
This is my job, Your Highness.

122
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,481
Many eyes are watching us.

123
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:35,057
Then put it away.
I am fine getting some sunlight.

124
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,293
Your Highness.

125
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,497
The sun is bright.
Please go under the parasol.

126
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:45,567
I am fine.

127
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,671
If this is heavy, I am no man.

128
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:57,118
Hoonnam.

129
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:58,881
Yes, Your Highness.

130
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:02,918
The breeze is nice,
so I'll take a nap. Don't wake me.

131
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,520
Yes, Your Highness.

132
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,290
And you. Hold this properly.

133
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:10,092
Do you understand?

134
00:15:37,219 --> 00:15:41,156
Why is this tiny hand so rough?

135
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:45,294
That is how a man's hands are.

136
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,097
That is right.

137
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,100
Your eyes, nose and lips

138
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,169
are clearly those of a man.

139
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,305
Such masculinity!

140
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,775
That is what I fell for.

141
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:02,411
Pardon me?

142
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,385
I fear someone may hear.

143
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,455
Please take back everything you said.

144
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:16,225
You don't take words back
once they're spoken.

145
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:20,529
You take responsibility for them.

146
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,053
Rest.

147
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:46,689
I shall read slowly.

148
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,363
Your Highness.

149
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,633
You are so kind to me,

150
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,135
but I cannot be happy.

151
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:09,578
Do not think you know everything about me.

152
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,550
I never said I do.

153
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,819
I only said, "Rest."

154
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:35,404
Your Highness, do not be so good to me.

155
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:40,075
I keep wanting to lean on you.
This will not do.

156
00:17:47,883 --> 00:17:48,884
Eunuch Hong.

157
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,888
She is the Princess' friend.

158
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,562
Are you Eunuch Hong?

159
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,698
Yes, I am.

160
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,905
To recap, he is classy and handsome.

161
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:14,710
He is cold and is not interested
in beautiful women such as yourself.

162
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:21,717
I tried many times to draw his attention,

163
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:23,485
but it was to no avail.

164
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,387
What did you do?

165
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:27,456
When I fell because of him,

166
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,459
I reached out my hand
and asked him to help me up.

167
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,393
Aigoo... Really!

168
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,365
You should have slapped him
and acted even more disinterested.

169
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,006
Is that right?

170
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:44,606
But I cannot keep from smiling
when I see him.

171
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,943
That is not all.
I asked him to go for a walk,

172
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,413
but he rejected me straight out.

173
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,885
Did you really do that?

174
00:18:58,253 --> 00:19:00,189
I had no shame.

175
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,497
Why are you looking at me like that?

176
00:19:09,598 --> 00:19:12,267
Is there no way you can help me?

177
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,207
No. I do not think I need to help you.

178
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,912
What use is it to know
the secrets to relationships?

179
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:27,583
You just relay your feelings as they are.

180
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,784
I envy you.

181
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:32,688
- Me?
- Yes.

182
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:36,592
I am sure you will end up with him.

183
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:38,994
You see, sincerity is very powerful.

184
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,344
Your Highness.

185
00:19:56,011 --> 00:20:00,015
Becoming an interim king
before the age of 20

186
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,818
may be difficult and shake you up.

187
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:06,021
However, please be steadfast

188
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,024
and do not be lazy
in overseeing state affairs.

189
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:12,528
Please continue to study and learn.

190
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,763
Then whatever trials -Hoonnam.

191
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,566
May not be... Yes, Your Highness.

192
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,969
Stop making it so difficult.

193
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:23,205
"Be strong!" That is all you need to say.

194
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,041
Yes, Your Highness.

195
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:28,377
Your Highness,

196
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,213
please be strong!

197
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,616
Thank you.

198
00:20:37,353 --> 00:20:38,193
What about you?

199
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,491
Do you not have anything to say to me?

200
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:48,197
I do not.

201
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,406
Because I know you will do great.

202
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:31,073
The Crown Prince has arrived!

203
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,949
The Crown Prince must be shocked

204
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,617
to see the empty hall.

205
00:22:15,818 --> 00:22:18,687
He must have walked in confidently by now.

206
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,156
What a shame.

207
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:25,928
He shouldn't have canceled
the regular examination,

208
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,631
replacing it with the special test
written by the King.

209
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:31,000
He might have realized

210
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:33,102
that the successful applicants
were chosen beforehand.

211
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:40,109
He is proposing he will stop
the Kim Family's success.

212
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,346
It's the exam to select
those who will assist the King.

213
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:47,049
Let him do as he wishes...

214
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,121
Until he gives up on his own.

215
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:58,193
What can he do alone without the court?

216
00:22:59,361 --> 00:23:01,597
We have been running
the royal court until now.

217
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:04,066
We should teach him a lesson.

218
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,735
Do you not agree?

219
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:22,384
The Minister of Finance
fell ill and cannot participate.

220
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,228
Supreme Commissioner Kim Soohyung
has a high fever.

221
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:43,739
My goodness.
Someone even has a skin rash.

222
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,408
How despicable.

223
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,581
Your Highness,
shall I send men to bring them here?

224
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,653
Did you not hear it right?

225
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:01,323
Everyone is very ill.

226
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:20,702
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

227
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,786
I know you wish to see me to no end,

228
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:34,690
but do not make it so obvious.

229
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,158
Sorry?

230
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:41,096
You look down, Your Highness.

231
00:24:56,345 --> 00:24:57,780
Please have some of these, Your Highness.

232
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:03,419
Sweets are the best when you are down.

233
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,117
What would you do?

234
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:20,261
About what?

235
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,373
If you faced a difficult foe,

236
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,212
what would you do?

237
00:25:29,384 --> 00:25:30,852
If it is someone I must fight,

238
00:25:31,723 --> 00:25:33,591
I must fight with all my might.

239
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:38,627
If that still does not work,

240
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:41,630
I should go with the flow.

241
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,147
I will excuse myself then.

242
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:21,783
Your... Your Highness.

243
00:26:27,209 --> 00:26:29,144
It really is a very effective medicine.

244
00:26:34,783 --> 00:26:36,718
You did not have any yet.

245
00:26:38,453 --> 00:26:39,454
I meant you.

246
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:52,568
Tell the royal physician
and pharmacist to come in.

247
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,904
Sorry? But...

248
00:26:56,638 --> 00:26:57,639
But...

249
00:27:02,511 --> 00:27:05,814
We found someone
who was close to Hong Gyeongnae.

250
00:27:06,648 --> 00:27:10,953
We will find out whether he knows
about his family's whereabouts.

251
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,921
Find out quickly.

252
00:27:13,255 --> 00:27:14,923
It has to be before those thieves.

253
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:16,397
Yes, My Lord.

254
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:21,597
He died ten years ago,

255
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:24,433
yet they still wait for his return.

256
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:28,303
Hong Gyeongnae must have been incredible.

257
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:29,938
I suppose you're right.

258
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:35,611
Everyone is making such a fuss
to search for his daughter.

259
00:27:36,812 --> 00:27:38,780
- Let me see.
- That is...

260
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:40,749
What is that?

261
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:51,193
Kim Uigyo.

262
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:54,196
Kim Geungyo.

263
00:28:01,336 --> 00:28:02,404
What is this?

264
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:05,474
The Crown Prince is here.

265
00:28:13,415 --> 00:28:16,952
I was concerned
how I would deliver all the medicine,

266
00:28:17,719 --> 00:28:23,492
but luckily you are all gathered.
What a relief!

267
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:30,938
Here.

268
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,776
I heard you have indigestion,

269
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,007
so I had the pharmacist
prepare medicine for it.

270
00:28:41,443 --> 00:28:43,445
I hope they will be effective.

271
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:46,582
Do you not agree?

272
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:50,992
Your Highness.

273
00:28:58,627 --> 00:28:59,862
Please come inside.

274
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:15,210
I thought she was a widow at first,
since she lived alone with her daughter.

275
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:21,717
But every once in a while,
I heard them arguing.

276
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,686
Sometimes a man would come

277
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:27,089
and leave rice in front of the door, too.

278
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,958
So I thought he was the father,

279
00:29:32,394 --> 00:29:35,564
but it turned out he was Hong Gyeongnae.

280
00:29:36,064 --> 00:29:38,066
Have you heard anything since the riot?

281
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,736
I am sure they died.

282
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:45,707
The royal guards searched
the entire nation to find them.

283
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:47,676
They would not have let them live.

284
00:29:48,977 --> 00:29:51,813
Do you remember
anything else about the girl?

285
00:29:53,448 --> 00:29:55,417
No, I do not.

286
00:30:00,923 --> 00:30:02,991
She was just a baby.

287
00:30:04,693 --> 00:30:06,962
She had big and round eyes.

288
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:08,530
She was pretty.

289
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,133
What was her name?

290
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:13,068
What was it?

291
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,104
Ra... Ra something.

292
00:30:19,942 --> 00:30:20,943
Raon!

293
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,078
Raon.

294
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:26,381
Hong Raon.

295
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:32,020
I am sure this place is well-located.

296
00:30:33,622 --> 00:30:37,960
The officials who were too ill to work
recovered so quickly after being here.

297
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:44,399
How about we move
the court assembly to your house?

298
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:45,801
What do you think?

299
00:30:46,635 --> 00:30:49,471
You must know that officials
gathered separately to discuss

300
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:54,643
out of their devotion
to you and the nation.

301
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:02,718
Joseon has lasted for 400 years
thanks to its courtiers.

302
00:31:03,886 --> 00:31:06,188
However, you wish to ignore this

303
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:09,303
and walk your own way.

304
00:31:09,394 --> 00:31:14,730
It is the officials' responsibility
to ensure that you take the right path.

305
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:22,710
But I think your right path and mine
seem to head in different directions.

306
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:30,084
If a red flower blooms in a green field,

307
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:35,223
it is human nature
to want to pick that flower.

308
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:39,160
You will get hurt if you stand out.

309
00:31:40,562 --> 00:31:41,629
Is that what you mean?

310
00:31:42,564 --> 00:31:48,169
But if you try to pick that flower,
the grass in its vicinity,

311
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:51,206
is to be trampled on first.

312
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,314
You must remember,

313
00:31:56,953 --> 00:32:01,461
how much His Majesty regretted
losing the Queen seven years ago.

314
00:32:04,045 --> 00:32:08,186
Please do not ignore my loyal advice.

315
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:15,991
You can ask for me whenever you need help.

316
00:32:17,893 --> 00:32:20,963
As the saying goes,
"Be satisfied with what you have."

317
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:26,101
It is not a shame to know your place.

318
00:32:42,484 --> 00:32:43,585
I am Kim Yunseong.

319
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:47,422
I am Cho Hayeon.

320
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:51,293
Were you surprised
because I asked to see you?

321
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:55,764
Not so much. You must have your reasons.

322
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:57,638
Please have a seat.

323
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,221
I know it is not appropriate
to meet you like this.

324
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:08,533
But I was curious
as you may become my husband.

325
00:33:08,844 --> 00:33:10,812
I had to see you even though
it is not polite this way.

326
00:33:12,476 --> 00:33:15,517
Has your curiosity been satisfied at all?

327
00:33:16,518 --> 00:33:17,358
Yes.

328
00:33:17,485 --> 00:33:20,555
However, I am worried now.

329
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:26,295
To be the wife
of such a great man like yourself,

330
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:29,331
I have too many faults.

331
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:35,270
Could you elaborate?

332
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,777
I am the only child,
so I may come off as selfish,

333
00:33:41,944 --> 00:33:43,879
and I lack patience.

334
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:46,421
Oh, no.

335
00:33:48,884 --> 00:33:50,052
That is a big problem.

336
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:54,356
Furthermore,

337
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:57,459
I prefer reading books to embroidering.

338
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,229
I know many vulgar stories
that would shock you.

339
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:10,472
My parents are very worried about me.

340
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:20,382
In fact, I am not as upright
as I am known to be.

341
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,919
Please do not worry.

342
00:34:28,023 --> 00:34:30,425
That cannot be true.

343
00:34:34,596 --> 00:34:38,433
I mean I understand what you want.

344
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:41,003
Pardon?

345
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:44,006
You do not want to marry me,

346
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:46,903
but you are afraid
of the consequence of rejecting me.

347
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:51,238
How did you know that?

348
00:34:56,733 --> 00:35:00,236
By any chance,
do you have someone else in mind?

349
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:03,425
It seems that we are
in the same situation.

350
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,700
What should we do then?

351
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:18,799
Let's find out a way to break off
this arranged marriage peacefully.

352
00:35:20,434 --> 00:35:22,736
Come and take a look at this.

353
00:35:25,939 --> 00:35:27,507
My Lord.

354
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:30,844
Please take a look at this.

355
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:36,083
They're eternal love bracelets
that tie lovers' fate.

356
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:42,589
Eternal love bracelets...

357
00:35:43,117 --> 00:35:46,856
Even if you part with your lover,

358
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:50,917
this bracelet will bring you two
back together in the end.

359
00:36:17,182 --> 00:36:19,785
I did not expect to see you here,
Your Highness.

360
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:28,335
Why are you staring at me like that?

361
00:36:29,818 --> 00:36:32,654
Are you pretending
that we met accidentally again?

362
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,371
Pardon?

363
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:38,741
I did not plan this. It is true.

364
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:47,813
Does this mean
we are meant to be together?

365
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,152
She is way too direct.

366
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,834
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?

367
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:13,272
I will be at the training field
for the group training.

368
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:37,890
Who are they?

369
00:38:38,424 --> 00:38:41,560
I will jump into them on three.
Please run away.

370
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:44,930
One, two, three.

371
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:18,831
Are you all right?

372
00:39:25,804 --> 00:39:29,975
I am relieved that you are unharmed.

373
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,802
Why do you not ask me?

374
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:37,843
You mean why you were being chased?

375
00:40:42,381 --> 00:40:46,085
If you could tell me,
you would have already.

376
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:50,823
- Your Highness.
- I want to be alone for a while.

377
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:52,691
You may go now.

378
00:41:06,238 --> 00:41:07,078
Byeongyeon.

379
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:19,118
If I had only one person
in the whole world whom I could trust,

380
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,588
it would be you.

381
00:41:23,422 --> 00:41:24,556
You know that, right?

382
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,759
You must remember
how much His Majesty regretted...

383
00:42:12,825 --> 00:42:14,827
...losing the Queen seven years ago.

384
00:42:18,264 --> 00:42:22,702
I heard the palace attendants
saying that she did not die of a disease.

385
00:42:23,016 --> 00:42:24,784
Who hurt Mother?

386
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:26,295
Yeong!

387
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:30,043
Never say that out loud again.
Do you understand?

388
00:42:30,877 --> 00:42:32,278
Father!

389
00:42:33,149 --> 00:42:34,917
Please find out the truth.

390
00:42:35,081 --> 00:42:36,785
Please find them.

391
00:42:37,536 --> 00:42:41,173
Please catch the people who hurt Mother!

392
00:42:41,595 --> 00:42:42,629
Yeong!

393
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,427
Your Highness.

394
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,388
Where have you been?

395
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:20,417
I visited someone I missed.

396
00:43:21,823 --> 00:43:23,091
Who is the person, Your Highness?

397
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:27,208
My mother.

398
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:46,461
What kind of person was the late Queen?

399
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:54,836
She was bored in the palace
and curious about the outside world.

400
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,375
She is like you.

401
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:05,913
She often tried unusual things.

402
00:44:06,781 --> 00:44:09,517
Her servants used to be in trouble.

403
00:44:12,253 --> 00:44:14,756
It is the same for you as well.

404
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:25,133
Nevertheless, she had a warm heart,
and was wiser than anyone else.

405
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,610
I could not protect her.

406
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:40,915
I could not.

407
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:55,990
That's when I realized that
I must be strong to protect those I love.

408
00:44:59,233 --> 00:45:00,301
Your Highness...

409
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:10,678
Were you worried
because I disappeared so suddenly?

410
00:45:21,556 --> 00:45:23,458
You do not need to say anything.

411
00:45:26,828 --> 00:45:28,529
You can just stay by my side.

412
00:45:34,035 --> 00:45:35,536
You are like the sweets to me.

413
00:46:31,893 --> 00:46:33,294
What is this?

414
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:36,030
It was sent from Minister Cho's house,
Your Highness.

415
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:44,832
Not long ago, he saved my life
when I was in danger.

416
00:47:44,999 --> 00:47:47,235
What else could it be other than fate?

417
00:47:51,506 --> 00:47:53,708
As you advised me,

418
00:47:53,775 --> 00:47:56,544
I will tell him how I feel sincerely.

419
00:48:29,978 --> 00:48:33,214
Did you not like my gift, Your Highness?

420
00:48:33,982 --> 00:48:35,516
I could not open it,

421
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:38,219
because I was not sure what it meant.

422
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:42,957
You saved my life.

423
00:48:44,726 --> 00:48:46,861
It was only an accident.

424
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:54,736
Since I am not good at embroidering,

425
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,272
I had to stay up
for several nights to make this.

426
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:11,152
I often think of you
and I miss you every day.

427
00:50:09,143 --> 00:50:13,348
Does this mean
you can't stand being away from me?

428
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:31,332
Your Highness.

429
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:35,803
May I have your permission
to ask something?

430
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:47,415
Have you ever liked a maiden before?

431
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:55,762
Yes, I have.

432
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:01,796
You have?

433
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:05,433
When? What was she like?

434
00:51:09,304 --> 00:51:10,371
Right now.

435
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,541
I like a very beautiful woman.

436
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:19,753
If so,

437
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:23,251
why would you keep being so nice to me?

438
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:27,055
- That is...
- All day long,

439
00:51:28,156 --> 00:51:31,426
I was happy,
upset and heartbroken because of you.

440
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,628
I suffered so much.

441
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,433
Am I forbidden to ask

442
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:44,172
what's on your mind
when you treat me like this?

443
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:53,214
I may be a eunuch serving you,
but you cannot tell my heart what to do.

444
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:03,952
I may be a eunuch serving you,

445
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,056
but you cannot tell my heart what to do.

446
00:54:28,703 --> 00:54:32,040
What is it, Your Highness?

447
00:54:46,854 --> 00:54:47,694
Raon?

448
00:54:48,456 --> 00:54:50,892
Why are you looking for her? I mean...

449
00:54:52,026 --> 00:54:52,961
How do you know that name?

450
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:57,098
Did you raise her
after the riot ten years ago?

451
00:55:00,024 --> 00:55:03,761
I do not wish to harm her,
but protect her. So tell me.

452
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:06,307
Whatever. I do not care.

453
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,860
She ran away long ago.

454
00:55:09,844 --> 00:55:11,179
Do you know where she went?

455
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:16,628
I do not. That is why I came here
to see if she came.

456
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,528
If someone else asks for her,

457
00:55:28,096 --> 00:55:29,263
tell them you really do not know.

458
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:30,971
No.

459
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,134
Escape before then.

460
00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:35,603
It is dangerous here.

461
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,275
Wait.

462
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:46,648
Nothing will happen to Raon, right?

463
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:09,037
What are you doing?

464
00:56:40,068 --> 00:56:43,204
What is this?

465
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,343
It is an accessory
perfect for a pretty lady.

466
00:56:48,476 --> 00:56:49,577
You should know.

467
00:56:53,414 --> 00:56:56,150
A pretty lady?

468
00:57:00,421 --> 00:57:02,490
- Who...
- I told you...

469
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:06,327
...that there is a lady
that I like right now.

470
00:57:08,496 --> 00:57:09,897
And she is standing before me.

471
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,150
Wait!

472
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:33,621
Are you really trying to protect her?

473
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:44,207
Samnom.

474
00:57:50,338 --> 00:57:51,178
What did you say?

475
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,037
Hong Samnom.

476
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:56,778
She is in the palace now.

477
00:57:58,078 --> 00:58:01,315
She was sold off by the creditors.

478
00:58:04,003 --> 00:58:05,504
That is all I know.

479
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:31,713
I will now treat you like
the most precious lady in the world.

480
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:37,952
May I do that?
