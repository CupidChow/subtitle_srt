1
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:34,494
How embarrassing
for a man to look like this.

2
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,898
I heard it may be bad for the Crown Prince,

3
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,268
if the important festival were ruined.

4
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,539
Would you please forget what you saw?

5
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,312
Are you saying you took such a risk...

6
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,181
...for the Crown Prince?

7
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:58,551
What other reason could there be?

8
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,888
I work for Donggungjeon after all.

9
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,390
Then,

10
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:09,229
why did you become a eunuch,
when you're a woman?

11
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,368
Your Highness. Your Highness.

12
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,670
Did you look into it?

13
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:20,373
Yes, Your Highness.
I met with each dancer,

14
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,441
but I could not find her.

15
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,277
No one knew her either.

16
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,048
She knew every move of the dance.

17
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,350
Even parts that I told only to Aeshim.

18
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,390
Pardon?

19
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,255
Not to mention that that dance
was completely different from...

20
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,625
Document the entire preparation.

21
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,161
Yes, Your Highness.

22
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,997
All those dance moves are in your head?

23
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,171
Yes.

24
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,935
I never forget dances or songs
once I hear them.

25
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:53,873
Where is Eunuch Hong?

26
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,145
I've been gone too long. I must return.

27
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:09,923
You cannot go with those clothes on.

28
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:29,009
Wait right here.

29
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,494
I cannot find Eunuch Hong.

30
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,429
-He is not here?
-No, Your Highness.

31
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:50,697
Your Highness.

32
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,937
Are you searching for Eunuch Hong Samnom?

33
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,539
Have you seen him?

34
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,310
Yes. He thought you went to Donggungjeon,

35
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,112
so he rushed over there.

36
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,411
Have you returned?

37
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,481
How long have you been here?

38
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,786
I could not find you after the festival,

39
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,022
so I came here first.

40
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,259
What were you doing?

41
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:00,767
You ordered me to record
the music you newly wrote.

42
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,735
What am I thinking?

43
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,043
Do you have something else for me to do?

44
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,148
No. You may finish this.

45
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:50,589
Yes, Your Highness.

46
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,737
-You must hurry.
-Pardon?

47
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:12,605
The Crown Prince was looking for you,

48
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,240
so I said you went to Dongunggjeon.

49
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,110
You should hurry.

50
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:31,124
CHAPTER 5 Tell Me Your Wish

51
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,409
Do that again.

52
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,549
Pardon?

53
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,952
Not that. The sneeze.

54
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,659
Like this?

55
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,893
Not that.

56
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,812
Stop sneezing. You keep startling me.

57
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,884
My apologies, Your Highness. I will be...

58
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,386
Again?

59
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:38,992
What should I do? I cannot hold a sneeze.

60
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,931
Your Highness,

61
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,102
Chuseok is approaching, is it not?

62
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,171
Why do you ask?

63
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,874
I thought perhaps...

64
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:57,210
...trainees could get a vacation as well.

65
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,748
You want to go to the Lantern Festival.

66
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,351
How did you know?

67
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,321
Come closer.

68
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,615
Why did you do that?

69
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,284
How can you play when you're burning up?

70
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,420
A minor fever like this is nothing.

71
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:43,256
Don't you worry about me playing or not.

72
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,259
Worry? Who worries you?

73
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,397
Don't you budge from Jahyeondang today.

74
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,133
If I catch a cold from you,
I will punish you severely.

75
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,771
Do you understand?

76
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,188
Were you surprised that I called for you?

77
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,325
I do not mean anything else.

78
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,763
I just heard you make the best tea.

79
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,335
I wonder who told you that.

80
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:31,838
Who was it again?

81
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:44,551
The deep flavor and scent!
It is a work of art.

82
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,654
I am glad it pleases you, Your Highness.

83
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,058
You said before

84
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,160
that you only wrote
the letters on his behalf,

85
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,163
but the content within them was real.

86
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:02,469
Yes. I only added a little flair,

87
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,239
but I did not make anything up.

88
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:11,745
All I did was relay Jung Doryung's
affection for you.

89
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,182
What does he look like?

90
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,352
He is very masculine looking.

91
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,187
What about his voice?

92
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,489
-His voice...
-Your Highness.

93
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:26,493
Did you not order Eunuch Hong

94
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,895
to remain in Jahyeondang all day today?

95
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,469
I did.

96
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:31,704
But...

97
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,239
Over there...

98
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,111
Why that...

99
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,118
Eunuch Hong. You do not look well.

100
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,087
You may return.

101
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,624
My apologies, Your Highness.

102
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,132
I heard you were ill
with the cold before, too.

103
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,901
Before?

104
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,135
When?

105
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:13,139
When Jung Doryung first sent his letter.

106
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,375
He said you looked lovely...

107
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:19,045
...riding the swing while coughing.

108
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:22,849
A swing?

109
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,951
A cold?

110
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,725
Did he

111
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,128
really say that?

112
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,163
Your Highness.

113
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:39,833
Are you all right?

114
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,336
I just asked a question!

115
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,608
Your Highness, it is dangerous!

116
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,410
Please sit back down, Your Highness!

117
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,348
Your Highness!

118
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,659
Eunuch Hong!

119
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:07,627
Eunuch Hong! Are you all right?

120
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:09,863
Eunuch Hong!

121
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,966
Hold my hand!

122
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:21,947
Eunuch Hong!

123
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,110
Your Highness!

124
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,148
Your Highness!

125
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,400
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

126
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,971
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

127
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,044
Your Highness.

128
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:09,749
-Help His Highness!
-Yes, Master.

129
00:14:11,918 --> 00:14:13,553
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness!

130
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:14,955
Your Highness.

131
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,763
How dare you! Get up this instant!

132
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,233
A eunuch should protect His Highness.

133
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,637
My apologies.

134
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,343
I jumped in on my own.
He did nothing wrong.

135
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,456
Your Highness, what are you doing?

136
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,427
Do you think he can survive
after putting you at risk?

137
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,443
I am fine.

138
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,113
-Put it away.
-Yes, Your Highness.

139
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:18,184
Apologize to His Highness right now!

140
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,022
I've committed a mortal sin,
Your Highness.

141
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,693
Get up.

142
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,528
The ground is cold.

143
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,213
I will punish you severely,

144
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:48,815
so come with me.

145
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,927
My Lord, Councilor Kim is waiting.

146
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,796
Go ahead. I will follow shortly.

147
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:15,675
Over here! I am here!

148
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,979
Where are you all going? I am here!

149
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:25,819
Why is nobody looking at me?

150
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,088
Jahyeondang

151
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,710
My Lord.

152
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,313
Why are you so shocked to see me?

153
00:16:53,947 --> 00:16:54,914
I'm disappointed.

154
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,717
I did not hear you approach.

155
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,354
Are you all right?

156
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,491
Yes, I am fine.

157
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,993
Thank you, My Lord.

158
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,399
Eunuch Hong.

159
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,403
You think I caught your secret, correct?

160
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,978
Can you think of it

161
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,681
as me sharing a secret with you?

162
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:31,785
Because I'm dependable.

163
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,988
Can you not think that of me?

164
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,662
Do not worry because of me.

165
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:45,031
Do not avoid me, either.

166
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,706
I need to go.

167
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:12,292
Jahyeondang

168
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,227
Jahyeondang?

169
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,038
Eunuch Jang.

170
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,336
The maiden who danced at the festival.

171
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:24,844
Did you find her?

172
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,507
Do not get me started.

173
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,144
The Crown Prince
ordered me to search the palace,

174
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,814
so I checked everywhere
like a beggar licks a bowl.

175
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:35,855
But I could not find her.

176
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,252
Do not even bring that up.

177
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,956
Thinking how I suffered...
I just lost my appetite.

178
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:44,497
Completely.

179
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,251
Hong Samnom

180
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:19,292
He could not have avoided this.

181
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,396
Your Majesty.

182
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,934
The envoys have handed
the list of tributes.

183
00:19:29,703 --> 00:19:32,806
From the royal palace,
they demand 30,000 nyang in silver,

184
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,308
120,000g of ginseng,

185
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,611
150 sheets of leopard skin,

186
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,713
and 50 brushes made of weasel-tail hair.

187
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:42,282
Why such an increase in amount?

188
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,886
It is much higher
than what they demanded last month.

189
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,823
It is because Your Highness
taking the throne in the interim

190
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:52,726
is under their control.

191
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:58,164
They are being greedy and demanding more.

192
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:04,571
They wield the sword,
so we have no choice.

193
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,708
Who handed them the sword
in the first place?

194
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:13,580
You must accept risks and loneliness
when taking shortcuts.

195
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,287
What can one gain
without giving in exchange?

196
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:26,293
Your Majesty, what shall we do?

197
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,564
Do not offend them
with useless negotiations.

198
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,502
Let us turn a blind eye this once,

199
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,070
and do as they wish.

200
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,840
If we turn a blind eye once,

201
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:43,276
they will try to cut it out next.

202
00:20:47,781 --> 00:20:49,182
I apologize,

203
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,686
but I refuse.

204
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:30,423
That way!

205
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,229
Raon, do you want to play hide-and-seek?

206
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,832
I will count to ten,

207
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,735
and you hide under there.
Can you do that?

208
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:45,171
You hide and don't let
a single hair show, all right?

209
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,375
I win if you cannot find me
before you count 100.

210
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,579
No. That is not how we do it this time.

211
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,382
You must not come out until I find you.

212
00:21:56,383 --> 00:21:59,552
You must not tell anyone who you are.

213
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,522
Okay? No matter what happens,
do not get caught.

214
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:03,723
Understand?

215
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:06,699
I'm going to count.

216
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,096
One. Go. Two.

217
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:12,599
Please, Raon. Three.

218
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,000
Four.

219
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:18,939
Five.

220
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,075
Six.

221
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:25,779
Seven.

222
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:50,904
There she is! Get her!

223
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,028
Mom...

224
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:17,364
Mom...

225
00:23:19,132 --> 00:23:20,166
Mom...

226
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:34,247
Mom...

227
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:36,216
Mom...

228
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,953
What a baby.

229
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,219
Why are you talking in your sleep?

230
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:15,589
Byeongyeon.

231
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:23,029
I dreamed of the day
when I parted with my mom.

232
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,508
You had a sad dream.

233
00:24:37,577 --> 00:24:39,646
It was a happy dream.

234
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:46,086
At least I got to see my mom again.

235
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,897
Your Highness, you've been here?

236
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,400
-You fell into the pond...
-Puppy.

237
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:11,671
I said not to come here
until your fever broke.

238
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:14,941
That is more like it.

239
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,912
I am fine now,

240
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:22,649
thanks to my dear Byeongyeon
who nursed me all night.

241
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:27,220
"My dear Byeongyeon"?

242
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:31,157
Yes. My dear Byeongyeon
is completely different

243
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:35,962
from someone who trembles
before a sneeze.

244
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:39,933
Come sit here.

245
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,635
I refuse.

246
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:44,437
What? You refuse?

247
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:53,613
I am still coughing.

248
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:57,250
I'll get beaten for getting
precious Silver Spoon sick.

249
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:12,999
What are you doing?

250
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:14,768
Chew it well.

251
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,205
It's ten times more effective
than your Byeongyeon.

252
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:43,697
Hong Samnom!

253
00:27:44,631 --> 00:27:45,699
Yes?

254
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,902
What are you doing here
in times like these?

255
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:50,804
Is something wrong?

256
00:27:51,238 --> 00:27:53,139
Yes, something is very wrong.

257
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,442
Trainees who worked on the festival

258
00:27:59,212 --> 00:28:01,414
have been granted
a special Chuseok vacation.

259
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,921
Master Jang! Thank you so much!

260
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:08,922
Thank you!

261
00:28:15,462 --> 00:28:18,665
By the way, what's gotten
into Prince Dung lately?

262
00:28:18,865 --> 00:28:21,635
Why would a prince
give a vacation to a eunuch?

263
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:23,470
How nice of him.

264
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,548
Is something wrong?

265
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:36,883
Eunuch Hong.

266
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,287
Eunuch Do lost the bowl
that he was about to eat from.

267
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:45,091
I washed the rice and cooked it all,

268
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,294
but I lost the entire bowl.

269
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,596
What do you mean?

270
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:50,797
Come now.

271
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:54,568
Eunuch Do did all the preparations
to greet the envoys.

272
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:57,404
But as soon as they arrived,

273
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,773
he was removed from the list.

274
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:04,244
Is it that good to work
at the Envoy Residence?

275
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:07,247
Of course. If you become close
with the envoys,

276
00:29:07,314 --> 00:29:09,449
your life as a eunuch is set.

277
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,519
But...

278
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,788
Who took away your spot?

279
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,993
Who is the rat that stopped your path?

280
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:21,628
They should help the eunuch trainees!

281
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,764
Why did they block your way instead?

282
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:38,278
I see you are prettier
than any maiden out there.

283
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,922
That is the rat.

284
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:51,297
Pardon?

285
00:29:54,127 --> 00:29:55,462
That jerk.

286
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,068
What do you think, Councilor Kim?

287
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:06,873
Is the Crown Prince
worthy of being the interim king?

288
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,778
He is more than worthy.

289
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,785
However, this is not the time.

290
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,588
He is a child
who cannot even feed himself.

291
00:30:21,855 --> 00:30:23,490
If we give him a sword now,

292
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,625
he will only hurt himself.

293
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:31,731
So is it not the time?

294
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:40,567
I will relay your concern
for the Crown Prince to the Emperor.

295
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:48,615
I apologize,

296
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:52,719
but I must go prepare for the banquet.

297
00:30:59,392 --> 00:31:01,728
Joseon has beautiful rivers,

298
00:31:02,562 --> 00:31:05,232
and the ocean surrounding its land
is just magnificent.

299
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:10,670
But most beautiful of all are its women.

300
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:15,508
Is there a wench you've taken a liking to?

301
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:17,544
At the festival,

302
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:22,048
I remember the maiden
who did the solo dance.

303
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,220
I wish I could see her dance again.

304
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:36,930
Is that what you'd like?

305
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:44,638
Can you not even do that?

306
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:46,039
I can do it.

307
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:47,741
-Then try.
-Try it.

308
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:48,948
I will do it.

309
00:31:49,376 --> 00:31:51,077
I can do it. I can!

310
00:31:51,544 --> 00:31:53,413
That was a good angle.

311
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:54,981
-Again.
-Try again.

312
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:00,053
-That was great.
-Slap my hands.

313
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,689
Slap my hands! Did you see that?

314
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,898
His Majesty is coming.

315
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:12,938
What?

316
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:21,875
Where is His Majesty?

317
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,510
I was kidding.

318
00:32:25,912 --> 00:32:27,914
Hey! Stop right there!

319
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:37,924
What brings you here?

320
00:32:45,332 --> 00:32:48,235
Are you still spending time
at the Jahyeondang?

321
00:32:49,436 --> 00:32:50,503
Places don't matter.

322
00:32:51,605 --> 00:32:54,741
All I ever do is eat and play.

323
00:32:57,744 --> 00:33:00,947
Then why did you accept it?

324
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:09,756
Why do you want
to become the interim king?

325
00:33:12,859 --> 00:33:13,927
Do you want to know?

326
00:33:29,576 --> 00:33:31,044
It is to rid Joseon

327
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,981
of its enemy.

328
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,313
This is what I think.

329
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,415
Friends from youth

330
00:34:10,283 --> 00:34:11,718
are even like this.

331
00:34:12,786 --> 00:34:13,987
But the sovereign and subject

332
00:34:14,821 --> 00:34:17,290
are not even, like this vertical line.

333
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:20,327
If you must choose one,

334
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:22,929
which would you like?

335
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:38,778
I would choose this.

336
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:40,747
What is that?

337
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:44,985
What I must do
as a friend and subject is the same.

338
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:48,255
If His Highness tries to take
an improper path,

339
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:49,789
I must stop him.

340
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:54,661
Thus, I will help him choos
the right path

341
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:58,498
as his friend and subject
for the rest of my life.

342
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,635
What do you think, Your Highness?

343
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:05,939
With a great friend and subject
like him by my side,

344
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:08,775
I believe I can become a great king.

345
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,870
Is anyone in here?

346
00:35:40,707 --> 00:35:41,708
No, right?

347
00:35:43,376 --> 00:35:46,346
Then I have no choice
but to return another time.

348
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,892
Are you here for Eunuch Do
and Eunuch Ma's incident?

349
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,761
Yes, I am.

350
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:03,463
How did you know?

351
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:06,833
I checked the list
and noticed something odd.

352
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:09,870
I was going to send someone
to the Office of Eunuch Discipline.

353
00:36:11,638 --> 00:36:12,772
Thank you.

354
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:16,910
I am always grateful to you.

355
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:18,745
Such empty words.

356
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:20,580
Pardon?

357
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:24,017
How shall I show my gratitude?

358
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:26,052
That is more like it.

359
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:29,489
I heard you received a special vacation.

360
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,291
Give me

361
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:33,693
just half a day.

362
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:37,664
I apologize, My Lord.

363
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:39,833
But I have plans
at the Lantern Festival...

364
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,602
Then we can meet after you finish.

365
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:47,574
I will take that as a yes.

366
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:51,411
Also...

367
00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,019
Here.

368
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,956
I had one already.

369
00:37:03,023 --> 00:37:04,324
The Crown Prince gave me one.

370
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:06,326
His Highness?

371
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:07,233
Yes.

372
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:10,664
He gave me medicine
since I might get him sick.

373
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:12,566
He yelled at me to stay away, too.

374
00:37:27,848 --> 00:37:30,116
This was the spot
he said in the first letter, right?

375
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:33,553
Yes, it was.

376
00:37:34,988 --> 00:37:37,390
He said it was where he first saw you.

377
00:37:44,564 --> 00:37:45,765
I want to ride, too!

378
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:46,867
It looks fun.

379
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,676
How pretty!

380
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:05,619
I heard you were ill
with the cold before, too.

381
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:15,328
Do you know what colds
and love have in common?

382
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:19,332
It is that you cannot hide them.

383
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,768
There is one more.

384
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:24,104
They both

385
00:38:25,071 --> 00:38:26,406
can hurt you.

386
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,512
Why do I care about a man
I've never seen before?

387
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:36,917
Forget it. That's good enough.

388
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:46,126
Your Highness, let us go fly a lantern.

389
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:47,366
Shall we?

390
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:50,931
Let us go.

391
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:58,538
This place is still the same.

392
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:00,740
But she must have forgotten me.

393
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:04,377
Of course, she did.
You stopped writing her.

394
00:39:13,954 --> 00:39:15,522
Still, I hope...

395
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:18,859
I could see her one more time.

396
00:39:20,861 --> 00:39:22,128
Just once more.

397
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,672
This is Minister Cho Manhyeong,

398
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:35,475
former governor of Gyeongsang Province.

399
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:36,843
And now Minister
of Culture and Education.

400
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,944
Greet His Excellency.

401
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:41,348
I am Kim Yunseong.

402
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:45,318
He is as good looking as I heard.

403
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:49,689
I can see why he's famous
even in Gyeongsang Province.

404
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,259
You are very generous.

405
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:55,562
Your daughter is much more famous.

406
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:01,601
Please take good care of him.

407
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:04,371
I am a mere country man
who just came to the city.

408
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:09,276
I will need more help
from him than I can give.

409
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:14,981
I was told you hadn't seen each other
in a few years.

410
00:40:15,982 --> 00:40:19,753
May I be excused
so you can enjoy your reunion?

411
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,887
Stay.

412
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:24,624
This meeting is also for you.

413
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:30,931
Minister Cho, would you like him
to pour you a drink?

414
00:40:32,632 --> 00:40:34,067
I would like that very much.

415
00:41:16,443 --> 00:41:20,180
I dreamed of the day
when I parted with my mom.

416
00:41:24,985 --> 00:41:28,755
At least, I got to see my mom again.

417
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,970
Mom. Mom.

418
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:46,006
Mom.

419
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:47,847
Mom.

420
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:41,655
I thought you'd be having fun.
What are you doing?

421
00:43:44,558 --> 00:43:46,793
I am having so much fun, Your Highness.

422
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:50,630
But then again, puppies love

423
00:43:50,897 --> 00:43:53,366
playing in snow
and watching lights in the sky.

424
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:58,505
You said you did not want to go outside.

425
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,273
What are you doing here?

426
00:44:00,707 --> 00:44:02,008
Without an escort, too.

427
00:44:02,275 --> 00:44:03,343
I am with you.

428
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,378
I have someone to meet.

429
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:09,483
Of course.
Let's say you had someone to meet.

430
00:44:15,422 --> 00:44:16,990
Will you keep standing here?

431
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:21,027
You have four hours left
of your precious vacation.

432
00:44:23,096 --> 00:44:24,264
Follow me.

433
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:27,901
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

434
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:32,038
I'm on vacation now, so please...

435
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,242
-You never obey me.
-Please...

436
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:37,077
What is Eunuch Jang teaching the trainees?

437
00:44:38,745 --> 00:44:39,679
Let's go.

438
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:40,747
Please...

439
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:07,634
Buy wish lanterns.

440
00:46:09,836 --> 00:46:12,639
Here is a wish lantern.
Your wish will come true.

441
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:18,512
-Did you make these?
-Yes.

442
00:46:18,612 --> 00:46:21,781
It is five cents,
but I will give it to you for three.

443
00:46:24,384 --> 00:46:26,853
Here you are. I do not need a lantern.

444
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:30,357
If you're not buying, please go.

445
00:46:30,557 --> 00:46:34,628
I am selling my wish lanterns.
I am not a beggar.

446
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:39,566
I am sorry. I did not mean it that way.

447
00:46:42,736 --> 00:46:44,771
A lantern that makes your wish come true.

448
00:46:45,438 --> 00:46:48,475
What wish would you make?

449
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:53,480
My wish is that I could meet the King
just once.

450
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,850
What would you do when you meet the King?

451
00:46:57,284 --> 00:47:01,321
I would ask him
to make Joseon a better country.

452
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:07,494
What makes a country great?

453
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:09,763
I think...

454
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:15,702
The King knows better
since he cares about his people.

455
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:23,410
I will buy one of your lanterns.

456
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:26,580
-It is three bun.
-Yes. Hold on...

457
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:34,120
I will buy all your lanterns.

458
00:47:41,294 --> 00:47:43,930
You did not have to do that.

459
00:47:51,938 --> 00:47:54,808
You said it will make a wish come true.
I trust you.

460
00:47:55,609 --> 00:47:57,043
Is that true?

461
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:01,748
Thank you.

462
00:48:03,316 --> 00:48:05,652
This is for you.

463
00:48:06,853 --> 00:48:09,422
Wait and see if your wish comes true.

464
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:11,324
Thank you, My Lord.

465
00:48:13,827 --> 00:48:14,667
As for these...

466
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:19,966
Give them to those
who cannot afford to buy one.

467
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:33,580
I hope your wish will come true.

468
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:00,907
This is pretty.

469
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:14,488
Lady!

470
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:53,126
She saw my face and ran away.

471
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:56,496
The Princess does not even know
how you look.

472
00:49:57,464 --> 00:49:59,733
She is still beautiful.

473
00:50:06,173 --> 00:50:07,307
It was Yeong, was it not?

474
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,708
Yes, Your Highness.

475
00:50:12,379 --> 00:50:14,281
Your Highness, where is your lantern?

476
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:15,488
What?

477
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:33,099
Let us meet again.

478
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:42,876
I wish I could become pretty like her.

479
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:55,789
Each of those lanterns

480
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:59,159
has a different wish of my people in it.

481
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,295
"I wish to have enough food."

482
00:51:02,996 --> 00:51:04,364
"I wish to be healthy."

483
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:11,571
All of their wishes
are what they want to say to me.

484
00:51:16,276 --> 00:51:17,277
Chief Eunuch Han.

485
00:51:18,678 --> 00:51:19,913
I do not have a lantern to fly.

486
00:51:21,314 --> 00:51:24,885
But can I make a wish to you?

487
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:28,588
Yes, Your Majesty.

488
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:34,161
Please look after the Crown Prince.

489
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:38,532
Help him and guide him

490
00:51:39,533 --> 00:51:41,401
so that he will not be defeated or shaken

491
00:51:42,702 --> 00:51:44,271
like I was, the foolish King.

492
00:51:50,343 --> 00:51:54,247
I shall heed your command
with all my heart.

493
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,995
It is the time and date
for the envoys' departure.

494
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,867
Until then, find a ground route
for your return.

495
00:52:15,368 --> 00:52:18,171
The tribute to the Qing
is made of the people's sweat.

496
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:20,674
We must give it back to them.

497
00:52:26,513 --> 00:52:29,950
Are you afraid
the Crown Prince will be blamed?

498
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,721
If you could wait
until the Crown Prince decides...

499
00:52:34,788 --> 00:52:36,156
Do not forget who you are.

500
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,694
You are not the Crown Prince's friend.

501
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:55,208
What are you looking at?

502
00:53:00,213 --> 00:53:01,548
It was nothing.

503
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:17,297
-Look at that.
-It is nice to see wish lanterns

504
00:53:17,597 --> 00:53:18,931
-floating like stars!
-It is beautiful.

505
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,469
Now, please write your wish.

506
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:24,838
I'm fine.

507
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,841
Please tell me what your wish is.

508
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:32,179
If only one of our wishes
is to be granted,

509
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:35,749
it would be better
for your wish to come true.

510
00:54:09,082 --> 00:54:11,885
Your Highness, shall we fly it now?

511
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:31,972
Please help our village
reap a good harvest!

512
00:54:49,923 --> 00:54:53,527
Please help our village prosper!

513
00:54:57,697 --> 00:55:00,834
Please make
the Crown Prince's wish come true.

514
00:55:07,874 --> 00:55:09,476
I wish Eunuch Hong will find his mother.

515
00:55:12,245 --> 00:55:14,447
I wish Eunuch Hong will find his mother.

516
00:55:30,564 --> 00:55:31,565
Is that...

517
00:55:32,866 --> 00:55:34,468
your wish, Your Highness?

518
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:37,270
Yes.

519
00:55:38,305 --> 00:55:39,873
It is my wish...

520
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:42,809
...to make your wish come true.

521
00:56:09,603 --> 00:56:10,604
With someone?

522
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:12,411
Are you a palace worker?

523
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:15,008
Raise your head.

524
00:56:18,678 --> 00:56:21,815
She is my woman, Your Highness.

525
00:56:25,285 --> 00:56:29,689
Can you think of it as
me sharing a secret with you?

526
00:56:30,724 --> 00:56:31,825
That I'm dependable.

527
00:56:33,026 --> 00:56:34,528
Can you not think that of me?

528
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,140
Your Highness.

529
00:56:50,043 --> 00:56:52,212
How did you know

530
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:54,748
that I parted with my mother?

531
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:19,072
Why are you staring at me like that?

532
00:57:19,973 --> 00:57:22,242
I know this must sound ridiculous.

533
00:57:25,078 --> 00:57:26,346
I don't know why

534
00:57:28,682 --> 00:57:30,650
I keep seeing someone else in you.

535
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:33,687
Someone else?

536
00:57:34,488 --> 00:57:35,328
Yes.

537
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,427
I see a lady.

538
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:52,278
Eunuch Hong.

539
00:58:03,683 --> 00:58:04,751
I am sorry I am late.

540
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:13,426
Your Highness, please forgive me.
We had plans.

541
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:22,135
You did not forget our plans, did you?

542
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:25,739
Would you go with me now?

543
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,685
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

544
00:58:55,769 --> 00:58:56,870
I do not give you permission.

545
00:58:59,873 --> 00:59:00,713
Your Highness.

546
00:59:06,112 --> 00:59:07,180
He belongs to me.
