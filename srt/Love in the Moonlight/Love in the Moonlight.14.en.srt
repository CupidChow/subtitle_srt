1
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:06,001
I'm Kim Sooran.

2
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:12,852
You may not leave. Go over there.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,134
I received permission from my superior.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,667
It's an order that women
your age may not leave the palace.

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,140
Next.

6
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:41,725
I work at Donggungjeon.

7
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,183
-My name is Hong...
-Hello.

8
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,801
Hello, Master.

9
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:54,180
He is with me.

10
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,057
Do you need anything else?

11
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,956
No, Master.

12
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:38,500
CHAPTER 14 Foggy Path

13
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:49,534
I cannot find a trace of him anywhere.

14
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:54,668
Did you know this was going
to happen at all?

15
00:02:56,293 --> 00:02:57,660
I did not, Your Highness.

16
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:20,305
Minister of Finance.

17
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:23,737
What do you feel about improper taxation?

18
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,777
What do you mean, Your Highness?

19
00:03:26,963 --> 00:03:29,931
We collect taxes
from those over the age of 16,

20
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:32,713
but we are collecting taxes
even from babies.

21
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:38,873
And now, they make the dead ones
pay taxes, too.

22
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:43,324
The bookkeepers sometimes make mistakes,

23
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:45,949
and collect taxes incorrectly.

24
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:50,781
Why do you try to blame the bookkeepers?

25
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,740
Find a way,

26
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,919
to compensate those
who were taxed unfairly.

27
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:02,959
Your Highness,
the nation is in financial crisis.

28
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:04,556
Rather than compensation,

29
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:08,229
punishing those responsible
would be better.

30
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:14,543
But if we collect even less in taxes
than right now due to the punishment,

31
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:17,890
our nation's financial state will worsen.

32
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:23,802
I commend your concern for the nation.

33
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,910
Then...

34
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:30,244
...given the dire situation,
I will take extreme measures.

35
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:36,088
I shall dock the payment
of all the officials of the Royal Court.

36
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:44,209
Your Highness, that shall not be done.

37
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:46,451
That cannot be done, Your Highness.

38
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,309
Docking the pay of the entire Royal Court

39
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,580
has never been done before.

40
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,198
Please be understanding.

41
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:54,422
Please be understanding.

42
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,265
The people are told

43
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:01,091
to pay taxes for even the dead
due to corrupt officials.

44
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,594
How could you whine at something so minor

45
00:05:03,685 --> 00:05:05,435
while you call yourselves
the roots of this nation?

46
00:05:06,162 --> 00:05:07,696
Do you really think

47
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,654
you deserve payment from the nation?

48
00:05:35,675 --> 00:05:40,075
Eunuch Jang. You look harried.

49
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:42,728
Do not get me started.

50
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:45,081
I do not blame him.

51
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:49,610
His Highness is like an icicle
in the dead of winter.

52
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:50,636
Icicle?

53
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:53,413
Cold and sharp.

54
00:05:55,127 --> 00:05:56,594
It must hurt a lot if you are stabbed.

55
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,600
I do not mind getting hurt,

56
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,499
but His Highness works all night.

57
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,823
I am worried for his health.

58
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:06,528
It is driving me crazy.

59
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,906
But...

60
00:06:09,647 --> 00:06:11,624
Where could Eunuch Hong be?

61
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,448
How would I know?

62
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,700
He disappeared without a trace overnight.

63
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,734
He used to hop around like a bunny.

64
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:23,882
Hong Samnom. I miss you.

65
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,009
I hate him.

66
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,803
That was so mean,
leaving without saying goodbye.

67
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,862
Eunuch Hong.

68
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:36,079
Your Highness,

69
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:38,954
I did not see any trace of Baekwoon

70
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,646
amidst the dead assailants.

71
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:44,799
They may be waiting
until things calm down.

72
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,402
Yes, that may be true,

73
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:50,513
but I found something strange.

74
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:52,883
What is it?

75
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:55,867
Recently, Minister Kim Uigyo

76
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,492
sold some official positions
for a bar of gold.

77
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:02,068
I had removed him
from office for that recently.

78
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:03,890
I see.

79
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:07,452
But where the gold bar ended up

80
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:09,756
is suspicious.

81
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:12,543
Where?

82
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,560
The dead assailant's brother
used that bar

83
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:17,952
at a gambling game.

84
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:21,636
The dead assailant received

85
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,873
the bar in return for something.

86
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:26,687
That is correct.

87
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:28,410
Your Highness.

88
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:30,601
The Lieutenant from the Department
of Justice wishes to see you.

89
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:32,435
Send him in.

90
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:37,872
What is it?

91
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:39,253
Your Highness,

92
00:07:39,344 --> 00:07:42,632
we captured someone suspicious
while searching

93
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,624
the merchant Chung Manshik's house.

94
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,734
It is a child less than 20 years in age.

95
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:52,616
She appears to have
a connection with Baekwoon.

96
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,838
Let us go.

97
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,213
I must see for myself.

98
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,511
A white-egret flower, right?

99
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:20,845
You remember.

100
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:27,309
This flower was embroidered

101
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:29,976
on the handkerchief

102
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:32,589
that my old friend used to carry with him.

103
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,023
He said it was given
by his wife he parted with.

104
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:44,294
"I miss you even in my dreams".

105
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,188
Do you think Father knew

106
00:09:51,667 --> 00:09:54,601
the meaning of the flower
you embroidered?

107
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:58,991
I think so.

108
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:16,018
Is it hard to bear?

109
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,927
No.

110
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:26,461
By the way, how did you and Father meet?

111
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,327
We were friends from the same town.

112
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,027
He was one of the boys who liked me.

113
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:43,128
The other boys brought me ornaments

114
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,827
and flowers from the field,

115
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,895
but your father was different.

116
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:51,761
What did he give you?

117
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:56,526
Barley.

118
00:10:57,693 --> 00:10:58,793
Corn.

119
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:03,693
When he had none of those,
he brought me wild greens or tree barks.

120
00:11:05,227 --> 00:11:07,561
I felt like I'd never go hungry with him,

121
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,095
so I asked him to marry me.

122
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:21,060
Father did not have
a romantic bone in his body.

123
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,828
A field to work.

124
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,660
Rice to eat when you are hungry.

125
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,360
A small house to sleep in at night.

126
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,527
That was all...

127
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,928
...your father ever wanted.

128
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,661
Are you saying

129
00:12:08,726 --> 00:12:11,293
she was not there when you arrived?

130
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,393
She was not.

131
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,660
How could this happen

132
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:22,360
right before our plan
of bringing her to our base?

133
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:24,926
She probably fled because the guards

134
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,794
started to search more aggressively.

135
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,893
You said

136
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:34,293
she did not know about her family,

137
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:36,594
their involvement in the riot,

138
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:40,527
or of the Baekwoon Group, did you not?

139
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,993
Yes, I did.

140
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:48,294
She did not seem to know back then.

141
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:53,559
I understand.

142
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:55,960
You may go.

143
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:05,460
Remember one thing.

144
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:11,761
Even if she knows who she is now,

145
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,327
the safest place for her

146
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,759
is Baekwoon Group.

147
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,660
Your Highness.

148
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:34,893
Did you call for me?

149
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:43,327
Are you well?

150
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,927
Are you worried about me?

151
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:54,360
The woman you love enough
to challenge me disappeared.

152
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,260
Why are you not asking me anything?

153
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,560
Whether she left me a letter...

154
00:14:05,194 --> 00:14:06,227
Or...

155
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,927
whether she said where she was going.

156
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,494
You and I

157
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:18,060
cannot share any information
with each other

158
00:14:18,726 --> 00:14:20,926
even if one of us knew something anyway.

159
00:14:23,893 --> 00:14:25,761
That is why I do not ask.

160
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,493
Not for me.

161
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:36,860
Even if it's useless,

162
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,160
I want to ask

163
00:14:42,326 --> 00:14:44,060
if you know anything.

164
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,360
Whatever it may be.

165
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:54,361
I am sorry for not being able to help,
Your Highness.

166
00:14:57,459 --> 00:14:59,492
You would say you do not know anything

167
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,627
whether you know or not.

168
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:05,894
That's what it sounds like.

169
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,661
Yes, that is correct.

170
00:15:12,093 --> 00:15:13,493
That is what I would do.

171
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,027
Your Highness.

172
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:59,361
Will you not even greet me passing by?

173
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,927
I did not see you.

174
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:07,060
I envy you.

175
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,260
For what?

176
00:16:12,326 --> 00:16:17,626
I wish I could walk past
without noticing you.

177
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,693
I wish I could walk past you
as if I did not see you.

178
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:32,461
Why do you look like that?

179
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:34,893
You are breaking my heart.

180
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:43,026
And you?

181
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,061
Why do you look at me that way?

182
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,527
You said it is merely a transaction.

183
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:56,027
Is love the only emotion
that a man and a woman

184
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:58,761
can have toward each other?

185
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,261
We may have to make transactions for life.

186
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:04,326
What is the harm in becoming close?

187
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,293
What I mean is...

188
00:17:16,793 --> 00:17:18,826
Do not walk so dejectedly.

189
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:24,060
Do not look as though
you have lost the world.

190
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:35,194
I am sure the person you love

191
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:38,227
would say the same...

192
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,893
if she saw you just now.

193
00:17:51,593 --> 00:17:53,394
Fine. I shall leave.

194
00:17:55,194 --> 00:17:56,194
But...

195
00:17:58,393 --> 00:17:59,994
I shall see you again, Your Highness.

196
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,294
So that is how the moon looks
from the palace.

197
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,527
The moon is the same.

198
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,526
How is it different?

199
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:19,060
When I was young,

200
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,061
I went all over the place
with the performance troupe,

201
00:19:24,326 --> 00:19:27,760
and I thought each region had
a differently shaped moon.

202
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:32,160
I thought the Yeongnam region
had a round moon.

203
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:35,427
And I thought the Honam region
had a crescent moon.

204
00:19:39,093 --> 00:19:43,027
Did you move around that often?

205
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Yes.

206
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:49,326
Isn't it funny?

207
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:56,594
Have you never had such silly thoughts?

208
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:00,093
I have not.

209
00:20:01,294 --> 00:20:04,228
You learn about the changes
in the sun and the moon

210
00:20:04,326 --> 00:20:06,160
by the age of five.

211
00:20:08,227 --> 00:20:10,161
How are you so foolish?

212
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:14,327
Sure, sure.

213
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:17,526
It is a joke.

214
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,360
I have never said this to anyone before,

215
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,561
but I was more foolish than you.

216
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:33,927
When I was young,

217
00:20:34,993 --> 00:20:37,360
I thought this palace
was the entire world.

218
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:45,194
The noblest, the most precious,
and the tiniest well in Joseon

219
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,294
is this palace, my home.

220
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:54,960
Yes, I am better.

221
00:20:57,593 --> 00:21:00,127
It was the lowest
and the least significant,

222
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:03,260
but I grew up in a big lake.

223
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Raon.

224
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,594
Whether you see it
from the palace or from a farm,

225
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,427
the moon is simply the moon.

226
00:21:27,526 --> 00:21:28,693
I may be the Crown Prince,

227
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,160
but it does not matter who you are.

228
00:21:31,183 --> 00:21:32,751
Whenever it is and wherever we are,

229
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:36,455
it's fine as long
as our hearts are the same.

230
00:21:38,557 --> 00:21:39,658
Just like that moon.

231
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:47,766
Yes, Your Highness.

232
00:22:28,107 --> 00:22:29,108
Your Highness.

233
00:22:44,556 --> 00:22:45,925
Push harder.

234
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:47,459
Please push harder.

235
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,632
Just one more push, Your Highness!

236
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:55,968
-Your Highness.
-Do not give up.

237
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:57,603
You must be strong!

238
00:23:00,806 --> 00:23:02,741
She is not due for another month.

239
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,577
How could this happen?

240
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:06,145
Your Majesty,

241
00:23:07,146 --> 00:23:09,114
she will be fine.

242
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:11,884
Do not worry too much.

243
00:23:24,463 --> 00:23:28,667
Her Highness has already given birth
and is resting.

244
00:23:29,168 --> 00:23:31,136
She said you do not have to come.

245
00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:33,105
Why did you not call me sooner?

246
00:23:34,006 --> 00:23:37,042
It happened so suddenly. My apologies.

247
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:47,786
The baby is here.

248
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,403
It is a princess, Your Highness.

249
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:30,562
Your Highness.

250
00:24:31,897 --> 00:24:35,768
Will you really not look at the baby?

251
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:39,905
There is no need.

252
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:45,010
Get rid of her.

253
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:36,195
It is a prince. A prince.

254
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:40,065
Congratulations.

255
00:25:40,399 --> 00:25:41,600
Congratulations.

256
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:43,702
Stop the fuss.

257
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,240
We should start the preparations.

258
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:50,943
What do you mean?

259
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,146
A new prince has been born,

260
00:25:54,213 --> 00:25:57,116
so Donggungjeon
should prepare for a new master.

261
00:25:58,708 --> 00:25:59,776
Watch your mouth.

262
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,789
I just don't like Minister Cho's attitude.

263
00:26:05,289 --> 00:26:06,325
I was worried

264
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:09,061
that the Crown Prince
would marry his daughter,

265
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:14,166
but now all we have to do
is replace the prince.

266
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:16,912
There is no rush

267
00:26:17,603 --> 00:26:19,271
in who we put on that throne.

268
00:26:20,172 --> 00:26:22,074
You are correct.

269
00:26:38,524 --> 00:26:39,364
Wait.

270
00:26:43,596 --> 00:26:44,630
Go.

271
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:50,502
Go. Go. Go.

272
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,363
One, two, three.

273
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:22,268
Your Highness.

274
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:26,171
Oh, my.

275
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,208
Were you there the whole time?

276
00:27:29,642 --> 00:27:32,945
Yes, Your Highness. Have you been well?

277
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:35,681
I have.

278
00:27:37,216 --> 00:27:39,551
I was about to take a walk.

279
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:42,187
You may join me if you wish.

280
00:27:53,432 --> 00:27:56,569
I liked how you were being rude.

281
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:59,872
It felt like a breath of fresh air.

282
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:04,810
So,

283
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:11,951
when we are alone,
why don't we speak casually?

284
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:14,620
Deokho.

285
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:24,063
I cannot do that, Your Highness.

286
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:27,333
Why not?

287
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,935
I do not...

288
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:35,975
...know your name.

289
00:28:42,214 --> 00:28:44,717
It is Myungeun. That is my name.

290
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:49,088
Okay,

291
00:28:51,257 --> 00:28:52,391
Myungeun.

292
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,849
How... How dare you?

293
00:29:17,449 --> 00:29:19,084
That is too soon.

294
00:29:19,151 --> 00:29:20,019
Right.

295
00:29:20,252 --> 00:29:23,222
Sorry... Sorry about that,
Your... I mean Myungeun.

296
00:29:24,156 --> 00:29:25,124
But...

297
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:27,826
...that hurts so much.

298
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:37,436
I just received news from the Queen.

299
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:43,075
She gave birth to a prince.

300
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:49,248
Congratulations, Father.

301
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:58,457
I know that the birth of another prince

302
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:00,192
is not all good for you.

303
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:04,997
They say as much
as it is important and noble,

304
00:30:05,464 --> 00:30:08,133
it is difficult to protect the throne.

305
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:12,004
But he is my brother
who just entered the world.

306
00:30:13,405 --> 00:30:17,076
Please do not worry, Father.

307
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:32,558
The Crown Prince must be dying inside.

308
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:36,829
More so because
his favorite eunuch disappeared.

309
00:30:37,229 --> 00:30:39,865
What? A eunuch disappeared?

310
00:30:40,232 --> 00:30:41,834
Did you not know?

311
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:44,937
The day the palace
was turned upside down,

312
00:30:45,004 --> 00:30:47,039
searching for Hong Gyeongnae's daughter,

313
00:30:47,273 --> 00:30:49,441
he disappeared into thin air.

314
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:53,512
How suspicious.

315
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:55,381
Do not get me started.

316
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:59,084
He was caught trying
to escape on his first day here.

317
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:02,721
Not long ago, a woman's dress
was found in his room,

318
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:05,925
so he was dragged over to the Queen.

319
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:08,427
It was quite a sight.

320
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:12,765
As always, the Crown Prince saved him.

321
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,834
A woman's dress?

322
00:31:17,236 --> 00:31:18,504
The Crown Prince?

323
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,072
That is right.

324
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:25,644
He protected him so much just because
he was a eunuch from Donggungjeon.

325
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,849
This is getting interesting.

326
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:45,798
Your Highness.

327
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:58,577
From the attack on Donggungjeon

328
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:02,815
to your eunuch's disappearance,
my heart aches deeply

329
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,783
as I hear of your recent troubles.

330
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:10,723
That is correct.

331
00:32:12,291 --> 00:32:13,359
Thanks to that,

332
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:17,062
I learned an interesting fact
while investigating

333
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:20,199
the criminal who was captured back then.

334
00:32:21,967 --> 00:32:23,969
An interesting fact?

335
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:34,380
Your wealth, a quite large bar of gold...

336
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:37,583
...was with his family.

337
00:32:40,686 --> 00:32:43,589
I do not understand what you mean.

338
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,292
That is what I want to say.

339
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:50,462
For what did you pay so handsomely

340
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,199
to an assailant
who attacked Donggungjeon?

341
00:33:07,212 --> 00:33:10,316
Who knew the bar
would have a serial number on it?

342
00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:12,151
This is going to be a pain.

343
00:33:12,952 --> 00:33:15,354
How can I make an excuse
for giving so much money

344
00:33:15,554 --> 00:33:18,657
to someone who attacked Donggungjeon
to make it look less like a conspiracy?

345
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:22,861
The Queen had a prince,
but he is still arrogant.

346
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,931
I thought he was just a baby.

347
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:29,668
What if this harms Councilor Kim?

348
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:31,370
That would be terrible.

349
00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:44,783
Master.

350
00:33:48,988 --> 00:33:50,189
My apologies.

351
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:55,194
Do not even start
something you'd be sorry for.

352
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:53,352
So pretty.

353
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:02,461
I mean the moon.

354
00:35:05,231 --> 00:35:07,333
Would you like a closer look?

355
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:17,910
What is that?

356
00:35:19,345 --> 00:35:21,013
They are binoculars.

357
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:22,832
They let you have

358
00:35:23,614 --> 00:35:25,450
a closer look at things that are far away.

359
00:35:29,922 --> 00:35:31,023
Like this.

360
00:35:53,646 --> 00:35:55,114
You are right.

361
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:58,984
The moon is filling my eyes.

362
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,732
Whether you see it
from the palace or from a farm,

363
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:16,869
the moon is simply the moon.

364
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:21,841
I may be the Crown Prince,
but it does not matter who you are.

365
00:36:22,808 --> 00:36:24,410
Whenever it is and wherever we are,

366
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:28,180
it's fine as long
as our hearts are the same.

367
00:36:29,949 --> 00:36:31,383
Just like that moon.

368
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,435
Is it that fascinating?

369
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:38,851
You must be missing someone...

370
00:37:41,053 --> 00:37:42,221
...who is far from here.

371
00:37:47,959 --> 00:37:49,161
No, Master.

372
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:51,767
Since the moon looked so big,

373
00:37:52,267 --> 00:37:55,370
I was simply admiring it.

374
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:27,047
My lord is waiting for you.

375
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,139
Please come inside, Master.

376
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:42,651
Did you say the eunuch from Donggungjeon

377
00:38:42,951 --> 00:38:44,586
is Hong Gyeongnae's daughter?

378
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:46,622
Oh my goodness.

379
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:50,092
How did she become a eunuch as a girl?

380
00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:52,327
She even lived in the palace

381
00:38:52,628 --> 00:38:54,396
serving the Crown Prince as a spy.

382
00:38:56,898 --> 00:38:58,700
Should we not catch her right now?

383
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:01,363
It is too late.

384
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:04,306
She must have run away by now.

385
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:09,144
What did you just say?

386
00:39:10,012 --> 00:39:14,249
The spy used to be called Hong Raon
when she was a child.

387
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:24,192
I see why the Crown Prince
looked so shocked.

388
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:32,200
If she ran away, we can catch her.

389
00:39:34,703 --> 00:39:38,206
Do you know where she is hiding, Master?

390
00:39:49,818 --> 00:39:51,186
Poor Minister Kim.

391
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:55,290
He might be dismissed twice

392
00:39:55,457 --> 00:39:57,426
in a month for the same reason.

393
00:39:58,694 --> 00:40:00,095
About the bar of gold,

394
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:02,764
he'll have to give a clear explanation.

395
00:40:03,932 --> 00:40:07,346
Do you know what information
he meant to get

396
00:40:07,437 --> 00:40:09,404
to cost him that much money?

397
00:40:11,073 --> 00:40:12,441
What?

398
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:16,651
Hong Raon.

399
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:23,218
The spy who served you
as a eunuch at Donggungjeon

400
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,955
helped the assailants attack you.

401
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,493
Where is the proof?

402
00:40:32,527 --> 00:40:34,930
That girl is the solid proof.

403
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:41,203
It must make you quiver with anger.

404
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:44,139
Do not worry, Your Highness.

405
00:40:44,606 --> 00:40:48,176
I shall go as far as cutting off her limbs

406
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,446
to bring her before you.

407
00:40:57,653 --> 00:40:58,654
Did you...

408
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,456
know about her, Your Highness?

409
00:41:36,792 --> 00:41:38,794
Did someone open the gate

410
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:41,863
and let you in that night?

411
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:48,470
There is a Baekwoon Group spy
in the palace.

412
00:42:25,273 --> 00:42:26,375
That cannot be true.

413
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:17,092
What kind of crown princess
do you wish to be?

414
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,929
I shall love the Crown Prince

415
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,800
with all my heart until the end.

416
00:43:30,505 --> 00:43:34,142
I will love because I believe
that true love is the only thing

417
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,411
that would enable me to be patient

418
00:43:37,145 --> 00:43:38,914
and to sacrifice myself for His Highness.

419
00:43:48,924 --> 00:43:50,058
Your Highness.

420
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,801
This is where you will stay

421
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:01,837
during the preparation.

422
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,786
Why did you get so much work again?

423
00:44:19,054 --> 00:44:21,823
It is good to make much money.

424
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,628
Maybe a lot of ladies are looking for

425
00:44:26,962 --> 00:44:28,363
pretty clothes to get married.

426
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:31,566
I heard this on the way home.

427
00:44:32,234 --> 00:44:33,869
The ban on marriage has been lifted.

428
00:44:39,608 --> 00:44:41,576
It means the crown princess
has been decided.

429
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:43,010
All that is left is the wedding ceremony.

430
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:45,747
I heard the Crown Princess

431
00:44:46,548 --> 00:44:48,283
is Minister Cho's daughter.

432
00:44:59,094 --> 00:45:00,195
That's good.

433
00:45:02,998 --> 00:45:04,766
Let me help you with this.

434
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:07,002
No. I will do it.

435
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:10,472
You need something to put these in, right?

436
00:45:10,939 --> 00:45:12,240
I will bring it, Mom.

437
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:13,468
Your Highness, why are you so surprised?

438
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:17,973
Should you not be in your quarters?

439
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:21,610
Have you heard the news?

440
00:46:22,844 --> 00:46:25,380
Do you mean that you were chosen
as the Crown Princess?

441
00:46:26,848 --> 00:46:27,816
I heard it.

442
00:46:30,652 --> 00:46:34,423
I shall serve you with all my heart,
Your Highness.

443
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:37,392
It is merely a deal.

444
00:46:38,527 --> 00:46:40,128
That would not be necessary.

445
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,336
If you become a great king,

446
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:50,939
it would be good for my family as well.

447
00:46:55,177 --> 00:46:57,512
Since I accepted this deal,

448
00:46:58,313 --> 00:47:00,382
I shall commit myself to my duties.

449
00:47:05,954 --> 00:47:07,089
In return,

450
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:09,391
I need you to promise me one thing.

451
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:14,229
What promise will it be, Your Highness?

452
00:47:16,598 --> 00:47:18,166
Never come in to this place again.

453
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:21,503
Never.

454
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:58,740
I asked you
not to come here again, Master.

455
00:48:09,217 --> 00:48:10,886
You have not eaten anything, have you?

456
00:48:12,587 --> 00:48:13,655
Please stand up.

457
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:15,190
-Come with me...
-It is...

458
00:48:16,525 --> 00:48:19,361
It's painful for me to see you, Master.

459
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:26,702
You make me want
to ask about His Highness.

460
00:48:31,373 --> 00:48:32,808
I know I should forget him.

461
00:48:34,242 --> 00:48:36,645
I know I shouldn't,
but I keep wondering how he is.

462
00:48:38,146 --> 00:48:41,483
I wonder if he eats and sleeps well,

463
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:43,919
whether he is healthy or not.

464
00:48:48,056 --> 00:48:50,158
I hate myself

465
00:48:51,593 --> 00:48:53,862
for wanting to ask these things to you

466
00:48:54,863 --> 00:48:56,331
when you are so kind to me.

467
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,668
So please do not come again.

468
00:49:01,536 --> 00:49:02,704
Please.

469
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:11,413
It is all right.

470
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:19,688
I think about shameful things
as well, deep down.

471
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,092
I wonder maybe you would open up to me

472
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:30,732
once all these miserable days pass.

473
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:45,213
You may cry.

474
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:51,653
I will not hope

475
00:49:53,956 --> 00:49:55,424
nor delude myself.

476
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:29,558
I was trying not to cry.

477
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:41,303
My heart is aching so much.

478
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:52,441
Just in case.

479
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:55,243
Should you face
a very difficult situation

480
00:51:56,778 --> 00:51:58,347
and have to let go of something,

481
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,819
it must not be me.

482
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:07,689
Can you promise me?

483
00:52:09,825 --> 00:52:11,026
Yes, Your Highness.

484
00:52:17,432 --> 00:52:19,001
I have a request.

485
00:52:20,669 --> 00:52:26,975
May I stay within one step from you
all day today?

486
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:22,591
Who are you looking for, My Lord?

487
00:54:23,325 --> 00:54:26,795
I am here to see Eunuch Hong
on behalf of Chief Eunuch Han.

488
00:54:29,398 --> 00:54:30,933
Are you saying you are from the palace?

489
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:02,230
"There is something
I did not tell you in the palace."

490
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:04,466
"It is about your father."

491
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:07,636
"I will write the time
and place for us to meet."

492
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:49,945
Wait.

493
00:55:50,312 --> 00:55:52,948
Are you saying that you know
where that girl is hiding?

494
00:55:53,348 --> 00:55:56,752
Then why are we not bringing her here?

495
00:55:57,853 --> 00:56:00,322
We already have the girl.

496
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:02,457
Now, we have to use her

497
00:56:02,891 --> 00:56:05,427
to make a bigger plan.

498
00:56:06,628 --> 00:56:10,832
Are you saying you will drag
the Crown Prince into this?

499
00:56:12,901 --> 00:56:14,636
What if the Crown Prince

500
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:18,273
was intimate with the enemy's daughter

501
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:21,043
outside the palace?

502
00:57:39,187 --> 00:57:40,289
I will...

503
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:44,389
...never forgive you.
