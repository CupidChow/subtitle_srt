1
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,086
Why are you staring at me like that?

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,189
I know this must sound ridiculous.

3
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,260
I don't know why...

4
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,531
But I keep seeing someone else in you.

5
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,668
Someone else?

6
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,905
I see a lady.

7
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,723
Eunuch Hong.

8
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,263
I am sorry I am late.

9
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:11,938
Your Highness, please forgive me.
We had plans.

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,547
You did not forget our plans, did you?

11
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:24,250
Would you go with me now?

12
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,759
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

13
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,011
I do not give permission.

14
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:54,914
Your Highness.

15
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:01,721
He belongs to me.

16
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,770
Yes, he works for Donggungjeon.

17
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,638
Hence, step aside.

18
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,375
Do you disapprove...

19
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,479
...because it's me who's taking him?

20
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,119
Were you that important?

21
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,489
If not, what is it?

22
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,267
Lord Kim?

23
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,770
It is you, Lord Kim.

24
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,875
Here's the famous Samnom, too.

25
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,479
What are you doing with just men?

26
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,448
Come hang out with us.

27
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,784
Step away from me.

28
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,688
My Lord. Are you not glad to see me?

29
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,228
Let... Let us go!

30
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,700
Let us have fun tonight.

31
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,804
You look pretty,

32
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:27,307
but you are so manly.

33
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,484
Go.

34
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,054
Pardon?

35
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,817
I am fine, so you go.

36
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:09,849
CHAPTER 6 When You Want to Tell a Secret

37
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,599
Thief! Stop him!

38
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,802
Stop him!

39
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,878
Do not get the wrong idea.

40
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,983
You have seen how upright I am.

41
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,485
So I do not worry, but...

42
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,455
Yes, do not worry.

43
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:57,030
I simply learned that you frequently visit
kisaeng's parlors alone.

44
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,832
There is nothing to misunderstand.

45
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,237
You are correct.

46
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,976
You came late,
so the lanterns are all turned off.

47
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,544
There is nothing for you to see.

48
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:16,449
Who told you
I wanted to see the Lantern Festival?

49
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,989
I cannot take another step.

50
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,525
What is the matter?

51
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,128
My steps...

52
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,735
...have never felt so precious before.

53
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,943
Is this how you act like
at the kisaeng's parlors?

54
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:49,883
My Lord.

55
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,518
My Lord.

56
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,222
There he is!

57
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,958
Over there!

58
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:02,062
Over there!

59
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,721
Are you all right?

60
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,724
Yes, I am.

61
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,234
Give that to me, please.

62
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,239
I have the mask!

63
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:32,825
Byeongyeon.

64
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,658
What is it?

65
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,094
When did you return?

66
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,463
You should come home early.

67
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,834
- Were you worried?
- Silence.

68
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,210
Go to sleep.

69
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,786
Three places were hit last night alone.

70
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,524
It is not the first time
thieves go rampant.

71
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,829
Do not make a fuss in front of the envoy.

72
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:16,936
Yes, My Lord.

73
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,433
But I have a bad feeling about this.

74
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,737
Only the houses of wealthy people,

75
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,039
who are notorious
for being abusive were robbed.

76
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,142
What are you doing? Show it to him.

77
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,182
They all say he was wearing this mask.

78
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,887
This is...

79
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:58,438
It is the mask from that night, is it not?

80
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:00,373
Who could it be?

81
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,779
The rumor circulating
on the market is disconcerting.

82
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:07,314
What rumor?

83
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,684
They say Hong Gyeongnae's clan
is on the move again.

84
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,988
They are stealing from the rich

85
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,058
and distributing it to the poor
just like they did before.

86
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:18,964
Could it be...

87
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,099
the thieves and Hong Gyeongnae's clan
are related somehow?

88
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,655
My apologies, Your Highness.

89
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,624
Is it uncomfortable?

90
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,692
Did you enjoy
your outing to kisaeng's parlors?

91
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:55,468
Pardon?

92
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,635
Yes, well...

93
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:13,246
Right. I must have forgotten
that you are a man.

94
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:18,518
That even a eunuch
wants to embrace a beautiful woman.

95
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,093
Heed not what I said last night.

96
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:33,033
I will never see someone else
in you again.

97
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,643
Eunuch Jang.

98
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,506
Yes, Your Highness.

99
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,019
You are excused.

100
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,328
Minister Cho.

101
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,564
Councilor Kim.

102
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,534
How long has it been
since you last came to the palace?

103
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,405
How long has it been
since you came to the palace?

104
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,942
It has been three years, Father.

105
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,478
She says it has been three years.

106
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:53,747
Pay your respects.

107
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,615
He is Chief State Councilor Kim Heon.

108
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,653
I am Cho Hayeon.

109
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,990
You're just as pretty as when you used
to play with the Princess.

110
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:06,593
Back then?

111
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,363
She was often scolded
for arguing with the Princess.

112
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,432
- Really?
- Yes.

113
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,870
I will be at the Royal Office.

114
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,407
If the Princess refuses to let you in,
come there.

115
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,375
Father, please.

116
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,012
Let us go.

117
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,552
Eunuch Jang.

118
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,589
The eunuch from Daejeon asked
for a couple of your trainees.

119
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:38,591
Do you mean me, Master?

120
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,293
Don't say anything.

121
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,064
Look elsewhere.

122
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,268
His Highness despises
sending his men elsewhere.

123
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,137
It seems urgent.
Couldn't you ask at least?

124
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,907
Look elsewhere before you face his ire!

125
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,575
Send Eunuch Hong.

126
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,081
Hoonnam is all I need.

127
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,092
Who is Hoonnam?

128
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,627
That would be me.

129
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,129
Jang Hoonnam.

130
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:28,675
It should be around here somewhere.

131
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,844
Is it over there?

132
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,128
Silver Spoon.

133
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,136
You are amazing.

134
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,328
Are you okay?

135
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:26,366
Your terrible archery skills shocked me,
but I am fine.

136
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,302
But why are you speaking
without courtesy...

137
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,815
The wish lantern.

138
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,117
Can you stand up?

139
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:48,555
Will you just watch?

140
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,197
Your Highness!

141
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,667
Your Highness! What is the matter?

142
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,874
Is he the Crown Prince?

143
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,284
I am Minister Cho's daughter, Cho Hayeon.

144
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,454
I've always wanted to meet you again.

145
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,536
As expected,
the envoy's movements are suspicious.

146
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,508
Monitor the officials
and others close to the envoy.

147
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,545
We may be able to find out
what deals they are making.

148
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,595
This is the list of people
who misappropriated funds.

149
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,473
Is this all?

150
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:09,775
Yes.

151
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:20,011
This is the information of children
who became orphans

152
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,215
or were sold off as slaves ten years ago.

153
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:27,253
Find anyone related to Hong Gyeongnae.

154
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,429
I shall.

155
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,161
You must find out before anyone else.

156
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:38,398
It will help consolidate power
that's been split up.

157
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,334
I will keep that in mind.

158
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,206
Please have some, Your Highness.

159
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:53,313
Put them away.
I will want to eat them if I see them.

160
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,220
Put them away.

161
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:57,951
Her Highness is trying to lose weight.

162
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,523
Do not say that in front of her.

163
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,092
"I am the one
that looks like a princess."

164
00:17:06,293 --> 00:17:07,327
She thinks that on the inside.

165
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,997
I made a jest as a child.

166
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,901
You have gotten prettier
after losing weight.

167
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,075
Since when were you so nice to me?

168
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:33,019
Your Highness.
I'll visit the palace more often now.

169
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:34,927
Why?

170
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,123
Please be welcoming.

171
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,661
Next time, I will bring tea
that helps you lose weight.

172
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,797
What is wrong with you?

173
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,920
Why should I hold it in?

174
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:07,047
Why did you have to see me urgently?

175
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,481
My apologies.

176
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,051
I came so urgently

177
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,920
because I found what you've been...

178
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,459
...desperately searching for.
Only I can bring it to you.

179
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,663
What I've been searching for?

180
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,433
Yes. Once you hear what it is,

181
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:31,504
you will surely be enticed.

182
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:37,210
Your Highness.

183
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,213
I will make you
a tonic good for insomnia.

184
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:43,049
I cannot breathe.

185
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:46,219
I suddenly get flushed and hallucinate.

186
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,622
What is the cause?

187
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,124
In my personal opinion,

188
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,361
your body is healthy.

189
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:56,896
However,

190
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,399
if you feel those symptoms often,

191
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:01,474
that is...

192
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:08,981
That is...

193
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,211
What is it? Speak.

194
00:20:11,745 --> 00:20:16,082
With those symptoms,

195
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:21,054
it sounds like an illness
for widows and nuns.

196
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,690
An illness for widows and nuns?

197
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:25,625
Yes.

198
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,961
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

199
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,870
You see...

200
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:36,403
It is natural for a man
and woman to be together.

201
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:40,206
But if you desire
someone you cannot have,

202
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:43,410
it eats away at you from within...

203
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,312
Oh my!

204
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,917
How dare you say such things?

205
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,154
- Get out right now!
- Yes, Your Highness.

206
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,801
Jahyeondang

207
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,637
A trainee is working overnight?

208
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,074
Yes. I was just summoned.

209
00:21:14,908 --> 00:21:17,244
I will not be back tonight,
so go to sleep first.

210
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,746
I'm off then.

211
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:32,192
Why am I working overnight
at the Envoy Residence?

212
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:33,994
You will know when you go in.

213
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:35,929
Where...

214
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:44,738
Master...

215
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,650
Come closer.

216
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:02,155
I came to work the overnight shift.

217
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,092
I will stand outside.

218
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:11,097
That pretty dancer was you?

219
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:25,011
But why are you acting as a eunuch,

220
00:22:26,313 --> 00:22:28,648
and residing in the palace?

221
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:33,954
I am curious,

222
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:36,923
so come and sit.

223
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,494
What are you doing?

224
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,264
Are you a boy with a pretty face,

225
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,267
or a wench pretending to be a eunuch?

226
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,376
Please stop.

227
00:22:55,242 --> 00:22:57,510
You are a eunuch
from Donggungjeon, correct?

228
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,747
Do you truly not know

229
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:05,151
that the fate of the Crown Prince
is in my hands?

230
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,389
A eunuch

231
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:12,959
should be willing to die
for the Crown Prince.

232
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:15,829
Stay still.

233
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,300
Please let me go!

234
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:25,305
Are you all right, My Lord?

235
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:27,807
You little...

236
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:31,717
Who is it?

237
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:41,888
It's me.

238
00:23:44,024 --> 00:23:45,025
Crown Prince.

239
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,510
Let us go.

240
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,545
Your Highness.

241
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:08,548
Is anyone out there?

242
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:10,584
Crown Prince!

243
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:11,618
Your Highness.

244
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:15,689
Will you cope with the consequences
of what you just did?

245
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:19,659
Why...

246
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,494
What should I do?

247
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:24,664
Why? Just why?

248
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,105
I was worried
that this may happen eventually,

249
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:35,709
but how could he do that to the envoy?

250
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:41,414
Do not worry too much, Your Majesty.

251
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:44,017
I will ask Councilor Kim to come.

252
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:53,960
Your Highness.

253
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,662
Your Highness.

254
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,063
Your Highness.

255
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,101
Why are you...

256
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,141
How could you go in there?

257
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,410
What if something happened?

258
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,981
My apologies, Your Highness.

259
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:17,350
I was ordered to work...

260
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,686
You should have fled
when it seemed strange!

261
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,626
How could a trainee like me
refuse an order?

262
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,496
And he is a Qing envoy.

263
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:32,565
I could not put you in a bad spot...

264
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:34,501
Why are you thinking about that?

265
00:25:38,672 --> 00:25:40,073
Who cares about the envoy?

266
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,542
Who are you to...

267
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:53,353
Why do you anger me this way?

268
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:05,498
What are you doing?

269
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,938
Your Highness, please forgive us.

270
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:14,874
But we were ordered
to lock up Eunuch Hong.

271
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,043
Let him go right now.

272
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:19,379
I shall meet with my father myself.

273
00:26:22,349 --> 00:26:23,450
Please step back, Your Highness.

274
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:25,352
If you do this,

275
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,989
we must kill him to bring him in.

276
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:34,761
How dare you threaten me?

277
00:26:36,296 --> 00:26:37,297
My apologies, Your Highness.

278
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:57,817
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

279
00:26:58,952 --> 00:26:59,953
Your Majesty.

280
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:03,023
Please hold the Qing Envoy accountable,

281
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,027
and punish me for breaking the law.

282
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:13,033
Why do you claim
only the helpless eunuch is at fault?

283
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,470
If that eunuch has any fault,

284
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:22,008
it is his devotion
as a subject and citizen.

285
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:24,511
Please retract your order.

286
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,081
Guards!

287
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:33,086
Lock the Crown Prince
in Donggungjeon and guard him.

288
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,193
Your Majesty!

289
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,189
I told you that life
is full of ups and downs.

290
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:45,825
You acted arrogant that the Crown Prince

291
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:49,162
was going to take the throne
in the interim.

292
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,498
What? When did I do that?

293
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,367
What are you going to do now?

294
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:57,137
What if he gets dethroned?

295
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,340
Watch your mouth!

296
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,975
How could you say that?

297
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,677
You startle me.

298
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:07,681
Don't yell at me.
The Crown Prince caused the mess.

299
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:10,550
What is the big deal about a trainee?

300
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,552
Oh, my.

301
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:15,555
Is the rumor true then?

302
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,525
What? What? What rumor?

303
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:21,528
That Prince Dung likes men.

304
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:23,530
Stop that!

305
00:29:24,698 --> 00:29:26,566
If you go around
and spread that ridiculous rumor,

306
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,535
I will not forgive you!

307
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:30,303
Hey.

308
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:35,442
Everyone will hear because
of your loud voice, not me.

309
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,010
I know.

310
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:40,046
That the Crown Prince does not like men.

311
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,222
What?

312
00:29:45,452 --> 00:29:48,989
The other person may not be a man.

313
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:50,729
What?

314
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,494
I really did not want to say this.

315
00:29:55,428 --> 00:29:56,463
Eunuch Ma.

316
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:58,865
My Lord.

317
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:02,535
Come with me.

318
00:30:06,006 --> 00:30:09,442
Were you the one who brought Eunuch Hong

319
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:12,112
to the Envoy Residence?

320
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:15,582
Pardon? Yes.

321
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:19,920
The assigned eunuch had an emergency.

322
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:27,627
What is that?

323
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:35,001
It's a gun I obtained while I was in Qing.

324
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,607
I was intrigued,
so I obtained bullets as well.

325
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:41,908
I see.

326
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,110
But why are you showing me...

327
00:30:44,644 --> 00:30:47,247
It does not require gunpowder.

328
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:55,255
All I need to do is pull the trigger.

329
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:03,263
Then it fires.

330
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:05,599
Why are you doing this?

331
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:10,470
Let Eunuch Hong be.

332
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:15,575
Why are you so concerned
about Eunuch Hong?

333
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:20,113
Do you know the secret that I know?

334
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:35,328
Do not be curious. Do not speak.

335
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:40,634
If anyone ever speaks
of Eunuch Hong's secret,

336
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:42,369
regardless of who it is,

337
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,107
you will be the one who dies.

338
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:52,679
I have one bullet remaining.

339
00:31:55,815 --> 00:31:59,019
I plan to save this for you.

340
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,836
You look terrible.

341
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:21,975
Is the Crown Prince well?

342
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:24,978
You are in no position
to worry about the Crown Prince.

343
00:32:30,383 --> 00:32:31,851
Donggungjeon is a mess.

344
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,988
The Japanese invasion
does not even compare.

345
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:40,660
The Crown Prince may be dethroned.

346
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:52,072
Dethroned?

347
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,644
Get your act together.

348
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:00,413
Eat well.

349
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:03,984
Eunuch Hong.

350
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:06,386
Are you listening?

351
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,022
Who is it? Get rid of them!

352
00:33:09,723 --> 00:33:11,124
Get them!

353
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:12,592
Get them!

354
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:14,794
- Get them!
- Run!

355
00:33:27,707 --> 00:33:31,645
The envoy will be departing
two days from today.

356
00:33:32,445 --> 00:33:35,282
Have you heard from the Qing official
who is coming?

357
00:33:35,782 --> 00:33:37,784
No. I do not think he has arrived yet.

358
00:33:40,654 --> 00:33:42,255
We must find

359
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:45,258
a clear proof that will nail the envoy.

360
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:57,237
You must not let anyone
in the palace know about us.

361
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:00,807
What are you thinking about?

362
00:34:01,241 --> 00:34:02,175
Pardon?

363
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:04,844
What did you say?

364
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:08,315
I asked how many men
are guarding Donggungjeon,

365
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:10,283
and whether you can get past them.

366
00:34:15,655 --> 00:34:19,025
Your Highness! Your Highness!
No, Your Highness!

367
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:21,461
Your Highness! You will get hurt!

368
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,598
- Get His Highness!
- Yes, My Lord!

369
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:26,700
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

370
00:35:06,273 --> 00:35:07,307
Your Highness.

371
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:11,077
It is fine. Stay seated.

372
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,252
How are you...

373
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:29,396
I will stay for just 15 minutes.

374
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,852
Please go back.

375
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,555
Only the palace guards
are permitted in here.

376
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:57,924
Have you forgotten?

377
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,594
I am the Crown Prince.

378
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,331
Exactly.

379
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:09,603
You cannot abuse your power
for a lowly eunuch.

380
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:11,438
I may abuse my power,

381
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,109
since I am the Crown Prince.

382
00:36:24,618 --> 00:36:26,453
Finally, you are smiling.

383
00:36:48,275 --> 00:36:49,276
Your Highness.

384
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:58,018
Are you still angry with me?

385
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,354
It is not you.

386
00:37:04,524 --> 00:37:06,693
It is me. I get angry,

387
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:11,698
whenever I look at you.

388
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:19,573
Promise me one thing.

389
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:26,079
Do not refrain yourself
because of someone else.

390
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,749
Especially if it is because of me.

391
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:33,220
Your Highness.

392
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:34,654
Promise me

393
00:37:35,922 --> 00:37:37,290
that you will not do that again.

394
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:52,439
I promise, Your Highness.

395
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,530
Mistreating a Qing envoy

396
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:19,799
is not different from
insulting the Emperor.

397
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:25,372
I cannot face the Emperor
with such humiliation.

398
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:29,142
If I could, I would take
the Crown Prince to Qing...

399
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:31,611
Pardon? But that is...

400
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:35,916
You cannot take the Crown Prince...

401
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,484
I am aware of that.

402
00:38:38,051 --> 00:38:39,920
At least, I should take
that eunuch to Qing

403
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:43,023
and punish him according to Qing law.

404
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:43,929
You cannot do that!

405
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:47,260
He's a mere eunuch trainee.
What would you...

406
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:48,728
How dare you?

407
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,765
You must not be rude to him. Sit down.

408
00:38:56,269 --> 00:39:00,240
So... would that be enough?

409
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:21,328
What brings you here, My Lord?

410
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,997
I came here as your friend.

411
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:25,999
Must you keep such a distance?

412
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:32,839
What is it?

413
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,309
I wonder if there is anything
I can do to help.

414
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:39,585
No.

415
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:42,449
I need your help.

416
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:55,395
Who cares about the envoy?

417
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:57,464
Who are you to...

418
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:01,968
Why do you anger me this way?

419
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:12,245
The Crown Prince may be dethroned.

420
00:40:18,084 --> 00:40:19,286
Promise me one thing.

421
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:26,259
Do not refrain yourself
because of someone else.

422
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:29,996
Especially if it is because of me.

423
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:59,426
Leave us alone so I can talk to him.

424
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:01,394
Yes, My Lord.

425
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,502
A eunuch must be willing

426
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:12,672
to sacrifice his life for those he serves.

427
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,041
But I am sorry

428
00:41:16,209 --> 00:41:18,812
I have to send you away
when you are innocent.

429
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:27,254
The Crown Prince
implored forgiveness all night long

430
00:41:28,288 --> 00:41:29,756
to save you.

431
00:41:33,226 --> 00:41:34,961
His Highness did that?

432
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:42,769
Do you have a family you left behind?

433
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:45,172
I will talk to them.

434
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:51,511
I have someone who found me
during the riot and raised me,

435
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:55,982
but I do not know his whereabouts now.

436
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,717
Are you saying

437
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,454
you lost your parents
in the riot ten years ago?

438
00:42:02,522 --> 00:42:03,523
Yes, Master.

439
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,692
I parted with my mother then.

440
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,296
How old are you?

441
00:42:10,463 --> 00:42:11,531
We must leave now.

442
00:42:14,234 --> 00:42:15,235
Let's go.

443
00:42:16,736 --> 00:42:17,904
I am 18 years old.

444
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:38,458
Guard him well.

445
00:42:39,459 --> 00:42:42,829
We need him alive until
we arrive in Qing.

446
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:53,507
Let's go.

447
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:07,554
Stop.

448
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:32,512
I am honored that
you would see me off like this.

449
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:34,915
Thank you for being glad to see me.

450
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:43,390
You have done enough.

451
00:43:44,524 --> 00:43:46,159
Leave the eunuch here.

452
00:43:50,163 --> 00:43:52,199
What is this act of disrespect?

453
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,709
We are seeing off the Qing envoy.

454
00:44:04,511 --> 00:44:07,247
Did you draw your sword
because of that mere eunuch?

455
00:44:07,547 --> 00:44:08,548
Yes, I did.

456
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:12,085
I have never let anyone
take what is mine before.

457
00:44:13,286 --> 00:44:14,421
Thus, I am very angry now.

458
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:17,591
Release him right now.

459
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:25,465
Why do you care about only one person?

460
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,834
You have to think of all your people,

461
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:30,971
who are shaking in fear
because of their immature Prince.

462
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:37,177
The people shaking in fear

463
00:44:37,911 --> 00:44:40,213
are the best weapon you have.

464
00:44:42,482 --> 00:44:45,285
You use them to get what you want,

465
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:47,787
and you hide behind them
when you are in trouble.

466
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:50,157
Is it not true?

467
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:54,027
How much longer
will you keep nagging like a child?

468
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:56,897
Please put up your sword right now.

469
00:44:58,899 --> 00:44:59,966
I shall go.

470
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:12,379
I shall go.

471
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:16,983
Did you forget what you promised me?

472
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:23,056
Your Highness told me
not to refrain myself,

473
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,225
especially when it is for you.

474
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,361
Therefore,

475
00:45:29,729 --> 00:45:31,431
I will not refrain myself
from telling you this.

476
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:38,605
Your Highness must refrain yourself
from anger,

477
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:44,144
for your people and not for me.

478
00:45:46,012 --> 00:45:48,315
It is because you are
the Crown Prince of this country.

479
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:04,397
Move away.

480
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:08,368
It is the King's command.
Please give me your sword.

481
00:46:35,462 --> 00:46:36,302
Let's go.

482
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:43,109
His Highness is...

483
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:55,916
I wish you health, Your Highness.

484
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:29,049
We shall take a rest here.
Stop the carriage.

485
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,217
Stop!

486
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,625
Follow me quietly with a few more people.

487
00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:40,260
Yes, My Lord.

488
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:43,730
Tie him to a tree.

489
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:53,440
Judging by the Crown Prince's temper,

490
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:58,011
he won't go easy
with the officials in the future.

491
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:01,581
Looking at the world
with such excessive enthusiasm,

492
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:04,384
he must be dissatisfied
with everything he sees.

493
00:48:05,352 --> 00:48:07,687
The King was the same
at the Crown Prince's age.

494
00:48:08,522 --> 00:48:11,091
He only pursued change and reform.

495
00:48:11,224 --> 00:48:14,594
Now look what he's done.

496
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:19,399
The result of his actions was tragic,

497
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:23,770
but you should take a risk
to pursue change.

498
00:48:24,504 --> 00:48:27,874
This country is led by courtiers.

499
00:48:29,042 --> 00:48:31,411
When the king considers himself as a king

500
00:48:31,578 --> 00:48:34,147
as the literal meaning suggests,

501
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:36,016
that's when it gets the most risky.

502
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,854
Oh, no.

503
00:48:42,823 --> 00:48:44,090
Dear me.

504
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,197
As I was trying to understand you,

505
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:51,765
I got distracted.

506
00:48:52,666 --> 00:48:55,168
It's hard to concentrate on fishing.

507
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,009
For the safety of the country
and political stability,

508
00:49:05,745 --> 00:49:07,714
please lend me your support.

509
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:13,553
I am suggesting marriage
between our children now.

510
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:50,223
Who are you?

511
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:06,106
I prepared a gift,
but I forgot to give it to you.

512
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:14,381
I shall fight alone.
Please stay away, Your Highness.

513
00:50:15,682 --> 00:50:18,151
You should have said that
before I drew my sword.

514
00:51:23,817 --> 00:51:27,120
This is the investigation censor
from the Censorate.

515
00:51:27,754 --> 00:51:28,822
Make way.

516
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:36,530
Please forgive us for being rude.

517
00:51:45,005 --> 00:51:47,474
Does my farewell present please you?

518
00:51:49,075 --> 00:51:51,278
What are you doing?

519
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:55,816
You not only tried
to steal what is the Emperor's,

520
00:51:56,016 --> 00:51:57,484
but you even tried to traffic some of it.

521
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,022
As far as I know,
you get exiled at the least

522
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:04,157
for trafficking sulfur
and bull's horn in Qing.

523
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:05,892
Is it not right?

524
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:09,863
The punishment
for trafficking sulfur is death.

525
00:52:10,764 --> 00:52:12,833
I will tell the Emperor
that it is a conspiracy.

526
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,203
Who do you think
the Emperor will believe?

527
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:20,974
You are right. He would not believe me.

528
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:25,645
That is why I invited another guest.

529
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:57,978
I heard they changed the route to Qing.

530
00:52:58,812 --> 00:53:00,614
It's a rougher and longer route.

531
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:02,682
They'd meet there
if they're trafficking anything.

532
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:10,190
I marked the place on the map.

533
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:14,161
Are you sure...

534
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:18,331
you will be okay?

535
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,070
I'm fine as long as Eunuch Hong is safe.

536
00:53:30,911 --> 00:53:33,146
It's a list of merchants
who made deals with the envoy.

537
00:53:41,788 --> 00:53:43,890
They're meeting for the last deal
on the way to Qing.

538
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,027
We have to find who the merchants are

539
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:48,528
before the investigation censor arrives.

540
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:50,497
Can you look into it?

541
00:53:51,097 --> 00:53:53,700
Yes, Your Highness.
But we don't have much time...

542
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,904
I will stop the envoy
from leaving until you return.

543
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:25,131
How could you disgrace the Great Qing

544
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,901
by abusing your position as an envoy?

545
00:54:28,368 --> 00:54:30,170
It is a misunderstanding.

546
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:34,841
I will explain everything.

547
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:35,942
I do not need your explanation.

548
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:40,814
Pay for your crime with your life.

549
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,541
Your Highness.

550
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:18,278
You cannot be doing this.

551
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,247
Let's go back.

552
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:24,651
You can go back now.

553
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,889
Are you sure?

554
00:56:35,262 --> 00:56:37,063
You are safe now.

555
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:48,675
I was afraid
I would really be taken to Qing.

556
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:52,279
I was afraid as well...

557
00:56:56,183 --> 00:56:57,384
...that it might be too late.

558
00:57:43,463 --> 00:57:45,599
How dare you break your promise to me?

559
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:49,069
You shall be punished
once we return to Donggungjeon.

560
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:54,141
May I really return to Donggungjeon?

561
00:57:55,575 --> 00:57:56,576
Of course.

562
00:58:00,046 --> 00:58:02,849
You said you get angry when you see me.

563
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:05,952
That is still true.

564
00:58:08,622 --> 00:58:09,990
I get angry when I see you.

565
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:15,228
But I cannot help it.

566
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:18,799
When I could not see you,

567
00:58:20,634 --> 00:58:21,834
I was angrier and it drove me crazy.

568
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:31,945
So...

569
00:58:33,513 --> 00:58:34,748
Stay by my side.
