1
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:14,760
Silver Spoon?

2
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:16,974
Jung Doryung?

3
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:22,179
Do you think
you can handle the consequences?

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,213
Yes. I'll do anything you want
if we meet again.

5
00:00:26,304 --> 00:00:29,174
If you want me to be your dog,
I'll be your dog.

6
00:00:41,092 --> 00:00:42,160
It's nice to see you again,

7
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:45,015
Puppy.

8
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:55,921
You made it out safely.

9
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,694
It broke my heart
having to leave you like that.

10
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:05,698
It broke your heart?

11
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,389
Were you a palace guard?

12
00:01:08,734 --> 00:01:12,805
You looked so skilled
when you drew your sword.

13
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:17,739
I was a fool to call
this strong man a silver spoon.

14
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,370
- I am...
- There aren't any that way.

15
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,616
You may keep walking backwards,

16
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:26,919
but there are no ditches or snakes here.

17
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:32,224
It was a tough experience, wasn't it?

18
00:01:33,125 --> 00:01:35,327
I sent someone who is very quick.

19
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:36,610
Did you?

20
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:39,682
He must've been quick but deaf and blind.

21
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:43,636
I screamed until I lost my voice
before he found me.

22
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:47,973
- My goodness.
- But, tell me.

23
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:51,410
How did you end up here as a eunuch?

24
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:52,778
Pardon?

25
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,616
The fact is,

26
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,875
it has always been my dream
to become a eunuch.

27
00:02:01,966 --> 00:02:02,967
Then...

28
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,374
Where are you sneaking off to
with that bag?

29
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,061
I'm running an errand.

30
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:10,763
Well...

31
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:13,666
- The Chief Eunuch...
- I see.

32
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:15,940
Who goes there?

33
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,370
- Oh my! Your Hi...
- If it isn't Eunuch Sung!

34
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,372
It's me. Chief Lee.

35
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:23,442
Why...

36
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:26,378
Yes Sir, Chief Lee.

37
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,182
What Sir?

38
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:35,387
The Office of Eunuchs
must be quite occupied these days.

39
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,938
Giving errands to novices
who don't know their way around.

40
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:40,793
And not only that.

41
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:44,212
Getting such orders from
the Chief Eunuch himself.

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,531
Pardon?

43
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,971
I thought a frightened trainee
was running away.

44
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,520
Your security is so tight.

45
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:11,624
The Office of Eunuchs must feel safe.

46
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,396
Come with me.

47
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:26,839
Silver Spoon.

48
00:03:26,905 --> 00:03:28,674
Slap me.

49
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:32,392
Just slap me and let's forget
that day ever happened.

50
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:40,920
It's not nice to hit a puppy.

51
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,657
You need to be nice and play with it.

52
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:47,359
I'll be seeing you around.

53
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,398
Puppy. Go on.

54
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,937
Go on.

55
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:05,577
Go in.

56
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,783
You've committed three wrongs at once.

57
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,061
First is fleeing. Second is lying.

58
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:16,188
Third is getting caught
by that fastidious little...

59
00:04:17,923 --> 00:04:18,924
That...

60
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,297
How could you
humiliate eunuchs like this?

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,870
I'm sorry! I was frightened
to be at the palace.

62
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:36,375
Fine. I will eliminate that fear of yours

63
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,812
and transform you into a great eunuch.

64
00:04:39,945 --> 00:04:41,013
Tonight,

65
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,315
you shall sleep here.

66
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,900
Master Sung!

67
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:04,770
CHAPTER TWO The Path to You

68
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,242
Office of Eunuch Discipline

69
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:17,950
Attention.

70
00:05:22,315 --> 00:05:24,851
Eunuchs have the important role,

71
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,720
of managing
the royal family's household affairs.

72
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,023
We must become one.

73
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,891
We shall become
His Majesty's hands and feet,

74
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,560
the lamp that lights His Majesty's path,

75
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,046
and his shield in moments of danger.

76
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:41,668
We share a common fate
to protect the royal family.

77
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:45,972
If you do anything to disgrace

78
00:05:46,372 --> 00:05:48,941
the reputation and legacy
of the Office of Eunuchs,

79
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,111
there is only one thing awaiting you.

80
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,682
Paying the price for such heinous vilipend,

81
00:05:55,948 --> 00:05:57,183
with your life.

82
00:05:58,718 --> 00:05:59,886
So we shall!

83
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:14,033
There goes one already.

84
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,936
Must he do this every time?

85
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:21,140
You must prepare them early on
to make it easier later.

86
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:24,844
Is that right? Still, go easy on them.

87
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:27,547
You know full well
you get teased for a while

88
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,149
if you're not mentally prepared
and faint in front of everyone.

89
00:06:31,217 --> 00:06:32,318
As if you didn't know that.

90
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:34,787
Who did that?

91
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:39,959
It's none of your business.

92
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,928
I figured it out.

93
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:49,936
You will be judged on three criteria.

94
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,905
A physical examination, a written exam,

95
00:06:53,006 --> 00:06:54,674
and a character test.

96
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:58,277
If you fail any,
you will be kicked out of the palace.

97
00:06:58,578 --> 00:07:03,249
You'd better be on your toes.
Do you understand?

98
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,517
Yes, Master!

99
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:09,489
I am Ma Jongja.
I'm responsible for training you.

100
00:07:10,356 --> 00:07:13,760
I am the trainees' common enemy.

101
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:17,964
We will begin the physical examination.

102
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:22,068
When I call your name,
head to the examination room.

103
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:23,970
Kim Dalgeun.

104
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,171
Yes.

105
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:26,272
Oh Donghee.

106
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:27,377
Undress.

107
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:31,377
Pass.

108
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:32,979
Pass.

109
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:34,614
Pass.

110
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:38,985
Pass.

111
00:07:40,186 --> 00:07:41,187
Pass.

112
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:43,189
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,726
My apologies.

114
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,963
It's okay. I'm a trainee as well,

115
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:52,098
so you don't have to be formal.

116
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,301
I see.

117
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:58,705
He is 18 years old, the same as I.

118
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:02,742
What? I'm also 18.

119
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,802
You're 18? We're the same age.

120
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:08,414
Why are you sweating so much?

121
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,018
It looks like rain.

122
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:16,802
It's raining, it's pouring,
and the old man is snoring.

123
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:23,029
Are you afraid
of the physical examination?

124
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,599
Is there a way out?

125
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,135
Don't tell me you are...

126
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,070
What?

127
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,841
What? Don't tell you what?

128
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,276
Are you unhappy with the palace?

129
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:40,446
Is that why you're whining?

130
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:41,419
You don't like the palace?

131
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,652
You are a genius.

132
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:47,253
You're so cute.

133
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:49,244
Next.

134
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,303
Hong Samnom.

135
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:52,601
Do Gi.

136
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:53,849
Park Seongyeol.

137
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:54,973
Yes.

138
00:08:55,428 --> 00:08:57,463
- Let's go. Aren't you Hong Samnom?
- Wait!

139
00:08:59,198 --> 00:09:00,199
Pass!

140
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,108
If you do anything to disgrace

141
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,144
the reputation and legacy
of the Office of Eunuchs,

142
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:16,316
you shall pay with your life.
Do not forget.

143
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:25,758
Undress.

144
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,901
Pass.

145
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:38,104
Pass.

146
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:43,836
What are you doing?

147
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,300
Undress.

148
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:46,783
Pardon?

149
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:50,476
Take them off.

150
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,921
But...

151
00:09:57,023 --> 00:09:58,024
But the thing is...

152
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,627
I... I...

153
00:10:04,197 --> 00:10:06,699
What about it?

154
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,278
This is bad.

155
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:21,490
The royal physician is asking for you.

156
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:22,615
What's going on?

157
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,191
Her Majesty has fainted!

158
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:27,563
What?

159
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:29,455
- Let's go.
- Yes, Master.

160
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:30,860
Master.

161
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:33,469
Master!

162
00:10:34,286 --> 00:10:36,422
You need to finish this first.

163
00:10:39,966 --> 00:10:42,502
Park Seongyeol. Do Gi. You pass.

164
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:44,070
Thank you.

165
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:51,511
Hong Samnom.

166
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:53,146
Yes?

167
00:10:55,315 --> 00:10:57,216
Pass, Fail

168
00:10:57,806 --> 00:11:00,108
More than half is on "Pass", so you pass.

169
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:01,387
- Here.
- Pardon?

170
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:02,522
Take it.

171
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,191
Thank you.

172
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:07,961
There will be another examination later...

173
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:09,292
...for the rest of you. Wait outside.

174
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:13,299
Let's go.

175
00:11:15,201 --> 00:11:16,936
Are they trying to kill me or save me?

176
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,511
They're so quick. Too quick!

177
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:29,515
How did they know already?

178
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:33,219
I heard the Queen fainted,
so I rushed to the palace,

179
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:35,922
but she's pregnant.

180
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:41,227
We must wait
for Her Majesty to have a prince.

181
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:45,865
We can make that prince
the heir to the throne.

182
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,368
The Crown Prince got away with it

183
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,970
because there were no other princes.

184
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:54,540
Look at the things he does.

185
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,994
Dethroning him shall be easy.

186
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,953
There's a saying in chess.

187
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,049
What does it matter
if it's a pig or a cow?

188
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,084
It's the hand that moves those pieces.

189
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:08,187
This hand.

190
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:10,456
This hand is what matters.

191
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:12,534
But...

192
00:12:12,823 --> 00:12:15,326
What if the baby in her womb
is not a boy?

193
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,499
Even then, it is our optimal time...

194
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,602
...to tame the Crown Prince
until the baby is born.

195
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:32,979
This is Donggungjeon
where the Crown Prince resides.

196
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,382
Have you heard
the rumors about Donggungjeon?

197
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,918
- What rumors?
- Get lost!

198
00:12:44,706 --> 00:12:46,106
Goodness.

199
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,239
Master Sung! Are you all right?

200
00:12:51,554 --> 00:12:52,675
Your foot. Foot.

201
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:58,042
- I'm sorry.
- I said get lost!

202
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,310
Where are you going?

203
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:10,683
- Are you all right?
- Don't get yourself involved.

204
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,590
I'm fine.

205
00:13:12,018 --> 00:13:13,419
The rumors are true.

206
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:15,303
They say it's full of dung.

207
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,695
Dung.

208
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,626
If Master Sung is treated that way,

209
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:22,028
mere trainees like us would be...

210
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:25,131
If we make a mistake,
we may lose our lives.

211
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:29,002
However, how they treat us
is totally up to us.

212
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,438
Is here inside or outside of Donggungjeon?

213
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:33,840
- Outside...
- Outside...

214
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,045
- Do you find that funny?
- Isn't it?

215
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,113
Your Highness.

216
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:41,019
Your Highness.

217
00:13:41,748 --> 00:13:44,050
You can't kick out Eunuch Sung like that.

218
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,954
He came to inform you
of Her Majesty's pregnancy.

219
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:51,858
Your Highness.
Is it that difficult to say,

220
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:55,395
"Congratulations, Your Highness"?

221
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:58,298
- Just say...
- Silence.

222
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:00,466
Yes, Your Highness.

223
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:04,776
Your Highness.

224
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,302
Eight Years Earlier

225
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:41,708
How was it?

226
00:14:42,642 --> 00:14:45,044
When you did this with your fingers,

227
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:50,450
it sounded like a leaf
shaking in the spring breeze.

228
00:14:50,917 --> 00:14:54,153
That's right. It is called vibrato.

229
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:58,591
Would you like me
to teach you how to play?

230
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,159
Do you mean it?

231
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:05,365
But it must be a secret between us.

232
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:07,734
Yes, Mother.

233
00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:15,141
This is vibrato.

234
00:15:23,783 --> 00:15:25,885
Your Highness.

235
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:29,789
Ahh... Councilor Kim!

236
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,695
Are you here to see Her Majesty?

237
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:38,998
Yes. I received word
that she is pregnant,

238
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,367
so I came to congratulate her.

239
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:44,103
I see.

240
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,007
I should be wise and do these things now

241
00:15:49,275 --> 00:15:52,111
to avoid backlash in the future, right?

242
00:15:54,347 --> 00:15:55,381
Excuse me, then.

243
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:09,362
I almost forgot what you looked like.

244
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:13,366
You are always very handsome.

245
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,368
Are you that pleased to see me?

246
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:19,605
Every mother is always happy

247
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:21,574
to see her child.

248
00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:25,211
Such maternal love...

249
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,348
Don't you feel the same?

250
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:31,918
That's right.

251
00:16:33,186 --> 00:16:37,090
Look how happy she is.
Visit her often from now on.

252
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:41,761
May I really?

253
00:16:42,295 --> 00:16:43,329
Your Highness.

254
00:16:44,897 --> 00:16:49,102
It is basic etiquette
to greet your parents daily.

255
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:52,472
What is the meaning
behind asking if you may,

256
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,742
when you do not do something so basic?

257
00:16:55,942 --> 00:16:57,143
My Queen.

258
00:16:58,411 --> 00:16:59,746
What is it, Sire?

259
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:05,318
Is a mother five years older
than him not a mother?

260
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:09,589
I am saying this for your sake
and that of my sibling,

261
00:17:09,756 --> 00:17:11,224
so do not be angry.

262
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,326
What was that?

263
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:18,031
They say you should see
and hear only pretty things

264
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:20,633
when you are pregnant
to have a pretty baby.

265
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,038
Would seeing me often,

266
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,241
be good for the baby?

267
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:31,044
Think about it.

268
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:36,749
Imagine another troublemaker
like me in the palace.

269
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:40,787
That wouldn't be good.

270
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:42,455
Yeong.

271
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:48,061
Look. She looks displeased already.

272
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:53,066
I shouldn't show my face
until the baby is born.

273
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,668
You may go.

274
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,272
I will excuse myself.

275
00:17:59,906 --> 00:18:02,275
Your Majesties.

276
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:05,211
Please enjoy your time together.

277
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:24,597
Are they the new eunuch trainees?

278
00:18:24,731 --> 00:18:28,368
Yes. The written exam is being held today.

279
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,776
What happens if they fail the exam?

280
00:18:37,043 --> 00:18:41,714
They may be forced out of the palace
without becoming eunuchs.

281
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:45,190
- Is that right?
- Yes.

282
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,057
Where are you sneaking off to
with that bag?

283
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,763
You can't be fleeing
after achieving your dream.

284
00:19:00,566 --> 00:19:01,467
Eunuch Jang.

285
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:03,303
Yes, Your Highness.

286
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:10,743
Your Highness. People are watching.

287
00:19:14,147 --> 00:19:15,248
Your Highness.

288
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:32,665
If you do anything improper
or look suspicious,

289
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:35,506
you will be kicked out
of the palace immediately.

290
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:36,608
Yes.

291
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:40,039
Here. Begin.

292
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:47,280
I may appear to be just sitting here,
but I can see.

293
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:49,315
I can see everything.

294
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:54,387
If you get caught doing something silly...

295
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,401
Me?

296
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,375
Leave.

297
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,053
Three

298
00:20:31,925 --> 00:20:33,927
Three

299
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,030
Four

300
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:40,233
Three

301
00:20:43,736 --> 00:20:44,938
It is three.

302
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:48,241
What are you doing?

303
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,249
My goodness.

304
00:20:56,349 --> 00:20:58,885
How will you pass the exam like this?

305
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:01,688
You do know that if you fail once,

306
00:21:02,355 --> 00:21:03,890
you will be kicked out of the palace?

307
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:12,365
Were you a eunuch?

308
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,801
I'm sure you were dressed
as a palace guard.

309
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,569
You couldn't tell because it was dark.

310
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,404
Mark your answer.

311
00:21:19,405 --> 00:21:20,245
Three.

312
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:35,188
I couldn't ignore your lifelong dream
to be a eunuch.

313
00:21:35,722 --> 00:21:38,658
So don't worry and trust me.

314
00:22:15,762 --> 00:22:16,629
Mark again.

315
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:21,067
It's good now. Submit it.

316
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:32,478
Hong Sangnom

317
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:33,880
Pass!

318
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:36,082
Congratulations.

319
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:46,793
This is your final examination.

320
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,730
Each will take a sheet of questions.

321
00:22:51,898 --> 00:22:54,300
The King will judge
the answers on Royal Palace eunuchs.

322
00:22:54,497 --> 00:22:58,007
The Queen will judge the answers...

323
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:00,206
...on Central Palace eunuch trainees.

324
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:05,011
So then if they fail us, are we not able
to stay at the palace?

325
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:06,218
Naturally.

326
00:23:09,582 --> 00:23:10,650
Next.

327
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:16,923
If I submit a blank sheet,
I can leave the palace.

328
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:22,462
What strange question is this?

329
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:25,031
Let me see.

330
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:30,270
She lost her appetite, doesn't speak much.

331
00:23:30,637 --> 00:23:32,672
She can't sleep.
She cries, laughs and gets angry.

332
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:35,775
The royal physician can't figure it out.

333
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:40,380
I can't get kicked out because of this
after all I did to become a eunuch.

334
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:43,549
I know the answer to that question.

335
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:45,891
Do you mean it?

336
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:57,130
There is no woman like that.

337
00:23:57,497 --> 00:24:01,434
I don't know where she went,
but there was one.

338
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:05,271
Whether she's beautiful or hideous,

339
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:08,374
every woman wants to look pretty.

340
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:12,779
Especially in front
of a handsome man like you.

341
00:24:13,212 --> 00:24:15,415
Even if she wears armor or a man's attire,

342
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:18,918
I could easily recognize a woman's body.

343
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:25,325
What did you do
to make the high eunuchs hate you?

344
00:24:25,491 --> 00:24:29,095
That's where you will reside
for the time being.

345
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:34,968
Who lives there?

346
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:36,836
Nobody lives there.

347
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:16,142
Byeongyeon, are you inside?

348
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:33,793
Isn't he Puppy?

349
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:36,195
Do you know him?

350
00:25:43,603 --> 00:25:45,872
Here. That's enough.

351
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,848
Good job. You may leave now.

352
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:02,188
You say the most beautiful thing

353
00:26:02,488 --> 00:26:05,425
that inspires you artistically
is a woman's body.

354
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:07,927
But why can't you embrace them?

355
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,901
Do you have an unmentionable condition?

356
00:26:23,643 --> 00:26:24,978
Look at this candle.

357
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:29,249
It doesn't flutter as it does.

358
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:31,184
My heart.

359
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:36,756
My body doesn't go where my heart...

360
00:26:38,258 --> 00:26:39,459
...doesn't lead.

361
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:57,310
How was your trip?

362
00:26:58,912 --> 00:27:00,747
It was not bad.

363
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:03,249
I heard on my way in.

364
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:06,319
Her Majesty is pregnant.

365
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,922
Is everyone talking about it?

366
00:27:09,188 --> 00:27:12,825
Perhaps you should stop coming here
for a while.

367
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:16,229
Do you think I'll be safe...

368
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,898
...if I stay quiet?

369
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:30,276
This is no place for a eunuch trainee.

370
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,178
Return to your lodge.

371
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:35,014
There is no room for me there anyway,

372
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:36,916
thanks to somebody.

373
00:27:38,718 --> 00:27:41,020
You passed the exam,
thanks to that somebody.

374
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,525
You don't need to be so thankful.

375
00:27:48,027 --> 00:27:51,197
But who exactly are you?

376
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:53,598
Are you a palace guard or an eunuch?

377
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,201
You keep showing up everywhere.

378
00:27:56,836 --> 00:27:57,937
And who are you?

379
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,974
Are you a ghost who lives here?

380
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,018
How dare you try to touch him?

381
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:14,393
Pardon?

382
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,291
It's okay, Chief Kim.

383
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:24,864
Goodness.

384
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:42,221
Look here.

385
00:28:46,085 --> 00:28:48,788
Silver Spoon met a new lover...

386
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:51,024
...and is so happy now.

387
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:54,694
Our poor Master Jung...

388
00:28:55,895 --> 00:28:59,399
What's the best solution
for a disobedient puppy?

389
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:01,301
I need more drinks.

390
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:03,636
- Strict training...
- Right?

391
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:05,050
Like this.

392
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:12,211
Roll to the left. To the right.

393
00:29:12,912 --> 00:29:15,114
Sit. Stand!

394
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:17,517
Bark!

395
00:29:17,817 --> 00:29:19,352
This is how you do it.

396
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:24,824
If you fail any,
you will be kicked out of the palace.

397
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:29,162
That's right.
I'm leaving the palace anyway.

398
00:29:29,295 --> 00:29:31,731
Why should I refrain myself?

399
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:51,217
Are you coming home now? You are late.

400
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:52,986
Yes, Grandfather.

401
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,121
Sit.

402
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,240
Yunseong.

403
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:12,438
Is your position so low and demeaning

404
00:30:13,072 --> 00:30:14,774
that it has made life boring?

405
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,376
It's not true.

406
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:19,590
"A man who is complacent
with a minor position,"

407
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,054
"will never amount to nothing."

408
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:24,517
That is what you've taught me.

409
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:26,653
That's right, I did.

410
00:30:27,654 --> 00:30:29,656
You must climb little by little

411
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:33,560
so you'll not waver
when you're at the top.

412
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:35,495
Do you remember that?

413
00:30:36,596 --> 00:30:39,365
Yes, Grandfather.
I always keep that in mind.

414
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,369
I've painted a grand picture
with you in mind.

415
00:30:44,203 --> 00:30:45,805
That is why I said it.

416
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:49,108
However,

417
00:30:50,209 --> 00:30:51,678
for what exactly...

418
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:53,780
...are you painting your picture?

419
00:30:55,915 --> 00:30:56,916
Fame and prestige?

420
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,585
For family power?

421
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:00,386
For the future of this nation?

422
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,125
I asked what you are painting for.

423
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:09,329
I just...

424
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:13,032
...paint for it to be a painting.

425
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,869
Does painting prostitutes
bring you comfort,

426
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:19,339
or pleasure in your tedious, empty life?

427
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:30,350
Forget it.

428
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:34,354
How could a cub without claws,

429
00:31:34,821 --> 00:31:36,256
grow to be a king?

430
00:31:38,258 --> 00:31:42,562
Let me know
if you want to paint in the future.

431
00:31:43,129 --> 00:31:47,267
I will fill this room
with prostitutes as you wish.

432
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:54,941
The paintings look nice.

433
00:31:55,275 --> 00:31:56,342
Very nice.

434
00:32:03,449 --> 00:32:05,451
Your Highness, it is time for bed.

435
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,958
Your Highness. Are you injured?

436
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,259
I was bit by a dog.

437
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,128
Why that...

438
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:20,248
Where and how did you see a mad dog
that dared to hurt your finger?

439
00:32:25,718 --> 00:32:27,206
Tell me about it...

440
00:32:27,907 --> 00:32:30,209
Where and how did I meet someone like that,

441
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:32,412
who dared to hurt me?

442
00:32:38,117 --> 00:32:39,986
Where did Silver Spoon go?

443
00:32:40,186 --> 00:32:41,833
Did he go home?

444
00:32:41,924 --> 00:32:43,489
Why aren't you going...

445
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:49,028
It's best you don't know
who he is or where he went.

446
00:32:49,662 --> 00:32:50,502
Why?

447
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,294
Office of Eunuch Discipline

448
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,355
Are you sure this is correct?

449
00:33:17,257 --> 00:33:20,093
Just trust me on this one.

450
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:28,161
Hong Samnom!

451
00:33:29,235 --> 00:33:30,075
Yes?

452
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:31,722
Are you submitting a blank sheet?

453
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,003
You'll be kicked out.

454
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,144
Are you sure you won't regret?

455
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:40,619
Yes.

456
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:44,450
I couldn't find the answer.

457
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:48,655
You may go.

458
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:56,496
You should've guessed something.

459
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:58,431
Why did you submit a blank sheet?

460
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:01,701
It's too late now.

461
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,007
They left on the dot.

462
00:34:08,308 --> 00:34:09,175
You. Trainees.

463
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,477
Come here.

464
00:34:11,611 --> 00:34:15,815
You will come with me
to Councilor Kim's feast.

465
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,423
Didn't the Minister of War
come to the palace today?

466
00:34:24,657 --> 00:34:27,527
Sire, I had already told you
that he requested a postponement

467
00:34:27,694 --> 00:34:31,164
of his audience with Your Majesty
due to his illness...

468
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:36,803
You did. I asked just in case.

469
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:40,673
The palace is so quiet.

470
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:45,445
I feel like I hear the music
from Councilor Kim's feast.

471
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:52,452
Send him plenty of food and wine.

472
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:56,990
It is a feast to celebrate the Queen

473
00:34:57,824 --> 00:34:59,392
bearing my child.

474
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:10,161
- Byeongyeon.
- Yes, Your Highness.

475
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:13,406
Shall we go to a feast?

476
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:16,776
What should we do here?

477
00:35:16,876 --> 00:35:19,345
Right. You help cook jeons.

478
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:22,916
You go help them cook over there. Go on.

479
00:35:23,183 --> 00:35:26,052
- Master Sung, you're here.
- Thank you for your work.

480
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:29,022
We need you to help cook chicken, too.

481
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:31,291
Good. We have one person left.

482
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:32,725
You handle it.

483
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:37,063
Go around and you'll find a door
to the mountain.

484
00:35:37,597 --> 00:35:38,598
Yes, Master.

485
00:35:40,533 --> 00:35:44,037
Is the chicken coop up the mountain?

486
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:47,140
You'll see when you get there.

487
00:35:47,807 --> 00:35:50,844
Go on and get 20 of them.

488
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,145
Did you say 20?

489
00:35:53,313 --> 00:35:55,715
How do I catch all of them?

490
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:58,818
Use whatever means you like.

491
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:02,121
You'll be punished
if you don't come back in an hour.

492
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:03,371
Off you go now.

493
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,454
Please follow me.

494
00:36:06,212 --> 00:36:07,737
Master Sung.

495
00:36:08,394 --> 00:36:11,581
Our master wouldn't want
to cook those chickens.

496
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,767
He wouldn't be able to catch them.

497
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:19,572
I just want to teach him
a lesson since he's rude.

498
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:21,207
Yes, Master.

499
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:50,170
Oh my goodness.

500
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:51,504
Congratulations.

501
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:55,108
- Congratulations.
- This is for you.

502
00:36:55,275 --> 00:36:56,509
- Congratulations.
- Please take this.

503
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:59,712
- Master.
- Master, look at this.

504
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:56,970
I'm tired of this.
I'd rather be struck by lightning.

505
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:57,831
My wish came true after all.

506
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,507
Your Highness.

507
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:10,443
These are the exam papers of the trainees.

508
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:15,515
The eunuchs from each palace
chose the questions

509
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:18,618
about what they consider to be
the most important matter.

510
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:23,957
You read them and pass them
if they're not so bad.

511
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:27,927
Are you sure you don't have to check them?

512
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:33,533
Bring them to me.

513
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:46,880
I can't believe this. How dare he?

514
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,490
It really seems like...

515
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:02,495
You're right.
I'm the one that tried to disguise.

516
00:40:03,496 --> 00:40:04,697
I'm not talking about that.

517
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:10,103
What else is there to talk about?

518
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:29,189
Are you really a eunuch?

519
00:40:31,524 --> 00:40:33,726
Of course, I am.

520
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:35,728
Is there such a thing as a fake eunuch?

521
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:37,879
Did you really...

522
00:40:39,316 --> 00:40:40,559
...become a eunuch?

523
00:40:42,876 --> 00:40:47,640
You seem to look down on eunuchs
just because we have a missing part.

524
00:40:48,241 --> 00:40:51,878
Are you trying to say
a eunuch is not even a man?

525
00:40:52,479 --> 00:40:53,680
That's not what I meant.

526
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:57,617
Then do you mean
I don't deserve to be a eunuch,

527
00:40:57,784 --> 00:41:00,787
because I'm wanted
by the gangs and the royal army?

528
00:41:01,321 --> 00:41:02,161
No.

529
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:04,123
Then why do you keep staring at me?

530
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:12,832
There's no eunuch as pretty as you.

531
00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:19,138
Then again, nothing's wrong
with a man looking pretty.

532
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:21,174
That's all I'm saying.

533
00:41:30,316 --> 00:41:33,019
He must be exhausted by now.

534
00:41:36,923 --> 00:41:38,992
He actually caught 20 chickens.

535
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:40,627
He caught such valuable chickens.

536
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,195
- I can't believe this!
- My goodness.

537
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:45,231
They actually caught
the valuable chickens.

538
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:48,902
Are you out of your mind?

539
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:57,777
- Let's have a toast.
- Let's do that.

540
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:05,451
Look how happy they are.

541
00:42:05,652 --> 00:42:08,154
You need to drink when you feel happy.

542
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:10,089
They're not happy because they're drunk.

543
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,260
They're happy because
they've become your people now.

544
00:42:16,616 --> 00:42:19,399
Those who couldn't pass the gate
made a line

545
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,969
that's as long as 4km.
They should be happy.

546
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:29,008
Even a flying bird wouldn't rest
on a sick tree.

547
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:32,679
Are you talking about
the sick tree in the palace?

548
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:46,793
Listen, everyone.

549
00:42:48,027 --> 00:42:51,965
I hope you enjoy yourselves
under the beautiful tree.

550
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,435
Let's have a toast.

551
00:43:15,455 --> 00:43:16,856
My goodness!

552
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:22,595
What are you waiting for? Go catch him!

553
00:43:22,662 --> 00:43:23,502
Yes!

554
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:55,862
Put away your swords.
This is the Crown Prince.

555
00:43:58,832 --> 00:44:03,169
Put away your swords
and greet His Highness.

556
00:44:08,174 --> 00:44:09,175
There he is!

557
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:31,464
Your Highness.

558
00:44:32,532 --> 00:44:35,301
What brought you out of the palace?

559
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:38,371
I can't miss any feast
with drinks and music.

560
00:44:40,707 --> 00:44:44,577
The Queen's baby is my younger sibling.

561
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:49,816
Is it weird that
I want to celebrate it with you?

562
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:53,086
Thank you, Your Highness.

563
00:44:54,654 --> 00:44:58,057
Why are you all so serious,
when you're having a feast?

564
00:44:58,458 --> 00:45:01,728
We had an unwelcome visitor
who caused a commotion.

565
00:45:16,576 --> 00:45:18,578
"There are virtuous beings."

566
00:45:19,445 --> 00:45:20,947
"I speak of our courtiers."

567
00:45:22,961 --> 00:45:25,264
"The people have committed no sin."

568
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:28,454
"Poverty being the only crime."

569
00:45:31,191 --> 00:45:34,394
"As courtiers squeeze the people."

570
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:36,726
"Their poverty finds its source"

571
00:45:38,397 --> 00:45:40,466
"In the courtiers themselves."

572
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,064
Is this true?

573
00:45:49,156 --> 00:45:50,639
What do you think, everyone?

574
00:45:52,956 --> 00:45:54,739
Ehh... Really.

575
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:58,086
How can we blame poverty
on the courtiers?

576
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,219
The King who couldn't
control the courtiers

577
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:02,699
is to blame.

578
00:46:10,897 --> 00:46:12,398
It was just a joke.

579
00:46:12,565 --> 00:46:14,367
You all look so serious.

580
00:46:15,802 --> 00:46:19,439
Now, let's celebrate
the Queen's pregnancy.

581
00:46:20,451 --> 00:46:23,487
Would you pour me a glass?

582
00:46:32,927 --> 00:46:34,029
Your Highness.

583
00:46:37,126 --> 00:46:40,496
May I pour you a glass of wine?

584
00:46:49,736 --> 00:46:51,104
What was that commotion about?

585
00:46:51,195 --> 00:46:53,139
An arrow flew into the feast table,

586
00:46:53,406 --> 00:46:55,441
and the Crown Prince showed up.

587
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:56,810
Where?

588
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:58,611
Where is he?

589
00:47:05,218 --> 00:47:07,854
- What are you doing not working?
- I'm sorry.

590
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:13,927
It's been a while.

591
00:47:14,427 --> 00:47:18,164
I should've visited you
when I was back from the Qing.

592
00:47:19,032 --> 00:47:20,133
You didn't have to.

593
00:47:21,868 --> 00:47:24,237
You and I are not that close.

594
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,974
You are still a bad liar.

595
00:47:29,442 --> 00:47:32,846
And you are still cold toward me.

596
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:36,983
Does that bother you?

597
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:39,439
I can't say it doesn't.

598
00:47:40,653 --> 00:47:42,255
- You were my...
- I was your friend.

599
00:48:00,507 --> 00:48:03,376
Would you like me
to pour you a glass, too?

600
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,881
Why?

601
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:10,682
You don't want it
because I'm not your friend anymore?

602
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:16,022
I never drink
while I'm guarding the Crown Prince.

603
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:19,192
I understand.

604
00:48:20,226 --> 00:48:22,595
You're still a loyal servant
of His Highness,

605
00:48:24,898 --> 00:48:25,999
and also his close friend.

606
00:48:40,713 --> 00:48:43,316
He'd make a better crown prince
than the current one.

607
00:48:45,017 --> 00:48:46,852
The only thing Yunseong falls short in,

608
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:51,057
is the fact that he was born
in the Kim family.

609
00:48:59,966 --> 00:49:01,834
Eight Years Earlier

610
00:49:11,244 --> 00:49:12,579
- Did you see him?
- Yes.

611
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:17,050
I took a careful look
at the Crown Prince's face.

612
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,252
How do you think his future will be?

613
00:49:20,954 --> 00:49:24,090
He may seem weak-hearted
because of his meek looks,

614
00:49:24,457 --> 00:49:28,428
but he's actually
very bold and competitive.

615
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:33,366
I could read the charisma
of a royal family member.

616
00:49:35,001 --> 00:49:36,302
However,

617
00:49:36,769 --> 00:49:39,205
there's this one thing...

618
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:42,509
What is it? You can tell me.

619
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,811
Actually,

620
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,514
he's destined to die young.

621
00:49:49,315 --> 00:49:52,652
I also felt an uncommon energy,

622
00:49:52,785 --> 00:49:54,854
from one of his friends.

623
00:49:55,822 --> 00:49:59,492
He seemed warm-hearted
and brave like a great man.

624
00:50:00,226 --> 00:50:03,429
He has the face of someone
who will be a great king.

625
00:50:05,532 --> 00:50:07,233
He was wearing
a headgear embroidered with a crane.

626
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:12,605
Stop it. That's absolutely absurd.

627
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,076
I couldn't tell you a lie.

628
00:50:19,112 --> 00:50:21,514
I'll pretend I didn't hear this.

629
00:50:22,415 --> 00:50:25,151
Tell no one what you just told me.

630
00:50:25,285 --> 00:50:27,720
Or else, you'll lose your life.
Do you understand?

631
00:50:28,321 --> 00:50:31,057
Yes, my lord.
I won't tell anyone about it.

632
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:33,092
I'll do as you command.

633
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:41,589
Yunseong.

634
00:50:42,635 --> 00:50:43,636
Grandfather.

635
00:50:56,249 --> 00:50:59,486
He has the face of someone
who will be a great king.

636
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,367
It was the perfect timing.

637
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:18,371
The Crown Prince shows right
when the arrow was shot.

638
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,375
Stop looking at me. I command you.

639
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:27,875
Yes, Your Highness.

640
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,102
The man who shot the arrow.

641
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:34,708
He was wearing a mask, wasn't he?

642
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:37,262
Did you see him?

643
00:51:40,093 --> 00:51:41,327
Who could that be?

644
00:51:53,907 --> 00:51:54,874
Look.

645
00:51:55,575 --> 00:51:56,415
Do you know what it is?

646
00:51:58,211 --> 00:52:00,013
It's a rare chicken
from Councilor Kim's house.

647
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:02,015
Councilor Kim?

648
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:04,551
Put it away.

649
00:52:05,118 --> 00:52:09,122
You still don't know
how to appreciate a gift.

650
00:52:10,723 --> 00:52:12,725
This is the last gift
I can give you in this palace.

651
00:52:14,294 --> 00:52:15,134
What?

652
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:20,433
It seems you're upset about something.

653
00:52:21,935 --> 00:52:23,670
Here. If you're hungry when you're upset,

654
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,239
you'd feel even more miserable.

655
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:29,675
Do you feel miserable when you're hungry?

656
00:52:30,877 --> 00:52:33,379
Not everyone feels the same as you.

657
00:52:34,481 --> 00:52:37,450
Don't think everyone else
would be like you.

658
00:52:39,953 --> 00:52:41,254
I've never been hungry before.

659
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:48,161
Maybe you've never been hungry before,

660
00:52:49,262 --> 00:52:51,297
but you must have been heartbroken
many times.

661
00:52:52,365 --> 00:52:53,205
What?

662
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:57,070
It's easy to help those who are hungry.

663
00:52:57,937 --> 00:53:02,575
But it's hard to console
those who are heartbroken,

664
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:07,313
because they tend to lie,
saying that they're fine.

665
00:53:09,682 --> 00:53:10,683
That's enough.

666
00:53:12,285 --> 00:53:16,389
How about sharing affection
with someone rich in heart?

667
00:53:18,224 --> 00:53:19,064
Here.

668
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:23,096
The richest person in heart
across the country is me.

669
00:53:23,556 --> 00:53:25,832
And I give you this,

670
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:27,467
as a piece of affection.

671
00:53:39,345 --> 00:53:42,315
You have no appetite,
but it's not because of food.

672
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:46,352
You feel weak,
but it's not because of an illness.

673
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,523
There's no cure for lovesickness.

674
00:53:51,224 --> 00:53:53,960
This isn't the time
to overcome the feelings,

675
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,163
but to endure them.

676
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:00,867
Instead of thinking
you loved someone you can't have,

677
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:03,736
try to think that you made good memories

678
00:54:04,137 --> 00:54:06,239
that you can cherish for a long time.

679
00:54:06,873 --> 00:54:09,242
It wasn't loving someone I can't have,

680
00:54:11,277 --> 00:54:13,346
but making good memories
that I can cherish for long.

681
00:54:17,383 --> 00:54:21,387
He said something like this, too.

682
00:54:56,055 --> 00:54:57,056
Is anyone out there?

683
00:55:01,528 --> 00:55:05,498
Oh, right. I saw the Crown Prince earlier.

684
00:55:06,232 --> 00:55:07,333
- What?
- What?

685
00:55:08,902 --> 00:55:10,103
You saw the Crown Prince?

686
00:55:13,606 --> 00:55:16,209
Not the face. Just the back of his head.

687
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:25,051
Do you know
what the Crown Prince's nickname is?

688
00:55:26,152 --> 00:55:28,955
What is it?

689
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:32,459
- Pretty Prince?
- Prince Dung.

690
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,296
See? Everyone does know.

691
00:55:37,764 --> 00:55:39,933
- What about the other one?
- Half-breed.

692
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:41,868
That's right.

693
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:45,104
They say that
half of the Crown Prince's blood

694
00:55:45,205 --> 00:55:47,073
is that of a beast
and the other half human.

695
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,643
And he doesn't know
when he should or shouldn't bark

696
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:52,979
- like a mad dog...
- Shut it! Eat this.

697
00:55:56,549 --> 00:56:01,254
- Is he really that bad-tempered?
- I said to stop.

698
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,059
Did you just laugh?

699
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:10,864
I thought he had a problem
with his facial expressions.

700
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:15,135
- I did not laugh.
- I saw it, too.

701
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:18,605
You must find
the Crown Prince's nicknames funny.

702
00:56:22,742 --> 00:56:24,143
He must have something
stuck in his throat.

703
00:56:24,244 --> 00:56:25,745
What's wrong?

704
00:56:26,112 --> 00:56:29,015
So how was the back
of the Crown Prince's head?

705
00:56:29,106 --> 00:56:31,117
It was quite a sight.

706
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:42,228
"Hong Samnom. You've failed."

707
00:56:43,696 --> 00:56:45,465
"Yes, Master Sung."

708
00:56:49,035 --> 00:56:50,403
Are you Hong Samnom?

709
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:05,318
Did you really write this?

710
00:57:16,663 --> 00:57:17,503
Yes.

711
00:57:19,265 --> 00:57:20,567
Then...

712
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:24,637
Did you write this, too?

713
00:57:29,075 --> 00:57:31,945
This... This is...

714
00:57:36,783 --> 00:57:38,084
How dare you mock me,

715
00:57:38,685 --> 00:57:41,321
by writing a love letter
on another man's behalf?

716
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:45,125
How dare someone like you...

717
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:48,828
How dare you mock me, the Princess?

718
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:52,438
Pardon?

719
00:57:55,535 --> 00:57:56,970
The Princess?

720
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:07,113
I've committed a mortal sin!

721
00:58:08,815 --> 00:58:10,216
So you know.

722
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:16,489
Your Highness.

723
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:22,662
I will kill you as you requested.

724
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:29,035
Stop.

725
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:57,230
Your Highness!

726
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,811
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

727
00:59:42,241 --> 00:59:44,768
Do you know what I am most grateful
to you for?

728
00:59:44,859 --> 00:59:45,994
For pretending not to know.

729
00:59:48,128 --> 00:59:49,230
Isn't it?

730
00:59:50,049 --> 00:59:53,186
- You are not qualified to be the king.
- No!

731
00:59:53,787 --> 00:59:56,623
What are you so afraid of
that you cannot do anything?

732
00:59:56,856 --> 00:59:59,259
You should've done something!

733
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,395
Shut it and take what you are given.

734
01:00:06,232 --> 01:00:09,335
The Crown Prince
shall take the throne in the interim.

735
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:13,373
It cannot be done, Your Majesty.
