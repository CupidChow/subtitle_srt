1
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,832
Master Han.

2
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,852
What brought you here?

3
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:25,025
I have spent a long time
trying to find you.

4
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,626
Pardon?

5
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:29,729
Me?

6
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,268
I have something to tell you.

7
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:38,358
Raon.

8
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,582
How do you know my name?

9
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,089
How do you know that name?

10
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,432
Hong Raon.

11
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,422
Your Highness.

12
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,028
She may not remember,

13
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:39,766
but we have met when she was a child.

14
00:01:58,818 --> 00:01:59,986
I was shocked to see you

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,522
where I did not expect you.

16
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,128
The same goes for me, Your Highness.

17
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,135
How did you know her as a child

18
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,583
to make you search for her
so desperately?

19
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:27,689
I owe Eunuch Hong's mother a big debt.

20
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,404
I wanted to stay close

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,755
and take care of them to repay my debt,

22
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:41,695
but we parted so suddenly
that I lost touch with them.

23
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,701
You met her before she lost her mother.

24
00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:51,585
Then...

25
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,408
You know already?

26
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,680
Do you mean...

27
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:03,059
...the fact that she cannot be a eunuch?

28
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,824
You can finally repay that debt.

29
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,491
Please,

30
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:19,419
look out for her
as the chief eunuch in the palace.

31
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,538
Yes, Your Highness.

32
00:03:26,883 --> 00:03:29,285
I will do as you request.

33
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,216
Master Han.

34
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,655
I am sure you have many questions.

35
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,790
I will call for you,

36
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:45,894
so be patient.

37
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:09,749
CHAPTER 11 A Promise

38
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,325
I will ask Master Jeong to set
another date to meet.

39
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,427
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,447
But what is Master Jeong like?

41
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,403
There is much to learn from him.

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,041
Except for one thing.

43
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,841
His drinking habits.

44
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,578
What is he like when he drinks?

45
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,117
He befriends every creature
and talks to them.

46
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,357
I know someone like that.

47
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,026
My grandfather.

48
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:58,465
Whenever he drank,
every person in town...

49
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,535
No, even the dogs used to avoid him.

50
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:13,947
Raon.

51
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,909
Are you having fun?

52
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:48,948
It comes from my heart.

53
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,954
This comes from your heart?

54
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:02,462
I have always wanted to mark you as mine.

55
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,764
Just like that.

56
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,887
By any chance,

57
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,390
did you hide your identity

58
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,660
so you could punish the traitors?

59
00:06:34,445 --> 00:06:36,747
I have never worried about you.

60
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,436
You know very well

61
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:46,696
who destroyed and massacred your family.

62
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,611
For several decades,

63
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:58,418
I have served three kings
from the closest proximity.

64
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:02,037
Each time they took the throne,

65
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:04,618
they began with small expectations

66
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,880
that always ended up
with anger and despair.

67
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:17,237
Joseon under
the Lee Family is hopeless now.

68
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:22,202
Then...

69
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:24,607
What must we do...

70
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,913
...to create hope?

71
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,753
Is it another riot?

72
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:38,636
That is merely a means.

73
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:42,515
How could a riot create hope?

74
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:51,404
Does that child
remember nothing about the riot...

75
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,617
...from 10 years ago?

76
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,984
No, she does not seem
to remember a thing.

77
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,496
What kind of nation is a good nation?

78
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,353
The King, who worries the most
about the people,

79
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,013
would know the best.

80
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:41,228
It is impossible.

81
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,925
Even an adult's legs would break.

82
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:46,850
How could a child withstand it?

83
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:49,756
She is a criminal that deserves it.

84
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:52,116
She insulted the Royal Family.

85
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,467
She cannot be forgiven
because of her youth.

86
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:59,726
Then bring me
conclusive evidence of her guilt.

87
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:01,753
I plan to interrogate her

88
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:04,276
in order to obtain that evidence,
Your Highness.

89
00:09:07,025 --> 00:09:10,662
They say a small flame burns down fields.

90
00:09:11,247 --> 00:09:14,965
We cannot ignore a small flame
that may cause

91
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:17,116
a bigger fire, Your Highness.

92
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,308
I will not hear it.

93
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:22,388
If a 10-year-old learned to be a spy
before learning how to write,

94
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:27,514
the ones who should be punished
are you and I.

95
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:31,813
Release her at once.

96
00:09:32,336 --> 00:09:34,972
Please understand, Your Highness.

97
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,986
What? What is it?

98
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,805
How could this...

99
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,677
Call the royal physician.

100
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,545
Now!

101
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,753
Where are you rushing to?

102
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,223
Hold on.

103
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,393
What is going on?

104
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:31,431
They found poison in His Majesty's food.

105
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:32,832
What?

106
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,236
What about His Majesty?

107
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,638
Luckily, he is fine.

108
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,811
This is bad.

109
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:47,414
The Office of Eunuch Attendants
will be a wreck again.

110
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:59,559
Did you bring everyone
who entered the Royal Kitchen?

111
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,594
Yes.

112
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,646
But they say there was
a non-palace worker.

113
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:07,074
A non-palace worker in the palace.

114
00:11:08,486 --> 00:11:09,587
Who was that?

115
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:10,644
It was the person,

116
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,707
who brought the ingredients for the food.

117
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,016
When we searched for him,
he had disappeared.

118
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,547
Who is he?

119
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:26,153
He is the father of the child
we found with the flyers.

120
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,668
What?

121
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:52,901
Your Highness, you cannot run
without eating. You will faint.

122
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:54,581
Silence.

123
00:11:54,648 --> 00:11:57,317
It is harder to maintain weight
than to lose it.

124
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,487
Do not follow me.
You just get in the way.

125
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:37,152
Who are you?

126
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,694
Your Highness... The truth is...

127
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,796
- I...
- Get away from me!

128
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,932
- I will call the guards!
- No... Please... Look...

129
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,234
Please... I...

130
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,605
What are you doing?
Guards! Is anyone there?

131
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,738
- Are you all right?
- How dare you?

132
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,141
Are you truly all right?

133
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,152
If I see you again,
I will not forgive you.

134
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,440
That is correct.

135
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,309
It is the child that we released

136
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,477
upon your order.

137
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,852
I came with my father who decorates bags.

138
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,457
Are you saying that the father and child

139
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,935
fled from the palace?

140
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,629
That is correct.

141
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:31,771
Your Highness.

142
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,574
He tried to murder the King.

143
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:40,098
Please give the order
to seize and punish them.

144
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,239
They finished searching
the eunuchs' quarters,

145
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,568
- so why...
- One lives here, too.

146
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,094
The strange one.

147
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,570
Be quiet and search.

148
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,941
Here.

149
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,319
What is this?

150
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,457
I am speechless.

151
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:26,426
Your Majesty.

152
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,296
You must be concerned.

153
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,299
Anyone can make a mistake

154
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,334
when there is much suspicion or doubt.

155
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,371
I am glad you caught the culprit.

156
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,807
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:46,713
However, considering
the Crown Prince's temper,

158
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,316
this is just the beginning.

159
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,354
What should I do?

160
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,852
I understand he is old enough
to be a king,

161
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,027
but repetitive errors must be curtailed.

162
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,332
Please rush the Crown Prince's wedding

163
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,801
in order to calm the people.

164
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,040
But the Crown Prince
does not wish to wed...

165
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:17,677
What went well by following
the Crown Prince's will?

166
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,151
I requested a list of eligible maidens
for the Crown Prince to wed.

167
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:34,728
I shall relieve you of your concerns.

168
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:53,346
Mother,

169
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,982
what kind of king
would you like me to be?

170
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:02,822
I wish you'd be a king with good eyes.

171
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,758
Good eyes?

172
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,294
If you are too high up,

173
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,297
you tend not to see people below you.

174
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,732
What else?

175
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,670
I wish you have good ears.

176
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,140
You must not listen only to
those who yell before you.

177
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,878
Do not judge by status,
take care of the people,

178
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,646
listen to your servants,

179
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,150
and discern between flattery
and counsel. Is that it?

180
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:36,890
Please protect everyone as if
they were your only people.

181
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,965
Will you promise me

182
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,701
to become a king like that?

183
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,238
I promise, Mother.

184
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,451
Raon.

185
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,092
Is what I see the truth?

186
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,428
Whom should I believe?

187
00:18:17,749 --> 00:18:20,718
What if what I thought
was right is wrong?

188
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:26,761
What do you do
when everything is difficult?

189
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:36,290
Your Highness.

190
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:42,162
My grandfather used to say,

191
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:47,649
when the heart is sad,
you doubt everything.

192
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:52,623
When the heart is sad,

193
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,612
you doubt everything.

194
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:06,463
Then,

195
00:19:07,507 --> 00:19:08,675
I need you.

196
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:14,927
Reduce my suspicions with enjoyment.

197
00:19:27,422 --> 00:19:28,723
Will that do, Your Highness?

198
00:19:31,664 --> 00:19:32,665
Yes,

199
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,429
I am filled with Raon.

200
00:19:51,918 --> 00:19:53,786
If the Crown Prince gets married,

201
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:55,116
there will be a temporary ban
on marriages

202
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:58,443
and our children's marriage
will be delayed.

203
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,333
Yes.

204
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,838
I didn't know His Majesty would rush
the Crown Prince's marriage so.

205
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:10,869
The bride has already been decided,
so the selection should be quick.

206
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:16,374
Are you saying
there is someone betrothed?

207
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,574
If not someone from the Kim Family,

208
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,569
what family could manage that position?

209
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,888
I heard His Majesty called for you
a few days ago.

210
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,420
Yes.

211
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:38,795
I felt bad toward you because of it.

212
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,741
There is no need.

213
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,843
Make yourself comfortable.

214
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,314
I told you before, did I not?

215
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,518
Do not make it complicated.

216
00:20:52,223 --> 00:20:53,824
Either take my hand,

217
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:56,234
or stand against me.

218
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,532
Those are your two options.

219
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,073
What could this mean?

220
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:16,042
I cannot figure it out either.

221
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,612
It is driving me crazy.

222
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,074
It could not be,

223
00:21:22,523 --> 00:21:25,259
though he may be prettier than a girl.

224
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,950
If I am curious,

225
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,801
all I need to do is check for myself.

226
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:36,948
The Crown Prince will not stand for it.

227
00:21:37,682 --> 00:21:39,617
Of course, he will not.

228
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:46,373
That makes it more enticing.

229
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,451
It's a crucial, as they're preparing
His Highness' wedding.

230
00:22:06,963 --> 00:22:07,964
Eunuch Hong.

231
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:12,905
Is something wrong?

232
00:22:15,474 --> 00:22:19,111
Eunuch Do, I hear
you know much about poisons.

233
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:20,378
Is it true?

234
00:22:21,061 --> 00:22:24,498
No, I just learned a little by watching.

235
00:22:27,728 --> 00:22:29,596
What is it? Tell me.

236
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:35,747
You heard there was poison
in the King's food.

237
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,559
They gave the food to the animals,

238
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,641
and not one of them died.

239
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,866
And the silver chopsticks turned black?

240
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:01,414
This is not just the water.

241
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,833
You get it from boiling honey locust.

242
00:23:24,498 --> 00:23:26,200
Silver that has been blackened
from poison

243
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,951
cannot be cleaned even with this water.

244
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,077
This is not poison.

245
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:37,217
Then why did it change color?

246
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,557
We need to find out.

247
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,141
Medicine

248
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,080
Poison?

249
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,857
Is the King safe?

250
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,916
He is struggling more since
it happened after the flyer incident.

251
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,795
When will you grant my request

252
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:41,660
and return to the Royal Court?

253
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:45,597
I apologize, Your Highness.

254
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:49,704
I am busy healing people with
my acupuncture skills.

255
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,817
The palace is filled
with better physicians.

256
00:24:54,336 --> 00:24:55,537
I do not need a physician.

257
00:24:56,505 --> 00:24:58,507
I need you to save an innocent child.

258
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:02,444
"Do not give up on a single person."

259
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:04,995
Do you remember what you said to me?

260
00:25:06,685 --> 00:25:08,053
I need your help.

261
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:22,555
I called you here because we found
something interesting at your place.

262
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:25,550
Pardon?

263
00:25:45,025 --> 00:25:45,892
This is...

264
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,685
What? Will you claim it is not yours?

265
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:57,690
Fine.

266
00:25:58,873 --> 00:26:00,308
I do not need an answer.

267
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,038
I can check with my own eyes.

268
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:11,760
Strip him.

269
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:18,117
Your Highness.

270
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:54,655
Your Highness, did you come out
for a walk?

271
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:57,711
You are fearless.

272
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,736
Please forgive my rudeness.

273
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,923
If I bothered you...

274
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,925
I mean because you are here alone
at this hour.

275
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,212
I learned that I am bold and courageous,

276
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,406
thanks to you, Your Highness.

277
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:23,918
Your Highness,

278
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:27,725
may I ask you one thing?

279
00:27:33,497 --> 00:27:36,800
Do you dislike me because
I was rude when we first met?

280
00:27:37,624 --> 00:27:41,995
Do you find me boring because
I showed you how I feel?

281
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,340
There is a maiden whom I like.

282
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:01,248
I am saying it is not your fault.

283
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:03,883
Does that answer your question?

284
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:10,690
What kind of maiden is she?

285
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,296
Your Highness. This is bad.

286
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:17,397
Eunuch Hong...

287
00:28:18,164 --> 00:28:19,165
What is it?

288
00:28:20,622 --> 00:28:22,100
Eunuch Hong...

289
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,738
I asked what is it?

290
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:27,407
Please head to Junggungjeon.

291
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:30,277
Please hurry.

292
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,422
Your Highness, the Crown Prince
is here to see you.

293
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,974
Welcome, Your Highness.

294
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,514
What is it this time

295
00:29:08,715 --> 00:29:10,584
that you summoned a eunuch
from Donggungjeon?

296
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:20,924
This trainee.

297
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:24,130
It is such a waste

298
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:28,568
that this pretty face belongs to a boy.

299
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,195
What do you think?

300
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,571
Remove your hand.

301
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:59,466
How could you not be drawn
to a face this pretty?

302
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:02,335
He is more feminine than any girl.

303
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,838
Of course, you are confused.

304
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:06,973
But...

305
00:30:07,745 --> 00:30:10,581
While we were searching everyone's room,

306
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,346
we found this among his belongings.

307
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:28,028
I know you've been struggling
because of odd rumors.

308
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:31,298
As your mother,
I will wash away all doubts

309
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:35,368
in front of everyone right now.

310
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,407
If you wish.

311
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:52,619
Why did you have a woman's dress?

312
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:57,390
Well...

313
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:00,594
The thing is...

314
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:02,729
I...

315
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,699
I said you do not have to answer
if you cannot.

316
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:11,705
I said to shut your mouth
and take off that eunuch's robe!

317
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:19,913
Eunuch Hong!

318
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,918
Do as the Queen orders.

319
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,799
You summon a mere eunuch.

320
00:31:41,761 --> 00:31:44,704
You even molest him
and tell him to disrobe.

321
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,975
How long will you toy
with the palace workers

322
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,343
with those silly rumors?

323
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:53,980
Please show

324
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:57,350
who is correct right now.

325
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:01,621
If anyone is at fault,

326
00:32:02,489 --> 00:32:04,291
I will punish them severely.

327
00:32:10,463 --> 00:32:11,498
Yes.

328
00:32:12,132 --> 00:32:14,034
You are correct.

329
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:18,271
I said to take off your robe.

330
00:32:18,872 --> 00:32:21,141
Why are you stalling?

331
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:33,814
Your Highness,
Eunuch Han is here to see you.

332
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:56,555
Why are you here at this hour?

333
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:58,211
Your Highness,

334
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:02,115
disrobing a trainee is not a big problem,

335
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,886
but please proceed in a manner
that does not damage the dignity

336
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:11,157
of the Office of Eunuch Attendants.

337
00:33:16,751 --> 00:33:17,886
This child is a eunuch,

338
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,248
who passed the Office of Eunuch
Attendants' exam.

339
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:28,997
Eunuch Sung.

340
00:33:30,618 --> 00:33:32,553
Did you not examine him yourself?

341
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,684
Yes, Master.

342
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,222
Your Highness.

343
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:47,810
I understand you wish to scold
a eunuch for his fault,

344
00:33:49,207 --> 00:33:51,476
but how could the mother of the nation

345
00:33:51,937 --> 00:33:53,038
look at the naked body of a man,

346
00:33:54,429 --> 00:33:57,999
while bearing a child of all times?

347
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:07,651
If His Majesty were to learn of this...

348
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:18,498
Chief Eunuch Han,

349
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,995
both the Queen and I

350
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:24,509
will grow ill if we do not quench
our curiosity,

351
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,806
so let her be.

352
00:34:31,963 --> 00:34:32,803
Your Highness,

353
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:35,484
why are you hesitating?

354
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,211
Check for yourself right now!

355
00:34:56,117 --> 00:34:57,585
Take him away.

356
00:34:59,108 --> 00:35:00,776
Yes, Your Highness.

357
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:23,910
Jahyeondang

358
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:07,983
Did something happen?

359
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,653
I simply want to keep someone
I care about near me.

360
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,786
I don't know why...

361
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:19,523
...things keep happening that I'm sorry for.

362
00:36:23,593 --> 00:36:24,594
Your Highness.

363
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:34,381
That is why I thank you.

364
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:54,526
What is it?

365
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:56,756
I am surprised you wanted to see me.

366
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:00,964
I could tell you want the same thing.

367
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,769
I remembered the past, too.

368
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:12,309
I know.

369
00:37:13,009 --> 00:37:17,514
We used to spend a lot of time
together at Jahyeondang.

370
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:22,419
Also,

371
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:25,655
I heard what happened.

372
00:37:30,927 --> 00:37:33,497
Is Eunuch Hong okay?

373
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:38,869
His Highness is with him.

374
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:45,876
When we were young,

375
00:37:46,943 --> 00:37:48,912
I wanted to be His Highness' best friend.

376
00:37:52,582 --> 00:37:58,255
But somehow I became
someone he is uncomfortable with.

377
00:38:02,759 --> 00:38:05,028
I found a woman I want by my side
for the first time...

378
00:38:05,362 --> 00:38:06,202
Do not say it.

379
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:12,736
Just keep it in your heart.

380
00:38:18,341 --> 00:38:19,181
No.

381
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:23,814
I will not keep it inside any longer.

382
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,685
It is the first time
I wanted something...

383
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:31,386
...this badly.

384
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:52,108
May I ask you for directions?

385
00:38:52,175 --> 00:38:53,015
Yes, My Lord.

386
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:12,639
- My grandfather...
- My grandfather...

387
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,131
- used to say...
- used to say...

388
00:39:15,198 --> 00:39:16,038
Is it you, Grandpa?

389
00:39:16,888 --> 00:39:17,728
Raon?

390
00:39:19,265 --> 00:39:20,406
Are you Raon?

391
00:39:20,497 --> 00:39:22,532
No. I am called Samnom here.

392
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:25,610
How dare you!

393
00:39:26,311 --> 00:39:28,179
I told you not to call me "Grandpa".

394
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:32,614
By the way...

395
00:39:33,899 --> 00:39:35,401
How did you end up here?

396
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:37,709
You are...

397
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:40,463
...a eunuch?

398
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:43,627
It is a long story.

399
00:39:43,718 --> 00:39:44,785
Things just turned out this way.

400
00:39:45,671 --> 00:39:47,673
I am acknowledged as a good eunuch,

401
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:49,139
so please don't worry.

402
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:52,803
That does not make me feel relieved.

403
00:39:59,362 --> 00:40:00,863
It has been years.

404
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,952
I am glad I finally met you.

405
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:09,855
My grandfather used to say,

406
00:40:10,987 --> 00:40:12,422
people who are meant to meet,

407
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:15,025
meet again in one way or another.

408
00:40:34,587 --> 00:40:38,310
We are looking for the criminal
Hong Gyeongnae's family.

409
00:40:40,094 --> 00:40:41,650
Do you mind if we look around your house?

410
00:40:56,499 --> 00:40:59,035
The royal guards have left.
You can come out now.

411
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,702
You must have parted with
your mother at the market.

412
00:41:11,306 --> 00:41:12,307
That is right.

413
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:16,300
Did you...

414
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:18,579
How do you two know each other?

415
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:32,548
Are you here to meet His Highness?

416
00:41:40,293 --> 00:41:43,092
Grandpa, does it mean you are...

417
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:45,013
...Master Jeong?

418
00:41:49,471 --> 00:41:50,505
Grandpa?

419
00:42:10,434 --> 00:42:11,902
This is the cause.

420
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:13,784
Hooker chives.

421
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:16,069
Hooker chives?

422
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,728
Yes, Your Highness.

423
00:42:18,528 --> 00:42:20,029
It is known to have
three different flavors,

424
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,789
which are sweet, spicy and bitter.

425
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:25,298
It makes the silver...

426
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,475
...change its color
because it contains sulphur.

427
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:31,978
It is not a poisonous herb,
Your Highness.

428
00:42:33,172 --> 00:42:35,107
Are you saying it is not poisonous?

429
00:42:52,954 --> 00:42:54,589
Do you still not believe me?

430
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,513
Although it is from a different country,

431
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:03,493
the royal physicians must have known.

432
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,128
Why did they not say anything

433
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:07,230
and pretend as if it were
a serious problem?

434
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:24,614
Has the Crown Prince not returned?

435
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:27,853
He must be anxious.

436
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:29,574
I feel sorry for him.

437
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,389
Since the royal physicians will not talk,

438
00:43:32,455 --> 00:43:33,924
there is no way for him to find out.

439
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,427
Who would dare tell His Highness

440
00:43:37,494 --> 00:43:40,057
lest they anger Councilor Kim?

441
00:43:40,672 --> 00:43:43,575
I hope the Crown Prince realizes

442
00:43:44,412 --> 00:43:47,949
that there is no one on his side
in the palace.

443
00:43:49,323 --> 00:43:50,224
Do you not agree?

444
00:44:00,642 --> 00:44:02,276
Your Highness.

445
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,988
You are the person I met
at the Lantern Festival.

446
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:11,794
He is the Crown Prince.

447
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,710
Your Highness, thank you
for saving our lives.

448
00:44:16,149 --> 00:44:17,451
Thank you, Your Highness.

449
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:21,776
It is all right.

450
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:23,718
Look at me.

451
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:29,671
I am sorry you had to go through
such hardship.

452
00:44:30,742 --> 00:44:35,113
Has my wish to meet the King
been granted, Your Highness?

453
00:44:38,019 --> 00:44:39,020
Yes.

454
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:43,356
You still remember what you wanted
to tell him, right?

455
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:46,686
Watch me and see if I make this country

456
00:44:47,628 --> 00:44:48,863
a better country.

457
00:44:50,158 --> 00:44:51,159
Yes, Your Highness.

458
00:45:09,693 --> 00:45:12,663
Thank you for helping me
save an innocent child.

459
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:15,587
By the way,

460
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:18,786
when will you reply to my request?

461
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:23,602
I am a mere old man.
I would not be of any help to you.

462
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,438
Good day, Your Highness.

463
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:30,796
Grandpa.

464
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:40,364
Have you not heard
from my mom since then?

465
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,246
I hope I can tell you
good news next time.

466
00:46:06,162 --> 00:46:09,098
I shall push forward your marriage.

467
00:46:10,844 --> 00:46:11,845
Father.

468
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,001
Do you

469
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:18,482
also think of me as a thoughtless coward?

470
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,301
No, Father.

471
00:46:21,564 --> 00:46:22,631
It is just that...

472
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,296
I do not want to marry
someone I do not love.

473
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:32,721
I see. I understand how you must feel.

474
00:46:34,996 --> 00:46:35,997
Yeong.

475
00:46:39,123 --> 00:46:42,693
Since the day I took the throne
when I was 10,

476
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:48,752
there has not been a single day
when I was not confused or afraid.

477
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,712
It would be as if you were walking
through rough water.

478
00:46:57,283 --> 00:47:00,320
You think you took ten steps forward,

479
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:03,392
but then you realize you have only been

480
00:47:03,483 --> 00:47:05,485
stamping your feet on the same spot.

481
00:47:08,455 --> 00:47:10,857
You at least need to grab a twig

482
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:15,181
if it helps you
to move to the calm water.

483
00:47:20,183 --> 00:47:24,154
You need to marry
Minister Cho's daughter.

484
00:47:43,173 --> 00:47:45,342
If His Highness marries someone
from a powerful family,

485
00:47:45,538 --> 00:47:47,207
it would strengthen his position,

486
00:47:47,806 --> 00:47:49,775
and more people would be on his side.

487
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:50,901
It would be great.

488
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:54,631
This is frustrating.

489
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,051
Raon.

490
00:48:19,242 --> 00:48:21,778
Your Highness, you startled me.

491
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:26,409
What were you thinking so deeply about?

492
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:29,984
Your Highness.

493
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:32,229
What is it?

494
00:48:34,133 --> 00:48:39,138
Could you walk me to Jahyeondang?

495
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,806
We have been walking back
and forth for a while.

496
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:07,424
Do you hate to part with me that much?

497
00:49:10,096 --> 00:49:13,325
Do you know when I am
the happiest these days?

498
00:49:17,419 --> 00:49:21,557
It is when you call me, "Raon".

499
00:49:24,307 --> 00:49:25,475
It is the same for me.

500
00:49:26,526 --> 00:49:29,396
That is the happiest moment
for me as well.

501
00:49:30,043 --> 00:49:31,511
When I call your name,

502
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,908
you appear in front of me.

503
00:49:37,379 --> 00:49:39,715
What more would I need?

504
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:43,123
I shall not ask for more.

505
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,746
I shall ask for more than that.

506
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:51,377
When you are in love,

507
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:54,473
you naturally become greedy.

508
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,928
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:49:59,317 --> 00:50:02,520
I am your person already.
Please do as you wish.

510
00:50:07,936 --> 00:50:11,673
But I do not want you to be
in danger because of me.

511
00:50:16,491 --> 00:50:19,027
Even if I cannot stay by you as a woman,

512
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,982
it won't mean I would stop loving you.

513
00:50:23,427 --> 00:50:24,461
So please...

514
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,122
Say no more.

515
00:50:29,098 --> 00:50:31,000
Please stop refusing to get married,

516
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,256
Your Highness.

517
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:35,190
I said that is enough.

518
00:51:22,558 --> 00:51:24,360
The maiden I asked you to help

519
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:26,633
is Hong Raon.

520
00:51:30,138 --> 00:51:33,141
The maiden you want to give a home
and parents?

521
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:36,376
That is right.

522
00:51:39,927 --> 00:51:41,673
Why do you care so much about her?

523
00:51:42,312 --> 00:51:43,914
She is only a young eunuch.

524
00:51:46,634 --> 00:51:49,036
She may have come to me as a eunuch,

525
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:51,437
but she is my love.

526
00:51:55,164 --> 00:51:57,733
The difference in social status
and the twisted fate.

527
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,455
You asked me to help you
overcome all the barriers.

528
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:04,901
That is right.

529
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,257
Well...

530
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,776
She needs someone else,

531
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:16,931
not you, Your Highness.

532
00:52:36,669 --> 00:52:37,704
Your Highness.

533
00:52:40,161 --> 00:52:42,997
What brings you here
so early without notice?

534
00:52:44,058 --> 00:52:45,727
I need to talk to you.

535
00:53:01,149 --> 00:53:02,984
Do you remember the little girl,

536
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:05,040
who was selling the lanterns?

537
00:53:06,797 --> 00:53:07,831
Yes, Your Highness.

538
00:53:09,332 --> 00:53:12,002
I still remember her eyes full of joy

539
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,882
when she finally met her father.

540
00:53:18,275 --> 00:53:19,776
She told me

541
00:53:21,812 --> 00:53:24,047
that the King must know better

542
00:53:24,948 --> 00:53:26,950
how to make a country great.

543
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:33,056
What kind of country

544
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,328
would you like Joseon to be?

545
00:53:40,764 --> 00:53:41,998
Well...

546
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:44,804
A country where a child
can live like a child,

547
00:53:47,778 --> 00:53:49,413
and a woman like a woman.

548
00:53:49,872 --> 00:53:52,642
A country where everyone lives happily.

549
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:15,678
Can you wait
until I create a nation like that

550
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:18,693
for you?

551
00:54:25,156 --> 00:54:27,191
You'll be the first of my people,

552
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:29,831
in the new Joseon

553
00:54:31,387 --> 00:54:32,955
I will make.

554
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:56,866
What if it causes you harm
when she finds her mother?

555
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:00,575
If you just bury the truth,

556
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:02,939
you and Raon

557
00:55:03,964 --> 00:55:06,833
can live happily together.

558
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:11,926
If you face...

559
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:16,778
...a very difficult situation

560
00:55:18,196 --> 00:55:20,198
and must let go of something,

561
00:55:25,526 --> 00:55:27,295
it must not be me.

562
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:31,090
Can you promise me?

563
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:43,027
Yes, Your Highness.

564
00:55:46,323 --> 00:55:47,390
Good.

565
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:50,227
Now,

566
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:53,163
I think my wish has been granted.

567
00:55:56,625 --> 00:55:58,460
What do you mean, Your Highness?

568
00:56:03,184 --> 00:56:05,020
My wish...

569
00:56:06,801 --> 00:56:07,936
...for your wish to be granted.

570
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,625
I found your mother.

571
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:37,662
Mom.

572
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:43,006
Raon.

573
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:46,910
I am sorry for being so late.

574
00:57:48,912 --> 00:57:50,514
Mom.

575
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:52,616
Mom.

576
00:57:53,283 --> 00:57:56,586
Mom... Mom...

577
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:02,626
I am so sorry, Raon.

578
00:58:08,031 --> 00:58:09,466
Mom.

579
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,275
Mom.

580
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:28,485
Mom...

581
00:58:44,668 --> 00:58:46,736
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

582
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:51,875
I am frightened,

583
00:58:52,982 --> 00:58:53,822
because I am so happy.

584
00:58:54,692 --> 00:58:58,329
I am waiting for the Crown Prince
to be incapable.

585
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:10,636
What if someone else's happiness

586
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:12,562
came to me as well?
