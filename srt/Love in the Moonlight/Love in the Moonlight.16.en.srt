1
00:00:11,806 --> 00:00:14,307
What took you so long?

2
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:00,186
Your Majesty,

3
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:04,201
please forgive me
for overstepping my boundaries.

4
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:09,955
Go ahead.

5
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,173
Your Majesty,

6
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:17,247
Hong Gyeongnae is alive.

7
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,226
What did you say?

8
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,866
Nanhee.

9
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:40,068
Gyeongnae?

10
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:44,143
You must run.

11
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:45,698
Where is Raon?

12
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,990
Raon... On the hill...

13
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,087
Come with me.

14
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:39,529
Stay right here.

15
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,226
No. No.

16
00:02:52,634 --> 00:02:54,201
No.

17
00:03:01,883 --> 00:03:02,950
Excuse me.

18
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,387
Are you looking for me?

19
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,087
He was just arrested
and is being transported.

20
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,078
How dare you?

21
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,844
Do you dare mock me?

22
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:07,888
I could not believe it either,

23
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,154
but it is true.

24
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,756
No, no. He died 10 years ago.

25
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:15,940
How?

26
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,487
I think the rumors
that he survived the riot

27
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:22,153
10 years ago were true,
and he's planning a new rebellion.

28
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:26,820
Then...

29
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,526
Your Majesty.

30
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,536
Your Majesty!

31
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:33,933
Your Majesty!

32
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,320
Call the royal physician!

33
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:38,921
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

34
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,796
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

35
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:22,187
Your Highness. His Majesty has collapsed.

36
00:05:23,686 --> 00:05:26,253
Hong Gyeongnae was arrested.

37
00:05:31,787 --> 00:05:34,321
Mom, are you all right?

38
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,521
They captured him.

39
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:43,586
What?

40
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,587
Your father.

41
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,886
What do you mean?

42
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,487
Your father...

43
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:05,753
I thought he was dead.

44
00:06:07,753 --> 00:06:10,886
I just hoped he was alive somewhere...

45
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,120
I thought he died.

46
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,554
But he didn't.

47
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,688
He was alive.

48
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:20,420
He came back.

49
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:37,553
Raon.

50
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,254
CHAPTER 16 The World You Dream Of

51
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:58,120
Move out of the way!

52
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,053
Move.

53
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,154
Who is that? That is Hong Gyeongnae.

54
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:04,537
That really is Hong Gyeongnae.

55
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:06,112
He really was alive.

56
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:07,853
Oh, my.

57
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:09,087
My goodness.

58
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,787
Move. Move.

59
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,221
It is Hong Gyeongnae.

60
00:07:13,286 --> 00:07:14,653
Oh my goodness.

61
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:18,387
He really was not dead.

62
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,888
Step aside. Move.

63
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:21,153
Oh my goodness.

64
00:07:21,586 --> 00:07:23,220
How could this be?

65
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,487
I waited for so long.

66
00:07:27,286 --> 00:07:29,720
Why must I see him like this?

67
00:07:31,053 --> 00:07:32,554
This is devastating.

68
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:36,053
His Majesty ordered
to bring him to the palace

69
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:38,754
not the Department of Justice.

70
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,020
I will risk my life if I have to

71
00:07:44,753 --> 00:07:46,853
and free him.

72
00:08:01,154 --> 00:08:05,888
We are guarding this place,
so do not worry.

73
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,654
How is your mother?

74
00:08:14,386 --> 00:08:16,020
The shock must have been too much.

75
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,854
She cannot seem to wake up.

76
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,721
Once she calms down,

77
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:24,953
she should be fine.

78
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:27,820
Do not worry too much.

79
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:30,519
Yes, Master.

80
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:34,154
All right, then.

81
00:08:35,453 --> 00:08:36,293
I...

82
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,654
I have something to tell you.

83
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
No.

84
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,753
Don't you see

85
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,619
how dangerous the palace is
for you right now?

86
00:08:53,386 --> 00:08:54,586
I know.

87
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:58,352
They had been after him for ten years.

88
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:04,153
Your father and you could die.

89
00:09:05,353 --> 00:09:07,087
That is why I am asking you.

90
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,720
If things go wrong...

91
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,454
Master, every person in this nation

92
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,620
knows about my dad but me.

93
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:25,486
I cannot let you fall into danger as well.

94
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:29,488
Just one last time.

95
00:09:31,686 --> 00:09:32,686
No.

96
00:09:33,286 --> 00:09:34,286
For the first time,

97
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:38,988
I want to see my dad. Please help me.

98
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,521
He was alive.

99
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,154
He came to my bedroom
just a few days ago.

100
00:09:58,553 --> 00:10:00,887
It was not a dream. It was not.

101
00:10:07,154 --> 00:10:10,554
How could this happen on the day

102
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,554
the Crown Prince was supposed to be wed?

103
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:18,287
Your Majesty. We will set a new date,

104
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,454
so do not worry about the wedding

105
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,053
and focus on your health.

106
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:26,719
He trifled with me for 10 years.

107
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:30,454
Ordering his execution would not suffice.

108
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,153
Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,087
I agree wholeheartedly.

110
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:39,320
He committed a grave sin of treason.

111
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,187
You should judge him yourself

112
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,421
and give him capital punishment.

113
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:52,187
Councilor Kim.
His Majesty should not do it himself.

114
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:55,154
You know very well

115
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:58,120
how his health failed
at the news of his arrest.

116
00:10:59,286 --> 00:11:01,887
That is correct.
Your health is still unstable.

117
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,887
I do not believe you should.

118
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,820
No.

119
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:09,820
As Councilor Kim says,

120
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:12,287
I shall judge him myself.

121
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:46,920
Keep your head down and follow closely.

122
00:11:52,953 --> 00:11:54,854
Were you the person...

123
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:57,954
...who was coming for me?

124
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,354
Do not ask anything
until we enter the palace.

125
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,421
Your Highness, where are you going?

126
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,053
Let us go to the prison.

127
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,420
Pardon? At this hour?

128
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,787
I must meet him myself.

129
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:33,520
I will wait here.

130
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,687
I know. I agree.

131
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:12,486
Are you...

132
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,554
...really Hong Gyeongnae?

133
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:18,686
I am.

134
00:15:22,286 --> 00:15:26,020
What was the precious
Crown Prince curious about

135
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:28,387
that he came to the prison?

136
00:15:29,753 --> 00:15:31,120
Does your family know...

137
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,320
...that you have been arrested?

138
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:39,886
I have no such thing.

139
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:45,387
I hear you wish to eliminate the King.

140
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:48,419
Does that mean...

141
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:51,755
...I am also your target?

142
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,021
Has the investigation begun?

143
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,187
I have lost something very precious
because of you.

144
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,654
"A leader is placed
for the sake of the people."

145
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:20,654
"It is not for one man
to sit high above everyone"

146
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:23,055
"and fulfill his selfishness."

147
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:29,120
Is that what Baekwoon believes?

148
00:16:29,653 --> 00:16:32,720
No. There is one more thing.

149
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,820
I believe there is
an error in the statement.

150
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:40,320
What is that?

151
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:44,721
It is not the ultimate being,

152
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,721
who chooses the leader.

153
00:16:48,753 --> 00:16:50,554
A leader for the people

154
00:16:51,453 --> 00:16:55,354
must be chosen by the people themselves.

155
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:20,420
It is too dangerous.
Let us leave at daybreak.

156
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,054
I am sorry for troubling you.

157
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,187
Did you bring her here?

158
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:18,588
My apologies, Your Highness.

159
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:32,887
Are you sure?

160
00:18:34,254 --> 00:18:36,855
I thought it was strange
he averted my eyes.

161
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,987
The unusually small frame too.

162
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,320
I saw the side profile when they turned,

163
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:44,986
and I am sure it was her.

164
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:49,221
How bold. How dare she come in here?

165
00:18:49,987 --> 00:18:53,054
Capture her
before the investigation begins.

166
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:54,586
Yes, Master.

167
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,046
It will be impossible

168
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,586
for even an ant
to leave the palace right now.

169
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:02,470
I cannot wait to see
the Crown Prince's face

170
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:04,187
when he sees
the father-and-child reunion.

171
00:19:33,753 --> 00:19:38,287
If someone follows you into Jahyeondang,

172
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,454
you may hide in here.

173
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:46,388
It's difficult to find
the door from outside.

174
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,087
I never knew

175
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,021
there was a room
like this in Jahyeondang.

176
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,853
My mother...

177
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:59,020
...used it from time to time.

178
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:08,287
Are you all right?

179
00:20:14,154 --> 00:20:15,321
Yes, Your Highness.

180
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:22,788
I will find you a way in
during the changing of guards.

181
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,687
If you miss someone,

182
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,254
you should see them.

183
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,687
Pass.

184
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:07,321
Pass.

185
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,253
Pass.

186
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:15,653
Pass.

187
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,421
It is frightening.

188
00:21:37,853 --> 00:21:39,920
Hong Raon, Hong Gyeongnae's daughter

189
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:43,987
I am mistaken to think
she looks familiar, right?

190
00:21:44,087 --> 00:21:46,421
I wish you were,
but she is to me as well.

191
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:49,211
Eunuch Hong...

192
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,608
...is a rebel's daughter?

193
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,587
Not even a rebel's son.

194
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,781
It says "daughter". Right?

195
00:22:05,187 --> 00:22:06,521
Eunuch Hong?

196
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:10,953
What is this?

197
00:22:12,453 --> 00:22:14,820
The eunuch whom the Crown Prince favored

198
00:22:15,187 --> 00:22:16,754
turned out to be a girl.

199
00:22:19,154 --> 00:22:20,221
What?

200
00:22:20,987 --> 00:22:22,454
And it turns out

201
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,987
she is rebel Hong Gyeongnae's daughter.

202
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:37,253
Two days from now,

203
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:40,954
we will free him
from the prison around noon.

204
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,354
During the changing of guards,

205
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,787
we shall take the guards down

206
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,287
and open the prison gate.

207
00:22:52,486 --> 00:22:54,619
If you take him
to the underground passage,

208
00:22:55,154 --> 00:22:57,788
I will get him out of the palace.

209
00:22:58,653 --> 00:22:59,720
Yes, Master.

210
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:02,253
How many will assist in the escape?

211
00:23:02,753 --> 00:23:05,287
Ten, including you.

212
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:07,653
Yes, Master.

213
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,687
You must protect her

214
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,320
and make sure she is not found.

215
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,420
Yes, Master.

216
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:46,048
What brings you to Donggungjeon?

217
00:23:46,787 --> 00:23:48,987
I know we didn't have
the wedding ceremony,

218
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:52,241
but I must have become
the Crown Princess,

219
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:56,799
seeing how they let me wait alone

220
00:23:57,705 --> 00:24:00,406
in Donggungjeon in your absence.

221
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:05,787
I am sorry for making you wait,

222
00:24:06,853 --> 00:24:11,220
but it is late.
You should return another day.

223
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,287
Your bracelet...

224
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,088
Did you remove it?

225
00:25:02,087 --> 00:25:04,354
You seemed to have cherished it,

226
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,987
but I do not see it, that is why I asked.

227
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:10,653
I put it somewhere else.

228
00:25:16,286 --> 00:25:18,620
I heard if you share those bracelets,

229
00:25:19,353 --> 00:25:22,854
destiny will find a way
to bring back the two together

230
00:25:23,686 --> 00:25:25,320
even if they part ways.

231
00:25:30,887 --> 00:25:35,054
The vendors at the market
are good at making things up like that.

232
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,153
They must know the hearts of the people

233
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:47,786
who wish to believe it,
knowing they are lies.

234
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:26,386
There is a maiden whom I like.

235
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:31,854
What kind of maiden is she?

236
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:37,421
Your Highness. This is bad.

237
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:38,788
Eunuch Hong...

238
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:40,453
What is it?

239
00:26:40,544 --> 00:26:42,819
Please head to Junggungjeon.

240
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:44,907
Please hurry.

241
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:49,953
Never come here again.

242
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:53,319
Never.

243
00:27:39,715 --> 00:27:42,449
Do you have something to say?

244
00:27:43,753 --> 00:27:45,454
The guard had to step away

245
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:47,605
and asked me to watch you.

246
00:27:49,386 --> 00:27:50,553
Did you come last night

247
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:54,454
at that guard's request, too?

248
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:17,353
Raon.

249
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:26,987
Yes?

250
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,607
Hong Raon.

251
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,354
I did not name you that
to lead such a difficult life.

252
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,554
I am sorry.

253
00:28:52,987 --> 00:28:54,087
When...

254
00:28:57,254 --> 00:29:00,188
...were you planning to come see me?

255
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:02,987
I do not know.

256
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:09,953
Perhaps when you would no longer need

257
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:12,020
to pretend to be a boy.

258
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,087
You...

259
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,554
...didn't have to change the world.

260
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,153
You...

261
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,221
...could have been of great help
as a father, just by being there.

262
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:38,020
I did not want

263
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:41,587
to throw my child

264
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,220
into a world full of problems

265
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,554
and scold her for not doing better.

266
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:51,787
So,

267
00:29:52,787 --> 00:29:54,154
I wanted to change it...

268
00:29:58,453 --> 00:30:03,653
...to a world that is better
for you to live in.

269
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,419
Still.

270
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:10,387
It would have been nice to know

271
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,087
you were alive.

272
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:26,187
I would have missed you,

273
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:31,920
and called out for you,

274
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:39,753
Dad.

275
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,488
Oh, my. My apologies, Master.

276
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:49,153
I am in a rush.

277
00:32:03,586 --> 00:32:05,120
What is the fuss?

278
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:07,454
Your Highness.

279
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,719
I found her.

280
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:13,487
Found who?

281
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,920
Hong Samnom.

282
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:18,719
I mean, Hong Raon.

283
00:32:21,486 --> 00:32:23,853
Was she really in the palace?

284
00:32:24,353 --> 00:32:25,353
Yes.

285
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,654
How fearless of her.

286
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,487
Where did you see her?

287
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:34,787
I saw her exit the prison.

288
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,687
She is headed towards Jahyeondang now

289
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:39,988
with the Crown Prince, too.

290
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,554
To Jahyeondang with the Crown Prince?

291
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:49,621
Get the Commandant of the Palace Guards.

292
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:52,153
I must watch for myself.

293
00:32:57,853 --> 00:32:59,886
What brings you all the way here?

294
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:06,921
Your Highness,
I brought you tea from Grandfather,

295
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,788
but I must tell you something first.

296
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:11,686
Thank you,

297
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:15,021
but this is a bad time.
Come another time.

298
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:15,927
No.

299
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:20,420
You must listen to me first.

300
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:23,320
I said to come another time.

301
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:24,753
It is about...

302
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,586
a new-born baby
that was sneaked out of the palace.

303
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,087
Should I really come back later?

304
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,519
How dare you scorn me,

305
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:00,820
the mother of the nation,
with this absurd accusation?

306
00:34:01,853 --> 00:34:04,953
You are the one
scorning the nation, not I.

307
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:06,887
You know that.

308
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:10,254
Shut that mouth!

309
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:13,020
Forget what Eunuch Sung said.

310
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:16,886
Do not say a word
to His Majesty or to Grandfather.

311
00:34:18,087 --> 00:34:19,688
If you agree,

312
00:34:20,254 --> 00:34:21,649
I will also keep quiet...

313
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,654
What will you do if I talk?

314
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,900
Will you tell His Majesty
that I switched babies?

315
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,719
Who would believe you?

316
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,759
I would not say it without evidence.

317
00:34:38,604 --> 00:34:41,020
How dare you throw out empty threats?

318
00:34:43,254 --> 00:34:44,287
Empty threats?

319
00:34:49,148 --> 00:34:51,654
What if the baby is alive and not dead?

320
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,320
Would that change things?

321
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:25,554
I did not want to put you in danger

322
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,087
because of me.

323
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,587
Do not say that.

324
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,088
Our destinies were tangled already

325
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,654
before you and I even met.

326
00:35:46,419 --> 00:35:49,753
So don't feel bad

327
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:53,120
or hurt anymore.

328
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,421
It is very late.

329
00:36:10,187 --> 00:36:12,421
You must go, Your Highness.

330
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,187
It is too cloudy to see the moon.

331
00:36:22,053 --> 00:36:25,921
How can I walk in the dark by myself?

332
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:31,353
So...

333
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,888
I will stay here a little longer.

334
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,154
I imagine...

335
00:37:03,486 --> 00:37:06,619
...how it would be if we were
in a different situation

336
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:09,987
several times a day.

337
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:18,787
At least

338
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:22,786
while we are here, hidden from the world,

339
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:27,187
let us not think about anything,

340
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:31,387
and look at each other.

341
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:37,453
Raon.

342
00:38:14,087 --> 00:38:15,254
I think,

343
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:19,420
I can finally sleep well tonight.

344
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:01,619
Did you escape from prison?

345
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,220
We must catch the escaped prisoner.

346
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,478
We must catch him now.

347
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,320
Is anyone out there?
Summon Councilor Kim.

348
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:23,787
I shall order him...

349
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,888
...to begin the interrogation
of Hong Gyeongnae.

350
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,621
I did not know the interrogation
would begin so soon.

351
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:47,188
Getting him out of the interrogation room,

352
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,887
will be 10 times harder than the prison.

353
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:53,955
Yes, Master. I am aware of that.

354
00:39:58,586 --> 00:39:59,753
Byeongyeon.

355
00:40:01,389 --> 00:40:05,554
Jang Gibaek died in prison, right?

356
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,320
I did it.

357
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,488
Although he betrayed us,

358
00:40:18,453 --> 00:40:21,653
he had been my comrade for 10 years.

359
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,087
However,

360
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:28,253
personal feelings must be put aside
for a great cause.

361
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,587
Devote all your power

362
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:46,087
to help him,
whom we have waited for long,

363
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:47,654
escape the interrogation room.

364
00:40:50,953 --> 00:40:51,986
Yes, Master.

365
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,521
Tell Raon to disguise herself

366
00:40:57,553 --> 00:40:59,553
and hide next to the gate.

367
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:03,854
We will take her out with him.

368
00:41:05,187 --> 00:41:06,688
It will be safer for her.

369
00:41:08,987 --> 00:41:10,120
Yes, Master.

370
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,421
The interrogation will begin soon.

371
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:42,613
What do you want to ask me about now?

372
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,354
It is about what you said last time.

373
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:51,254
By the leader chosen by the people,

374
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:54,420
do you mean another puppet king,

375
00:41:56,087 --> 00:41:58,055
who does as the people tell him?

376
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:02,619
No.

377
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,354
I want that as well.

378
00:42:06,586 --> 00:42:08,053
Politics for the people.

379
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:10,987
However,

380
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,421
how can people choose
the king who rules over them?

381
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,454
What we want

382
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,720
is not only politics for the people.

383
00:42:28,553 --> 00:42:30,521
It is politics by the people.

384
00:42:31,586 --> 00:42:34,320
A king like yourself who is born as a king

385
00:42:34,787 --> 00:42:37,021
must think of himself as the sun.

386
00:42:38,087 --> 00:42:40,321
The absolute being
that shines over the people.

387
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:44,888
A king chosen by the people is different.

388
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:49,321
How is he different?

389
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,020
He would consider himself
equal to the people,

390
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:56,720
a human being.

391
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,120
A human being dreams
of becoming a human being.

392
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,320
Is it not funny?

393
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:24,688
Then why do you think that
removing the King is necessary?

394
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:31,419
No king would give up
the throne by himself.

395
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,320
You and I.

396
00:43:35,254 --> 00:43:36,621
Nobility and peasants.

397
00:43:37,419 --> 00:43:38,819
Women and men.

398
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,920
A rebel's child and a king's successor.

399
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:47,254
When you become a king,

400
00:43:48,753 --> 00:43:52,087
would you accept all of them to be equal?

401
00:44:01,254 --> 00:44:03,955
Your Highness, we must take him now.

402
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:19,086
A leader chosen by the people

403
00:44:19,753 --> 00:44:21,654
is not the only one cherishing them.

404
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,587
How could someone
who cherishes each person

405
00:44:26,686 --> 00:44:29,453
treat the people as though
they were animals?

406
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,387
So...

407
00:44:38,953 --> 00:44:40,821
What are you trying to say?

408
00:44:41,987 --> 00:44:43,721
The world I dream of

409
00:44:43,987 --> 00:44:46,354
is not different
from the world you dream of.

410
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:48,986
The only difference is

411
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,687
how far they are from the present.

412
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,320
I shall come to see you
after the interrogation.

413
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,053
Maybe...

414
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,087
...we could find a way without bloodshed.

415
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:11,287
The way we can walk together

416
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,520
toward the world we dream of.

417
00:46:54,254 --> 00:46:55,688
Hong Gyeongnae.

418
00:46:56,386 --> 00:46:58,987
Do you admit that you committed treason?

419
00:47:01,787 --> 00:47:03,454
I do not know what treason means.

420
00:47:04,286 --> 00:47:07,187
Therefore, I cannot admit it.

421
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:19,320
We have proof of your betrayal
and rebellion against the nation.

422
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,254
Will you still tell a lie?

423
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,487
What is betrayal?

424
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,754
What is rebellion?

425
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,393
How dare he!

426
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,954
Begin the torture immediately.

427
00:47:32,419 --> 00:47:35,486
Torture him until he admits his faults.

428
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,854
If you tell a lie again,

429
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:34,853
you will be executed right here.

430
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:38,853
Hong Gyeongnae.

431
00:48:39,653 --> 00:48:41,887
You led a riot 10 years ago,

432
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,554
putting the country in distress

433
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,721
and causing thousands of deaths.

434
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:49,720
Do you admit it?

435
00:48:52,187 --> 00:48:53,554
Is that what you meant

436
00:48:54,353 --> 00:48:56,753
by treason?

437
00:48:56,853 --> 00:48:58,986
Betrayal and rebellion?

438
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,454
If so,

439
00:49:02,254 --> 00:49:03,855
I admit it.

440
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,020
There are also...

441
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:13,768
...accomplices who planned
the treason with me.

442
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:16,354
Right here.

443
00:49:28,453 --> 00:49:32,120
Those in authority
collected too much in taxes

444
00:49:32,586 --> 00:49:34,554
from the peasants,

445
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:38,519
taking most of their income
to grow their fortunes.

446
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:44,520
I, Hong Gyeongnae, gathered the people

447
00:49:45,686 --> 00:49:48,853
who were dying of hunger,
and led them to death.

448
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,187
The King blew up a bomb to destroy

449
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,920
the lives and hopes
of the people who fought

450
00:49:59,087 --> 00:50:02,055
until the end, hoping for a new world.

451
00:50:05,353 --> 00:50:06,386
Hear me!

452
00:50:07,154 --> 00:50:09,547
Cut off the head of that monstrous...

453
00:50:09,638 --> 00:50:11,487
I am confessing my faults.

454
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:18,999
Please execute them with me.

455
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,454
That'd be the only way
to repay the sacrifices

456
00:50:27,187 --> 00:50:28,654
of thousands of people.

457
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:33,906
I command!

458
00:50:34,271 --> 00:50:36,205
Cut off his head right this instant!

459
00:50:36,296 --> 00:50:37,663
Right now!

460
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:39,141
Yes, Your Majesty.

461
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,820
Your Majesty.

462
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,121
Please revoke your command.

463
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,480
Crown Prince.

464
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,321
Your Majesty, please refrain yourself.

465
00:50:56,509 --> 00:50:57,843
You must follow the procedure

466
00:50:58,286 --> 00:51:01,254
and decide on his punishment
after the interrogation.

467
00:51:06,571 --> 00:51:08,287
Put down your swords!

468
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:11,520
I am sure that is not the reason.

469
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,721
You must not show your personal feelings

470
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:21,653
when we are punishing a felon.

471
00:51:23,187 --> 00:51:24,220
Councilor Kim.

472
00:51:25,953 --> 00:51:28,271
It is widely rumored in the palace

473
00:51:28,362 --> 00:51:30,454
that you are intimate with his daughter.

474
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:49,488
Councilor Kim.
What are you talking about?

475
00:51:53,312 --> 00:51:55,437
Is that true, Your Highness?

476
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,754
Crown Prince, why are you not answering?

477
00:52:04,419 --> 00:52:06,086
Is what Councilor Kim said true?

478
00:52:13,053 --> 00:52:14,687
Bring her in.

479
00:52:46,054 --> 00:52:48,955
This is the wench.

480
00:52:54,726 --> 00:52:55,726
Crown Prince.

481
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,790
Is this true?

482
00:53:15,672 --> 00:53:18,273
She is Hong Gyeongnae's daughter,
Hong Raon.

483
00:53:19,553 --> 00:53:23,686
Is she the spy,
who served you as a eunuch?

484
00:53:25,815 --> 00:53:27,582
Is it true that you hid her,

485
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:30,761
because you fell in love with her?

486
00:53:45,546 --> 00:53:47,514
Do not punish her for my faults.

487
00:53:48,386 --> 00:53:49,953
I have not even seen her until now.

488
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:51,955
I have never called her name.

489
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:56,421
She has nothing to do with me.

490
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:12,821
Your Highness, you must prove yourself

491
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:14,687
that you did not plan treason
with the rebels.

492
00:54:19,453 --> 00:54:20,453
You can prove it

493
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:24,187
by cutting off her head now.

494
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,420
Crown Prince, why are you hesitating?

495
00:54:48,259 --> 00:54:51,687
I command. Cut off her head
right this instant.

496
00:54:51,778 --> 00:54:52,746
Right now!

497
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,114
Yes, Your Majesty.

498
00:55:11,337 --> 00:55:12,337
Your Highness.

499
00:55:13,686 --> 00:55:15,387
From this moment,

500
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:18,204
stop loving me.

501
00:55:19,799 --> 00:55:20,799
Please.

502
00:55:22,164 --> 00:55:24,498
Remember me as a rebel's daughter.

503
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:28,912
I do not want to leave you

504
00:55:30,254 --> 00:55:31,888
with the horrible sense of guilt

505
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,287
that you could not protect
the girl you loved.

506
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:15,175
Protect the King and the Crown Prince!

507
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,154
What are you doing?

508
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,221
Kill those rebels. Right now.

509
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:31,213
Right now!

510
00:57:27,453 --> 00:57:29,653
If you wish to save the Crown Prince,

511
00:57:35,337 --> 00:57:36,437
