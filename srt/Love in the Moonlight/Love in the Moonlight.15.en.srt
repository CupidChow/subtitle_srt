1
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,792
There is something
I did not tell you in the palace.

2
00:00:43,393 --> 00:00:45,028
It is about your father.

3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,452
Meet me at the time and place below.

4
00:02:08,167 --> 00:02:09,300
I will...

5
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:13,554
...never forgive you.

6
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:09,853
I will listen only to you.

7
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,871
No matter what lie you tell,

8
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,717
I will believe it.

9
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,850
Did you mean everything...

10
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:32,803
...you said and did to me?

11
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:50,300
My apologies, Your Highness.

12
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:08,710
You were correct.

13
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,002
You must escape.

14
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,946
Your Highness.

15
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,593
Minister Kim.

16
00:06:44,398 --> 00:06:45,598
What brings you here?

17
00:06:49,901 --> 00:06:53,398
I wondered who tried to entrap me
with a fake letter,

18
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:55,489
so I came to see for myself.

19
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:58,563
Was it you?

20
00:07:00,775 --> 00:07:01,842
Your Highness.

21
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,501
I came only because I was told

22
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,381
someone was meeting a rebel here.

23
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:16,523
How dare they try to frame
the Crown Prince of treason?

24
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:20,735
Bring him to me right away!

25
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,801
That is the only way you will live.

26
00:07:24,436 --> 00:07:25,603
Do you understand?

27
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,679
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:07:40,467 --> 00:07:47,401
CHAPTER 15 All The Lies That Seemed True

29
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:01,519
Is Raon safe?

30
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:04,111
Yes, Your Highness.

31
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,328
I will move her to a safe location,

32
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:07,984
so do not worry.

33
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,641
I must not know...

34
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,070
...where that is, correct?

35
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,843
It will make things harder for her

36
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:23,144
if you try to know.

37
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:29,936
How did I become

38
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,687
the person who makes it difficult

39
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:36,873
for Raon?

40
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,484
I understand.

41
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:50,715
I will not ask any questions.

42
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:06,627
We do not have time.

43
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,483
Please take care of her.

44
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:21,564
Go on.

45
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:35,797
Your Highness.

46
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:41,098
Do not be curious...

47
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,830
...about where I am.

48
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:50,098
Regardless of what news you hear about me,

49
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,465
please do not be swayed.

50
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:58,931
That is...

51
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,360
...what I will do as well.

52
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:03,431
Lady Cho.

53
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,899
You must be bored living in the annex.

54
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,897
Not at all, Your Highness.

55
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:13,598
I have many rules of the palace to learn,
so the days fly by.

56
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:17,565
You are studying so hard
to be the crown princess.

57
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:23,764
Lady Cho.

58
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:29,452
Do you know why the wedding date
has not been set yet?

59
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:31,098
Pardon?

60
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:35,293
I heard the Office of Astrology
will choose a date...

61
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:37,784
What is the point in choosing a date?

62
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:44,465
I hear the Crown Prince is making
all sorts of excuses and is refusing.

63
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:51,370
Are you not curious

64
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,765
what is the reason for that?

65
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:03,918
His Highness must have his reasons.

66
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,518
He does.

67
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:11,998
Ever since his effeminate eunuch
vanished without trace,

68
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:15,765
he has been heartbroken.

69
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:18,564
Pardon?

70
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:23,064
What do you mean?

71
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:25,176
Please comfort him

72
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:28,564
in my stead.

73
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:33,731
Yes, Your Highness.

74
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,404
So...

75
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,198
Do you know where Hong Raon lives?

76
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:52,164
I do not.

77
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:56,398
I only went as the Crown Prince's escort.

78
00:12:58,351 --> 00:12:59,585
By the time I arrived,

79
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:02,497
Hong Raon had disappeared.

80
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,030
Who would have done that?

81
00:13:11,864 --> 00:13:15,498
Seeing how they used
my name to call them out,

82
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:19,097
it was...

83
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:23,393
...someone close to us.

84
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:30,598
It is bad enough that Councilor Kim
is framing us for all sorts of crimes.

85
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:34,599
Now, must we suspect one of our own?

86
00:13:35,764 --> 00:13:38,632
If there is a traitor among us,

87
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:42,497
I will...

88
00:13:44,397 --> 00:13:46,064
...never forgive him.

89
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:53,792
Mom.

90
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:54,983
You should rest.

91
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:59,131
I am fine.

92
00:13:59,265 --> 00:14:00,797
I am used to it.

93
00:14:01,684 --> 00:14:03,051
You go to sleep.

94
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:05,664
You did not lie down all day.

95
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:08,498
I am fine too.

96
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,730
I am Samnom.

97
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,732
Born to succeed. Meant to be big.

98
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,064
Capable of doing anything.

99
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:20,564
You must resent your father.

100
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:34,198
For making us suffer?

101
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,530
Yes.

102
00:14:40,597 --> 00:14:42,531
You said it was the right thing.

103
00:14:43,098 --> 00:14:44,732
Somebody had to do it.

104
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:49,098
Yes.

105
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:51,564
That is correct.

106
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:54,997
But...

107
00:14:56,164 --> 00:14:58,032
I did not want my husband to do it.

108
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:02,131
More than someone with great deeds,

109
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:05,503
I needed a family

110
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:06,697
I could eat, sleep,

111
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,464
laugh, and cry with.

112
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,531
So how could I not hate him?

113
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:23,064
Mom, I hear that
as you miss him and long for him.

114
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:28,831
Goodness. Just go to sleep.

115
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:31,065
Let me finish it.

116
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,032
I am done for the day.
Let us both go to sleep.

117
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,630
Let us sleep.

118
00:16:01,797 --> 00:16:03,598
Have you seen this letter before?

119
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:09,064
If you tell me the truth,
you will not be harmed.

120
00:16:11,098 --> 00:16:12,398
Did you...

121
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,298
...leave this on my desk?

122
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,830
Yes, Your Highness.

123
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:23,864
Who ordered you to do it?

124
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,031
I am not trying to punish the person.

125
00:16:30,664 --> 00:16:33,831
I merely want to ask some questions,
so answer me.

126
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,365
I had never seen him
in the palace before.

127
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:44,498
He asked if my job
was cleaning Donggungjeon.

128
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,964
He said he would give me two nyang.

129
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:51,032
Do you remember what he looked like?

130
00:17:02,864 --> 00:17:06,064
Bring me an artist right away.

131
00:17:26,397 --> 00:17:29,464
I thought hard about it
after what happened.

132
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,365
You betrayed Baekwoon.

133
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:35,765
How can I trust that you won't betray me?

134
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,799
I believe in the power of money,

135
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,632
not you, Councilor Kim.

136
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,964
You simply buy what you need,

137
00:17:47,397 --> 00:17:50,564
and I sell what I can. That is all.

138
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:12,532
Here is the promised pay.

139
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,430
But...

140
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,064
Bring that wench right away.

141
00:18:22,597 --> 00:18:24,298
Hong Raon.

142
00:18:42,397 --> 00:18:44,998
Wait. Go. Go. Go.

143
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,464
Hello, Master.

144
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,064
Let me.

145
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:06,931
My goodness.

146
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,365
How have you been?

147
00:19:16,564 --> 00:19:18,465
Laughter never ceases

148
00:19:18,731 --> 00:19:21,498
in the kisaeng room because of her.

149
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:25,898
She is hogging their love
even more than you.

150
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,398
I am glad.

151
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:34,331
I was surprised
that you asked such a favor.

152
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:37,731
Whose baby is she?

153
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,864
Will you not tell me?

154
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:49,998
She is an orphan with nowhere to go.

155
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:55,464
My dear. Poor thing.

156
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,998
I am a lowly kisaeng,

157
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:02,997
but I will do my utmost in raising her.

158
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,270
Raon.

159
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:22,832
What are you doing? Come in.

160
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:25,431
Okay, I will.

161
00:20:28,131 --> 00:20:29,131
Raon!

162
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,931
Raon!

163
00:20:43,363 --> 00:20:44,396
Let us go.

164
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,531
Mom. Mom.

165
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,563
Mom.

166
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,397
Mom.

167
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,493
Are you taking care of yourself?

168
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:46,131
Yes.

169
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:49,525
I am happy I gave birth to a prince,

170
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:53,398
so my body feels light.

171
00:21:57,997 --> 00:22:00,631
He is very handsome.

172
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:04,031
Do you mean it?

173
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:13,897
Are you happy?

174
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:16,131
Of course.

175
00:22:17,664 --> 00:22:20,031
I cannot express it in words.

176
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:22,564
Are you...

177
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:25,931
...truly that happy?

178
00:22:38,797 --> 00:22:40,498
I shall go now.

179
00:23:26,397 --> 00:23:28,464
What are you doing?

180
00:23:28,997 --> 00:23:31,764
Are you the one bearing the name Baekwoon

181
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:34,697
while acting as Councilor Kim's dog?

182
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:48,130
So?

183
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:50,731
What?

184
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,431
If I am caught,
what will happen to Baekwoon?

185
00:23:54,764 --> 00:23:57,198
What about you and Chief Eunuch Han?

186
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:05,431
You cannot do anything to me

187
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:09,798
because you're afraid
that your long-time position as a spy

188
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:12,798
to the Crown Prince may be exposed.

189
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:13,964
Am I wrong?

190
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:19,831
What?

191
00:24:21,098 --> 00:24:23,131
Does the mere thought of it hurt?

192
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,397
That is why I warned you

193
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:31,463
that the Crown Prince...

194
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:35,398
...is not your friend.

195
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:48,103
Stop!

196
00:24:55,464 --> 00:24:56,332
Chief Kim.

197
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:08,532
We came to arrest him

198
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:10,698
on the Crown Prince's orders.

199
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,563
We have caught the culprit,
who broke into the palace

200
00:25:29,664 --> 00:25:31,632
and tried to frame me for treason

201
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,331
by luring me with a fake letter.

202
00:25:41,897 --> 00:25:45,431
Your Highness, is that true?

203
00:25:45,997 --> 00:25:51,364
Who broke into your quarters
and committed such a heinous deed?

204
00:25:52,797 --> 00:25:57,097
He said he was hired by somebody as well.

205
00:26:02,497 --> 00:26:04,964
Please send that criminal to be punished.

206
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,031
I shall interrogate the criminal,

207
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:09,799
who tried to frame you.

208
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:13,698
He asked for a public interrogation.

209
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:17,764
He said he will expose the truth
in front of everyone.

210
00:26:41,697 --> 00:26:43,064
Do not worry.

211
00:26:43,497 --> 00:26:48,098
I am sure he knows that he cannot talk.

212
00:26:49,664 --> 00:26:52,797
But we should meet with him
before it is too late.

213
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:16,032
If my guess is correct,

214
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:19,597
you were my father's friend

215
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,097
and worked with him.

216
00:27:23,764 --> 00:27:24,864
That is correct.

217
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:28,031
I searched for you,

218
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,631
so you may carry on
with your father's will.

219
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,665
I do not want to.

220
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:41,564
Is it because of the Crown Prince?

221
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:50,799
His Highness is pushing off his wedding.

222
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,997
He is not eating

223
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,097
nor sleeping well.

224
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,597
Raon.

225
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:08,064
When you untangle a thread

226
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,398
and you come across a knot

227
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:15,765
that is impossible to untangle,

228
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:22,465
you must cut it off without holding back.

229
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:29,364
Do you understand what I mean?

230
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,064
That is...

231
00:28:33,397 --> 00:28:35,697
...what is best for His Highness.

232
00:28:39,797 --> 00:28:41,031
I am sorry.

233
00:28:42,497 --> 00:28:44,131
Take care of yourself.

234
00:28:46,797 --> 00:28:47,797
I will be back.

235
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:33,064
What brings you here

236
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,830
at this late hour?

237
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,797
What brings you here, Your Highness?

238
00:29:47,564 --> 00:29:50,465
I wanted to know why he tried to harm me.

239
00:29:51,098 --> 00:29:53,465
We also came simply because

240
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,930
we were curious and worried
about the criminal.

241
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:01,365
Do you mean that man?

242
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:05,031
Yes, Your Highness.

243
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:09,797
But...

244
00:30:11,098 --> 00:30:12,098
How did you know

245
00:30:13,363 --> 00:30:15,430
he is the criminal whom I spoke about?

246
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:20,697
I did not tell anyone

247
00:30:21,964 --> 00:30:24,364
about his name or his appearance.

248
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,731
Well...

249
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:37,764
Commandant.

250
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:40,497
Do you know

251
00:30:41,964 --> 00:30:43,765
his name or crime?

252
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:47,597
I do not, Your Highness.

253
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:55,530
We will find out once we ask him

254
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:57,664
just who...

255
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,664
...is behind him.

256
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,430
Get him up.

257
00:31:20,397 --> 00:31:21,237
Get up.

258
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,437
Your Highness.

259
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:41,831
Did you touch the criminal before
he was questioned again?

260
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:46,131
Your Highness.

261
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:18,131
Is Councilor Kim not present?

262
00:32:21,764 --> 00:32:24,931
I am here, Your Highness.

263
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:08,665
I devoted myself
to serving the nation for much longer

264
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:11,465
than your time as the interim king.

265
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:16,699
But I cannot enter the court

266
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:18,931
while I am being framed, can I?

267
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:21,831
Then...

268
00:33:23,464 --> 00:33:25,398
Are you turning in your title
as chief state councilor

269
00:33:26,098 --> 00:33:28,332
as well as your seal and robe?

270
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,764
I wish to put everything down

271
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:34,031
and prove my innocence,

272
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:36,098
so please allow it.

273
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:40,565
Use another means to prove your innocence.

274
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,031
We are all sinners.

275
00:33:47,098 --> 00:33:48,765
Please terminate us all.

276
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:52,831
Please terminate us all.

277
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:55,799
Please be understanding.

278
00:34:03,464 --> 00:34:05,898
If you believe in my loyalty,

279
00:34:06,764 --> 00:34:10,764
I will capture and bring all the enemies,

280
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:14,031
who tried to turn us against each other.

281
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,932
High treason?

282
00:34:32,997 --> 00:34:34,631
Hong Ra On, Age 18,
Suspect of Donggungjeon attack

283
00:34:38,564 --> 00:34:39,697
High treason?

284
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,798
My goodness.

285
00:34:41,864 --> 00:34:43,931
Goodness.

286
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:45,730
Let us go.

287
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:10,098
I think...

288
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:13,398
...it will be too difficult

289
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,964
for her to remain in the capital.

290
00:35:21,797 --> 00:35:23,364
Is she leaving soon?

291
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:30,563
Raon.

292
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,097
When you untangle a thread

293
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,565
and come across a knot

294
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:39,998
that is impossible to untangle,

295
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:45,799
you must cut it off without holding back.

296
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,298
Does she really...

297
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:12,031
...have no questions or wants

298
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,398
...to ask of me or hear from me?

299
00:36:22,897 --> 00:36:24,097
Nothing to argue.

300
00:36:25,564 --> 00:36:26,731
Nothing to request.

301
00:36:29,964 --> 00:36:32,565
Does she not want to see me
or wonder how I am doing?

302
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,897
Is she...

303
00:36:42,564 --> 00:36:43,631
...even alive?

304
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:51,831
Byeongyeon.

305
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,430
I know I said I would ask no questions,

306
00:36:58,464 --> 00:36:59,464
but I take it back.

307
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:08,430
Once.

308
00:37:11,064 --> 00:37:12,531
Just once.

309
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,898
Will you let me see her?

310
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:48,864
Raon.

311
00:37:52,464 --> 00:37:56,965
Should we live somewhere far away?

312
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,530
It could be Qing or an island.

313
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,897
Just somewhere far from this city,

314
00:38:08,864 --> 00:38:12,465
where no one recognizes us.

315
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:15,930
What do you think?

316
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,031
Let's do that. Let's leave here.

317
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,665
Let's live somewhere else.

318
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:50,831
But Mom,

319
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:53,797
before we leave,

320
00:38:54,764 --> 00:38:56,831
I have something to do.

321
00:38:58,731 --> 00:38:59,931
What is it?

322
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:05,565
I have to say a proper goodbye to someone

323
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:11,965
so that he can live well without me.

324
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:22,597
Even when someone replaces my place...

325
00:39:22,964 --> 00:39:25,431
Do you want him to forget about you?

326
00:39:27,964 --> 00:39:29,097
No.

327
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:33,897
I don't want him to feel sorry towards me.

328
00:40:40,363 --> 00:40:42,463
What an unfortunate fate.

329
00:40:43,464 --> 00:40:47,464
Her father was a rebel,
and she was in a performance troupe.

330
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:53,830
She led a good life
all by herself without her parents' help.

331
00:40:55,198 --> 00:41:00,565
You are not in love
with a rebel's daughter,

332
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,997
who pretended to be a eunuch, are you?

333
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,565
How clueless you are!

334
00:41:10,564 --> 00:41:13,564
I told you to let me know
if you needed a woman.

335
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,697
Did I not say to have
as many women as you want?

336
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:20,431
I said I would call as many as you want.

337
00:41:23,897 --> 00:41:25,097
Just like you, Grandfather?

338
00:41:26,964 --> 00:41:28,531
Do I just spend a night with anyone

339
00:41:29,363 --> 00:41:30,630
and abandon her afterwards?

340
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,530
Whether it's a woman, a man,
or even your own child,

341
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,498
you throw them away
when you don't need them anymore.

342
00:41:44,164 --> 00:41:46,564
Is that a tradition of our family?

343
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,131
Is that...

344
00:41:50,064 --> 00:41:51,898
...how you would like me to live?

345
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:56,864
What is it that you hate so much?

346
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:03,598
It is the picture in your head.

347
00:42:06,464 --> 00:42:08,864
You have been drawing a big picture,

348
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:11,931
having me in mind.

349
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:19,432
Right. I have made a farsighted plan
for our family and for your future.

350
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:22,632
Are you saying you hate
everything about it?

351
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:25,998
Yes, Grandfather.

352
00:42:26,564 --> 00:42:28,532
Even if it may be
poorly planned and humble,

353
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:31,631
I shall draw my own future.

354
00:43:11,664 --> 00:43:12,797
Raon.

355
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:30,030
Why did you want to see me, Your Highness?

356
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,364
Why are you being so cautious?

357
00:43:41,831 --> 00:43:43,665
Did anyone follow you?

358
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:48,464
Did asking you out

359
00:43:49,831 --> 00:43:51,765
put you in danger?

360
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:05,064
This moment I am with you

361
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,964
is the most dangerous moment for me.

362
00:44:12,397 --> 00:44:13,864
Only one word from you

363
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:17,097
could get me arrested.

364
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:29,931
Raon.

365
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:04,031
Put that down.

366
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:10,097
I shall not...

367
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:13,532
...order anyone to hurt you.

368
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:19,064
Must I really say such
an absurd thing like this?

369
00:45:20,764 --> 00:45:22,964
Your Highness, many things have changed

370
00:45:24,797 --> 00:45:26,631
since the time you did not know
about my identity.

371
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:30,098
What does that mean?

372
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:35,730
I heard His Majesty is not well

373
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:39,630
from the illness of his mind,

374
00:45:41,597 --> 00:45:43,931
thanks to my dad ten years ago.

375
00:45:52,031 --> 00:45:53,398
You might hurt yourself.

376
00:45:54,363 --> 00:45:55,864
Put down that knife.

377
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:00,864
You must resent my dad as well.

378
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:04,964
However,

379
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:08,397
I feel resentful as well.

380
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:11,599
Who accused my dad

381
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,730
of being an evil rebel and made him die?

382
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:29,031
I told you...

383
00:47:31,931 --> 00:47:33,632
I would believe whatever you tell me.

384
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,463
Even your lies.

385
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:49,964
I see what you mean, so stop it.

386
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,497
I shall never...

387
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,331
I shall never ask you to meet me again.

388
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:46,330
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

389
00:50:22,464 --> 00:50:25,131
His Highness will soon come
to take you to the palace.

390
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:29,797
Are you ready, Your Highness?

391
00:50:31,597 --> 00:50:32,764
Yes, Father.

392
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:37,764
I no longer have to stay
in the boring annex.

393
00:50:39,131 --> 00:50:42,365
The palace may seem large and splendid,

394
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,597
but it is not as it seems.

395
00:50:45,897 --> 00:50:48,464
With your straightforward personality,

396
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:51,597
it could be hard
to endure life in the palace.

397
00:50:53,497 --> 00:50:55,497
You are worried for nothing, Father.

398
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,630
You must have forgotten who I am.

399
00:51:04,098 --> 00:51:05,098
Hayeon.

400
00:51:10,564 --> 00:51:11,564
Yes, Father.

401
00:51:14,464 --> 00:51:17,731
This will be the last time
I call your name

402
00:51:18,797 --> 00:51:20,631
as your father.

403
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:26,131
Please...

404
00:51:27,564 --> 00:51:28,798
Be strong

405
00:51:29,597 --> 00:51:31,164
and take good care of yourself.

406
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:41,799
You are talking as if we cannot see
each other anymore.

407
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:23,864
Your Highness, you have grown up

408
00:52:24,564 --> 00:52:26,998
and are finally getting married.

409
00:52:27,697 --> 00:52:30,565
I am overwhelmed with joy.

410
00:52:32,363 --> 00:52:34,396
I still remember vividly
when I first met you

411
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:37,797
so little years ago.

412
00:52:39,597 --> 00:52:40,597
Your Highness,

413
00:52:41,064 --> 00:52:44,698
I wish you a long and healthy life.

414
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,697
I wish you happiness.

415
00:56:04,897 --> 00:56:07,097
What took you so long?

416
00:56:38,464 --> 00:56:41,664
The wedding ceremony will begin soon.

417
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:47,430
It will take Lady Cho time
to adjust to the palace.

418
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:50,765
Please take good care of her.

419
00:56:51,031 --> 00:56:54,598
Your Majesty,
the Chief Magistrate is here.

420
00:56:56,797 --> 00:56:57,797
Let him in.

421
00:57:04,397 --> 00:57:05,331
Your Majesty,

422
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:07,397
Your Majesty.

423
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:10,332
Please forgive me
for overstepping my boundaries.

424
00:58:02,797 --> 00:58:04,598
Your Highness!

425
00:58:05,098 --> 00:58:07,098
Your Highness, this is terrible!

426
00:58:07,931 --> 00:58:10,432
His Majesty has collapsed.

427
00:58:11,397 --> 00:58:12,397
What?

428
00:58:13,263 --> 00:58:16,030
I do not know how to tell you this, but...

429
00:58:17,031 --> 00:58:18,398
Well...

430
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,930
Stop stalling and tell me.

431
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,598
The Chief Magistrate
just advised His Majesty

432
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:27,303
that Hong Gyeongnae was arrested.
