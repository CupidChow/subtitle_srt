1
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:42,088
It may become a long trip.

2
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:47,375
But I promise to return...

3
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,750
...to you and to His Highness.

4
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,861
Your Highness.

5
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,588
Your Highness.

6
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,528
Your Highness! Your Highness!

7
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:13,686
Your Highness.

8
00:02:14,374 --> 00:02:15,374
Your Highness.

9
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,377
Your Highness.

10
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
Your Highness.

11
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:21,729
No...

12
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,126
Your Highness.

13
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:53,845
I dreamed about the day
I parted with you.

14
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,241
It was a happy dream, right?

15
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,460
At least,

16
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,379
I can see you there.

17
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:13,111
Are you in?

18
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:15,841
Are you inside?

19
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:24,541
What is it?

20
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,505
Is there an urgent patient?

21
00:03:26,946 --> 00:03:29,847
Yes. You must hurry
and come to the palace.

22
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:31,604
The palace?

23
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:33,672
What do you mean?

24
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,850
There was a poisoning attempt.

25
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,162
What?

26
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:47,067
The Crown Prince
is in serious condition right now.

27
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:19,742
CHAPTER 18 Love in the Moonlight

28
00:04:22,065 --> 00:04:22,905
Who are you?

29
00:04:27,622 --> 00:04:29,755
I am Jeong Yakyong.
The Crown Prince called for me.

30
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:32,517
Show your face.

31
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,293
She is a medical assistant.

32
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:45,282
Look...

33
00:04:45,444 --> 00:04:47,462
Doctor... You're here.

34
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,710
Why aren't you coming in?

35
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:51,934
Hurry. Hurry.

36
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:52,865
Hurry.

37
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,947
Hurry.

38
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:44,942
Your Highness.

39
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:52,174
I am here.

40
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,366
It's Raon.

41
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,367
Are you all right?

42
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:05,120
Your Highness.

43
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:18,498
The Crown Princess is here.

44
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,957
How is His Highness doing?

45
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,202
He just awoke.

46
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:44,789
Your Highness.

47
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,934
It's me, Hayeon.

48
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:56,066
Can you see me?

49
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:18,556
Please take a look.

50
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,640
Is she not pretty?

51
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,271
Your Highness.

52
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:35,178
Your Highness.

53
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:39,237
The Crown Prince collapsed
after drinking a poisoned tonic.

54
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:41,590
What?

55
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:44,393
Is that true?

56
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,668
Yes, Your Highness.

57
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,050
The tonic was clear.

58
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:04,234
That is why there was no change
in the taster and the silver spoon.

59
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,738
Then what happened?

60
00:09:09,305 --> 00:09:11,772
The poison was
on the outside of the bowl.

61
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,614
That is why the Crown Princess' ring
changed color.

62
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,278
I am glad you are safe.

63
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,133
You ingested very little amount of poison

64
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:35,056
and you are so healthy,

65
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,026
so there should not be a big problem.

66
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:42,215
Thank you for coming so quickly.

67
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:47,198
For the time being,
please do not tell anyone I am awake.

68
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:52,031
I want to see how happy they would be

69
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,809
to see someone they thought was dead.

70
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:56,967
Let us see.

71
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,433
Yes, Your Highness.

72
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:03,291
As you wish.

73
00:10:17,276 --> 00:10:20,144
Everyone is keeping quiet,

74
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:24,733
but there's a rumor in the palace
that the Crown Prince is slowly dying.

75
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:28,715
Is Donggungjeon still off limits?

76
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:30,593
Yes.

77
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:33,851
I heard even physicians
cannot go in freely.

78
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:38,891
What if the throne becomes vacant
before the Prince

79
00:10:38,982 --> 00:10:39,916
reaches the age of one?

80
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,904
It cannot be.

81
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,335
I was not hallucinating.

82
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:48,274
I heard you were gravely ill.

83
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:57,529
Do you know how afraid I was

84
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:01,088
that when I would open my eyes

85
00:13:01,828 --> 00:13:03,961
it would not be you?

86
00:13:07,506 --> 00:13:09,273
I feared it would not be you

87
00:13:10,934 --> 00:13:12,334
when I grabbed your hand,

88
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:15,263
so I hesitated for quite some time.

89
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,242
Your Highness.

90
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,059
I promised Master Jeong...

91
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,857
...that I would stay only for a few days

92
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,201
and not let anyone notice, even you.

93
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:45,169
So please...

94
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:52,220
Pretend you do not know.

95
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:35,821
I will pretend not to know
for a long time,

96
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:40,675
so stay by my side...

97
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:47,967
At least until I am fully recovered.

98
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,464
There was a royal command,

99
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,159
so we could not visit sooner.

100
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:56,698
I am sorry for worrying you.

101
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:00,351
Not at all.

102
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:03,346
Thank goodness you are not worse.

103
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,326
Consort Park.

104
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:10,761
Do you remember the night
my mother passed away?

105
00:16:13,865 --> 00:16:15,165
Yes, Your Highness.

106
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:21,016
She drank a tonic and fell ill.

107
00:16:22,154 --> 00:16:25,454
No poison was found in the tonic.

108
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,624
Yes, that is true.

109
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,642
Several workers in the palace

110
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:36,808
died without reason
and the rumors were rampant.

111
00:16:38,237 --> 00:16:39,404
However,

112
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,349
it was buried for lack of evidence.

113
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:48,867
Why are you bringing up
that heartbreaking story?

114
00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:53,570
The two incidents have similarities.

115
00:16:56,591 --> 00:17:00,292
Moreover, I think it was done
by the same person.

116
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:03,565
Thus,

117
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:05,607
this is a good time

118
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,223
to uncover the truth of my mother's death.

119
00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:13,992
What do you mean?

120
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:15,983
I have a hunch,

121
00:17:17,396 --> 00:17:18,796
but no evidence.

122
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:36,241
Did you look for...

123
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:38,629
...the baby?

124
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,492
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:44,455
Court Lady Han of Donggungjeon
is caring for her.

126
00:17:47,014 --> 00:17:48,314
Bring her here...

127
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:50,886
Right this moment.

128
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:52,750
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,100
If the same thing happens again,

130
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:19,647
I shall kill you first.

131
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:25,218
Halt.

132
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,463
"Kill the baby."

133
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,757
Is that what you ordered?

134
00:18:48,236 --> 00:18:49,970
What are you doing here?

135
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,963
Put her down.

136
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,024
Put the baby...

137
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,110
...down right now.

138
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:12,405
What do you think you are doing?

139
00:19:14,432 --> 00:19:15,832
Even if she dies,

140
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:19,095
she should at least cry as she wants.

141
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:22,781
Should she not?

142
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,015
What?

143
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,066
Even prisoners scream
before they are executed,

144
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:29,557
asking to be heard.

145
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,213
But all this baby can do...

146
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:38,683
...is cry.

147
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,265
Let her cry as she wants,

148
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:53,775
before she dies.

149
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,350
In front of her cruel mother,

150
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:03,266
who wants to get rid of her.

151
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,307
Do whatever you wish.

152
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,766
She has nothing to do with me.

153
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,051
This is...

154
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:18,908
...the last chance I am giving you.

155
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:23,903
The only way,

156
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:27,549
for both you and that baby...

157
00:20:30,018 --> 00:20:32,151
...to survive.

158
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,476
Admit that she is...

159
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:42,099
...your baby, not the Prince.

160
00:20:56,721 --> 00:20:58,222
I do not understand...

161
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:03,038
...what you are saying at all.

162
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,797
It's me, Princess.

163
00:22:47,676 --> 00:22:50,610
Are you surprised by how I am dressed?

164
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:03,687
Eunuch Hong.

165
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,383
Did you become a medical assistant,

166
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:08,073
because of my sick brother?

167
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:13,371
Yes. I will stay here only
until His Highness recovers.

168
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:17,994
But...

169
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:20,420
Do you have another concern?

170
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:32,127
Eunuch Hong,

171
00:23:32,982 --> 00:23:36,015
may I ask you one more favor again?

172
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:06,896
Princess.

173
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:11,124
Do you need to find something in here?

174
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:50,492
What were you going to deliver
to the Crown Prince?

175
00:24:50,804 --> 00:24:55,305
Is there anything you do not want
His Highness to see?

176
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,029
If you believe

177
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:01,405
you can bury the truth by killing me,

178
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,560
do what you want to do.

179
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,873
Princess. Are you all right?

180
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:41,793
There.

181
00:25:44,564 --> 00:25:47,131
There...

182
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:52,278
Princess.

183
00:26:02,135 --> 00:26:03,069
Here?

184
00:26:43,465 --> 00:26:44,699
Under the floor board?

185
00:26:45,257 --> 00:26:46,257
Yes.

186
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:49,658
Are you sure it was Hong Raon?

187
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:51,481
Yes.

188
00:26:51,733 --> 00:26:53,967
I lost her because of the eunuchs,

189
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,828
but I am certain.

190
00:26:57,233 --> 00:26:58,233
Shall I bring her?

191
00:27:00,253 --> 00:27:02,221
Kill her if you must.

192
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:06,672
I will go.

193
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:25,433
I know you adore the wench.

194
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:27,724
Why would I entrust her to you?

195
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:31,656
I want to test

196
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,311
my feelings for her.

197
00:27:35,357 --> 00:27:38,490
Are you disappointed that she is

198
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,082
with the Crown Prince
and does not let you in?

199
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:43,042
Yes.

200
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:47,368
I need my family to be in power

201
00:27:48,422 --> 00:27:50,290
so that I can take what I desire.

202
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:54,581
Fine. Go and bring her.

203
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,500
Did Hong Raon

204
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:24,331
really find this?

205
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,988
Yes, Your Majesty.

206
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,584
Yes.

207
00:28:44,002 --> 00:28:45,603
It is right.

208
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:50,958
It is definitely your mother's.

209
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,000
Crown Prince,

210
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:24,678
I desperately hope that by the time
this letter reaches you,

211
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:28,992
it will be after you have overcome
all sadness and hatred.

212
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:37,066
Please do not forget that your throne,

213
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:39,985
which I gave my life to protect,

214
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:42,732
is not for you to be in power,

215
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:44,849
but to give hope to Joseon.

216
00:30:11,691 --> 00:30:12,559
Hong Raon.

217
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:22,867
Master.

218
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:25,398
I need you to come with me.

219
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,442
Where?

220
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,190
Master.

221
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,239
Master.

222
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:34,018
Master. If Lord Kim were to find out...

223
00:31:34,286 --> 00:31:35,286
What?

224
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,271
Were you surprised?

225
00:31:57,885 --> 00:31:58,885
Master!

226
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,679
Master.

227
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,961
Master.

228
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,027
Are you all right?

229
00:33:24,301 --> 00:33:25,701
Please do not cry.

230
00:33:30,714 --> 00:33:32,148
I do not want to be...

231
00:33:34,757 --> 00:33:37,191
...a weak man who makes a maiden cry.

232
00:33:44,614 --> 00:33:46,014
Master.

233
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,828
Look how badly injured you are.

234
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:56,741
How can you make a joke?

235
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,004
Please do not be sad, either.

236
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:19,833
You've always made me laugh.

237
00:34:24,381 --> 00:34:27,581
I am so sorry I always hurt you.

238
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:37,532
You are the painting
that I have always wanted...

239
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:39,325
...to paint.

240
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,574
It is fine as long as I was happy...

241
00:34:48,481 --> 00:34:50,382
...while painting you.

242
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,258
So...

243
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:00,015
Please...

244
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,165
Be happy.

245
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,699
Master.

246
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,881
Please get up.

247
00:35:39,813 --> 00:35:41,280
The ground is cold.

248
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:45,269
Master.

249
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:51,604
Master.

250
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:53,735
Master.

251
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:01,661
Master.

252
00:36:09,527 --> 00:36:12,194
I simply wanted to give birth to a prince.

253
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:17,064
No, I wanted to at least
pretend to have one.

254
00:36:18,548 --> 00:36:21,848
It is a natural ambition
and obligation as the Queen.

255
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,573
Yes.

256
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:29,075
But the greater reason...

257
00:36:31,182 --> 00:36:33,349
...was to be acknowledged...

258
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,491
...by you.

259
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:42,860
I wanted to help my family,

260
00:36:45,554 --> 00:36:48,854
so I dared to steal the King's seed.

261
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:54,030
I warned you, but every time
you open your mouth...

262
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:56,878
I may be inadequate,
but I am still your child.

263
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,621
Have you ever loved me?

264
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:10,268
Have you ever had affection for me
as your child?

265
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,201
As the mother who threw away her child
to keep her position as the Queen,

266
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,692
you do not even deserve to ask that.

267
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,010
That is right.

268
00:37:31,557 --> 00:37:32,957
What you said makes me realize,

269
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:37,011
that I really am your daughter.

270
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:41,575
Whoever is in my way,

271
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:45,609
I can throw away or kill them with ease.

272
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:50,118
I resemble you very much.

273
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,690
You said you wished to gain my recognition.

274
00:37:54,934 --> 00:37:58,334
That is not possible
for a lowly woman like you.

275
00:38:00,649 --> 00:38:03,963
Just be grateful
for your position as the Queen,

276
00:38:04,054 --> 00:38:05,621
and keep it well.

277
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,467
Councilor Kim.

278
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:22,272
Is everything really true?

279
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:43,672
Ten Years Earlier

280
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:48,433
Do you not realize how dangerous
it is to fall for Western Learning?

281
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:52,602
You even dragged
the Crown Prince into this.

282
00:38:54,061 --> 00:38:55,562
Those are merely petty things,

283
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:57,554
that I got through the envoy.

284
00:39:02,231 --> 00:39:03,442
The True Principles of Catholicism

285
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:04,833
"The True Principles of Catholicism".

286
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:09,076
It's a dangerous book
about the Western religion.

287
00:39:10,261 --> 00:39:12,561
Why are you showing this book to me?

288
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:14,598
You have read this book

289
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,989
before you became the Queen,
have you not?

290
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,487
I only read it out of curiosity.

291
00:39:23,026 --> 00:39:24,760
I do not believe in the Western religion.

292
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:27,518
Who would know what is on your mind?

293
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:32,682
I heard you taught the Crown Prince
about an equal society.

294
00:39:34,461 --> 00:39:35,828
You must be aware...

295
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,066
...that Hong Gyeongnae's rebellion,

296
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,494
left deep scars to His Majesty
and all the people.

297
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,448
Thus, I only wished...

298
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:49,258
...that the Crown Prince would cherish
each and every one of his subjects.

299
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,370
I shall give you a choice, Your Highness.

300
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:57,262
Would you be dethroned...

301
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,254
...and make the Crown Prince
a criminal's son,

302
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:04,850
or step down by yourself,

303
00:40:05,765 --> 00:40:07,932
and remain as the flawless Queen?

304
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:32,292
Master Kim.

305
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:33,918
Something terrible happened.

306
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,006
Your grandson...

307
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,139
Section Chief Kim is...

308
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:13,042
Let Criminal Kim Heon hear.

309
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,384
You scorned the Royal Family
and the Royal Court

310
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:19,124
by fabricating the identity of Queen Kim.

311
00:41:20,556 --> 00:41:22,556
You made an attempt
to poison the Crown Prince.

312
00:41:24,165 --> 00:41:25,932
You assassinated the late Queen Yun,

313
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:28,478
and kept it a secret for a long time.

314
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:33,700
Kim Heon will be divested
of his title as councilor,

315
00:41:34,266 --> 00:41:38,366
and be executed along with
the two former ministers,

316
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:40,692
Kim Uigyo and Kim Geungyo,

317
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:42,183
who sent assailants to Donggungjeon.

318
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,471
Queen Kim will be dethroned...

319
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,872
...for leaving indelible scars
to the Royal Family,

320
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,595
by fabricating her identity,

321
00:41:52,568 --> 00:41:54,402
and switching the Princess
with another baby.

322
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,398
Chief Magistrate.

323
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:14,337
Let me look around
Yunseong's room for the last time.

324
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:22,722
Thank you.

325
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:29,412
If I put on the royal robe,

326
00:43:29,503 --> 00:43:30,603
do I become a crown prince?

327
00:43:31,185 --> 00:43:32,185
No.

328
00:43:32,462 --> 00:43:35,495
The clothes would not make you
a crown prince,

329
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:39,743
but it would help you
understand the feelings.

330
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:42,992
How did you feel when you wore my clothes?

331
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:54,911
Your clothes felt
as heavy as my royal robe.

332
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:37,141
I hope you will be a king
with a clear vision.

333
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:40,867
When you are in a high position,

334
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:43,759
you are apt to neglect
those in lower positions.

335
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:48,392
I hope you will be a good listener.

336
00:45:49,094 --> 00:45:52,194
You should not listen only
to those who speak near you.

337
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,750
Please take care of all your subjects,

338
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:59,108
as if each one of them
were your only subject.

339
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,689
Can you promise me,

340
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:10,245
that you will be such king?

341
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:12,936
Yes,

342
00:46:13,629 --> 00:46:14,629
I shall bear in mind...

343
00:46:15,516 --> 00:46:17,117
...what you have taught me.

344
00:46:18,588 --> 00:46:20,255
Please watch over me,

345
00:46:21,733 --> 00:46:22,733
Mother.

346
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:35,908
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

347
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:39,214
"Criminal Hong Raon,
receive the royal command."

348
00:46:40,554 --> 00:46:42,288
"Even though you committed high treason,"

349
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:43,875
"as the rebel's daughter,"

350
00:46:44,998 --> 00:46:46,194
"you contributed
to strengthening the stability,"

351
00:46:46,284 --> 00:46:48,484
"and to regaining the honor
of the Royal Family."

352
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:50,533
"I commend your effort..."

353
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:53,466
"...and grant you
a pardon of all your crimes."

354
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:05,281
Crown Princess.

355
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,247
Are you even aware of what it means...

356
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:10,747
...to remove your title
as the Crown Princess?

357
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,042
Yes, Your Majesty.

358
00:47:15,787 --> 00:47:18,187
Even if you step down from your position,

359
00:47:18,312 --> 00:47:21,312
you have to live alone
for the rest of your life.

360
00:47:22,316 --> 00:47:23,316
Yes, Your Majesty.

361
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:25,585
I am aware of that.

362
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:30,847
Do you really wish to live that way?

363
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:33,610
Your Majesty.

364
00:47:35,633 --> 00:47:41,400
I knew that His Highness
did not have feelings for me.

365
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,106
I thought he would open
his heart to me one day...

366
00:47:49,197 --> 00:47:51,764
...if I stayed by his side.

367
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:54,774
I believed so.

368
00:47:58,586 --> 00:47:59,686
However,

369
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:04,429
as I kept blaming myself
for not being able...

370
00:48:04,847 --> 00:48:07,281
...to comfort His Highness
in his tough times,

371
00:48:08,632 --> 00:48:11,732
I realized how foolish I was.

372
00:48:17,008 --> 00:48:19,809
Your majesty, please grant my request,

373
00:48:20,972 --> 00:48:24,172
so I can live with confidence
though I'll be alone.

374
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,301
I do not wish to remain
as a burden to His Highness.

375
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:49,181
Excuse me.

376
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:52,158
Which way is it to the dock?

377
00:48:53,241 --> 00:48:54,541
Go that way.

378
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:04,067
Your position will be annulled
as the crown princess.

379
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:09,291
I hope you will find a man
who loves you as you are,

380
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,623
and live a happy life.

381
00:49:14,057 --> 00:49:15,824
The sun feels very nice.

382
00:49:17,064 --> 00:49:19,164
-Let us hurry up.
-Yes, my lady.

383
00:49:30,151 --> 00:49:32,318
All rise for His Majesty!

384
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:34,176
One Year Later

385
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,280
Your Majesty.

386
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,351
Why do you not sit on the royal seat?

387
00:50:57,189 --> 00:50:58,990
I shall keep sitting here.

388
00:51:02,252 --> 00:51:04,686
The class difference
between me and my people...

389
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:07,738
The distance from you...

390
00:51:09,086 --> 00:51:10,687
...I hope you understand...

391
00:51:11,472 --> 00:51:14,906
...my will to narrow these gaps.

392
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,537
Eunuchs have
very important responsibilities,

393
00:51:50,038 --> 00:51:53,672
of keeping the Royal Family safe and well.

394
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,058
We become one,

395
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:58,367
to serve His Majesty
as his hands and feet,

396
00:51:58,984 --> 00:52:01,284
and to be the light that shines his way...

397
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:03,220
Eunuch Do.

398
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:07,052
It's not just me with this feeling, right?

399
00:52:07,425 --> 00:52:10,447
It's the feeling we once had...

400
00:52:10,538 --> 00:52:12,086
...some time ago at some place.

401
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:14,145
We share a common destiny.

402
00:52:41,879 --> 00:52:43,879
Those are 99 flowers, Your Highness.

403
00:52:44,223 --> 00:52:46,523
-The last one is...
-Is the last one me?

404
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:48,497
That is silly.

405
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:59,149
That is correct. It is hard
to tell you apart from the flowers.

406
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:03,712
Your Highness.

407
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:06,535
Will you marry me?

408
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:11,801
Deokho...

409
00:53:16,396 --> 00:53:19,429
If you marry me, you will not be promoted.

410
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:21,376
Would that be all right?

411
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:29,460
I will be happy as long as I am with you.

412
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:31,237
I would not mind that.

413
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:37,966
All I need is you.

414
00:53:39,167 --> 00:53:40,167
Myungeun.

415
00:53:58,268 --> 00:53:59,735
Here I go!

416
00:53:59,826 --> 00:54:01,260
-Great!
-That is good!

417
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,381
-What was that?
-Goodness.

418
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:07,944
-What a shame.
-It is our turn now.

419
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,201
Would you like to try this, My Lord?

420
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:12,931
My Lord.

421
00:54:13,022 --> 00:54:14,990
-Please try it, My Lord.
-Please try it.

422
00:54:15,081 --> 00:54:17,220
-Please come here, My Lord.
-Please come.

423
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:20,858
Have you heard
of the moonlight drawn by clouds?

424
00:54:22,896 --> 00:54:25,597
You draw clouds to make the moon shine.

425
00:54:26,516 --> 00:54:27,356
Is that what you mean?

426
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:32,358
-Ready, throw!
-Throw!

427
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,681
He is not like the sun
that shines over us.

428
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:39,965
He is the king who shines brighter...

429
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:41,886
...when he's with his people.

430
00:54:42,283 --> 00:54:43,383
Throw!

431
00:54:48,628 --> 00:54:50,529
I think that is how His Majesty is.

432
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:53,652
So you wish to remain as a cloud...

433
00:54:54,135 --> 00:54:55,769
...for His Majesty.

434
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,477
Is that what you wanted to say?

435
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:22,031
Top ten most popular books

436
00:55:24,036 --> 00:55:24,936
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

437
00:55:29,257 --> 00:55:32,324
You were so busy writing a great novel.

438
00:55:34,106 --> 00:55:35,341
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

439
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:37,490
What is this?

440
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:41,480
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

441
00:55:41,919 --> 00:55:44,553
The sales depend greatly
on the book covers.

442
00:55:44,644 --> 00:55:46,311
I had no choice.

443
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:01,991
I shall make you pay for this.

444
00:56:09,663 --> 00:56:10,863
In here?

445
00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:16,983
What are you thinking?

446
00:56:18,948 --> 00:56:20,849
Pay me one bun for each book you sell.

447
00:56:25,285 --> 00:56:27,886
My figure is too valuable
to be used like this.

448
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:39,733
Raon.

449
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,371
"Love in the Moonlight"...

450
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:47,542
What is the book about?

451
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:51,600
In a faraway country,

452
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:54,825
a very beautiful crown prince lived.

453
00:56:56,019 --> 00:56:58,319
Though he was ignorant of the world,

454
00:56:58,808 --> 00:57:00,975
with a short temper...

455
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,540
Was using my figure
without permission not enough?

456
00:57:04,123 --> 00:57:05,524
Are you now using my private life as well?

457
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,294
Let me finish.

458
00:57:10,457 --> 00:57:11,924
That Crown Prince...

459
00:57:12,286 --> 00:57:14,187
...goes through many things,

460
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:17,372
and matures into the greatest king ever.

461
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:19,345
That's the premise.

462
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:23,556
Is that your hope?

463
00:57:27,107 --> 00:57:28,107
No.

464
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:33,400
I simply peeked at the world...

465
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:37,110
...that you will be making.

466
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:52,472
Who are you?

467
00:57:55,988 --> 00:57:58,188
Do you mean me as the first of your people...

468
00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:00,889
...in your nation?

469
00:58:08,748 --> 00:58:11,482
Your first love who somehow went to you...

470
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:14,048
...as a eunuch?

471
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:22,832
Then who am I?

472
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,747
You are Raon,

473
00:58:36,339 --> 00:58:37,474
who fills my world.
