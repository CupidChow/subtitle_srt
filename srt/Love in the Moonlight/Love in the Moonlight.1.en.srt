00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:03,416
The Joseon Romance We Didn't Know

2
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,065
The reason I came all the way here,

3
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:18,305
isn't about me.

4
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:21,498
It's about a close friend of mine.

5
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:25,903
He's been doing weird things,
so I'm worried.

6
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,340
What weird things do you mean?

7
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:31,417
He walks as though
he's completely out of it,

8
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,437
walks into a wall and hits his forehead.

9
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,490
He drinks alcohol, which he can't handle.

10
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,781
And gets into fights.

11
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:41,789
Which is so not like him.

12
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:46,523
Whenever people talk
about a certain woman,

13
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:48,905
you seem to get angry.

14
00:01:49,664 --> 00:01:50,899
That's right!

15
00:01:54,097 --> 00:01:55,530
"It won't work."

16
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,190
"That relationship will never work out."

17
00:01:57,256 --> 00:02:00,693
You're upset because
your friends keep stopping you.

18
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:03,220
How did you know?

19
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:06,856
So you're indeed a fortuneteller
when it comes to romance.

20
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,669
The rumors are true.

21
00:02:12,038 --> 00:02:15,975
My life has turned into hell,
because of that wom...

22
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:20,279
Because of that woman.

23
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,950
Don't you worry. I understand.

24
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:27,362
No man has ever been killed...

25
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,388
...for telling a woman he loves her.

26
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:31,496
So...

27
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:35,739
Don't despair.

28
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:45,316
Are you going for a walk?

29
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:52,417
Are you all right?

30
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,987
Enjoy your walk.

31
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,507
She won't even look at you.

32
00:03:04,757 --> 00:03:06,225
The typical wall.

33
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:08,761
Wall?

34
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:13,529
I'm saying she has a wall
guarding her heart.

35
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:17,167
What must I do?

36
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,140
Don't do anything for 10 days.

37
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:23,643
What if she forgets me forever?

38
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:27,647
If a man who is always around disappears,

39
00:03:27,914 --> 00:03:29,982
there's no woman that wouldn't be curious.

40
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:33,152
Then, on the 10th day...

41
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:00,580
My Lady, are you hurt?

42
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:01,914
What are you doing?

43
00:04:06,686 --> 00:04:08,020
Are you all right?

44
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,523
Yes, I am fine.

45
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,825
Do not do this again.

46
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:27,073
No.

47
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:28,899
I'll block them all even in the future.

48
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,543
Any trees that fall,

49
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,980
any stones that come at you,
people mocking you.

50
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,874
I will block them all.

51
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:43,523
Tell me.

52
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:46,993
Where were you...

53
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,562
...for these last 10 days?

54
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,868
A Man from Hwaseong, A Woman from Gunsan

55
00:05:29,635 --> 00:05:30,736
The Joseon Romance We Didn't Know

56
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:33,539
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

57
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:40,079
CHAPTER ONE Destiny in the Moonlight

58
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:50,690
Your Highness, are you awake?

59
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,616
Your Highness, we beg your forgiveness,

60
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:58,317
but it is too urgent a matter.
Bless us with your mer...

61
00:05:58,408 --> 00:05:59,565
Go in. Go in.

62
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,466
Go in. Go.

63
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,068
Go. Go!

64
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,508
- His Majesty is...
- Don't bother.

65
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:20,786
Yes, Your Majesty.

66
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,460
Your Majesty.

67
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:29,795
Your Excellency.

68
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,162
Last time you studied

69
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,208
"Admonition on Rising Early
and Retiring Late".

70
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,021
Do you remember?

71
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:38,281
"When the cock crows,"

72
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,477
"and you're awake,"

73
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:42,108
"brush your teeth,"

74
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,383
"comb your hair
and don your robes and cap."

75
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:47,928
"Then open your books
and partake in the company..."

76
00:06:48,414 --> 00:06:50,316
"...of sages and wise men."

77
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:52,624
"Master Confucius is seated,"

78
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:56,689
"and Yan Hui and Zengzi
attend before and behind."

79
00:06:58,524 --> 00:07:00,159
What does that mean?

80
00:07:00,298 --> 00:07:02,700
A scholar must sit erect, compose his body,

81
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,694
and recollect his mind
as luminously as the rising sun.

82
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:07,900
He has to be solemn,
silent, ordered, and even.

83
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:12,271
Yes, may Your Highness
cherish this wisdom...

84
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:16,776
...in your heart
and reflect upon it at all times.

85
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:18,344
So I shall,

86
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,378
Master.

87
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:25,952
Seeing the Crown Prince
focusing on his studies...

88
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,120
...warms my heart.

89
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,076
My goodness.

90
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,656
What was it again...

91
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,290
- ...about dressing properly?
- "Dressing properly?"

92
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:07,827
"Don't..."

93
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,698
Don't mock me for asking something simple.

94
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:19,472
Why?

95
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,625
It even says to laugh three times.

96
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:29,616
HA HA HA

97
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:33,686
How can they be doing this?
This is ridiculous!

98
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:38,991
Bring it to me.

99
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:41,327
Yes, Your Majesty.

100
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,192
Your Majesty!

101
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,234
We don't deserve your mercy!

102
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,030
We don't deserve your mercy!

103
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:22,535
That... that fool!

104
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:37,458
KIM HEON
Chief State Councilor, Queen's Father

105
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:46,592
I followed what you said,
for a pupil should obey his teacher.

106
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,096
I feel like I see more faults.

107
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:51,711
Your Highness, I...

108
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,266
I mean...

109
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,901
Ahh... Really.

110
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:57,134
You should be teaching your pupil.

111
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,174
One should not pretend to teach.

112
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,475
And yet, look at you.

113
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:06,395
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

114
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:07,554
I ought to...

115
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:11,731
It was a joke.

116
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:14,320
You did nothing wrong.

117
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:18,393
The wind is at fault
for appearing without warning.

118
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,263
Your Highness, what is that?

119
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,999
A paper that flies through the sky.

120
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,418
It's an air-paper.

121
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:47,053
- Look who's here!
- If it isn't you!

122
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:49,488
Have a great day!

123
00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,427
Who's that young man
that everyone makes a fuss about?

124
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:57,330
What? You don't know who that is?

125
00:10:57,597 --> 00:11:00,900
He's born to succeed.
He's meant to be big.

126
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,069
He'd do anything for money!

127
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:05,171
He is Samnom!

128
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,367
Apply to become eunuchs
You will be paid 10 nyang

129
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:39,171
That amount is more than enough
to pay all my debt.

130
00:11:41,173 --> 00:11:43,209
Eunuch...

131
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:59,392
You should get up
if you smell the medicine.

132
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:00,615
Why are you turning around?

133
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,495
You drink it.

134
00:12:02,995 --> 00:12:06,490
I can't even afford to eat
with the lenders coming after us.

135
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:08,134
Imagine those darned tonics.

136
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:09,777
Father.

137
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:11,422
Don't act like that, just get up...

138
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:14,040
Ahh... Really. I told you to stop!

139
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,509
Why do you keep bugging me?

140
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:18,936
You're not related to me,

141
00:12:19,027 --> 00:12:20,680
and you're not carrying my family name.

142
00:12:21,213 --> 00:12:23,416
Why won't you leave?

143
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,312
Come on.

144
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:28,024
Stop telling me to leave.
I have nowhere to go.

145
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:30,736
You found me and raised me,
so take responsibility.

146
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:33,196
It's because I'm just a burden to you!

147
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,043
You said you'd make money
and find your mother.

148
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,853
How long will you pretend to be a boy?

149
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:45,006
- That again.
- Samnom, are you home?

150
00:12:45,686 --> 00:12:46,687
Yes!

151
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,109
Stop the nonsense.
Take your medicine and get better.

152
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:54,958
Raon.

153
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,623
I told you not to call me that.

154
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:05,893
I'm Samnom. Hong Samnom.

155
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,063
If you don't return one day,

156
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:10,698
I'd be happy.

157
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:13,267
You know what I mean.

158
00:13:15,714 --> 00:13:17,048
I won't be happy.

159
00:13:18,306 --> 00:13:19,307
I'll be back.

160
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:29,317
Young Master, I brought Samnom.

161
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:37,558
Here you are!

162
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,759
Ehh... Really.

163
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:44,194
What is with that outfit?

164
00:13:45,581 --> 00:13:47,850
I made it. How is it?

165
00:13:47,974 --> 00:13:49,876
It's a camouflage uniform for war.

166
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:54,475
You can't tell if I'm a tree
or if the tree is me.

167
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:56,410
Right?

168
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:59,373
Sure. Well... Anyway.

169
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,899
What was the response?

170
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,218
Let's see.

171
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,818
"She worries if the pollen makes me sneeze."

172
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:12,727
She is worried about me.

173
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:17,390
What will you write in response?

174
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,809
What shall I write?

175
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,402
First tell me what's in your heart.

176
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:23,927
I'm only writing on your behalf,

177
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:25,673
not making up stories, right?

178
00:14:26,105 --> 00:14:27,907
Yes, that's right.

179
00:14:29,113 --> 00:14:31,845
Soon, I'll be leaving
with a performance troupe.

180
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,199
For how long
will you simply exchange letters?

181
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:36,350
What else would we do?

182
00:14:38,886 --> 00:14:40,354
Don't you want to meet her?

183
00:14:44,225 --> 00:14:46,360
Perhaps, you don't really want to see her.

184
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:47,395
I...

185
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:48,904
...do.

186
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,165
Your eyes are
as brilliant as black pearls.

187
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:58,272
Your nose is as sharp
as the crescent moon.

188
00:14:58,906 --> 00:15:01,142
"Your lips are red like pomegranate?"

189
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:08,082
Who is it?

190
00:15:10,418 --> 00:15:13,321
Who is seducing my sister
with these terrible lies?

191
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:14,479
PRINCESS MYUNGEUN Crown Prince's Sister

192
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:15,590
I don't know, Your Highness.

193
00:15:16,175 --> 00:15:18,011
I only pick up the letter...

194
00:15:18,102 --> 00:15:20,638
...that's placed at the promised time
and location.

195
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:23,130
I'm telling the truth, Your Highness.

196
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,705
"I want to meet you
before the end of spring."

197
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:36,210
"May I wait under the tree
in Mount Mongmyeok?"

198
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:40,982
May he or may he not?

199
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,050
He may not.

200
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:48,022
Then what will you tell Princess Myungeun?

201
00:15:48,293 --> 00:15:49,294
Pardon me?

202
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:53,997
I'll tell her that she cannot go out.

203
00:15:54,088 --> 00:15:55,429
She'll probably want to.

204
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,547
I'll say that Your Highness
is very concerned for her.

205
00:15:57,638 --> 00:15:59,207
She'll only blame me.

206
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,306
How about I tell her
I didn't get any response?

207
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:06,007
That sounds good. You're dismissed.

208
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:07,379
Yes, Your Highness.

209
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:23,524
I know why people
compare the Donggungjeon to dung.

210
00:16:24,425 --> 00:16:27,194
How could they stop paying us
for three days?

211
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:30,314
They should just eat bean sprouts
off a beggar's dunghole.

212
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:33,411
Stop talking about dung!

213
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:36,056
I'm eating right now.

214
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:38,524
I'm eating bean sprouts now, too.

215
00:16:44,784 --> 00:16:46,147
What they're doing is horrible.

216
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,284
In case the superiors
find the smell disgusting,

217
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,826
we have to eat bland food
without any seasoning.

218
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:55,356
We also have to chew on bitter cloves.

219
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,058
I'm very disappointed.

220
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:01,194
If there's any new
smart and determined eunuch,

221
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:02,753
I should ask for one more.

222
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:06,881
There's only so many of us
to run this huge palace.

223
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:09,317
- Eunuch Jang.
- Yes?

224
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:11,580
We're in trouble. His Highness...

225
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:12,739
What happened to him?

226
00:17:12,805 --> 00:17:15,816
He took off his royal robes
and disappeared again.

227
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:18,973
Oh my goodness!

228
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:41,118
Your Majesty.

229
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,545
Ask the queen's father.

230
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,582
Your Majesty.

231
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:48,575
I said ask the queen's father!

232
00:17:53,813 --> 00:17:54,948
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

233
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:58,582
How dare you, little scoundrel?

234
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,530
Who are you?

235
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:02,962
You little...

236
00:18:03,053 --> 00:18:05,758
How dare you... And who might you be?

237
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,595
You really want to know?
I am none other than...

238
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,225
You answer first!

239
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,008
I live inside the palace over there.

240
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:22,445
I go this way, turn right
and go this way again.

241
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,444
In that huge Donggungjeon...

242
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:25,778
Wait!

243
00:18:26,914 --> 00:18:30,518
Wait. Come to think of it,

244
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:32,938
I also live there?

245
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,826
Fa... Father?

246
00:18:41,861 --> 00:18:42,962
Crown Prince?

247
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,532
You fool!

248
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:49,321
Instead of studying like I told you,

249
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:52,305
you're always outside acting vulgar.

250
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:57,510
Let me play, too.

251
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,560
You two!

252
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,020
You dare insult the name of the king
and his crown prince and hope to...

253
00:19:11,424 --> 00:19:12,325
...survive?

254
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,469
You call yourself a janggu player, huh?

255
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,361
But you only know how to talk.

256
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,374
You'd better tie the broken string.

257
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,911
I tuned my janggu this morning.
What is he saying?

258
00:19:32,913 --> 00:19:33,780
Ohh... Really.

259
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:38,722
Now what?

260
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,303
Wait. What are you doing?

261
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,752
- What are you doing?
- Take off your clothes.

262
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:50,439
Put this on.

263
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,033
He told you to undress
and put his clothes on.

264
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,538
Whenever he's nervous or surprised,
our Young Master sta-ta-ta-ta-tammers.

265
00:19:58,605 --> 00:19:59,562
That's right.

266
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:00,874
Ahh... I see.

267
00:20:01,193 --> 00:20:03,028
Why do I have to undress?

268
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:07,566
Go to Mount Mongmyeok...

269
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:11,294
You must go to Mount Mongmyeok
today on his behalf.

270
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:12,664
That's right.

271
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:16,180
Did she reply that she also wants to meet?

272
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:20,272
Her class is way too...

273
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:24,379
It's impossible
since she's too high-class.

274
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,673
- You must take care of it.
- That's right.

275
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:31,804
What do you mean I should take care of it?

276
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:34,415
I wrote the letters on your behalf,

277
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:37,832
but I thought that
your feelings toward her were sincere.

278
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,300
Were they not?

279
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,497
Let's say I go out there on your behalf.

280
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:44,712
That means I have to act like a nobleman.

281
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:47,086
What if I get caught?

282
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:49,389
I'll be killed.

283
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,667
Here, Samnom!

284
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,895
- Take this money.
- He'll pay you well.

285
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:57,030
That's right.

286
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:03,403
Who do you think I am?

287
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:05,104
This isn't all.

288
00:21:10,513 --> 00:21:14,183
You can't control people
with money like this.

289
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,909
- Shall I put these clothes on?
- Hurry up.

290
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,103
Hurry up.

291
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:42,735
Now that I'm so close to you
after being far away,

292
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:47,119
I can't hide my nervousness.

293
00:21:57,221 --> 00:21:59,857
Expressing how I feel about you
only in words,

294
00:22:00,557 --> 00:22:03,927
can't satisfy my yearning for you.

295
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:08,015
I only see you with my eyes.

296
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:11,171
I like the voice.

297
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,988
Where's the woman
as beautiful as a flower,

298
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:30,894
and why is there a man instead?

299
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:35,995
We can't be together anyway.

300
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:38,498
I beg for forgiveness for loving someone

301
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,500
I should never have.

302
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:49,843
I wondered how high-class she was,

303
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:52,011
but it's a man!

304
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:53,965
Goodness.

305
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,783
This isn't all.

306
00:23:15,535 --> 00:23:17,637
Your words were very moving.

307
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,309
I couldn't help but get teary-eyed...

308
00:23:28,882 --> 00:23:29,821
...as I read this part.

309
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:41,227
When you get teary, you should just cry.

310
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:43,642
What?

311
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,801
You two who suffered from being
in a love that isn't allowed.

312
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:51,234
It's all right.

313
00:23:51,404 --> 00:23:53,006
I understand everything.

314
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:58,011
What was your intention
behind wanting to meet?

315
00:23:58,378 --> 00:24:00,146
You knew it was pointless.

316
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:05,018
How can you stop your feelings,

317
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:07,220
just because you're not allowed...

318
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:10,490
...to love each other?

319
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,594
I only have one intention.

320
00:24:16,596 --> 00:24:18,164
All I wanted was...

321
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,099
...to deliver,

322
00:24:21,234 --> 00:24:22,268
my deep love for you.

323
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:28,908
I'm sure you yearned for him.

324
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,811
Instead of staying here like this,

325
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,988
let's forget all the biases
in this world today,

326
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,083
and make a memory...

327
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:39,352
...that we'll remember forever.

328
00:24:41,888 --> 00:24:42,989
Trust me.

329
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:44,424
Let's go.

330
00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:51,264
Welcome.

331
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:57,593
Goodness, look at this fool.

332
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:58,752
Clean up right now.

333
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:03,969
The gukbap here is amazing.

334
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:07,247
The owner of this place...

335
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,749
...used to be a court lady
in the royal kitchen.

336
00:25:12,196 --> 00:25:14,465
Those rascals.

337
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:17,223
How much kimchi are they eating?
Those sons of ...

338
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:21,410
Are you laughing, you fools?

339
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:25,541
Ma'am, aren't you being
too rude to your customers?

340
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:27,100
You're the one being rude.

341
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,069
I need to make a profit, you ...

342
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:39,512
Why do you find her cursing funny?

343
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,248
- Are you kidding?
- I'm asking.

344
00:25:42,682 --> 00:25:44,517
My, you're so frustrating.

345
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:47,287
How is that cursing?

346
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:49,222
It's love that reminds us
of our grandmothers.

347
00:25:49,313 --> 00:25:50,966
That's what life is about.

348
00:25:51,524 --> 00:25:53,626
My grandmother never cursed that way.

349
00:25:54,627 --> 00:25:55,628
Is that so?

350
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,232
Have you ever been scolded
by your grandfather,

351
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,367
- for memorizing the characters wrong?
- No.

352
00:26:01,634 --> 00:26:04,137
Why would I make a mistake
when it's so easy?

353
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:09,217
Have you been hit
for wetting the bed at night?

354
00:26:09,308 --> 00:26:10,890
That doesn't apply to me.

355
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:12,542
Even if I did,

356
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,782
there's no one who would dare to hit me.

357
00:26:24,557 --> 00:26:27,060
I see you were born
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

358
00:26:28,027 --> 00:26:29,229
Silver spoon?

359
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,330
Yes.

360
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:33,297
It means you were born in a wealthy family

361
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:37,303
and lived a very comfortable life.

362
00:26:37,537 --> 00:26:40,740
Silver spoon? I'm not that kind of person.

363
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,865
What's wrong with that?

364
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:46,179
Not all boys should be strong and sturdy.

365
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:49,461
They can also be weak like a flower.

366
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:50,683
I said I'm not.

367
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,941
Fine.

368
00:26:52,352 --> 00:26:54,053
We'll leave it at that.

369
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:56,689
You...

370
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,625
You rascals.

371
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:01,461
If you're done stuffing yourselves,
get out of my face,

372
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:02,629
you lousy beggars.

373
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:06,636
Who dare you look up and down at me?

374
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,269
You seem familiar.

375
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:14,262
You're...

376
00:27:25,084 --> 00:27:26,786
Here. Try some.

377
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:28,488
What are you doing?

378
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:30,969
Kimchi goes well with gukbap.

379
00:27:35,045 --> 00:27:36,346
Try it.

380
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:40,266
Follow me.

381
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:44,838
Wait. Where are you going?

382
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:46,490
What about our gukbap?

383
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:56,265
Why didn't you tell me you weren't hungry?

384
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:59,419
How could you waste such precious gukbap?

385
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:00,573
Goodness.

386
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:06,626
You shouldn't do this here.

387
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:09,229
The reason why I came here in person,

388
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:11,229
instead of having someone to catch you,

389
00:28:12,532 --> 00:28:14,267
was because I was hoping...

390
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,769
...you'd be someone caring and kind.

391
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:18,982
However,

392
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:22,142
you didn't even know
the receiver of your letters.

393
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,677
You pretended to be a nobleman
when you aren't.

394
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:28,382
How shall I get rid of you?

395
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:31,130
Pardon me?

396
00:28:32,535 --> 00:28:34,120
I'm not pretending.

397
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:37,857
I'm definitely a nobleman.

398
00:28:38,658 --> 00:28:41,394
Everything in my letters was genuine.

399
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,427
Was it really?

400
00:28:51,437 --> 00:28:52,605
Lead the way.

401
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:55,686
I want to know which family you're from.

402
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:00,213
Go.

403
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:02,882
Go where?

404
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,832
She's soon to get a reward
for keeping her chastity.

405
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:22,922
How can he run away
with my daughter-in-law?

406
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:26,439
What are you doing?

407
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:27,674
Bring him now.

408
00:29:28,074 --> 00:29:30,310
Bring him to me now!

409
00:29:44,057 --> 00:29:45,091
Be careful.

410
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,025
Be careful.

411
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,699
This is ridiculous.

412
00:30:14,301 --> 00:30:17,490
What are you doing? This is rude.

413
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:20,927
What's rude is the sunlight.

414
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:23,496
It's so strong...

415
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,834
...that I'm concerned
it may damage the beautiful face.

416
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,484
Who are you to worry so much about me?

417
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,398
You?

418
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,359
Do you mean the beautiful face?

419
00:30:55,757 --> 00:30:56,791
I was talking about myself.

420
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,107
Why can't you trust me?

421
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:09,367
Go on.

422
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,519
Here comes dung!

423
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:23,399
It stinks.

424
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,724
Go easy on him.

425
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,594
If you don't pay the interest
in three days,

426
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:30,763
I won't pour dung over you.

427
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:35,301
Instead, I'll burn you alive.

428
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,803
Do you understand?

429
00:31:41,044 --> 00:31:41,989
Hey.

430
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,642
I need to take a leak here.

431
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:52,452
Are you going to watch me?

432
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,342
You can take a leak, too.

433
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:25,718
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

434
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,027
My back...

435
00:32:38,198 --> 00:32:39,265
What are you doing?

436
00:32:41,468 --> 00:32:42,769
Are you hurt?

437
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:44,471
Why did you push me?

438
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:47,340
It's because...

439
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:49,189
Snake.

440
00:32:49,657 --> 00:32:51,592
Do you need to die...

441
00:32:52,956 --> 00:32:53,881
Snake.

442
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,334
On your hands and knees.

443
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,069
What?

444
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,304
I'll pull you up from above, so get down.

445
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:22,788
- Push me up first. I'll pull you up...
- Get down!

446
00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:24,544
- I'll go up first.
- Get down!

447
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:38,808
Let's just stay here together.

448
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:41,027
Someone will pass by one day.

449
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:42,153
Someone will pass by.

450
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:45,768
Ehh! Really!

451
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:47,693
Get down on your hands and knees.

452
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:49,736
Get down!

453
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,143
I told you to wait.

454
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:21,850
You have to stand like this
so I can help you up.

455
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:33,067
- Can you reach?
- Pardon?

456
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:38,785
I can't.

457
00:34:41,887 --> 00:34:42,956
How about now?

458
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:46,426
A little bit higher.

459
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,938
When we get out, I'll make you regret...

460
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:53,533
...getting out of here.

461
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,703
What? What did you just say?

462
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,607
Nothing. Can you reach now?

463
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:05,345
I can't. Please lift me up higher.

464
00:35:06,874 --> 00:35:08,175
Higher.

465
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,796
Stretch out your arm.

466
00:35:10,887 --> 00:35:13,720
You have to lift me up higher.

467
00:35:17,352 --> 00:35:18,286
How about now?

468
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:24,839
I'm going up, and I'm out.

469
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:34,773
Look.

470
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:45,055
Go find a branch or something.

471
00:35:49,729 --> 00:35:50,997
What are you thinking of?

472
00:35:52,162 --> 00:35:55,489
I'll send someone to help you shortly.

473
00:35:56,272 --> 00:35:58,641
- I'm sorry.
- You can't do that.

474
00:35:58,732 --> 00:36:00,967
I'll send help within an hour.

475
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,169
I promise you...

476
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,374
...I'll let you go without asking anything.

477
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:10,719
Help me get out.

478
00:36:11,446 --> 00:36:13,356
I heard what you said earlier.

479
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,648
You said you'd make me regret.

480
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,318
That was just a joke. You!

481
00:36:19,258 --> 00:36:21,961
How dare you do this to me?

482
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:25,215
Do you think you can handle
the consequences?

483
00:36:25,306 --> 00:36:29,010
Yes. I'll do anything you want
if we meet again.

484
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:31,698
If you want me to be your dog,
I'll be your dog.

485
00:36:32,298 --> 00:36:35,135
I'm deeply sorry.

486
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:37,737
- I'm sorry.
- Wait!

487
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:40,575
No! You can't leave me like this.

488
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,308
You can't... Hey!

489
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:45,145
- Hey!
- So long.

490
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:46,878
- Come back here!
- Let's not see each other again.

491
00:36:48,114 --> 00:36:50,049
How dare you!

492
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,485
You little jerk!

493
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,554
Come back here!

494
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:20,246
What have these people done wrong?

495
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:24,704
That servant ran away
with his owner's daughter-in-law.

496
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:28,755
Isn't she his owner's daughter?

497
00:37:30,002 --> 00:37:31,437
She's his owner's daughter-in-law?

498
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,118
Then,

499
00:37:58,585 --> 00:37:59,853
this one.

500
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:01,744
Why?

501
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:07,568
The servant paid him for luring the lady.

502
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:13,833
He didn't lure the lady!

503
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,887
He must've told them
how they felt about each other.

504
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:21,320
Excuse me.

505
00:38:23,516 --> 00:38:24,477
What are you trying to do?

506
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:31,885
It seems these two have run away together.

507
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,554
What happens to him...

508
00:38:36,723 --> 00:38:37,991
...when he gets caught?

509
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:39,559
He'll get killed by the servant's master,

510
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:41,442
even before going to the prison.

511
00:38:44,998 --> 00:38:46,252
I don't know what exactly happened,

512
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:50,003
but I heard that this lady,

513
00:38:50,103 --> 00:38:53,073
had been treated very badly
by the family.

514
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:55,708
When she was suffering so much,

515
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:59,004
the only one who comforted her was him.

516
00:39:01,414 --> 00:39:03,149
That's what I heard.

517
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,119
How do you know so much about them?

518
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,088
Let me see your face.

519
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:20,233
What face...

520
00:39:21,616 --> 00:39:23,670
Let me see your face.

521
00:39:39,052 --> 00:39:40,353
What are you doing? Let's go.

522
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:49,028
You look so messy.
Did you play with mud like a child?

523
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:01,641
The leaders of the riot
have been executed.

524
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:04,778
However, the gathered market merchants...

525
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:08,181
...are considered to be a serious problem.

526
00:40:08,581 --> 00:40:13,486
Hence, I suggest
the execution of Kim Jaeseok,

527
00:40:14,154 --> 00:40:16,489
the owner of the inn
and Ha Yoonsoo, the merchant.

528
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,392
Do as you suggest.

529
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:22,683
Yes, Your Majesty.

530
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,643
Wait.

531
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:31,535
They have already been executed?

532
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:33,940
I haven't heard of it.

533
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:36,919
I gave the command.

534
00:40:38,824 --> 00:40:42,360
I believe you would've made
the same decision.

535
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:45,685
Your Excellency.

536
00:40:46,186 --> 00:40:47,720
We should find a fundamental solution,

537
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:52,459
so my people won't have to steal rice.

538
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:55,061
Do you really believe...

539
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:58,498
...I would just kill them
for what they've done?

540
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,770
You are too soft-hearted, Sir.

541
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:08,975
If we give one to the hungry rioters,

542
00:41:09,242 --> 00:41:11,778
they would ask for tens and hundreds more.

543
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:14,914
In the end,
it won't be just the rice storage.

544
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:16,816
They'll try to invade your palace.

545
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,946
There could be an assassin
coming into your quarters,

546
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:24,320
just like 10 years ago.

547
00:41:41,075 --> 00:41:44,612
You still have difficulty
sleeping through the night.

548
00:41:46,946 --> 00:41:50,383
Please don't doubt my loyalty,
Your Majesty.

549
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:54,087
Please entrust all the affairs to me,

550
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:57,824
and focus on staying healthy.

551
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,797
Are there any other questions,
Your Majesty?

552
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:05,747
No.

553
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,777
Have you sought audience
with His Majesty?

554
00:42:18,678 --> 00:42:20,113
You have seen his conditions.

555
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:22,248
But look at this!

556
00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:25,044
What state are you in?

557
00:42:25,135 --> 00:42:28,254
How can you parade
outside the palace like this?

558
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:31,991
How many times did I tell
Your Highness about your demeanor?

559
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,827
How many times?

560
00:42:33,972 --> 00:42:37,976
So His Majesty was looking for me?
And who alerted him?

561
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:40,633
Yes, it is all my fault.

562
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:48,041
Your Highness...

563
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:49,342
Your Highness!

564
00:42:51,377 --> 00:42:52,579
Your Highness!

565
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:17,337
Did you think
it would help disguise yourself?

566
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,908
Do you mean the mole?

567
00:43:29,516 --> 00:43:32,819
Since you seem to have noticed,
I won't lie to you.

568
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,252
Thank you for helping me.

569
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:39,392
I thought you didn't deserve to die.

570
00:43:40,693 --> 00:43:41,575
However.

571
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,808
Though you managed to get away this time,

572
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:48,894
it'll be hard now
since many people recognize you.

573
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,774
Take care then.

574
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:06,958
I forgot to say...

575
00:44:12,192 --> 00:44:16,529
I wanted to say
that they seemed very happy.

576
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:19,432
Quite quick.

577
00:44:20,649 --> 00:44:22,968
Ehh... Really!

578
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:25,484
Let go of me!

579
00:44:28,441 --> 00:44:29,310
He's strong.

580
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:37,273
Finally, he has paid off all his debt.

581
00:44:38,151 --> 00:44:40,487
What are you planning to do with me?

582
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:45,325
Listen to me. It's true that I sold you,

583
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:46,626
but don't forget.

584
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,695
I assure you,

585
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:52,107
it's much better this way than that way.

586
00:44:52,198 --> 00:44:53,466
Do you understand?

587
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,068
Ehh... Really!

588
00:44:55,384 --> 00:44:57,670
Who are you selling me to?

589
00:44:58,605 --> 00:45:00,016
Training Institute
Office of Eunuch Attendants

590
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:01,007
Come here!

591
00:45:01,307 --> 00:45:03,810
Let go of me! I said to let go!

592
00:45:08,014 --> 00:45:10,049
Please open the door, please!

593
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,641
What...

594
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:38,933
What... What is this place?

595
00:45:39,024 --> 00:45:40,180
The Office of Eunuch Attendants.

596
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,516
What's that?

597
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:46,186
A place where
we make eunuchs out of boys.

598
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,857
You make them what?

599
00:45:51,324 --> 00:45:52,258
Eunuchs.

600
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:54,260
Eu...

601
00:45:55,662 --> 00:45:56,663
...nuch!

602
00:46:05,206 --> 00:46:06,268
I can't.

603
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:08,141
I can't be an eunuch.

604
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,745
Please open the door.

605
00:46:12,078 --> 00:46:14,447
I'm begging you. Please open the door.

606
00:46:15,248 --> 00:46:16,850
I'm Umgong.

607
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,269
Pardon? Umgong?

608
00:46:19,648 --> 00:46:20,587
Oh, right.

609
00:46:21,554 --> 00:46:22,655
Master Umgong.

610
00:46:22,722 --> 00:46:24,190
How should I address him?

611
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:26,559
My lord!

612
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,397
Please don't do this to me. Please!

613
00:46:35,316 --> 00:46:36,451
Go away!

614
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:38,138
Go away!

615
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:44,377
I didn't say
I'll do anything to you right now.

616
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,955
Don't waste your energy for nothing.

617
00:46:56,322 --> 00:46:59,793
You don't get food for three days
before the surgery.

618
00:47:00,994 --> 00:47:02,095
You're pretty.

619
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:10,937
I don't care about the food.

620
00:47:12,005 --> 00:47:13,773
I don't...

621
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:16,276
I don't have it.

622
00:47:17,577 --> 00:47:19,446
You said you don't have something.

623
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:21,347
What?

624
00:47:24,818 --> 00:47:27,654
There was no word from him again?

625
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:30,441
No, Your Highness.

626
00:47:31,524 --> 00:47:34,194
There was nothing under the roof tile.

627
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,065
It's been a while since the day he
promised.

628
00:47:39,566 --> 00:47:41,835
Why hasn't he sent a reply yet?

629
00:47:45,605 --> 00:47:46,639
Your Highness.

630
00:47:47,373 --> 00:47:50,376
How can he be so heartless?

631
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:51,811
I can't believe him.

632
00:47:55,029 --> 00:47:59,586
Stop crying. There's no turning back.

633
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,188
I've already been paid and registered you.

634
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:03,741
You'll either have to live as a eunuch,

635
00:48:03,832 --> 00:48:06,092
or get out as a corpse. So give up.

636
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:08,995
Still,

637
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:12,565
I think I'm very lucky.

638
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:14,968
What do you mean?

639
00:48:17,504 --> 00:48:18,505
I heard

640
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:23,410
you're the best at this in the country.

641
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,044
Me?

642
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:29,983
I'm quite talented.

643
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,419
Hang on.

644
00:48:33,486 --> 00:48:38,258
Others keep only three to four alive
out of 10,

645
00:48:38,324 --> 00:48:39,826
but I'm better than them.

646
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,227
I keep half alive.

647
00:48:41,327 --> 00:48:43,229
I keep five out of ten alive.

648
00:48:46,499 --> 00:48:48,535
That is amazing.

649
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:51,905
Want to know why?

650
00:48:53,173 --> 00:48:55,141
- About ten years ago.
- Yes?

651
00:48:57,277 --> 00:48:58,745
This is a secret.

652
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,819
I operated while I was completely drunk,

653
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:08,221
but I cut it off precisely.

654
00:49:09,122 --> 00:49:10,090
Precisely!

655
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,394
Is that true?

656
00:49:14,594 --> 00:49:18,264
How do you do that while you're drunk?

657
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:22,335
My hand remembered how to do it.

658
00:49:23,036 --> 00:49:24,304
Your hand.

659
00:49:27,107 --> 00:49:28,274
Then again,

660
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:32,011
everyone says they were great
in their best days.

661
00:49:32,212 --> 00:49:33,513
What did you say?

662
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:36,383
That's how it goes.

663
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:40,120
When people get old,
they start making mistakes.

664
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:43,189
How dare you speak that way
to Master Umgong?

665
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:48,261
You're a real man.

666
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:51,264
Of course, I am a man. I'm not a woman.

667
00:49:51,464 --> 00:49:52,665
Have another drink like a man.

668
00:49:52,732 --> 00:49:55,068
Pour me another one. I can handle that.

669
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:04,144
Now that I've enjoyed drinking,

670
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,680
I should get back to work.

671
00:50:10,483 --> 00:50:11,584
Actually...

672
00:50:36,676 --> 00:50:38,678
I really should stop drinking.

673
00:50:38,878 --> 00:50:41,581
I used my knife while I was drunk again.

674
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:44,017
My goodness. Samnom.

675
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:53,493
He's alive.

676
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,961
He's alive.

677
00:50:57,063 --> 00:50:58,131
You're here.

678
00:51:09,876 --> 00:51:11,111
You remember

679
00:51:14,314 --> 00:51:17,183
what happened last night, don't you?

680
00:51:19,185 --> 00:51:20,854
You were so confident last night.

681
00:51:22,222 --> 00:51:25,825
Do you not remember what happened?

682
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:29,396
I do. I remember everything.

683
00:51:29,562 --> 00:51:32,265
I did it. I remember that.

684
00:51:32,932 --> 00:51:33,933
Oh, my.

685
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:35,935
Are you feeling okay?

686
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:39,005
Just as you said,

687
00:51:39,866 --> 00:51:41,601
you were amazing.

688
00:51:42,242 --> 00:51:44,344
That's right.

689
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:49,749
I want to sleep, sir.

690
00:51:49,816 --> 00:51:53,119
Of course. Take a good rest.

691
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:55,755
Take a rest.

692
00:51:57,724 --> 00:51:58,892
Have a good rest.

693
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:32,058
Hey,

694
00:52:32,926 --> 00:52:34,894
Samnom won't come.
There's no point waiting.

695
00:52:36,173 --> 00:52:37,174
Let's go now.

696
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:40,527
Fine. Let's go. I wasn't waiting for him.

697
00:52:42,302 --> 00:52:43,336
Let's go.

698
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:35,789
Raon.

699
00:53:39,626 --> 00:53:40,627
Take off your clothes now.

700
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:43,329
No. Let me wear this just for today.

701
00:53:43,496 --> 00:53:46,466
No, just until the sunset.

702
00:53:46,733 --> 00:53:49,135
Please? Mother.

703
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:54,374
You're not a girl.

704
00:53:55,375 --> 00:53:56,376
You're a boy.

705
00:53:57,377 --> 00:53:58,578
Do you not understand me?

706
00:53:58,978 --> 00:54:00,349
Do you want me to tell you again? I mean,

707
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:02,949
do you want me to slap you again?

708
00:54:06,186 --> 00:54:07,353
Take it off now.

709
00:54:28,742 --> 00:54:29,743
Raon,

710
00:54:30,276 --> 00:54:33,179
if you don't return one day,

711
00:54:33,847 --> 00:54:34,881
I'd be happy.

712
00:54:36,116 --> 00:54:37,417
You know what I mean.

713
00:54:42,522 --> 00:54:43,990
He must be thinking I ran away.

714
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,292
I'm sure he's happy.

715
00:54:48,528 --> 00:54:50,063
Are you happy now?

716
00:55:09,022 --> 00:55:10,089
I said I don't want it.

717
00:55:10,517 --> 00:55:12,052
Goodness.

718
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:15,121
I'm worried to death.

719
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:18,158
I'm going to get revenge.

720
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:21,896
I'll catch him and chop him up.

721
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:28,501
What if he caught a terrible illness?

722
00:55:29,536 --> 00:55:30,603
Your Highness.

723
00:55:33,646 --> 00:55:37,110
What brings you here?

724
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:39,479
Why? Can't I come?

725
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,516
Look at you. You look terrible.

726
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:53,359
What is this?

727
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:56,830
If you eat this, I'll tell you.

728
00:56:03,536 --> 00:56:05,905
This book has a list,

729
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:08,141
of all the best bachelors.

730
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:11,378
Why are you giving this to me?

731
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:16,149
Pick anyone you like.

732
00:56:16,483 --> 00:56:18,885
I'll bring him to you somehow.

733
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,070
What?

734
00:56:21,354 --> 00:56:24,023
This is a big world with many men.

735
00:56:29,062 --> 00:56:31,264
You call that wimp a man?

736
00:56:32,632 --> 00:56:34,334
They are entering the palace!

737
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:31,895
You'll have to brace yourself.

738
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,049
After a simple test in the morning,

739
00:57:34,854 --> 00:57:36,189
the torturous training begins.

740
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:38,581
What kind of a test?

741
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:40,600
What else? They check the family jewels.

742
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,019
They'll make sure
it's been cut off properly.

743
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:45,372
Don't worry. You know my skills.

744
00:58:28,481 --> 00:58:29,482
Who are you?

745
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:01,548
Silver Spoon?

746
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:03,983
Master Jung?

747
00:59:07,287 --> 00:59:09,089
Do you think you can handle
the consequences?

748
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:12,926
Yes. I'll do anything you want
if we meet again.

749
00:59:13,293 --> 00:59:15,729
If you want me to be your dog,
I'll be your dog.

750
00:59:27,821 --> 00:59:28,889
It's nice to see you again,

751
00:59:30,744 --> 00:59:31,778
Puppy.

752
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,776
LOVE IN THE MOONLIGHT

753
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:05,812
- We will begin the physical examination.
- I'm dead.

754
01:00:05,879 --> 01:00:07,747
Did you think I won't recognize
a woman's figure?

755
01:00:09,172 --> 01:00:10,173
Puppy?

756
01:00:10,264 --> 01:00:12,085
Who are you exactly?

757
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:14,278
Look what the Crown Prince is doing.

758
01:00:14,369 --> 01:00:16,538
Dethroning him would be easy.

759
01:00:18,825 --> 01:00:19,859
Get him!

760
01:00:20,134 --> 01:00:21,202
Talk about timing.

761
01:00:21,293 --> 01:00:23,829
The Crown Prince shows up
right after the arrow's shot.
