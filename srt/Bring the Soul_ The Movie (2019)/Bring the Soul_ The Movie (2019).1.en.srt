1
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,159
- Okay!
- We're having our team dinner.

2
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:30,522
We just finished our concert
and we're having dinner at our hotel.

3
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:31,857
Dinner with just the members.

4
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,834
Is this the sauce?

5
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:36,503
- Yes.
- I'll have some.

6
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,139
- Jung Kook.
- Right on.

7
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,300
Let's make another toast
since the camera's rolling.

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,104
- Good work!
- Cheers!

9
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,148
The performance, though...

10
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:51,885
- The way I see it...
- I'm so happy.

11
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,553
- I think I'm...
- I'm so happy.

12
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,888
- What?
- I'm happy.

13
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,856
If I wasn't here...

14
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,691
Our team and our label are smart.

15
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:00,160
I don't know what I'd be doing.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,263
That's the same for all of us.
If I didn't come here...

17
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:07,700
I seriously thought about that.
"What would I have done if not this?"

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,236
We'd still be in school, right?

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:15,175
Well, we travel across the continents,

20
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:20,246
and performing in similarly large stadiums
wherever we go

21
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:25,085
has kind of become a given after a certain point.

22
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,321
It became a part of our daily lives at some point,

23
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:34,594
but a lot of people are still surprised by it,
and it gets a lot of attention.

24
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,030
I think there are many people
who still wonder about it.

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,766
Yes. But the thing is...

26
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,435
Yeah, it's surprising for us, too.

27
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,336
Yes.

28
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:50,017
Kim Namjoon! Kim Namjoon! Kim Namjoon!

29
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:54,222
I'd like us to give a round of applause...

30
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:02,589
for BTS and ARMY for loving ourselves and
persevering for the past two and a half years.

31
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,597
You did well.

32
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:12,365
Well...

33
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:16,536
When I think about it, there's the last verse

34
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:21,675
of "Reflection" from 2016,
"I wish I could love myself."

35
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:29,849
Since then, I thought about
what it means to "love myself".

36
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:36,823
I arrived at, "I don't know,
so why don't we find out together?"

37
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:41,486
and that's how this journey started after
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life era,

38
00:02:41,486 --> 00:02:45,565
through which we got a lot of great feedback.

39
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,293
This project followed that one,
and we were a bit worried about

40
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,754
whether a lot of people
would show us the same support.

41
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:55,642
So now, if I ask myself, "Do you love yourself?"

42
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,478
I'm still not sure, but...

43
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,591
I'm starting to feel like it's possible.

44
00:03:03,691 --> 00:03:08,121
To be honest, it can be thought
of as a curse or a blessing,

45
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,690
but after I cried my eyes out
on the day of our last concert in Seoul,

46
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,494
I erased all the memories from before that.

47
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,431
The various emotions I felt
at the time were so strong

48
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,935
that they would stay with me as one big lump.

49
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:26,206
If the remnants of those emotions
weigh down on me too much,

50
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,875
it makes it hard for me
to move on to the next stage.

51
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,712
We have our next mission,

52
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:37,016
and that next mission will be even harder
than the one before.

53
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,019
Right now, in this moment
where I'm doing this interview,

54
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,349
I can purely focus on the things I need to do now,

55
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,659
and I think that's a great blessing.

56
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,828
Let's love ourselves.

57
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:53,700
Let's talk for the camera for another minute,
then turn it off.

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,734
Yeah, let's turn it off.

59
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,936
If we get inebriated,
we won't be able to do anything.

60
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,605
Let's do the closing comment.

61
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,440
I don't think I'm going to get that drunk.

62
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,442
- Some of us will.
- Okay, then...

63
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,877
- I don't drink to that point.
- I know. Will any of us get that drunk?

64
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,705
- It's okay if you can't drink.
- Yeah.

65
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:08,692
Should we get ourselves really drunk?

66
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:15,288
Hang on. I'm drawing a blank.

67
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,957
It was in May? It's been that long?

68
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:18,864
Incredible.

69
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,226
Oh, that's right.

70
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,996
Yes, we shot another one. I get them confused.

71
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:28,968
Paris, Osaka, Shizuoka, Riyadh, and lastly Korea.

72
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:30,470
We had the drone show.

73
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,470
Yes.

74
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:33,452
An introduction?

75
00:04:33,452 --> 00:04:35,253
Hello, my name is...

76
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:42,649
World Wide Handsome Jin.

77
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,310
My BTS stage name is Jin.

78
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,110
My real name is Kim Seok Jin.

79
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,523
My stage name and my real name?

80
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:55,695
Hello, I'm the eternal hope of BTS, j-hope,

81
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,497
and my real name is Jeong Hoseok.

82
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,133
Hello, I'm SUGA.

83
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,649
My name is Min Yoongi.

84
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:06,639
I'm Jung Kook of BTS.

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,807
My real name?

86
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,609
It's Jeon Jung Kook.

87
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:14,205
Hi, I am Jimin of BTS and my name is Park Jimin.

88
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:18,485
I am V of BTS, and my real name is Kim Taehyung.

89
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:22,690
Hello, I am RM and my name is Kim Namjoon.

90
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,366
I went to the US, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia.

91
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,637
Then to Europe, the UK, France.

92
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,539
We then performed in Seoul, Korea.

93
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,499
We went to Japan.

94
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,702
We've been to lots of different countries.

95
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:58,191
Actually, I still think about it.
I never thought we'd receive so much love.

96
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:05,832
I just thought I'd sing and dance to
a certain extent and show the person I am.

97
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,702
That's all I expected,
but it expanded to the point

98
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,739
where so many fans all over the world
are so passionate about us,

99
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:15,775
listening to our music, and being inspired by it.

100
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,407
I'm still so amazed by it all.

101
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,282
I think it felt very unreal to me.

102
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:28,287
I tried to tell myself
not to label what was happening

103
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:33,526
as something unreal
as a way to avoid the reality of it.

104
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:37,364
So I accepted it and wanted to do even better.

105
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,425
I think the feeling changed into a greater drive

106
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:43,269
to see our group perform
more awe-inspiring performances.

107
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,938
Kim Taehyung without V?

108
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:51,344
I'm the kind of person
who likes to try new things.

109
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:58,117
In order to become a better person,
I'm always trying to do something new.

110
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,520
I thought about this a lot on this tour.

111
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,188
If I had two bodies,

112
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:05,993
instead of seeing myself on-screen
with my own eyes,

113
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:11,130
I could have my other self see what I am doing.

114
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,800
Actually, I used to think
that the self I show to others

115
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,005
and my real self were quite different,

116
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:22,108
but I've come to realize
that it's not really the case.

117
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:27,847
If you don't love yourself,
I don't think you can do anything else.

118
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:33,053
If you start getting negative thoughts,
you should look back at yourself

119
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,823
and think about what you can do to become happy.

120
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:42,328
There are a lot of things
I want to do and accomplish.

121
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:46,699
Though it's not clearly definable,

122
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,337
I think I'm constantly searching for myself.

123
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:11,624
We can say a new persona was created
since the moment we debuted.

124
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:17,530
I used to think that the two personas
had to be kept separate,

125
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,233
though I can't say why.

126
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,002
But when I thought about it,

127
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:28,099
the good parts of me
were in the new Jung Kook I had created,

128
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,545
so it didn't seem necessary for me
to separate what was good

129
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,480
and keep it that way.

130
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,353
Iron Man's flying over there.

131
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,788
- Look. There he is.
- Iron Man!

132
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,164
Nice, V. You're looking great.

133
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,641
What should I say?

134
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,276
- With camera on face?
- Yes.

135
00:09:06,891 --> 00:09:08,648
Did you just shoot the trailer? All right.

136
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,983
We should each shoot one. Move aside.

137
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,321
It's so windy, it messes your hair.

138
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,861
- It's my turn.
- No, you're done.

139
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:22,921
Just one more.

140
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:25,056
Come on. I didn't get to add any effects.

141
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,463
Let me try. Let me try one more time.

142
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:36,876
They'll use at least one of our clips.

143
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,746
BTS Tour: Speak Yourself. Let's go.

144
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,515
- Okay, I'm going to go again.
- Move aside.

145
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,424
Why are you going again?

146
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:45,952
All three of us should do it.

147
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,157
Let's not fight.

148
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,602
- What?
- One, two, three.

149
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:52,914
BTS Tour: Speak Yourself.

150
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:58,368
[USA, April 2019]

151
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,731
Your face is reflecting on the screen.
Can't do anything about that, huh?

152
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,158
Your face shows more than mine, yet I'm the star.

153
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:02,387
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

154
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:03,707
- Let's go.
- We'll head right over.

155
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,549
It sounds like the Champions League finals.
This is dope.

156
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,015
- Anything you want to say?
- Nope.

157
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:32,417
- Bangtan, Bangtan.
- Bang Bangtan.

158
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,186
The meaning of life?

159
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:40,659
That's always a hard question.
It's difficult to answer.

160
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,228
Well...

161
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:46,665
I've thought about it a lot,
and I think it's because I find it fun.

162
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,033
It's like...

163
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:56,008
You asked me before what keeps Bangtan going.

164
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,877
I think it's similar to that.

165
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,402
I thought about it a lot.

166
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:26,071
"What keeps us going? Why does BTS work so hard?"

167
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,007
I put a lot of thought into it,

168
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,611
and the first answer that came to mind
was because it's fun.

169
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:36,715
I haven't been able to define it yet,
but to start,

170
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,442
it's really fun.

171
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:43,289
It's fun to work together,
and it's a joy to be living this life.

172
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:48,961
It feels like we're searching together,
and I think that's the reason.

173
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,261
- Will you be joining me?
- Yes.

174
00:13:57,261 --> 00:14:01,040
I didn't dress like I usually do.
Do I look any different?

175
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,808
Can you tell it's me?

176
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,421
Is it too me? My clothes are all similar.
I can't help it.

177
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,516
Is it too me? Isn't there anything else?

178
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,989
I think I should wear glasses.

179
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,959
I picked the most inconspicuous clothes.

180
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,427
It has "Jin" written all over it.

181
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,264
Can you please lend me some clothes?

182
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:26,699
I'll go with this.

183
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,367
Can I just put this on?

184
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,371
Thank you.

185
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,532
What do you think? Is it less me, now?

186
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,614
I don't know about this.

187
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,360
Doesn't this look like me, too?

188
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,712
Man... I'm going insane.

189
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,961
I think it's different for me.

190
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,696
When I listen to the other members,

191
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:01,200
they say Jin is turning into Kim Seok Jin
or Yoongi is turning into SUGA.

192
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,838
I hear them say that a lot,
but it's a bit different for me.

193
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:11,893
Some people might find this hard to believe,
but I'm really quiet when I'm alone.

194
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:14,295
None of us here can speak English?

195
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,985
What if someone starts talking to us?

196
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,438
Who's going to do the talking?

197
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:31,112
I want to know what they said,
but there's no one I can ask.

198
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,149
Okay, let's go make some noise.

199
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:41,674
As Jin, I don't really want
to show people that side of me

200
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:47,379
since I'm a person who likes games and movies...

201
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,616
So I try my best not to show my darker side.

202
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:56,455
I try hard to act more cheerful
or show only my bright side.

203
00:15:56,455 --> 00:16:01,260
So I tend to separate Jin and Kim Seok Jin.

204
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:42,101
Sometimes, I go on the Internet
to look at fans' reactions.

205
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:47,773
When something makes me happy,
the fans are all happy for me,

206
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,244
and when something sad or distressing
happens to me,

207
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:56,884
they all sympathize with me, feel sad for me,
and even become depressed.

208
00:16:56,884 --> 00:17:03,088
Namjoon once said that fans love us
because they want to feel happy,

209
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:07,393
but if they see us depressed,
they feel depressed along with us.

210
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,095
After hearing that,

211
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:16,802
I realized I shouldn't show myself
looking down or depressed.

212
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,638
So that's what I've been trying to do.

213
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:44,763
The fans get positive energy from seeing us.

214
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,368
"This is who they are,
and seeing them makes me happy."

215
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,769
If that's what they feel,
that makes me happy, too.

216
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,203
That's what I love about it.

217
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:58,744
Now, we're off to Chicago.

218
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,679
We are off to Chicago now.

219
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,891
Things like this...

220
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,455
These need to be short and sweet.

221
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:11,123
No, no.

222
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,047
Hello, Chicago!

223
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,051
Wow, it's cold here.

224
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,788
It's so cold in Chicago.

225
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,127
Look at these mats.

226
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:23,618
Wow, this is amazing.

227
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:35,071
[Chicago, Speak Yourself Tour, 2019.05.09]

228
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:58,864
Well... I don't know. It's hard to say.

229
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,799
Rather than film noir,

230
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,305
I think I'm better suited
to documentaries and travelogues.

231
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:13,072
At first, I think I was trying
to avoid the amount of attention

232
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:16,382
and the public's eyes on BTS.

233
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:21,587
In my attempts to counter that, I found nature.

234
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,946
I found it in greenery, mountains,
rivers, and parks.

235
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,633
- Hello.
- Welcome.

236
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,301
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

237
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,870
- It's an honor to meet you.
- Thank you.

238
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,902
This here is...

239
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:46,778
What a scent.

240
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:49,348
- Wow.
- Here it is.

241
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,349
This is...

242
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,217
- That's mine.
- Yes.

243
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:58,524
This will become my desk around December.

244
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,493
Is it Persian walnut?

245
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,363
I think there are many different kinds of artists.

246
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:09,301
There are a minority of artists that create
things that are never-before-seen in this world,

247
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,902
while there are artists that don't.

248
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,872
I don't think I'm of the former.

249
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,410
Some would say that's not art
or that it's not fascinating.

250
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,847
And people often say that being in pain
is inevitable for artists,

251
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,718
but I don't think it's always the case.

252
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:31,456
I believe there are lots of things
that I can do that are far better.

253
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,794
And I want to keep my thoughts that way.

254
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:37,030
It's how I'm able to continue
without going insane.

255
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,629
I think I was able to keep going
without creating some kind of public incident...

256
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,672
all because I didn't go mad.

257
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,510
I don't want to make myself into a weak person

258
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,313
nor let fear consume me and swallow me whole.

259
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,948
So when I go to the museum,

260
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,287
grow plants, and ride my bike,

261
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,756
it's part of a fight
to keep myself from going insane.

262
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,501
Where are you going?

263
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,604
We are heading to New York from Chicago.

264
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,781
I didn't get to drink apple juice.

265
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:19,959
Grandiose titles, descriptions,
some kinds of messages are a lot of pressure.

266
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:25,430
Of course it's all our music, music that
we've created and our own performances,

267
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,033
but here's what I think.

268
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,427
We make music. We perform.

269
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:33,305
And if people see that and enjoy it,

270
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,342
I feel that we've done our job.

271
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,688
I don't know about this.

272
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,624
- It's raining again in New York.
- What's taking the rest so long?

273
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,626
They're leaving one by one because of the rain.

274
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:59,130
Yesterday, the rain was lighter.

275
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,224
It started to rain, but stopped.

276
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,852
I think that's the most we can take.

277
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,854
Rain as heavy as this...

278
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,075
We would get soaking wet.

279
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:14,246
It says it's cloudy.
It says it'll rain on Thursday.

280
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,081
- This is...
- And Friday as well.

281
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:20,411
It's our first stadium tour,
and we're seeing some bad weather.

282
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:26,215
Namjoon, like you said,
what if it stops raining thanks to ARMY?

283
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:29,427
I'm not sure about that. Not this time.

284
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:30,896
I'm not sure.

285
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,485
Meanwhile, after staying days outside Central Park,
fans of the populat boy band BTS

286
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:38,936
got to see them perform for free.

287
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:49,178
Even before the crack of dawn,
the BTS ARMY, as they are known,

288
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:53,909
showed up in force, some waiting overnight,
others for several days.

289

to go on a stadium tour in the US.

Now then, you know what they say, the so-called dream.

292
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,980
It's a dream that...

293
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,636
Some say we've reached it and some say we've not,

294
00:27:38,636 --> 00:27:47,902
but we never dreamed of it because it was always
considered something we could never dream of,

295
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:50,472
that it was impossible.

296
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:55,459
But the ARMY gave it to us. We made it together.

I'm going out alone today.

299
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:26,071
With BTS not in the picture?

300
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:30,141
You know, there's something
really excruciating about that.

301
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:37,582
I devoted my entire youth to BTS,
so I think it will be difficult.

302
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:41,820
The moment I have to let this go,
I think it will be really difficult for me.

303
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,622
I wouldn't even know how to introduce myself.

304
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,881
I guess I'll have to say,
"Hello, I'm Jeong Hoseok."

305
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,196
I guess it would be...

306
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,701
How should I put it?

307
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:59,571
It wouldn't be... so great.

308
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,514
Well...

309
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:14,119
I was born as someone named Jeong Hoseok,

310
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,146
this is how my mom gave birth to me.

311
00:29:16,146 --> 00:29:20,091
I've been dancing since elementary school,

312
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:26,998
I went on auditions, entered the label,
and met these guys.

313
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,034
Then our debut was confirmed.

314
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:32,539
We performed and our first music show
was a great hit.

315
00:29:33,846 --> 00:29:38,476
We went on to receive the Grand Prize Awards,
and even received music awards abroad.

316
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:42,580
If you lay them all out,
so many things have happened.

whom I can't forget in my life.

How am I going to get down?

319
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:00,932
I'm scared.

320
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:16,208
When I'm older and I think back
on this time, as an old man,

321
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:19,362
I think I'd be brought to tears.
That's how much they mean to me.

322
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:43,375
Before I debuted, or just after we debuted,

323
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:49,681
I was young then and would often think,
"I have the experience, so I should step up."

324
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,485
These thoughts confused me a lot
in the beginning.

325
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:57,555
My performance got me in,
but I didn't get a lot of attention.

326
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:02,162
But now, to be honest,
the members are doing such a great job.

327
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:06,900
So in terms of that, I don't feel
the pressure to lead from the front.

328
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:26,050
I think I've been trying to bring out
the attitude and state of mind

329
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,255
that we shared when we were young.

330
00:31:28,255 --> 00:31:34,259
In a way, it has been a small driving force
that has helped me perform.

331
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,596
It's also made me realize
how precious it is to perform.

332
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:48,506
I guess the j-hope onstage
is like a bird that flies free.

333
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:56,047
I think I become a free spirit, at least onstage.

- Jin.

335
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:08,326
Jin.

00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,066
- Jin.
- J-hope.

338
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,402
I'm really ugly right now. What's up?

339
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:18,603
- Jin.
- What is it, j-hope?

340
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,676
- J-hope, what's going on?
- You're not ugly.

341
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,911
Come on. Show us your face.

342
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:28,813
J-hope! I'm so happy, but...

343
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:30,148
- Jin, Jin.
- Sit down, j-hope.

344
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,649
Hurry and open it.

345
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:33,051
- I have to open it?
- Yes, Jin.

346
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:35,486
- Okay.
- You look good right now.

347
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:37,647
- Wow, j-hope.
- Jin, you're looking good.

348
00:32:37,647 --> 00:32:40,016
So this is how my ugly face
is revealed to the world.

349
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:43,361
J-hope, what is the meaning of this? J-hope!

350
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,863
- Take a look, Jin.
- J-hope, seriously...

351
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,632
- I'm so moved. What a surprise.
- Jin, Jin.

352
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,525
- What is it? What's going on?
- Jin.

353
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:52,136
- J-hope.
- It's a whale!

354
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,338
What is it?

355
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,507
- It's a whale? j-hope!
- It's a whale, bro.

356
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:57,742
- J-hope, I will...
- What is it?

357
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,144
I immediately thought of you
when I saw it, so I bought it.

358
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,312
- Now...
- You have this shirt?

359
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,380
- No, I don't.
- No. Okay.

360
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,681
- Now, I'm...
- Jin.

361
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,609
- I'll wear this every day for a month.
- Okay, got it.

362
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,616
- Get some rest.
- Good night, j-hope.

363
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:10,188
- I love you, bro, you know.
- Yeah.

364
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,925
Last year, he gave me clothes as a present
and I was so moved.

365
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:17,231
So I went to Jin's favorite store
to get him something,

366
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:21,733
and I found just the perfect thing for him.
I had to get it.

367
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:25,470
I had a really happy day today.

368
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,039
I hope you all have a good night, too.

369
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,975
We're off to Brazil.

370
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,690
[Brazil, May 2019]

371
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,419
Have you heard of K-pop or BTS?

372
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:52,430
If you haven't heard of them,

373
00:33:52,430 --> 00:34:00,805
you'll have no idea why so many people
are gathered in front of the stadium.

374
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,303
Why don't we ask them?

375
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:16,587
This is what it takes
to face the dancers in Brazil.

376
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:20,458
In Brazil, we have to prepare
like we're going to war.

377
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:26,155
But we'll lose the moment they shout like this.

378
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:46,050
I think when it comes to these performances,

379
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,712
it's nice to have ideas that are conceptual
and a storyline that flows.

380
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:55,095
It would be nice
if the performance flows smoothly,

381
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:58,830
but a concert should be fun for the audience,
besides anything else.

382
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,500
There are fun concerts
and there are boring concerts,

383
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,311
and I think our concerts are fun.

384
00:37:10,931 --> 00:37:14,976
[Sao Paulo, Speak Yourself Tour, 2019.05.25]

385
00:37:14,976 --> 00:37:16,186
Who left from here?

386
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:17,554
- Jimin.
- Hello.

387
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:20,116
Let's get on the elevator.

388
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,225
Jung Kook, today's our last show in Brazil.
How do you feel about it?

389
00:37:28,972 --> 00:37:30,340
How are you feeling?

390
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:32,984
I'm feeling really good.

391
00:37:34,888 --> 00:37:37,789
Our Brazil concerts are so much fun.

392
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,057
I agree.

393
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:08,486
The soccer field looks like such a free place.

394
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,626
Right? It takes you back to your childhood.

395
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,863
The sight of the grass
looks so comforting and free.

396
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:24,068
Even with loss, I learned a lot of things,
and I've also gained things in the process,

397
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,897
but in the beginning,

398
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:33,986
I felt that I'd lost my friends,
the people who see me as I truly am,

399
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:36,414
as well as my freedom.

400
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,867
That's how I felt at first.

401
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:43,654
When we debuted,
I didn't need all those things.

402
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,357
I thought, "It's okay. I don't need them.
I'll do what I have to do."

403
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,051
Those were my thoughts.

404
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,728
What I was doing at the time was so important

405
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:57,168
that it didn't matter if other people
looked at me strangely or left my side.

406
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,071
Then when I got halfway,

407
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:03,496
I started feeling lonely,

408
00:39:03,496 --> 00:39:06,916
and that feeling of loneliness
made me notice the people around me.

409
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,686
Okay, Jimin. I scored first place.

410
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:14,185
You're in first place?

411
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,519
Jump, okay.

412
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,592
You came in first place.

413
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:23,353
I feel like playing soccer.

414
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:25,154
See? I won.

415
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:32,269
It's hard to definitively say
that I lost something,

416
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,473
because there were things I gained in the process.

417
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,008
For instance, if I lost friends,

418
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:44,949
I learned who my real friends are
and got to make new friends.

419
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:49,145
It may have felt like I lost my freedom,
but I'm enjoying even greater freedom.

420
00:39:49,145 --> 00:39:54,117
I think I got to learn these things as I grew up.

421
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,690
At first, I thought the gap was huge
and wanted the two to be kept separate.

422
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,687
I wanted to draw a line
and separate myself from it.

423
00:41:00,687 --> 00:41:03,553
I once said to my fans,

424
00:41:03,553 --> 00:41:07,998
"I don't really want to be
my real self as Park Jimin."

425
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:11,702
By that, what I meant
was that I just wanted to show them

426
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,338
my professional side, back then.

427
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,644
It's kind of like
me feeling a little under the weather

428
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:23,348
and not wanting to ask them to accept that.
It was that sort of feeling.

429
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:30,888
I thought it would be better for me
to be truer to myself in that moment.

430
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:37,895
On the tour last year, and this one as well,
I wasn't able to erase that thought,

431
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:41,665
but I think it gave me a chance to acknowledge it.

432
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,901
I'm sure there's a difference
between me and my persona,

433
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:48,706
but I'm trying to show myself
as honestly as I can,

434
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:54,311
and I've been trying
to acknowledge myself more than before.

435
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,287
Wow, this is seriously...

436
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,356
a historic moment.

437
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,132
Aren't we the first Korean artists
to perform at Wembley Stadium?

438
00:42:45,132 --> 00:42:48,468
It's a rare feat for any artist around the world.

439
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,101
Wow...

440
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:54,405
I don't know how many times
I've said "wow" already.

441
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,974
They won't hear you onstage
even if you scream from here.

442
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,609
- Really?
- Yes.

On the dream stage
where The Beatles and Queen performed,

446
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:32,910
BTS was the first Korean artist
to perform at Wembley Stadium in the UK.

447
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,371
It was a symbolic reenactment
of the Live Aid concert

448
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:38,808
performed here by Queen in 1985.

449

Good luck today!

450
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,937
- Fighting!
- Thank you.

451
00:44:01,672 --> 00:44:06,744
Naturally, I didn't know we'd do this well,

452
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,013
but I was still confident

453
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,516
that we'd make it someday,
even though nothing was guaranteed.

454
00:44:12,516 --> 00:44:16,020
For some reason, I felt confident about my team.

455
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,222
Plus, our label was very supportive of us.

456
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:22,092
In addition to the members,
there's Big Hit Entertainment

457
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:23,961
and people who've been with us this whole time.

458
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:29,333
I started thinking about them as one big force.

459
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,936
In fact, everyone involved in this
is part of a collective destiny.

460
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,205
That's how I feel.

461
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:37,631
At the very start, it's not just about...

462
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:41,608
We don't... We didn't... Back in the day in 2013...

463
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:46,920
I don't think we have this big attitude
that we're going to change the industry,

464
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,764
or we're going to change the whole world.

465
00:44:48,764 --> 00:44:53,424
Or we're going to influence
millions and billions of people.

466
00:44:53,424 --> 00:45:01,170
What we could do and what we know to do
was just telling stories,

467
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,312
what's our insight

468
00:45:03,312 --> 00:45:06,454
and to express it by the performances and the dances.

469
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:21,852
Here's the path, so we are on it.

470

They say you climb a mountain
because it's there, right?

471
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:30,427
Like so, people who share the same will
and destiny as me are by my side.

472
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:34,264

Well...

475
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:04,028
I think it served as a turning point for me.

476
00:46:04,028 --> 00:46:06,463
There were times when I got really depressed

477
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,933
and there were times
when I wished someone would hold my hand.

478
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,771
I used to feel a lot of hardships like that.

479
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:18,242
But when we started
the LOVE YOURSELF World Tour,

480
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:22,646
I think it served as a turning point
in the way I see myself.

481

for ARMY all over the world.

488
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,218
I wrote it...

489

with the help of a translation tool.

490
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,469

but Kim Taehyung can't show V.

Kim Taehyung is Kim Taehyung.

494

Kim Taehyung is someone
who's still filled with a lot of curiosity

495

00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,709
so V may be one persona,

504
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:12,516
but he should be able to show
various parts of himself.

505
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:16,920
When I'm onstage,
I want to show as much of V as possible.

506
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,008
Wow!

507
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,914
- Should we do another take?
- Okay.

508
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:04,039
Honestly, I think I've shown
about half of my potential.

509
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:05,404
There's still a lot I can do.

510
00:50:05,404 --> 00:50:09,907
Maybe it's because I like plot twists,

511
00:50:09,907 --> 00:50:13,176
but there's nothing like
showing something I've never revealed before

512
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,779
that elicits an immediate response.

513
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:42,339
The dance performance
during "Seesaw" is one example.

514
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,967
There are so many things I can do.

515
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:50,239
I could suddenly start doing rock music
though I'm not a rock musician.

516
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:53,984
Or even trot music...

517
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,433
Oh, I've already done that.

518
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:21,311
Anyway, I can show so many more things,
and there are so many genres in the world.

519
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,213
There are many things I can show

520
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:25,348
because there are so many things
I can choose from.

521
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:28,343
You never know, right? As I grow older,

522
00:51:28,343 --> 00:51:31,421
I could be working on stage productions
or visual productions.

523
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,857
If I show various different sides,

524
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,895
I guess there'd be a lot more for me to show.

525
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,883
I should've had sundae gukbap.

526
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:07,491
It's hard for me to tell if I'm in Korea or Paris.

527
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:19,469
The next track was the intro,

528
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,469
but that could change
as the album's being delayed.

529
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,777
All of them.

530
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,880
The...

531
00:52:30,688 --> 00:52:32,983
The track is sampled
from all of Namjoon's intros,

532
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,352
such as the one from Skool Luv Affair.

533
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,888
No. Actually, it's the album
with the "N.O" track, O! RUL8,2?

534
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:43,126
Even the part where the lyrics go,
"Of course" comes from that.

535
00:52:44,335 --> 00:52:51,234
At the time, I would think,
"Man... This is not reusable."

536
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,703
And leave them as is.

537
00:52:53,703 --> 00:52:57,711
When I go back and listen to them
after some time, they're actually pretty good.

538
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:00,210
Then I end up producing and releasing them.

539
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,271
Many of the tracks were created like that.

540
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,187
I will burn my soul onto the upcoming mixtape.

541
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,726
But I still don't know what I should talk about.

542
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:19,138
[France, June 2019]

543
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:08,144
Sometimes, I get flashbacks of
what I felt while I was performing.

544
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:11,281
When I'm monitoring,
there are videos that fans take.

545
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:15,277
I'd watch that and feel the exact emotions
I felt at that moment and think,

546
00:54:15,277 --> 00:54:18,021
"Right, that's how I felt back then."

547
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,163
That's when I'd start

548
00:54:20,163 --> 00:54:23,599
feeling a kind of itch and think,
"I can't wait until our next concert."

549
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:28,135
Lately, I've been thinking a lot...

550
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:36,273
And I think I'm an incredibly lucky
and happy person.

551
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,208
Why?

552
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:42,983
I get to do what I want and make money...

553
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,182
and meet good people.

554
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:53,823
Most importantly, I'm doing the things
I've always wanted to do.

555
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,729
And I get to be happy while doing those things.

556
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:06,670
Well...

557
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,733
What I mean to the team...

558
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:11,341
I'm one of the members...

559
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:17,314
of this team called BTS,

560
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,554
and I believe I've had a lot of influence
on the band itself.

561
00:55:20,554 --> 00:55:29,913
But if I were to try something by myself
and be an inspiration to a lot of people,

562
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:35,432
I wonder, "Would I really be able
to do that by myself?"

563
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:40,003
I often think about that.

564
00:55:54,351 --> 00:56:02,626
I want to become the kind of person
who takes responsibility for his words.

565
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:07,063
I always say things,
but don't follow through with them.

566
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:10,500
I'm like a greedy child.

567
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:16,740
It's foolish of me to know,
yet still not put it into action.

568
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,108
I'm lazy.

569
00:56:19,809 --> 00:56:21,478
As for my worth...

570
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:24,681
Honestly, I'm not sure.

571
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,911
I still have a long way to go
to even start thinking about my worth.

572
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,091
There isn't much.

573
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:07,364
BTS is the reason
behind the explosive popularity of K-pop.

574
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:53,536
[Japan, July 2019]

575
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,705
There are many kinds of fears.

576
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,266
I've thought about it a lot,

577
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:01,077
about the different kinds of fears,
and what kinds of fears I have.

578
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:03,713
I'm not someone
who's completely perfect or ethical,

579
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:07,050
who's worthy of being an inspiration
to so many people.

580
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:11,288
I don't see myself as someone
who deserves to have so much influence,

581
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:16,326
so there's the fear of not knowing exactly
what ship I'm sailing on.

582
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,621
Then there's the fear of,
"What do I do if I fall from here?"

583
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,031
"What if I go mad?" There's that fear.

584
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,634
Now that we're in the world's spotlight,

585
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,370
from the clothes I wear, to the background
behind me that's captured on camera,

586
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,339
to the interviews, to the lyrics,

587
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:33,877
everything feels like it's being scrutinized,
including myself as a person.

588
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:40,049
Then there's also the fear of
how well I'm taking care of myself,

589
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,443
the Kim Namjoon, as a person.

590
00:58:41,443 --> 00:58:43,512
Aside from money, fame,
and a sense of calling...

591
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,790
what do I really have?

592
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:51,361
When you have those things,
all other things start to feel really valuable.

593
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:54,898
Those who don't have them
would find them really special.

594
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,738
I think it's a repetition of that, so for me,

595
00:58:57,738 --> 00:59:04,407
there's a fear about whether I'm faithfully
living the story of my life to the fullest.

596
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:09,479
Before, I wanted us to get the music show
to the number-one spot,

597
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:13,650
and hold concerts at bigger venues.

598
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,880
We had a lot of dreams.

599
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:19,990
But now, we don't think
in terms of figures or our position.

600
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,393
Those aren't the things that drove us forward.

601
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:28,723
We just did things we wanted to do
and really enjoyed performing.

602
00:59:28,723 --> 00:59:31,334
The same is true now as well.

603
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,232
It's not like we don't care
about those indicators.

604
00:59:34,232 --> 00:59:37,273
They're just not our top priority.

605
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,933
With sincerity,

606
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:43,646
we can approach people with our music
and give them strength through our concerts...

607
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,282
ARMY dreams while looking at Bangtan.

608
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:52,956
From where we stand now, I guess
that could expand or lessen in the future.

609
00:59:52,956 --> 00:59:54,724
That I wouldn't know.

610
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:59,367
But that's what the members enjoy doing.

611
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,901
I've been to Dubai,
but it's my first time in Saudi Arabia.

612
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,269
As for Saudi Arabia,

613
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:49,312
I think not many people might've come here
compared to other countries.

614
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,480
I'm not sure.

615
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:56,019
Before we visit any country,
we always have a preliminary briefing.

616
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:03,593
We're informed on things we need to be cautious of

617
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,262
since we're visiting for the first time.

618
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:10,767
In terms of predicting audience reactions,

619
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:14,671
we are more conservative in our expectations,

620
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,199
so I was feeling a bit nervous on our way here,

621
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:21,181
but it seemed fine when we arrived at the airport.

622
01:01:21,181 --> 01:01:28,314
I thought it would be a place
that's very closed-off, but it wasn't like that.

623
01:01:29,141 --> 01:01:35,101
[Saudi Arabia, October 2019]

624
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,804
Here's what I think.

625
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:50,173
We make music. We perform.

626
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:56,479
And if people see that and enjoy it,
I feel that we've done our job.

627
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:59,916
The concept of this tour is "Festival",

628
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:03,352
and we got to enjoy festivals
in many different countries.

629
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:07,523
I hope a lot of people in this country
feel festive through us.

630
01:02:14,572 --> 01:02:16,466
- Is it "Hala wallah"?
- "Hala wallah".

631
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:19,435
The greeting is, "Hala wallah".
Say, "Hala wallah, BTS."

632
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:20,870
- Two, three. Bangtan.
- Bangtan.

633
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:22,972
Hala wallah, BTS.

634
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,307
No, it's, "We are BTS."

635
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,842
- Hala wallah.
- Two, three. Bangtan.

636
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:26,984
Hala wallah.

637
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,412
- Should we say, "We are"?
- Let's say it.

638
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,482
If we say, "Hala wallah, BTS,"
it means, "Hello, BTS."

639
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:33,482
Hala wallah.

640
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,919
- Good.
- All we say is, "Hala wallah, BTS."

641
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,354
Say it again, Namjoon.

642
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:39,489
Two, three. Bangtan.

643
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:40,489
Hala wallah.

644
01:03:18,302 --> 01:03:19,695
- This is...
- It's Jimin.

645
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,264
- This is seriously...
- This one is me.

646
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,366
- Isn't this me?
- No, it's not.

647
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:24,901
- This one is me.
- This is...

648
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,669
- This is Yoongi.
- This is Jung Kook.

649
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:28,037
- This one is you.
- This one.

650
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,006
This is clearly Park Jimin and j-hope.

651
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:31,566
- Who's this?
- Kim Taehyung.

652
01:03:31,566 --> 01:03:33,543
- Where are the rest?
- Who is this?

653
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,378
- Kim Taehyung, SUGA, JK.
- Jeon Jung Kook.

654
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:37,138
- Jin, RM.
- That's right.

655
01:03:37,138 --> 01:03:41,088
Our LOVE YOURSELF: SPEAK YOURSELF World Tour

656
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:46,322
was a tour and concert
that meant a great deal to us.

657
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:52,528
I don't know if I've grown from it,
but I was able to discover more of myself.

658
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:57,600
I felt that we were receiving a lot of love.

659
01:03:59,069 --> 01:04:08,945
I think the performances helped me learn
and contemplate many different things.

660
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:10,780
At the count of three. One, two, three.

661
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:11,747
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

662
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,816
- Thank you!
- Thank you. We love you!

663
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,985
- Fighting!
- Where are you going?

664
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:19,422
- We have to shoot for "Today's Bangtan."
- Let's shoot that then.

665
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:26,222
[Korea, October 2019]

666
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:38,445
Right, I can't think of any effect
we wanted to have in particular,

667
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:43,813
because we ourselves are in the process
of learning and discovering things

668
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:48,276
as we send our message to our audience.

669
01:04:48,276 --> 01:04:55,992
We always think about the effect
our words, our message, and our deeds

670
01:04:55,992 --> 01:04:59,829
have on our listeners,

671
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,199
but the answer to that question has always
remained a question mark.

672
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:14,844
I used to be very conscious
of how the audience might perceive me.

673
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:18,514
I worried a lot about how I might look to them,

674
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:22,185
but after listening to the members' advice,

675
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:28,724
I don't think I feel as nervous about it anymore,
so I just do as I feel.

676
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,427
That would be one thing that's changed.

677
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,664
I mean, there isn't any major pressure.

678
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:38,000
Though there is some pressure,
it's not overbearing,

679
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,171
so I can have fun and enjoy myself onstage.

680
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:52,315
At first, since it wasn't common for us
to have stadium tours of this scale,

681
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:57,520
I felt frustrated and scared
and I wanted to do better.

682
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,956
That's how I felt when we started.

683
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,461
Of course, I was excited for it.

684
01:06:01,461 --> 01:06:04,931
Then when we did our first concert,
everything felt so surreal.

685
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:13,035
We were able to come up with new ideas
without feeling inhibited by these things.

686
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:17,373
Even though the seven of us
think in different ways,

687
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:22,979
we all aspire to the same things,
and I think that creates a synergistic effect.

688
01:06:55,219 --> 01:07:00,149
Apparently, they say that the music
you listen to in your teens and 20s

689
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:05,688
has the greatest impact on you
during the course of your life.

690
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:11,727
That's why I want to make music
that has a positive effect,

691
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:13,729
culturally speaking as well.

692
01:07:13,729 --> 01:07:17,400
They're not things that only I feel.
It's what we all feel,

693
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,002
and that's what we express.

694
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:22,972
I think that's why it resonates with more people.

695
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:26,909
If we say the same thing with one heart,

696
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:30,312
I think it would make people
feel something greater.

697
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:39,855
There's the power to make people
go beyond mere admiration.

698
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:43,659
It makes people put in their time
and money and take action.

699
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:49,265
That power seems to lie
in music, performance, and content.

700
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:54,174
There were moments
where I could witness it for myself.

701
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:59,708
Some people might like us for our performances.

702
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,977
While others, they might like our message.

703
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,818
And others might like us for our music.

704
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:10,645
I want to have more of an influence like that,
but not just to people in their teens and 20s.

705
01:08:10,645 --> 01:08:17,059
I believe culture has the power to change people.

706
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,780
All right, ARMY!

707
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,649
Yes!

708
01:08:39,649 --> 01:08:47,089
You'll show SUGA how much you love him,
more than ever, right?

709
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,492
Yes!

710
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:52,194
Okay, let's go on the count of three.

711
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:54,063
- One!
- Do what?

712
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,253
Raise the dB.

713
01:08:56,253 --> 01:08:57,941
Actually, you should say decibels.

714
01:08:57,941 --> 01:08:59,201
Dibi? Dibidibidip?

715
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,803
You should tell them to scream.

716
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,505
- Dibidibidip!
- What...

717
01:09:02,505 --> 01:09:03,606
Dibidibidip!

718
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,075
Taehyung's trying to say
you should shout as loud as you can.

719
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,576
He wants you to scream, everyone.

720
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,245
- All right. Quiet!
- Okay.

721
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,245
All right.

722
01:09:11,779 --> 01:09:13,781
Make some noise!

723
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,625
How many decibels was that?

724
01:09:22,625 --> 01:09:25,995
It was about 110 dB, everyone.

725
01:09:26,854 --> 01:09:29,249
I think you could bring it up to 120 dB.

726
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,610
- That's possible.
- It's possible for ARMY.

727
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:33,014
- You can do it.
- In that case...

728
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:38,974
ARMY, make some noise!

729
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,913
- Great.
- Yes, that's right.

730
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:49,552
Everyone, I hope you scream as loudly
as you enjoy the next performance.

731
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:58,394
I think you should stand up again.

732
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,196
ARMY!

733
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,936
Are there hot packs on your chairs?
Why is everyone seated?

734
01:10:02,936 --> 01:10:04,881
Everyone, you should jump if you're cold.

735
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,195
Make some noise!

736
01:11:48,195 --> 01:11:51,132
If you're having fun today, make some noise!

737
01:11:54,911 --> 01:11:57,680
This show is in danger of being called off now.

738
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,282
I'm so happy to be here with you.

739
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:02,751
I love you all!

740
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:08,657
When I think back,

741
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:13,762
we started this tour last year,
and a year has gone by already.

742
01:12:14,755 --> 01:12:18,401
The biggest thing I noticed while traveling abroad

743
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:24,106
is that we're being loved so much
by so many people all over the world.

744
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:28,902
But today, in this very moment,
that feeling has reached its peak.

745
01:12:28,902 --> 01:12:31,204
You've given me so much love.

746
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:38,253
Yes, I can feel that love again
in this very moment.

747
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:42,424
I love you! I love you! I love you!

748
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:44,126
Seriously, everyone...

749
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,330
I'm so happy.

750
01:12:47,330 --> 01:12:52,968
I'm receiving so much love and attention,
so how could I not be happy?

751
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:56,605
When making any observation,

752
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:59,675
I tend to look at both the light and shadows.

753
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,277
It's part of my disposition.

754
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:07,116
So even when I reminisce the happy moments,
memories of hardship always tag along.

755
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:12,121
I'd think about a time and remember
how hard it was backstage,

756
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:14,569
or recall what it was like
after I'd return to the hotel.

757
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,627
Since they always come as a pair,

758
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,203
when I talk about an impression,

759
01:13:23,203 --> 01:13:28,168
it's hard for me to simply say, "I was so happy."

760
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,607
In reality, it's not always like that.

761
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:34,977
Then, is the problem with me?

762
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,245
I don't think so.

763
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:40,420
I think the problem has to do with
the very question about whether we are happy.

764
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:47,561
Rather, I want us to be able
to ask ourselves more specific questions.

765
01:13:47,561 --> 01:13:51,461
Instead of questions like,
"Am I happy in this moment?",

766
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:53,647
I'd prefer questions like,
"Do I love this moment?"

767
01:13:54,668 --> 01:14:01,637
Lately, I've noticed that there are
so many perfect images on social media,

768
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:06,608
be it economically, physically,
or in terms of lifestyle.

769
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:10,112
The higher we go, there are people
who are even more perfect

770
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,749
and someone even more perfect than that.

771
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,351
All the while, I feel that I lack something.

772
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:25,461
When it comes to consolations like,
"You're fine as you are," which are okay,

773
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:30,699
but aside from these worldly perfections...

774
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,838
I mean, look at me. My skin is a bit dark,

775
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:40,108
my eyes look like this, and my voice is like this.

776
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:41,881
I've embraced these things...

777
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:45,639
and thanks to you,
I have come to love myself more.

778
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:48,250
That's what I wanted to tell you.

779
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,452
I will no longer be swept by the waves!

780
01:14:52,726 --> 01:14:59,153
Everyone, please use the flashlight on your phones
and shine them on us.

781
01:14:59,153 --> 01:15:03,958
We dedicate this last song to you,
who have become our universe.

782
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,467
Here's our last wave.

783
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:07,636
Thank you and we really love you.

784
01:15:38,967 --> 01:15:40,936
- Thank you.
- Paris.

785
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,108
ARMY!

786
01:15:48,515 --> 01:15:51,885
Welcome to Shizuoka, everyone!

787
01:16:03,699 --> 01:16:05,401
Let's enjoy this last show!

788
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,617
I don't think I expect a lot in terms of results.

789
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,787
When we give someone a birthday gift,

790
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:35,390
it's not like we do it to get something back
on our next birthday.

791
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:43,231
If I can have a positive effect on someone,
or even on myself,

792
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:46,702
it's only right that I do what I can.

793
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:52,579
One example could be going to a BTS concert
or meeting someone new

794
01:16:52,579 --> 01:16:54,940
and talking with that person to feel refreshed.

795
01:16:54,940 --> 01:16:58,447
It could be enjoying a performance
and feeling refreshed that way.

796
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:03,143
We will help in any way we can,

797
01:17:03,143 --> 01:17:07,848
so I hope people find their own way to happiness.

798
01:17:08,862 --> 01:17:14,520
I hope there's not too much sadness and despair,
and at the same time,

799
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:19,602
I want us to be a reason
for each and every person to smile.

800
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:26,041
Wouldn't that alone be a major success
for the kind of work we do?

801
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:34,583
That's why as long as we are making music,
I want fans to express how they are feeling.

802
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,853
If they felt comforted by our music,

803
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:41,857
we're the kind of team
that would feel strengthened by it

804
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:44,493
and use that driving force to feel more energized.

805
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:47,929
So I hope fans don't take too long
to tell us as much as they can.

806
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:51,099
Luckily, I'm really glad
that I'm spreading the message

807
01:17:51,099 --> 01:17:55,270
and making the music
I've always wanted to make.

808
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:59,708
I'm glad that the music I make

809
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:04,405
and the music people hear
aren't interpreted too differently.

810
01:18:04,405 --> 01:18:10,185
I hope to see more artists
who are inspired by us to create

811
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,820
more amazing and successful music.

812
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:15,190
That way, others will see them
and be inspired to do the same.

813
01:18:44,378 --> 01:18:45,420
I don't know.

814
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:49,396
It's not just about what they mean to me.

815
01:18:49,396 --> 01:18:53,195
They've always been with me during these moments,

816
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:57,699
so in a way, they are the ones

817
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:02,170
with whom I spent the most precious
and brilliant moments of my life.

818
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,905
That's how I would describe them.

819
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,786
Everything passes in life.

820
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:21,223
People fall in love, part,
fall in love, and part again.

821
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:25,427
Does that mean our past relationships
mean nothing to us?

822
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:29,598
No. They helped shape who we are,
but that's the reality.

823
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:33,702
You gain some, and you lose some,
and that cycle continues.

824
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:38,140
In that process, we were able to share
amongst ourselves

825
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:42,711
the things we couldn't share with the world,

826
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:46,673
and for even just a moment,
they accepted my worth.

827
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,585
I think that's enough for me.
