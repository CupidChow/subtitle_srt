1
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,800
You worthless fool.

2
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,160
For a woman,

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,920
you provoked someone you shouldn't have.

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,720
Grandfather.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,680
I had no idea

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,680
that Lin Dongfeng

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
was actually that capable.

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,440
Didn't I tell you

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,200
to stay away from Lin Dongfeng?

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,960
Wasn't the patent incident lesson enough for you?

11
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,690
Haven't you learned anything?

12
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,800
Grandfather.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,320
Grandfather,

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,440
please stop. I was wrong.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,770
I truly know my mistake.

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,000
How many times have I taught you?

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
When you don't know your opponent's cards,

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,480
never act rashly.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,810
It all went in one ear and out the other.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,640
Grandfather,

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,200
I was wrong.

22
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,289
Untie it.

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,890
Grandfather, I—

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,370
You think I don't know what you've been doing?

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,840
At a time like this,

26
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,720
you're still hesitating.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,520
You're not worthy to be a Gu family descendant,

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,400
let alone the heir to Huasheng Group.

29
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,640
What is it?

30
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,640
Smith, right?

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,360
I'm Gu Yongbang.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a great honor

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,440
to speak directly with the true leader of Huasheng Group.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,640
We're both straightforward people,

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,440
so let's skip the pleasantries.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,120
I'm aware of all the deals between you and Gu Shaocheng.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,039
Let me

38
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,600
tell you clearly.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,680
Your attempt to control Huasheng

40
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,400
through Gu Shaocheng

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,640
will never succeed.

42
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,120
With all due respect, Mr. Gu,

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,200
Huasheng Group has just lost

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,840
cooperation with all top scientists.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,720
To me,

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,400
such a Huasheng

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,360
is worthless.

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,640
I must admit

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,520
that investing in

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,760
Gu Shaocheng

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,440
was a complete failure.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,800
Now,

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,160
I'd like to discuss a win-win deal with you.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,600
I really can't imagine

55
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
what bargaining chips

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,440
Huasheng Group has to negotiate with us now.

57
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,480
I know

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,640
you're looking for the person who completed controlled nuclear fusion.

59
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,800
I've found them.

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,600
If you don't cooperate with Huasheng,

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,780
I, Gu Yongbang, have the power

62
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,420
to ensure you'll never find this person.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,480
Fine, I admit you have this capability.

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,280
Tell me about your cooperation proposal.

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,040
Huasheng can provide you with

66
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,920
the technical details of controlled nuclear fusion.

67
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,480
You'll complete the public experiment.

68
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,880
After successful completion,

69
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,120
we'll share the patent.

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,960
You'll gain influence for your backers,

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,840
and Huasheng

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,160
can become the world's highest-valued company.

73
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
We both win.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
I agree to this proposal.

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,560
Then let's prepare to begin the second phase of experiments.

76
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,060
Protect that student.

77
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,920
Before the experiment succeeds,

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,280
we can't let anyone

79
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,880
know about our cooperation.

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,920
Yes, sir.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Kneel down.

82
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
Who told you to get up?

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,400
Before dawn,

84
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,360
reflect well before our ancestors.

85
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,240
Now that

86
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,970
personal matters are settled,

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,640
we

88
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,100
should discuss business.

89
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,810
The closed-door meeting will now officially begin.

90
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,760
Closed-door meeting?

91
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,140
Why wasn't Director Lin invited?

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,920
Lin Dongfeng wasn't invited

93
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,840
in order to

94
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,080
reduce his pressure

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,560
so he can

96
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,890
focus on solving the difficult problems.

97
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,200
Some burdens

98
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,840
we veterans

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,500
can still carry for the younger generation.

100
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,640
As it should be.

101
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,760
Yes, indeed.

102
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,050
The content of this meeting

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,600
concerns controlled nuclear fusion,

104
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,700
the second phase experiment,

105
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,920
specifically the arrangements for the nuclear fusion energy control experiment.

106
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,920
Both of you, please discuss

107
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,560
your specific views on this phase of the experiment

108
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,460
and your preparation status.

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,180
For this phase,

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,330
Under Jingshu's guidance,

111
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,850
Lin Dongfeng has made rapid progress.

112
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,120
The data model for nuclear fusion energy control

113
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,250
has been completed.

114
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,040
Several key data points

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,400
have been verified by me.

116
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,680
We're ready to conduct the experiment.

117
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,560
The feasibility assessment on my end is fine,

118
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
but we still lack raw materials.

119
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,480
Testing the limits of nuclear fusion control

120
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,360
requires enormous amounts of materials.

121
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,480
Currently,

122
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,520
we can hardly support the complete experiment.

123
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,760
What if we find channels

124
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,360
to purchase from abroad?

125
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,620
These nuclear fusion materials are too sensitive.

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,920
Large-scale purchases now

127
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,680
could alert foreign companies to get ahead of us.

128
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,040
Sir.

129
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm Yang Zhengdao.

130
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,680
I have a situation to report to you.

131
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,960
The raw materials needed for the nuclear fusion experiment are currently scarce.

132
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
Could you

133
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,400
approve some materials

134
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
from the special resource reserve?

135
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,040
Thank you.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I won't let everyone down. I'll complete the mission.

137
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,620
Academician Kang,

138
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,210
don't worry about the materials anymore.

139
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
The leader has approved it.

140
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,720
They'll fully support our experiment.

141
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,680
That's excellent!

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,660
Let's leave it at that for now.

143
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,770
Prepare according to the plan.

144
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,690
Meeting adjourned.

145
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,800
Mr. Wu,

146
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
please stay for a moment.

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,200
There's something

148
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,240
I need to

149
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
clarify with you.

150
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,680
The leader said

151
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,160
After this experiment,

152
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,220
the required materials will take six months

153
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
to be purchased in batches

154
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,810
from domestic and foreign suppliers.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,200
This means

156
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
within six months,

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,320
we can only conduct one complete experiment.

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,800
Foreign institutions are putting pressure on us now,

159
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,659
and they're unlikely to give us another six months.

160
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,760
Therefore,

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,200
this is actually our only chance.

162
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,440
Director Yang,

163
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
rest assured.

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,600
We will ensure this experiment is absolutely foolproof

165
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,560
and airtight.

166
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,880
I believe in our team.

167
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,130
The lady has gone to bed.

168
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,210
She took sleeping pills

169
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,500
and is already asleep.

170
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,360
Dongfeng.

171
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,320
Miss Gu.

172
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,450
Thank you so much for today.

173
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,080
After today,

174
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,130
Gu Shaocheng

175
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,000
won't be able to cause any more trouble.

176
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
You've dealt a heavy blow to Huasheng Group today.

177
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,880
Those who see you as an enemy

178
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,680
are no longer just Gu Shaocheng.

179
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,560
It's fine.

180
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,970
We'll face whatever comes our way.

181
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I haven't yet

182
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,880
revealed my true trump card.

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,120
Wanzi.

184
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,330
Don't worry.

185
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,240
No one will ever bully you again.

186
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,520
I promise.

187
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,420
I will protect you no matter what.

188
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,360
Alright.

189
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,080
Today's crisis has been resolved.

190
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,010
It's time to discuss matters between the three of us.

191
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,220
Now that we've driven away Gu Shaocheng,

192
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,240
let's talk about

193
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,330
the distribution of the Zheng family assets.

194
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,720
Lin Dongfeng

195
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,200
took all the credit.

196
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,880
But this money today

197
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,280
doesn't belong to him alone.

198
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,650
Technically speaking,

199
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,620
the Zheng family assets today

200
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,160
were purchased by Lin Dongfeng and me.

201
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,080
Didn't you tell me today

202
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,280
that all the money in the card is mine?

203
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
I changed my mind.

204
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,450
Is that not allowed?

205
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,520
Don't forget,

206
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,050
technically speaking,

207
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
you work for me.

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,560
Not you.

209
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,120
Today,

210
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,180
thanks to Sister Gu

211
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,720
and Dongfeng making this money,

212
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,900
Gu Shaocheng didn't succeed.

213
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,130
As for how to distribute the Zheng family assets,

214
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,050
I'll follow Sister Gu's decision.

215
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,360
I want all shares of Zheng Corporation.

216
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,960
70% will be mine,

217
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,000
and the remaining 30%

218
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,560
goes to Lin Dongfeng.

219
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,690
Do you agree?

220
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,820
I don't want it.

221
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,560
Miss Gu,

222
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,320
this is Wanzhi's father's life's work.

223
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,040
How could you?

224
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,800
It's okay.

225
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,640
Mom and I wouldn't know how to run the company anyway.

226
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,760
I believe

227
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,290
Sister Gu can manage Zheng Corporation well.

228
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,520
Right now,

229
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,460
I just want Mom and me to live peacefully.

230
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,360
As for this villa

231
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,320
and all the Zheng family assets,

232
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,720
including real estate, land, vehicles, etc.,

233
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,650
the market value

234
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,080
is about 40 million.

235
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
I want to take back the other assets.

236
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,560
For Lin Dongfeng's sake,

237
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,520
you and your mother

238
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
can continue living in this villa.

239
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,280
I only want 5 million,

240
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,040
with a 30-year term.

241
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,920
You can pay me monthly,

242
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
and I won't charge interest.

243
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,680
I'm already grateful that Sister Gu lets Mom and me stay here.

244
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,320
I'm truly thankful.

245
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,050
I'll repay this money as soon as possible.

246
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,480
Come outside with me.

247
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,610
I need to talk to you.

248
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,080
Listen, Miss Gu,

249
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,000
could you stop making things difficult for this widow and her child?

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,840
Besides, I earned this money myself.

251
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,040
What right do you have to take back their assets?

252
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,500
Did you ask for my opinion?

253
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,280
Lin Dongfeng,

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,120
so now you're feeling sorry for your little girlfriend?

255
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,180
Have you forgotten

256
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,000
how they treated you

257
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
before their family went bankrupt?

258
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,360
She was ready to marry Gu Shaocheng to clear her family's debts

259
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,760
and cut ties with you without looking back.

260
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,760
When she saw you could make money,

261
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,560
she immediately came back to curry favor with you.

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,040
Please, brother,

263
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,810
I need you to see clearly

264
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
who exactly has been

265
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,880
consistently

266
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,520
supporting and encouraging you all along.

267
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I don't care.

268
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,700
You can't treat her like this.

269
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,400
If you insist on making things difficult for Wanzhi,

270
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
then I won't do any more work for you.

271
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,680
I can leave her alone,

272
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
but she has to agree to one thing for me.
