1
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
It's you.

2
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,120
Let me formally introduce myself.

3
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm your research assistant,

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,680
Yang Jingshu.

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,360
So,

6
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,400
everything I've been doing,

7
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
you knew about it all.

8
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,440
It must be tough dealing with those old men,

9
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,880
especially that Yang Zhengdao.

10
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,280
I don't know why,

11
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,539
but I always feel somewhat afraid of him.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Let me show you around the lab first.

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,940
I'm busy right now.

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,880
I want to invite you to Huasheng Group's press conference.

15
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,280
Help me check out Gu Shaocheng's so-called chip technology.

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,880
See what's really going on with it.

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,759
Every time I help you,

18
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,160
nothing good comes of it.

19
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,009
Huasheng Group's business

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
is not my concern.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,160
Don't you want to know about Zheng Wanzhi?

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,360
Why she left you?

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,880
And why she's attending the press conference?

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,600
Are you saying

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,729
Wanzhi is going too?

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,960
I was hoping to create an opportunity for you two.

27
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,880
Forget it.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,000
There are plenty of people

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,640
who understand technology besides you.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,760
I'll find someone else.

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,440
Wait!

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,680
I'll go.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,680
Tech experts may be common,

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,400
but geniuses like me

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,560
are quite rare.

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,520
In ten minutes,

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,250
meet me downstairs at the dorm.

38
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
You're going to wear this

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,800
to the press conference?

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
What's wrong?

41
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,720
It looks quite proper.

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,850
It even has a collar.

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
Get in the car.

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,320
I need to teach you a thing or two.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,560
No.

46
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,370
Next outfit.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,560
Next one.

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,280
No, no.

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,570
Not this one.

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,600
This one.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,000
Excuse me for a moment.

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
Gu Shaocheng.

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,320
I found that your chip technology

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,360
highly overlaps with foreign patents.

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,400
You'd better stop this launch event immediately.

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,480
Otherwise,

57
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,280
you'll destroy Huasheng Group.

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,140
My dear sister,

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,090
do you know who they are?

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,640
This is

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
Chairman Tang from the Technology Association,

62
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,760
who oversees domestic patent approvals.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,960
That's Chairman Nie,

64
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,290
who handles overseas patent reviews.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,890
Once they both sign off,

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,980
my new technology will send Huasheng's market value soaring.

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,960
Someone as old-fashioned as you

68
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
will only ruin Huasheng.

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
Mr. Gu!

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,040
Come over here!

71
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,080
Just a moment.

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,210
I'll be right there.

73
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,920
Excuse me.

74
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,620
Just sit back and watch

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,760
how I lead Huasheng to the top.

76
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,120
Oh, by the way,

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,540
that guy next to you

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,840
is so pathetic.

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
If you really can't find a date, just let me know.

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,730
I can easily arrange some male models for you.

81
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,240
Which would be better than finding this poor student.

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
Who's dressed up but only embarrasses Huasheng.

83
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,920
Excuse me,

84
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,140
Is he always this annoying when he talks?

85
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,040
Chairman,

86
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm sorry, I apologize.

87
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Please excuse me.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,360
Please,

89
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,290
Have some water.

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
I'm sorry for the poor hospitality.

91
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,290
We'll start right away.

92
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,420
Let's hurry up.

94
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,600
Thank you all

95
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,640
for taking time out of your busy schedules

96
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,500
to attend Huasheng Group's new technology launch.

97
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,840
Before we officially begin the presentation,

98
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,040
I have some good news

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,720
that I'm eager to share with everyone here.

100
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
And that is,

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
I'm getting married.

102
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,360
Which lucky girl

103
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,720
is marrying into the Gu family?

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Let us see what beauty she is.

105
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,700
Only someone worthy of our CEO Gu.

106
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,520
My new bride

107
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,520
is the heiress of Zheng Corporation, my childhood sweetheart,

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,320
Zheng Wanzhi.

109
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Speaking of my wedding with Wanzhi,

110
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,400
besides our childhood romance,

111
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
When facing an ex,

112
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,400
you can't lose your confidence.

113
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,610
I'd like to especially thank someone,

114
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,240
that is Wanzhi's ex-boyfriend,

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,000
Lin Dongfeng.

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,040
I want to thank him.

117
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,440
For taking care of Wanzi over the past few years.

118
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,160
And returning her to me completely intact.

119
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,240
I should also thank him for his poor judgment,

120
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,800
and his worthlessness,

121
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,280
for making Wanzi realize

122
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
that marrying into the Gu family

123
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
is such an honor.

124
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,880
Today,

125
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,400
he has also come to the venue.

126
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,920
I want to tell him:

127
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,040
A toad will always be a toad.

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,360
Don't dream of tasting swan meat.

129
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
How presumptuous.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
The nerve to show up here.

131
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,760
Isn't he just humiliating himself?

132
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,400
Lin Dongfeng.

133
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,200
Calm down.

134
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,260
How can I stay calm?

135
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,320
Let go

136
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,010
of Wanzi.

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,640
Let

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,480
her go.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Release

140
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,480
her now.

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,080
I just love seeing you like this,

142
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
hating me but unable to get rid of me.

143
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
You know what?

144
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,960
The more powerless you are,

145
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,620
the more it proves Wanzhi made the right choice.

146
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,640
Let him go!

147
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,680
If he gets hurt at all,

148
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,340
I'll have all of you fired.

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,720
Let's go.

150
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
Let me go!

151
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,880
Let go!

152
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,040
Wanzhi!

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,320
Wanzhi!

154
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,040
Wanzhi.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,440
Lin Dongfeng,

156
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
calm down.

157
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,240
Being so impulsive

158
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,400
won't solve anything.

159
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,480
He humiliated me in public.

160
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,540
How can I stay calm?

161
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,200
All my life,

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I've been taught to be well-mannered

163
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,120
and tolerant of others.

164
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,180
But what happened?

165
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,800
From now on,

166
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
I'll make everyone know.

167
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
They may hold the knife,

168
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,920
but I won't be their cutting board.

169
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
I understand how you feel,

170
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,090
but you're no match for him.

171
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,160
I didn't think it through.

172
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,220
I shouldn't have asked for your help.

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,760
By the way,

174
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,520
you asked me to come here

175
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,880
because you think the new technology

176
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,559
that Gu Shaocheng is releasing today has issues?

177
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,200
Yes.

178
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,240
But since he's invited the two chairmen from the Technology Association,

179
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,799
even if we discover problems,

180
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,460
it won't change anything now.

181
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
As long as you have the documents for the new technology,

182
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,730
I have a way to stop this press conference.

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,200
However,

184
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,520
you need to think carefully.

185
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,480
If we do this,

186
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Huasheng's reputation will be severely damaged.

187
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,160
If you really can stop this press conference,

188
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm willing to cooperate with you.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,120
For Huasheng,

190
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,320
a century of foundation is more important than short-term reputation.

191
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,240
Well then,

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,930
pleasure doing business with you.

193
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,770
Pleasure doing business with you.

194
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,250
Send me all the documents about the chip technology.

195
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,610
Let's go.

196
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,080
Let's give Young Master Gu

197
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,160
a little surprise.

198
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,280
For the launch of the new technology,

199
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,760
I'll need both chairmen's support.

200
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,560
Of course.

201
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,640
After the launch,

202
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,080
we all win.

203
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Good. No problem.

204
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Please excuse me.

205
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,360
I really envy you

206
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,520
for being so thick-skinned.

207
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,080
How dare you!

208
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,680
Get your filthy hands off me.

209
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,040
Sister.

210
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,480
Feeling hurt?

211
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,160
You haven't actually fallen for this poor student, have you?

212
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Gu Shaocheng,

213
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,680
your smugness won't last long.

214
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,640
I'll make you

215
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,440
pay for what you've done.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, I'm so scared.

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,660
A student who's learned to make threats now.

218
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
Are you going to

219
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,000
tell on me to the teacher?

220
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,690
Will they deduct my credits

221
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,740
or give me a disciplinary action?

222
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
This evidence...

223
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,840
This proves your chip technology has stolen multiple patents

224
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,640
and doesn't qualify for domestic market listing.

225
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Do you want me to sue you for defamation?

226
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,160
There are plenty of lawyers here today.

227
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
With just one word from me,

228
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,490
any of them could bankrupt you.

229
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,840
Chairman Tang.

230
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,040
Here is evidence of their chip technology

231
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,120
and patent violations.

232
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,810
I suggest you immediately terminate Huasheng Group's approval process.

233
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
Who do you think you are,

234
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
talking to Chairman Tang like that?

235
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,960
You're just a nobody.

236
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,050
Who would care about anything you say?

237
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,360
Exactly.

238
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,720
You're just a college dropout

239
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,280
who found some random pictures online.

240
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,610
You call this evidence?

241
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,320
Mr. Gu's approval process was personally handled by me and Chairman Nie.

242
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,960
Every detail has been thoroughly verified.

243
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,400
Let alone someone like you,

244
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,340
no matter who comes today,

245
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
nothing will affect the approval process.

246
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,700
The new technology will go to market.

247
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,840
Chairman Nie.

248
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,490
Won't you look at the evidence?

249
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,200
Just seeking attention.

250
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,200
I'd like to see

251
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,560
what this so-called evidence of yours is.

252
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,560
The evidence is correct.

253
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,560
But

254
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,560
unfortunately

255
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,440
it's gone.

256
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,480
Miss Gu.

257
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,210
What did I do?

258
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,200
In front of everyone,

259
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,840
you dare to destroy evidence.

260
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,080
You're quite bold.

261
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,530
I don't understand what Miss Gu is talking about.

262
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,680
Who was so careless

263
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,210
and dropped their phone on the ground?

264
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,760
Young man.

265
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,880
You need to be more careful.

266
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,840
I know you're all in this together,

267
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,130
but I didn't expect you to be so shameless.

268
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,960
I gave you a chance,

269
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,520
but you didn't take it.

270
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,800
Everything

271
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,280
is your own fault.

272
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,360
Kid,

273
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,640
have you been watching too many web dramas?

274
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,200
Giving us a chance?

275
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,530
Who do you think you are?

276
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,200
Let me borrow your phone.

277
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,000
As long as it's not illegal,

278
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
if you need anything,

279
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,520
I can personally help you.

280
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,760
You need to understand.

281
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,090
Okay.

282
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,760
The entire country stands behind you.

283
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,040
Then I'll have to

284
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,600
exercise my authority just a little bit.
