1
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,480
How did my father end up owing so much money?

2
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,720
What's really going on here?

3
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,360
I thought

4
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,360
if you married Shaocheng,

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,960
you wouldn't be dragged down by this family.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,039
You've been pampered since childhood.

7
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,039
How could you handle such hardship?

8
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,730
I was planning to wait until you were settled.

9
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,200
Then I would give up this house.

10
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,720
And sell the remaining shares.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,860
That should be enough to cover it.

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,640
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,729
What good would telling you do?

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,610
It would only make you worry along with me.

15
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Mom just wants you to live a carefree life.

16
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,160
Silly child.

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,440
Mom,

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,200
I was too selfish before.

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,440
I've grown up now.

21
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
I can share the family's burden.

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,050
About the marriage with the Gu family,

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,860
I'll give it serious consideration.

24
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,840
Really?

25
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,040
That's wonderful!

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,170
I'm coming over now.

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,010
Thank you for today.

28
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,200
Nice to meet you.

29
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,120
Being friends with someone like you

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,980
is my honor too.

31
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's go.

32
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,040
Hit it!

33
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,600
Go for it!

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,200
Hurry!

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,480
No.

36
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,440
I'll do it.

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,570
Go play by yourself.

38
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
The progress is impressive.

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,050
Team Leader Lin.

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,050
What happened to your face?

41
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,680
It's nothing.

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,420
I just fell accidentally.

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,800
Be careful.

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,520
According to your proposal,

45
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,240
we've greatly accelerated the controlled nuclear fusion experiment.

46
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,880
Now

47
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,480
the first phase experimental data is ready.

48
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,000
If

49
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,280
it matches your calculations perfectly,

50
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,040
then it proves

51
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,840
your proposal

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,140
is completely viable.

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,170
We can immediately proceed to the second phase of experiments.

54
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
Professor Wu.

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,800
For this data,

56
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
you haven't rested at all, have you?

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,960
The opportunity to change an era is right before us.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,490
How could I possibly sleep?

59
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,280
I'm fine.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,930
Let's go check the data.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,520
That's right.

62
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,060
Indeed, it's correct.

63
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
A perfect match.

64
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,560
Comrades.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
We're one step closer

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,320
to making history.

67
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,000
How are things going with the Zheng family?

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,160
Everything has been taken care of.

69
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,400
Most of the Zheng family's debt

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,530
has been recovered.

71
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,160
What about Zheng Wanzhi?

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,360
The photos have been sent to her through her best friend.

73
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
She must be heartbroken by now.

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,760
Excellent.

75
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,560
Back then, Zheng Guofu didn't know what was good for him

76
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,560
and rejected my marriage proposal.

77
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,450
Now I'll take everything back with interest.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,440
Once I become the actual controller of the Zheng Group,

79
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,760
Zheng Wanzhi

80
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,800
will be putty in my hands.

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,159
Mr. Gu, with your brilliant planning,

82
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,200
taking over the Zheng Group

83
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,240
and winning the beauty

84
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,700
is just around the corner.

85
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
Cut the nonsense.

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,000
Get out.

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,720
I've got what you wanted.

88
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,240
What I want,

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,320
you must give it to me now.

90
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,400
Rest assured.

91
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
We honor our commitments to partners.

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,960
I've received your data.

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,720
I'll arrange now

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,400
to send you the latest chip technology.

95
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,640
You'll make a lot of money.

96
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,920
Become the true master of Huasheng.

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,960
Grandpa,

98
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,760
I got the latest chip.

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,680
So impetuous.

100
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,650
Have some tea first.

101
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,610
Calm down before you speak.

102
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,280
I got it.

103
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,120
Compose yourself.

104
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,480
Whatever you want to say,

105
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,570
think it through before speaking.

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,570
Grandpa.

107
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
This is the latest chip technology.

108
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,720
I've already submitted it to the regulatory department.

109
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,780
We'll receive the market approval document next week.

110
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
That's great.

111
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,880
This will significantly

112
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,720
improve our products.

113
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
What are your plans?

114
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,000
I plan to

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,660
On the day of market approval,

116
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,290
hold a press conference

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,160
to announce that our Huasheng Group

118
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,290
has joined the ranks

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,730
of global leaders in chip technology.

120
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,880
And take this opportunity

121
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,400
to stimulate the financial market

122
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,680
so that all our Huasheng Group stocks,

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,880
both domestic and international, hit their daily limit.

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,380
Any issues with the approval?

125
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,720
I've already communicated with the two approval officials

126
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
to ensure everything goes smoothly.

127
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,280
Good.

128
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,120
Since

129
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,900
you've made thorough preparations,

130
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,000
go ahead with it.

131
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,200
So you're

132
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,060
giving your approval?

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,520
What about the other directors?

134
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,920
You mean Bingqing?

135
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,840
Don't worry.

136
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,040
When it comes to the group's interests,

137
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,210
she has a clear head.

138
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,960
Besides,

139
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,120
this old man is still around.

140
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,560
You

141
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,120
just go ahead with it.

142
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,770
As for company matters,

143
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,600
you don't need to worry too much.

144
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
However,

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,880
regarding the approval process,

146
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,040
we can't be careless

147
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,520
and can't afford any surprises.

148
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
You must ensure

149
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,560
everything is foolproof.

150
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,560
Understand?

151
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,720
I understand.

152
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
Rest assured.

153
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,920
I'll make sure the press conference is

154
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,960
absolutely foolproof

155
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,080
and airtight.

156
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,980
What time are you going tomorrow?

157
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,080
Around 8 o'clock.

158
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,480
Me too.

159
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,080
Wanzhi

160
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,940
So at that time,

161
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,200
can we talk?

162
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,890
You all go ahead.

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,330
Let's go.

164
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,520
Lin Dongfeng

165
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,080
I've already told you we're over.

166
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,140
Stop bothering me.

167
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,840
Wanzhi

168
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,970
If there's any problem between us,

169
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,480
we can solve it together.

170
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,880
As long as we still love each other,

171
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,340
I believe there's no problem we can't solve.

172
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,640
Lin Dongfeng

173
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,900
Don't you understand?

174
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,130
We're from completely different worlds.

175
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,400
No matter how hard you try,

176
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,660
how excellent you are,

177
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
you're still just from an ordinary family.

178
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
You'll never fit into high society.

179
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,040
I was too naive before,

180
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
thinking love was everything.

181
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,160
Now I understand.

182
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,160
I don't want love without financial security.

183
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
Just go.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,680
I don't want to see you again.

185
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,520
Dongfeng

186
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,280
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,400
I have my own path to follow.

188
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,920
We can't go back anymore.

189
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,290
First of all,

190
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,520
thank you all for your hard work.

191
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,480
Special thanks to Comrade Lin Dongfeng for his experimental plan

192
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,520
and data.

193
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,280
They have enabled us to make

194
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,000
significant breakthroughs

195
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,080
in controlled nuclear fusion technology in such a short time.

196
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,520
We have successfully completed the first phase

197
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,960
of verifying all experimental data.

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,440
However,

199
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
the reality is not optimistic.

200
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,560
According to reliable sources,

201
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,680
foreign countries have almost simultaneously

202
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,960
completed their work on

203
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,560
Verification of the first phase experimental data for controlled nuclear fusion.

204
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,440
This means.

205
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,880
Although

206
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,360
we've made progress,

207
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,560
we're still

208
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,440
at the same starting point as our competitors.

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,320
That's impossible!

210
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,000
I've researched this my entire life

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,960
and never heard

212
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,680
of any foreign countries

213
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,800
making major breakthroughs in controlled fusion.

214
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,130
How could they suddenly

215
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,520
make such a significant breakthrough?

216
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,640
Exactly.

217
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,520
Whether domestically or internationally,

218
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,200
in the materials science field,

219
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,440
if any team

220
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,160
were researching materials for controlled fusion,

221
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,880
I would definitely know about it.

222
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,680
Alright.

223
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,920
I know

224
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,000
you all don't want to believe this.

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,800
To be honest,

226
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,660
I don't believe it either.

227
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,080
How could it be such a coincidence?

228
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,320
As soon as we make a breakthrough,

229
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,050
foreign competitors catch up.

230
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,400
But

231
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
reality

232
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
is just that cruel.

233
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,080
What we can do now

234
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,680
is to keep our spirits up,

235
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,920
rely on our own strengths,

236
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,040
allow no slacking,

237
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,520
and make every moment count.

238
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,480
Yes.

239
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,320
What we need to do next is

240
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,600
the second phase of experiments

241
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,800
and then the third phase.

242
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,240
We cannot allow our competitors

243
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,080
to catch up with our pace.

244
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,560
Director Lin,

245
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,380
please say something too.

246
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,120
Please believe me,

247
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
as long as I have enough time,

248
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,440
I won't let anyone

249
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,330
catch up with our progress.

250
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,680
The realization of controlled nuclear fusion

251
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,210
will definitely be accomplished by us first.

252
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,460
For the convenience of

253
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Comrade Lin Dongfeng's daily life

254
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,520
and security requirements,

255
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,940
we have contacted Jiangbei University.

256
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,240
Some preliminary research

257
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,330
can still be conducted in the Jiangbei University laboratory.

258
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,240
Also,

259
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,770
we've assigned a research assistant for Comrade Lin Dongfeng.

260
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,280
You're assigning me a research assistant?

261
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,330
It's not another old professor, is it?

262
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,600
Not an old professor.

263
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,960
Someone about your age.

264
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,780
You should get along well.

265
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,520
Finally, I can have someone my own age

266
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,050
and won't have to make awkward small talk with old men every day.

267
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,640
Someone my age.

268
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,200
To break the ice,

269
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,400
talking about basketball should work.

270
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,800
If he doesn't play basketball,

271
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,040
a game of Honor of Kings should help us bond.

272
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,730
That's the plan.

273
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,520
It's you.
