1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,280
Wu. Wu.

2
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,680
You've been so strict all your life.

3
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,000
You didn't even miss a small number.

4
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,200
At such a critical moment,

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,800
at this critical moment.

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm not blaming you.

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,680
You're taking our hard work as a joke.

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
As the deputy team leader,

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,000
How could you set an example like that?

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,130
Professor Oh...

11
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,880
Don't explain for me.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,400
Everyone knows

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm your student.

14
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,680
In front of justice,

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,240
in front of justice.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,120
But...

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,980
All right, let's go. Let's go.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,240
Let's go. Let's go.

19
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,200
It's useless to complain.

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,320
In this situation,

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,600
we can only

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,660
Let's finish this experiment. Okay.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,760
Half a year later.

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,759
Okay. Okay.

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,360
Test again.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,720
As for Mr. Wu,

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,120
or

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,039
I'll report it.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
Let the leaders decide.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,960
Editor Yang.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,440
Prepare the materials again.

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,039
Do you need half a year?

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,640
This is Yang Jeong Do.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,600
What?

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Is this true?

36
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,800
I see.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
I just received a message.

38
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,560
The overseas Smith team

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,840
[suddenly developed rapidly.]

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,240
Before 15 minutes,

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,820
the nuclear transformation energy control experiment started.

42
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:35,680
And

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,880
they invited international experts to observe.

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,840
If the experiment succeeds,

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,500
they apply for patent protection immediately.

46
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,040
If...

47
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,840
we'll be passive.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
It means

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,320
we have to

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,240
through the current route to conduct experiments.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,520
Wu,

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,120
You made a huge mistake.

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,570
Editor Yang.

54
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,080
I request

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
to enter the lab.

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,960
Yes.

57
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,520
artificial correction.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,560
Are you crazy?

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,320
You know how strong

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,720
how strong electromagnetic radiation is.

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,040
But the experiment can't stop.

62
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,360
Once it stops,

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,040
we have no chance.

64
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,079
The efforts of scientists

65
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,079
will be ruined by me today.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,280
Editor Yang.

67
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,079
Just agree

68
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,800
my request.

69
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,520
Editor Yang.

70
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,440
You can't agree to Wu's request.

71
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,560
This is a matter of life and death.

72
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
Wu.

73
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,880
I know you made a mistake.

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,120
I feel so guilty.

75
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,960
I was too harsh just now.

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
But no matter what,

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,400
I can't watch you enter the lab.

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,680
This is a nuclear mutation.

79
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,320
If anything goes wrong,

80
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,160
it'll kill us.

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,880
Yes.

82
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,640
Wu.

83
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,160
As long as you're alive,

84
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,490
there will be firewood.

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,520
Thank you for your kindness.

86
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,640
Thank you.

87
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,279
But

88
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,360
I can't let my mistake

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,320
because of my mistake today.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,760
Then I'll become a sinner of history.

91
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Stop persuading me.

92
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
I've made up my mind.

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,850
Editor Yang.

94
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll go to the lab

95
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm younger.

96
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,880
and healthy.

97
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,400
and safer.

98
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,800
Because I'm young,

99
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,560
I can't let you in.

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,320
You have to keep the wisdom beyond the era.

101
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,280
to lead the future

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,560
to lead the future.

103
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,640
I'm old.

104
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,880
It's okay.

105
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
The future

106
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,840
You young people

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,440
Mr. Yang.

108
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,600
Don't hesitate.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,600
We don't have enough materials left.

110
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,880
I allow you

111
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,520
to enter the lab

112
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,580
and perform artificial correction.

113
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
But remember,

114
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,880
at any time,

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
life is the most important.

116
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,400
Don't worry.

117
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,040
Wu, I...

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,440
haven't lived enough.

119
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,400
Wu.

120
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,680
There's one more segment before the ceremony.

121
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,960
Please grant my wish.

122
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,320
Master,

123
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,240
I, Wu Wenyong,

124
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,520
Greet you.

125
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,720
The ceremony is done.

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,640
Professor Wu.

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,400
I've made many decisions in my life.

128
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,290
But I believe

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,720
I made the right choice.

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,400
is now.

131
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,760
Lin Dong Feng.

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Lin Dong Feng.

133
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,720
I don’t need to succeed.

134
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,520
I will succeed.

135
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
The data is up.

136
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,340
The mutation reaction is back on.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,800
Mr Wu.

138
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,860
The ultimate value command has been activated.

139
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,240
Please evacuate immediately.
