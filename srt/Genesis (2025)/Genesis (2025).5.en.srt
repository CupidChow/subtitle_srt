1
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,440
Damn it!

2
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,840
Dongfeng!

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,240
Dongfeng!

4
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,200
Gu Bingqing,

5
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,200
how dare you ruin my plans!

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,860
Shameless!

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,600
Scum!

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,480
How could the Gu family raise such a scoundrel like you?

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,210
Gu Bingqing!

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,480
I advise you to mind your own business.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,320
After tonight, I'll be a director of the group.

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,880
I'll have plenty of ways to make your life difficult.

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,280
If the chairman finds out

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,760
about today's incident,

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,760
forget about being a Huasheng director.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,160
You won't even be allowed

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,160
to set foot in the Gu family house again.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,890
What did I do?

19
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,960
I didn't do anything.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,600
There's no evidence.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,280
Everyone will just think that you, Gu Bingqing,

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,140
are a sore loser

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,560
backed into a corner.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,930
Unfortunately,

25
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,560
the surveillance camera in this room broke down yesterday.

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,160
We can't see anything today.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,250
Don't leave.

28
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,900
I'm taking Miss Zheng with me.

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,560
I won't argue with you today,

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,920
because I don't want

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,979
you to ruin Miss Zheng's reputation.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,330
But sooner or later,

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,020
I'll make you pay for this.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,920
Nonsense!

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,850
You still have energy to meddle in others' business.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
Making me pay the price.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,900
When I take over Huasheng,

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,780
you'll be the first one I kick out.

39
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,680
No money.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,600
If you have no money, why take a taxi?

41
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,160
Crazy.

42
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,540
I should have asked Professor Wu for some taxi fare.

43
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,040
Kid.

44
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,640
I'll trade my watch

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,120
for your watch

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,000
and this bicycle.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,860
What do you say?

48
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,180
Hello, Wanzhi.

49
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,000
Wanzhi?

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,880
I'm sorry. Are you still at Huasheng?

51
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,040
I'm coming right now.

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,360
It's me, Gu Bingqing.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,760
Why is it you?

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,690
Where's Wanzhi?

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,520
Zheng Wanzhi is right next to me.

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,250
She's drunk.

57
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,490
Where can I find you?

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,800
How did she get drunk?

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,079
Take her home first.

60
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,000
25 Fulin Road.

61
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,960
I'm not far from there.

62
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,090
I'll be right there.

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,880
Didn't you say you were nearby?

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,940
Coming right away?

65
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,680
I've been racing here as fast as I could.

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,880
Come on.

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,690
I'm returning your girlfriend to you.

68
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,760
Are college boys nowadays

69
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,840
all this weak?

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,880
What happened to Wanzhi?

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
She was waiting for you

72
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
until she was heartbroken

73
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
and tried to drown her sorrows.

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,760
She almost...

75
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,640
Almost what?

76
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Almost got bitten by a dog.

77
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,200
Luckily I found her

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,530
and chased the dog away.

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,360
I've brought her back to you safe and sound.

80
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Thanks for today.

81
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
I'll take her home first.

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,100
I'll properly thank you another day.

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,200
Don't wait for another day.

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,130
There's an opportunity right now.

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,760
What?

86
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,600
You men really say one thing and do another.

87
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,120
You haven't fulfilled

88
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,600
what you promised your girlfriend yet.

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,780
Go to Huasheng.

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
There's still 30 minutes left.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,780
With your ability,

92
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,010
that's enough time.

93
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,040
I'll take her home first.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,420
Mrs. Zhang,

95
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,560
Wanzhi had too much to drink.

96
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,000
Please take care of her.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,440
I have something to attend to.

98
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,000
Alright.

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:33,920
Come, miss,

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,210
take it easy.

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,960
James,

102
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,320
95 points.

103
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,480
Edward.

104
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,680
98 points.

105
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,360
Chris,

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,660
perfect score.

107
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:32,960
Thank you,

108
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,480
everyone.

109
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,880
You're all too mediocre.

110
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,050
We have 28 minutes left.

111
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,220
That's enough.

112
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,360
Doesn't the GPS say we have 40 minutes left?

113
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,680
The 28 minutes I mentioned

114
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,140
includes the time for you to finish the exam.

115
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
Hold on tight.

116
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,520
What I just told you in the car,

117
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
did you remember?

118
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,560
Yes, I remember.

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,520
Good.

120
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,730
Let's go.

121
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,720
Mr. Gu.

122
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,640
Mr. Gu, are you confident about this talent recruitment?

123
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,080
Mr. Gu, who is this person with you?

124
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,480
Is he here for the exam?

125
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,840
Arriving so late after the exam has started?

126
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,760
Have you withdrawn from the board nomination?

127
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,890
Keep your distance.

128
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,280
Keep your distance.

129
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,640
Step back.

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
No interviews allowed here.

131
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,640
Step back.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,460
There are 11 minutes left.

133
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,380
Is that enough?

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,659
That's plenty.

135
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
It's almost over.

136
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,170
Why is someone else coming?

137
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,020
Indeed.

138
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,140
My dear sister.

139
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,530
You're counting on him?

140
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,200
Just look at him.

141
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,860
Look at him.

142
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,330
He's even wearing a children's watch.

143
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,580
Can he even understand the problems?

144
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,240
Our Huasheng

145
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,520
is a top tech company in the country.

146
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,050
This isn't some elementary school math camp.

147
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,760
How dare you!

148
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,400
Bingqing.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Is this the person you've selected?

150
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,480
That's right, Grandfather.

151
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,570
This is my sister

152
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,640
who was specially selected from Jiangbei University.

153
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,570
She just arrived

154
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,300
and was about to take the test.

155
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,120
Is that true?

156
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,440
This is absurd!

157
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,420
Our Huasheng Group's talent selection,

158
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
though flexible,

159
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,880
We don't care about background

160
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,810
but we need to take this seriously.

161
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,400
This year's topic

162
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,800
was personally

163
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,090
requested from Professor Wu Wenyong.

164
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,280
It's designed to help you select

165
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,960
truly reliable talents.

166
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,440
How could you bring someone from an ordinary university

167
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,560
who hasn't even finished their bachelor's degree

168
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,290
just to go through the motions?

169
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,920
What's wrong with being an undergraduate?

170
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,850
Education doesn't equal ability.

171
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Sister.

172
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,560
If you don't want to be a director at Huasheng, just say so.

173
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,080
Why bring in someone so arrogant

174
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,760
who treats Huasheng's selection process like a joke?

175
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,420
Just admit defeat.

176
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,640
Admit defeat?

177
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,090
What defeat?

178
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
It's not over yet.

179
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,140
Still being stubborn?

180
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,360
Only 8 minutes left.

181
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,010
Not even you.

182
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,370
Even Einstein couldn't finish this test.

183
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,540
Eight minutes.

184
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,540
That's enough.

185
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,080
So fast?

186
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,980
Just right.

187
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,040
How is it so quick?

188
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Yes, very fast.

189
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,010
Scan it quickly.

190
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,810
No mistakes.

191
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,860
Go make the announcement.

192
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,250
Lin Dongfeng

193
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,380
Perfect score.

194
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,720
What?

195
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,520
Perfect score?

196
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,380
Perfect score.

197
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,440
Who is this?

198
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,560
There must be a mistake.

199
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,290
Impossible.

200
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,800
The machine must be broken.

201
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,320
How is it possible

202
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,520
that someone answered everything in such a short time

203
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,850
and got a perfect score?

204
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,610
Yeah, how is that possible?

205
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,080
This kid wrote a ton of detailed answers.

206
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,140
The machine must have made a mistake.

207
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,480
I demand a manual review.

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,920
Fine.

209
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,480
You just said this exam paper

210
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,210
was created by Professor Wu from Qingbei.

211
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,570
That's correct.

212
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,340
This exam paper...

213
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Old Wu really pulled one over on you.

214
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,380
Utterly arrogant.

215
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,720
Let me check the test paper.

216
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,250
Let me check the test paper.

217
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,880
I've already helped you.

218
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,240
Remember our agreement.

219
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,970
Don't worry.

220
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,280
I always keep my word.

221
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Stop right there.

222
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,410
You were boasting so much earlier.

223
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,740
Now I see the expert frowning.

224
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,080
You're not trying to get exposed, are you?

225
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,610
Trying to sneak away early?

226
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,130
You're the one who asked me to stay.

227
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,850
Chairman Gu.

228
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
The machine is correct.

229
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,240
It's indeed a perfect score.

230
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,680
Mr. Gu.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
I got a perfect score today too.

232
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,260
We didn't lose.

233
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,740
So what if you got a perfect score?

234
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,680
In today's selection,

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,640
you're not the only one with a perfect score.

236
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,240
I wasn't finished speaking.

237
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,580
This test paper

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
not only has a perfect score,

239
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,000
but also includes three different solutions.

240
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,890
To accomplish this in such a short time

241
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
is truly remarkable.

242
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,480
It's nothing, it's nothing.

243
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,210
Less than ten minutes in total.

244
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,060
Perfect score.

245
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,480
Three different solutions.

246
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,490
Grandpa,

247
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,170
do you believe this?

248
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,440
Gu Bingqing must have done something beforehand

249
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
to help this kid with the questions.

250
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,680
Chairman Gu,

251
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,480
that's absolutely impossible.

252
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,180
The final solution method

253
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,400
isn't just missing from the answer key,

254
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,780
I've never seen it before.

255
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,240
It's unconventional,

256
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,370
with logical leaps,

257
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,400
yet the reasoning flows perfectly.

258
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,640
Incisive and profound.

259
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,240
It's truly

260
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
when the path seems blocked by mountains and rivers,

261
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,440
a village appears beyond the willows and flowers.

262
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:02,970
Alright.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,460
Since the experts' comments and conclusions are consistent,

264
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,120
let's accept the result.

265
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,380
Since the results are out,

266
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,540
I'll take my leave now.

267
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,560
Please wait.

268
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,140
Thanks to Bingqing

269
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,210
for her keen eye for talent.

270
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,600
I almost missed out on a brilliant young man.

271
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,000
I heard

272
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,220
you're about to graduate.

273
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,840
Are you interested

274
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,610
in working at Huasheng?

275
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,200
Special research assistant.

276
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,840
You'll work directly

277
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,400
with the academician team.

278
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,240
Annual salary

279
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,760
of 18 million.

280
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,640
Plus stock dividends.

281
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,320
What do you think?
