1
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,840
Sir.

2
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,480
I'm just from an ordinary university

3
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,480
and haven't even graduated yet.

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,120
I'm afraid

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,080
I'm not worthy to join a big company like Huasheng.

6
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,320
Young man.

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,480
Sharp-tongued.

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,700
I like that.

9
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,640
At Huasheng,

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,240
any position

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,800
goes to those with ability.

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,640
A talented young genius like you

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
joining Huasheng

14
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:15,900
will certainly

15
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,740
thrive like a fish in water

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,539
and achieve great things.

17
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,440
Quit while you're ahead.

18
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,440
Even PhDs with overseas experience

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,370
can't reach that level in 10 years.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,620
Think the money's not enough?

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,600
30 million.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,220
How about that?

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,560
30 million?

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,039
As for equity,

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,860
we can discuss that later.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,850
Grandpa.

27
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,320
Don't be fooled by Gu Bingqing and the others.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,850
Silence!

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,240
Young man,

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,640
what do you think?

31
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,090
Before the experiment officially succeeds,

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,440
you cannot disclose today's matters

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,400
to anyone.

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,100
To hide your identity,

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,440
you cannot join any commercial organization.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,100
I hope you understand.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm sorry,

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,960
but I'm not interested in this job.

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,700
This guy must be crazy.

40
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,000
That's a multi-million salary.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,120
So many people dream of it.

42
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,320
And he just gave it up.

43
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,079
Money isn't everything.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,600
Stop talking.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,840
I know it's 30 million plus equity.

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,720
Enough to last a lifetime.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,520
I have no choice.

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,210
Everyone has their own ambitions.

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,640
We shouldn't use worldly values

50
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,040
to measure genius.

51
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,020
That would be shallow.

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,420
Since Bingqing invited you here,

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
I assume

54
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,600
you two are friends.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,480
In the future,

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,040
please stay in touch.

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Huasheng's doors

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,920
are always open to you.

59
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
She and I

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,890
aren't really friends.

61
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,640
At most,

62
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,930
it's a transaction.

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,440
That's fine.

64
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,280
Today,

65
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,100
we have two perfect scores simultaneously.

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,200
This is

67
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,240
a blessing for our selection committee.

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,960
And also

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,200
a fortune for Huasheng.

70
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,400
Our young generation at Huasheng

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
can all achieve this.

72
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
Knowing how to use people

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,360
is truly rare.

74
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,480
Now I announce

75
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,370
that Gu Bingqing

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,490
and Gu Shaocheng

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,680
will today

78
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,720
both join the board of directors.

79
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,210
Thank you for today.

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
Don't just say thanks.

81
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
On your way here,

82
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,280
didn't you promise me

83
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,680
that you'd help me win over Wanzhi's mother?

84
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,600
To make her mother see you differently,

85
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,130
money is the best solution.

86
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,600
Why did you just refuse?

87
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:13,960
It's a

88
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,570
secret I can't tell.

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,519
Fine.

90
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Although you couldn't join Huasheng,

91
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
I won't let your help go unrewarded.

92
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,400
Take this.

93
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,380
You deserve it.

94
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
How much money is in here?

95
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
It depends on you.

96
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,770
This is my supplementary card.

97
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,520
How much credit limit I give you

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,280
depends on how much you help me.

99
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,850
So something like today

100
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
is worth how much?

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,730
Perhaps you don't realize,

102
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,960
but today for me

103
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,159
is very significant.

104
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,240
So today,

105
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,440
it's up to you.

106
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,720
Today for me

107
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,480
is equally significant.

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,920
So today,

109
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,860
I'll work for free.

110
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
To commemorate this memorable day.

111
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,160
Then let's find a place

112
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
to have a few drinks

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,860
and celebrate.

114
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,820
No, thanks.

115
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,820
This day has been too long.

116
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,640
If I don't go back now,

117
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,180
the dormitory will close.

118
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,290
Alright.

119
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,560
I'll take you back.

120
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,090
Let's go!

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,920
Go in!

122
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,000
Jungle!

123
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,480
Mid tower!

124
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,080
Coming!

125
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,680
Mid tower!

126
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,760
Not you.

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm not a miracle worker.

128
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Hurry, over here!

129
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,220
Coming!

130
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,000
Someone's coming!

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm going!

132
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,400
Coming!

133
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:21,840
What's

134
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,370
going on?

135
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,760
Really!

136
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,120
Let me do it.

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,860
I can't stand this.

138
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,620
What's that noise?

139
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,420
Have you been working like a mule all day?

140
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,960
That dress is really pretty.

141
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,640
I think it suits you well too.

142
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,420
Wanzhi.

143
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,320
Wanzhi.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,480
Wanzhi.

145
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,290
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

146
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,840
No.

147
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,720
Wanzhi, I had a special situation yesterday.

148
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,250
I really couldn't get away.

149
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,180
You're not even wearing the watch I gave you.

150
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,280
Wanzhi.

151
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
I truly couldn't leave.

152
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,280
Listen to me.

153
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,120
That student.

154
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,000
Sit down quickly.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,060
Class is starting.

156
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,040
Everyone turn to page 28.

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,600
Wanzhi,

158
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,080
I know I was wrong.

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,620
I shouldn't have stood you up yesterday.

160
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,280
There really was a special circumstance.

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,560
I can't tell you about it,

162
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,040
but I truly didn't mean to.

163
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,280
Stop bothering me. I hate you.

164
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,930
Just this question.

165
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,200
You've been asking me about this question for a long time.

166
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,730
Let's go.

167
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,280
Nice weather today.

168
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,040
Yes, yes, what should we have for lunch?

169
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,690
Let's go.

170
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,260
Stop following me.

171
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,220
Go back and reflect on your behavior.

172
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,320
Blockhead.

173
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,130
I told you not to follow and you really didn't.

174
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,159
She's really angry, Feng.

175
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,760
It's fine.

176
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,960
Let's go.

177
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,000
We meet again.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,800
Lin Tiancai.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,640
Are you free?

180
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,720
Help me with something.

181
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,040
Please give me a break.

182
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Because of what happened yesterday,

183
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,220
Wanzhi is still angry.

184
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,360
Another time.

185
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Last night's promise still stands.

186
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,360
Help me with this favor,

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,720
and the payment won't be small.

188
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
Damn.

189
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,600
Take this money and buy her some gifts.

190
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,560
Make her happy.

191
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Young girls love this kind of thing.

192
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,440
Really?

193
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,060
I know what I'm talking about. Get in the car.

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
I'll trust you this time.

195
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,880
Take my backpack home for me.

196
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,480
Feng.

197
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Don't forget me when you make it big.

198
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,560
Lin Dongfeng,

199
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,760
I'm not done with you.

200
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,600
Let's go.

201
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,720
There's a problem with the data from the company's chip research team.

202
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,050
Can you take a look at it?

203
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,320
Um,

204
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,720
do you have paper and pen?

205
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,120
Sure.

206
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,610
Here's the data you wanted.

207
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,200
Is this data

208
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,360
reliable?

209
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,400
What?

210
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,820
Don't you trust me?

211
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,120
Are you really human?

212
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,170
You're twice as fast as a computer.

213
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,280
I'm busy. I've already helped you.

214
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,370
Remember to call me.

215
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,860
Aren't you going to verify it?

216
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,610
You can stay here and verify it.

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
I still need to buy a gift for Wanzhi.

218
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,600
Let's go.

219
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,680
Wait.

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,680
What is it now?

221
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,980
Look at you being such a clueless guy.

222
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,640
Do you even know how to pick gifts for girls?

223
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,280
Come on.

224
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
I'll help you.

225
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,680
Smarty pants.

226
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,540
Pay attention.

227
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,760
Those stores we just passed sell handbags.

228
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,200
If you want to give something to Zheng Wanzhi,

229
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,130
this store has more lively styles.

230
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,760
But if you were buying for a mature lady like me,

231
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,100
this store's style would suit me better.

232
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,760
Giving skincare products requires more thought.

233
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,360
You need to consider her age,

234
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,480
whether she needs hydration or anti-aging products,

235
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,600
and whether she has dry, oily, or sensitive skin.

236
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,740
Are you listening?

237
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,480
What's dry skin and oily skin?

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,920
Then it's time for the secret weapon.

239
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,520
No girl can resist finely crafted jewelry.

240
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:27,940
This one...

241
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,890
Let me see it.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,600
Okay.

243
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,360
Come closer.

244
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,040
Why are you standing so far away?

245
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,570
I'm helping you pick a gift.

246
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Does it look nice?

247
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,410
Pretty good.

248
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,730
This one.

249
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,250
Help me put it on.

250
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Does it look good?

251
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,680
Not bad.

252
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,210
Please wrap up this set.

253
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Aren't these things too expensive?

254
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,900
When giving gifts to girls, you must be willing to spend money.

255
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,320
That's how they know you care about them.

256
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,720
I'll head back to my dorm then.

257
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Thanks for today.

258
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,800
You're just dismissing me with a simple thank you.

259
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,640
Aren't you going to invite me for a tour?

260
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,320
There's nothing special to see in the dorm.

261
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,920
Besides,

262
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
girls aren't allowed in the boys' dorm.

263
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,040
You know what,

264
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,560
I'm actually quite curious.

265
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,760
What are college dorms like these days?

266
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:21,920
No.

267
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,200
Good thing the dorm supervisor isn't here.

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,930
Which floor?

269
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,050
Third floor.

270
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,120
Why are you whispering?

271
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,180
We're not thieves.

272
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:54,760
Not you.

273
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,560
How did you get in?

274
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,690
[Power: 6:00 AM - Lights out: 11:30 PM]

275
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,960
Nice body.

276
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,580
Are all the guys at your school like this?

277
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,240
Miss, let's go.

278
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,360
Control yourself.

279
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,980
Are you going to wipe it or not?

280
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,560
What's the point of just holding tissues?

281
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,960
It's soaking wet inside.

282
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,440
Do you have any clean clothes?

283
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,370
I need to change.

284
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,720
Wear mine.

285
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,010
You want me to go back all wet like this?

286
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,920
Oh.

287
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,760
I forgive you.

288
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,250
I'm giving you a way out.

289
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,160
The dorm supervisor isn't here.

290
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,420
Since the supervisor isn't here,

291
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,850
I'll go upstairs and surprise him.

292
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,290
Turn around.

293
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,850
Call me when you're done changing.

294
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Don't look. Don't look.

295
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm done changing.

296
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,010
You can turn around now.

297
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,400
Dongfeng.

298
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,720
It's me.

299
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,200
Let's talk.
