1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,560
Wanzhi.

2
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,560
The property of the Zheng family

3
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,480
I don't want it.

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,480
That's right.

5
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,040
We are good friends.

6
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,970
But according to our previous bet,

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,880
you lost.

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,440
Lin Dongfeng, you're the one who lost. You're the one who lost.

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,770
It’s yours. It’s yours.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,039
East Wind.

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,280
Where did you get so much money?

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,280
I've been working on projects

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,080
for some technology companies.

14
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,240
I didn't expect these companies to be so generous.

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,720
What bet?

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,770
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,960
East Wind.

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
Sorry.

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,660
Sister Gu and I like you very much.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,400
So we made a bet before.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,520
Who can make more money in a month?

22
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,920
Those who earn less

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,380
quit the competition.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,320
Obviously,

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,160
Gu, you win.

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,080
Lin Dong Feng.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
I give it to you.

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,980
As long as you can return the Zheng family's property to us,

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,700
On behalf of my mother,

30
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
and my late father.

31
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,240
Thank you forever.

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,240
Okay.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,400
Deal.

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,040
Wanzhi,

35
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,520
What you said just now

36
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
really mean it?

37
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,160
We can't go back anymore.

38
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,970
I wish you and Sister Gu happiness.

39
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
Wish you happiness too.

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,000
Bingqing.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,480
Let’s go.

42
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,960
East Wind.

43
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,320
We are finally together.

44
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,120
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,600
This is the latest watch.

46
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,280
It's 10,000 yuan, right?

47
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,120
I know you always want it.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Since you did well today, I’ll reward you.

49
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,900
I love you so much, Wanwan.

50
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,400
It's done. Let's continue.

51
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,320
I won't lose!

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,480
What?

53
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,120
Let me dance.

54
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,860
I'm an intellectual broadcaster, okay?

55
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,200
This is the second stage of experiment.

56
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,000
that needs to be reviewed again.

57
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,260
You didn't sleep well last night?

58
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,880
You look pale.

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,960
I didn't get any rest. I'm fine. I'm fine.

60
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,560
It's okay.

61
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,920
Let's go.

62
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,500
Come on.

63
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,280
You broke up again?

64
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you talking about?

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
No way.

66
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,380
I'm not in the mood to date now.

67
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
We have

68
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
a national mission.

69
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,890
How can I be distracted?

70
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,720
I just

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,800
I didn't sleep well last night

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,010
Roommate keeps snoring It's too noisy

73
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,360
In that case

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,920
let's take a day off.

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,400
I'll show you around.

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,320
Let's hurry up and calculate the data.

77
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
Wu is waiting for me.

78
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,240
No.

79
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,360
As your research assistant,

80
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,490
I want to ensure your work efficiency.

81
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,120
With your current state,

82
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,120
I can't guarantee the accuracy of these data.

83
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,100
You need to change your brain.

84
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,200
Okay.

85
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,960
Where are we going?

86
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Are you okay?

87
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,080
Let me take a photo for you.

88
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,210
It looks delicious.

89
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,000
Look inside

90
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,000
Come on.

91
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,850
Come here

92
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,360
Here.

93
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,400
I quit.

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm so tired.

95
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,760
Look at you.

96
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,800
You should exercise more.

97
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,200
I can't even play.

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,240
It's so boring.

99
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,760
Oh no.

100
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
I was just playing.

101
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,570
I forgot about my business.

102
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Hey, Editor Yang.

103
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
Yes.

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,480
Okay, we'll be right back.

105
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,720
Right away.

106
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,120
What?

107
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,090
How many people are waiting for your key data?

108
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,440
but you went to the amusement park all day.

109
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
That's ridiculous.

110
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,240
And you.

111
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,360
I asked you to be Lin Dong Feng's assistant,

112
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,919
not to play with him.

113
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,280
Write 3,000 words of self-criticism for me.

114
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
and send it to my office tomorrow.

115
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,160
No, sir.

116
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,690
I'm not feeling well today.

117
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,240
Let Mr. Yang take a walk with me.

118
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,300
and change my mind.

119
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,300
I'm just afraid that my condition

120
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,560
and affect the experimental data.

121
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,160
Shut up!

122
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,370
Who told you to be a hero?

123
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,640
I took him out.

124
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,530
It has nothing to do with Lin Dong Feng.

125
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,720
We have to go back to school.

126
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,920
We still have a lot of data to calculate.

127
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,610
Stop!

128
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,880
What else?

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,600
Mr. Yang.

130
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,200
Go back

131
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,680
go back to see your mom.

132
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,800
You haven't been home for weeks.

133
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
Your mom missed you.

134
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,200
Yes, Editor Yang.

135
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Don't call me that.

136
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,940
There's no outsider here.

137
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,120
You know,

138
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,600
I don't like

139
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,320
call me that.

140
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
Okay.

141
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,640
He's your dad. He's your dad. He's your dad. He's your dad. He's your dad.

142
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,440
He's your dad.

143
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
He's a father

144
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,760
who has never been to an amusement park with his daughter.

145
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
He has never

146
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,900
who has never celebrated a birthday with his daughter.

147
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,000
He has never fulfilled

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
as a father.

149
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
So what if I go to the amusement park?

150
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
I only know Lin Dongfeng for two months.

151
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,200
can go with me.

152
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,960
And you

153
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,880
You've been my father for 22 years,

154
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,520
but you never kept your promise.

155
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,880
I had fun at the amusement park.

156
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,170
Because since I grew up,

157
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,690
This is the first time I've ever had someone go to an amusement park with me.

158
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,180
I'll give you the self-criticism tomorrow.

159
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,640
Let's go.

160
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,340
So Editor Yang is your father.

161
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,480
No wonder you know the research center so well.

162
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
They all envy me.

163
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,880
I had a father who was a high-ranking official.

164
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,080
But only I know

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,320
he is not a good father.

166
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,800
Since I can remember,

167
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,080
I only see him a few times a year.

168
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,640
and get sick once.

169
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,340
once during Chinese New Year.

170
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,480
When he quarreled with my mom,

171
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,840
it was once.

172
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
He's always arbitrary.

173
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,280
I like physics,

174
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,410
but he insisted that I study medicine.

175
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
He said it was for my own good.

176
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
He never thought about my feelings.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,560
Every time

178
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,520
I want to communicate with him,

179
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,480
he seems to be busy.

180
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,080
I know.

181
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,040
I know he's busy.

182
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
But how could he be so busy

183
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,460
He doesn't even remember his daughter's birthday.

184
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,160
You can't say that.

185
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,160
I think Editor Yang loves you.

186
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
But his identity

187
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,480
is not

188
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,360
you didn't really know everything.

189
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,920
As the saying goes,

190
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
he lost his family because of everyone.

191
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,880
I think he must have his reasons.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,930
Actually, over the past few years,

193
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,520
I don't hate him anymore.

194
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,000
I just feel wronged.

195
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,720
Sometimes, I'd rather he's just an ordinary person.

196
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,900
In this way,

197
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,360
he might be a good father.

198
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,760
Thank you.

199
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
for listening to me today.

200
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,760
It's nothing.

201
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,560
You were the one who comforted me last time.

202
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,680
We're even now.

203
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,460
And you're my only scientific research assistant.

204
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,280
What if your condition

205
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,960
and affect my work?

206
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,980
I forgot if you didn't tell me.

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,530
Let's go.

208
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Where are we going?

209
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,240
To the canteen again.

210
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Go back to the lab.

211
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,280
I urge you

212
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,720
to calculate the data of the second stage as soon as possible.

213
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,980
Mr Wu is still waiting.

214
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,520
No.

215
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm tired today.

216
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,540
Shall we take a day off?

217
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,280
I can't.

218
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,080
Let's go.
