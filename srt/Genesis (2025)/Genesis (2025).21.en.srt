1
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,200
Is everything settled?

2
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,260
All went smoothly.

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,290
With this evidence,

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,040
I don't believe Mr. Yang will still refuse to release the person.

5
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,220
Where is everyone?

6
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,520
Can't find anyone at this critical moment.

7
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,280
Forget it.

8
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,539
Let's go directly to the detention room.

9
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,760
Thank you to all the leaders,

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
distinguished guests,

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,700
and industry colleagues for your presence.

12
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,360
Here we will

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,880
witness together

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,240
a miracle of world science.

15
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,460
Additionally,

16
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,120
I need to explain something to all of you.

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,480
For the most perfect presentation effect.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,840
The area around the venue

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,479
has had all communication signals

20
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,240
blocked.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,759
Please understand.

22
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,009
Tonight we'll witness the debut of controlled nuclear fusion.

23
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,640
That's a monumental event!

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,860
Never mind blocking signals.

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,539
They could throw away my phone for all I care.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,530
Jingshu.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,720
This isn't a place for outsiders.

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,560
Captain Cao,

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,290
these evidences

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,640
are sufficient to prove that Lin Dongfeng didn't leak any information.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,840
We're here to take him with us.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,360
No matter what you've brought today,

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,160
without Director Yang's orders,

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,820
I won't release Lin Dongfeng.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,400
I went to his office.

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,329
He wasn't there.

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,160
And his phone is unreachable.

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,680
Can we make an exception?

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,810
I'll explain everything to him later.

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,360
I'll wait until you've cleared things up with Director Yang,

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,620
then I'll release him.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,160
Cao Dahua, don't push us.

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Stop wasting time with him.

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,130
Let's see the person first.

46
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,480
Wait.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Mr. Wu,

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,680
you're awake.

49
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:58,720
Xiao Cao.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,580
These three young people don't know better.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,320
I

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
apologize on their behalf.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,840
Please don't.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
Nothing really happened.

55
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,440
I didn't take it personally.

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,320
All right then.

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
Since I'm here

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,090
this door should be opened.

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,170
If anything happens

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,090
I'll take responsibility.

61
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,079
Mr. Wu

62
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,520
please don't make things difficult for me.

63
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,720
I have strict orders.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
Without Director Yang's instructions

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,540
I absolutely cannot release him.

66
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,320
I can't do it either.

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
You can't either.

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,920
Fine.

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,360
I, Wu Wenyong,

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,440
am risking my old bones today

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,120
to make you release

72
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
my master Lin Dongfeng.

73
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,140
Press conference.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,480
Everything is ready.

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,440
In 30 minutes,

76
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,580
we will officially begin.

77
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,770
At that time,

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,320
you will not only witness

79
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,120
the unveiling of the ultimate energy source.

80
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,760
I will also solve

81
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,490
a mystery that's been on everyone's mind.

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
I'll introduce you to

83
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,360
Huasheng Group's

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,079
contracted scientist.

85
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,399
Who single-handedly developed

86
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,200
controlled nuclear fusion technology,

87
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,000
a brilliant young man who will change the world.

88
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,600
The one who completed controlled nuclear fusion

89
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,930
is actually a young man?

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,520
Mr. Wu.

91
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,770
No matter what you do today,

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,940
without Director Yang's orders,

93
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,760
I won't let you leave.

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,880
Xiao Cao,

95
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,480
remember what you just said.

96
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Professor Wu.

97
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,640
I can't reach my father by phone.

98
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,440
Besides your father,

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,240
I

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,120
still have other friends.

101
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,960
Old friend.

102
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,930
Sorry to bother you.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,760
I can't find Yang Zhengdao,

104
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
so I had to come to you.

105
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,100
I have a small favor to ask.

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,400
Please help me out.

107
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,080
I'll call Xiao Cao.

108
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,940
Take this call.

109
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,320
Here.

110
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,760
Listen.

111
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Sir.

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,540
Sir, please give your instructions.

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,660
I'll follow the commander's orders.

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,880
Mr. Wu,

115
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,380
the commander wants you on the phone.

116
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,760
Thank you.

117
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,260
I'll come by

118
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,250
to thank you properly another day.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,800
So today,

120
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,650
would it be possible

121
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,650
for me to take Lin Dongfeng with me?

122
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,740
Coming.

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,720
Dongfeng.

124
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,360
Mr. Wu.

125
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
That's wonderful!

126
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,240
You're awake.

127
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,650
How are you feeling?

128
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,920
I won't be dying anytime soon.

129
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,570
The plan worked.

130
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,090
Don't worry about these trivial matters now.

131
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,400
Right now,

132
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,159
there's something more important that needs your attention.

133
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,560
That old fox Gu Yongbang,

134
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,130
he's an old fox even when you cough.

135
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,080
He's teamed up with Smith

136
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,120
to

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,120
livestream at Huasheng Group

138
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,770
the final controlled nuclear fusion device.

139
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,640
By my calculation,

140
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
the livestream will begin in about 20 minutes.

141
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,240
I don't believe

142
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,020
they can bypass your algorithm to conduct the experiment.

143
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,410
Get over there quickly.

144
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,650
Before the livestream begins,

145
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,680
perhaps

146
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,180
there's still room for negotiation.

147
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,600
Don't let this turn into a disaster.

148
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,800
If the device is unstable,

149
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,320
the consequences would be unimaginable.

150
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,250
What do you mean?

151
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,680
What would be the consequences?

152
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,280
If the device is unstable...

153
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,720
Atoms in the nuclear reactor collide rapidly

154
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,480
generating thermonuclear reactions.

155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Once it exceeds the critical threshold,

156
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,740
what we have here won't be a nuclear fusion reactor anymore

157
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,159
but instead

158
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,890
a hydrogen bomb.

159
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,560
Indeed.

160
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,360
19 minutes

161
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,440
is enough.

162
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,280
The press conference is about to begin.

163
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,200
And now,

164
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,680
please welcome tonight's main guest.

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,520
To open for us

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,600
a new chapter in human history.

167
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,960
Tonight's protagonist

168
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,920
is the genius young man from Huasheng Group,

169
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,520
Chu Tiankuo.

170
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,400
All are created by geniuses.

171
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,160
We're delighted to collaborate with Chu Tiankuo.

172
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,600
Leading humanity into the era of ultimate energy.

173
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,000
A fraud

174
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,920
and an imposter.

175
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,440
And you dare talk about

176
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,500
leading the times?

177
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
Dream on.

178
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Lin Dongfeng.

179
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,880
Shouldn't you be in custody?

180
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
How did you know

181
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,280
about such confidential matters?

182
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,800
I...

183
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,380
No... someone told me.

184
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,840
I bet it was all of you

185
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,240
who framed me.

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,280
Who would bother?

187
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
I never would have thought

188
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,410
it was you all along.

189
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,120
You're the one

190
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,140
who's been dealing with them.

191
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
The data from my laptop

192
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,460
you leaked it to them too, didn't you?

193
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,120
