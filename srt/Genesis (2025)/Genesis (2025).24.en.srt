1
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,200
Come on! Let's go!

2
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,600
Hold on, Wu.

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,560
It's okay.

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,800
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

5
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Dean Sun.

6
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,880
Mr Wu is a national treasure scientist.

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
You must save him at all costs.

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,800
Mr. Yang.

9
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,760
Don't worry.

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,800
I know Mr. Wu's dosage.

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,620
All departments are waiting inside.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,280
I will host this operation myself.

13
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
I will try my best

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,530
to get Mr. Wu back from hell.

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,039
Dean Sun.

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Please.

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,360
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,080
It's all my fault.

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,840
I was wrong.

20
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,800
I'm the one who should go in.

21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,160
It's me. It's me.

22
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,960
What are you doing?

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,320
Calm down.

24
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,280
This is a hospital.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,840
Get out of here if you keep making a scene.

26
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,200
Does Professor Oh

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
want to see you like this?

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,920
Pull yourself together.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,560
Professor Oh is in trouble.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
We don't want anyone to see it.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
But you're the one who should calm down.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
The experiment just succeeded.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,200
What you should do next

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,920
is to lead us on.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,800
instead of being a coward.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,440
All you do is cry.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,000
Look.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,280
We're all watching you.

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,079
You are our backbone.

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,840
You are our navigator.

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,440
At a time like this,

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,320
if you fail,

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,720
will you let us down?

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,660
Do you feel sorry for our country?

45
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,920
Everyone,

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,170
I understand your concern.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,200
But the operation

48
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,680
I think it will take some time.

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
Got it.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,360
I will

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
as soon as possible.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,120
You should

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,120
Go back and have a rest.

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,480
Let Mr. Lim

55
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,480
take a break.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,440
Editor Yang.

57
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,560
There's news.

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,600
Tell us.

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,680
Don't worry.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,360
Mr. Wu is lucky.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,680
He'll be fine.

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,440
I'm the one who should go in.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,200
If you think so,

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,900
you'll let Mr. Wu down.

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,840
The reason why our scientific research

66
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
for hundreds of years

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
That's because a generation of scientists

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,840
are not afraid of hardships.

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
and the spirit of sacrifice.

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,160
Mr Wu.

71
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,640
not for you.

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,960
but to

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,040
to make the technology spirit pass on.

74
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,120
Let you

75
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,240
lead us to a further future.

76
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,840
Jung-joo.

77
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,930
Take Mr. Lim to bed. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

78
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,240
This is Yang Jeong Do.

79
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Report the results to the national patent center.

80
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,680
to save

81
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
of our successful experiment in foreign institutions.

82
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
From now on,

83
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,000
monitor the movements of foreign institutions.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,860
Report to me if anything happens.

85
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,720
Dr. Sun.

86
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,840
How's Professor Oh?

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,340
The surgery went well.

88
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,560
Professor Oh.

89
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,240
He's out of danger now.

90
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,560
but he's still in a coma.

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,840
That's great.

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,960
Can we meet?

93
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
The patient needs to rest.

94
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,820
We'll arrange ICU right away.

95
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,480
to let Mr. Wu stay in Gagan ward.

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,560
I've asked the chief.

97
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,200
I'll arrange it right away.

98
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,060
Dean Sun and I will go through the procedure.

99
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,240
Go back and rest.

100
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,240
Mr Wu.

101
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,200
when Mr. Wu gets better.

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,159
Come and see him.

103
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,520
Dean Sun.

104
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
There's no one now.

105
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,920
Finally,

106
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
tell you my truth.

107
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,280
Actually,

108
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,680
when you and Lin Dong Feng

109
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,570
checked the data, I knew

110
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,880
you didn't make a mistake.

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
It was him.

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,680
You're thinking about your master-disciple relationship.

113
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,560
and wanted to be passed down.

114
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,880
but he shouldered all this alone.

115
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,200
Thank goodness.

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,280
We did it.

117
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,840
But I regret it.

118
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,680
If I didn't

119
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,970
I didn't agree to your request,

120
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,280
You won't be like this now.

121
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Mr Wu.

122
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,620
Can you open your eyes?

123
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
look at me?

124
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm...

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
Yang Jeong Do.

126
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,240
Wake up.

127
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,640
I beg you.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Please.

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
Mr. Yang.

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,600
Let Mr. Oh rest.

131
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,480
Please

132
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,040
take good care of Mr. Wu.

133
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,080
Don't worry.

134
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,320
We will take care of Mr. Wu

135
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,480
in the best medical level.

136
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,720
Thank you.

137
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,520
I officially announce to the world

138
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,920
we have made breakthrough in the controllable nuclear mutation area.

139
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,080
The nuclear fusion energy control problem has been completely broken.

140
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,409
We will lead all mankind

141
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,130
to use the ultimate energy.

142
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,760
[Chief, I'm Yang Jeong-do.]

143
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,480
I'm Yang Zhengdao. I'm Yang Zhengdao. I'm Yang Zhengdao.
