1
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,280
Mr. Lin.

2
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,120
Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin.

3
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,440
Are you sure you don't want to stay a bit longer?

4
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,280
I can introduce you to our bank's investment products

5
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,360
and our premium card services.

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,200
I can offer you unlimited credit.

7
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,160
Next time.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,020
Next time then.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,000
Farewell to our premium VIP member, Mr. Lin.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,320
Welcome back anytime.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,450
Feel free to drop by whenever you want.

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,120
I never expected these tech companies to be so generous.

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,720
I need to tell Wanzhi this good news right away.

14
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,760
Wanzhi,

15
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,640
I need to tell you something.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,920
Dongfeng, where are you?

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
Wanzhi,

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,080
what's wrong? Did something happen over there?

19
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,960
Dongfeng,

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,240
Gu Shaocheng just brought a group of people here.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,840
They smashed everything in the house.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,240
Dongfeng, where are you?

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,160
I'm so scared.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,680
Wanzhi,

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,720
don't be afraid.

26
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,980
I'm coming right away.

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,240
I'll be there soon.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,120
Smash this dead person's

29
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,200
photo now!

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,760
This cannot be smashed.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Gu Shaocheng!

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,250
Our families have been friends for generations.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,330
Wanzi's father was very good to you back then.

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,560
You can't do this.

35
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,200
You can't be so ruthless.

36
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,970
How are my daughter and I supposed to survive?

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,120
Stop!

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,120
What a heroic rescue.

39
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,920
Lin Dongfeng.

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,700
I was afraid you'd be too cowardly to show up.

41
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,840
Gu Shaocheng.

42
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,440
Breaking and entering.

43
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
Damaging others' property.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Do you know how many years you'll spend in prison?

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,140
You're absolutely right.

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,200
Then what are you doing in my house?

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,880
Get out!

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,650
What do you mean?

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,280
Due to the Zheng family's inability to pay their debts,

50
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,760
the Zheng family villa

51
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,800
and all property within

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,000
are hereby mortgaged to the director of Huasheng Group,

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
Gu Shaocheng.

54
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,200
This agreement is protected by law

55
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,720
and effective

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,880
immediately.

57
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
I am now the owner of this house.

58
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,360
You're the one trespassing and legally responsible now,

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,760
Lin Dongfeng.

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,620
Is what he's saying true, Wanzhi?

61
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,600
Yes.

62
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,800
Don't worry.

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,840
As long as I'm here,

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,700
no one can harm you or your family.

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,160
Take a look.

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,520
A debt must be paid,

67
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,640
that's only fair.

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
Now I have all the Zheng family's bills in my hands.

69
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,079
I can deal with them however I want.

70
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,960
Even if you know some powerful people,

71
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,760
they can't interfere with personal debts.

72
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
What I'm doing is perfectly legal.

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,560
Director Yang once said

74
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,820
that power must be used within the rules.

75
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,880
It seems today we need to try a different approach.

76
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,040
Ma'am.

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,890
I repeatedly came to propose marriage

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,490
because I wanted Wanzhi's sister to marry into the Gu family as my wife.

79
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,380
But you rejected my goodwill.

80
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,560
However, I'm not

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,840
a heartless person.

82
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,560
If Wanzhi's sister

83
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,440
is willing to serve me properly,

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
then I can still allow you mother and daughter

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
to live in this villa.

86
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,800
Gu Shaocheng,

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,800
our Zheng family is still a respectable household.

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,860
We won't tolerate such humiliation.

89
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,800
If you want to touch my daughter,

90
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
you'll have to kill me first.

91
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,160
Mom!

92
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,760
Gu Shaocheng, what kind of man are you?

93
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
If you've got the guts, come at me instead.

94
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Lin Dongfeng, why are you still pretending?

95
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,600
I've already investigated your background thoroughly.

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,680
You just happen to know Director Yang's daughter, don't you?

97
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,760
Let me tell you something.

98
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,080
Last time you got lucky.

99
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,880
Don't mistake luck for ability.

100
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,600
Today, even God himself couldn't help you.

101
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,520
You're just a kept man.

102
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,840
Without your powerful connections,

103
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
you're nothing.

104
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,560
Today, I need no one else.

105
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
I can handle this myself.

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,490
How much does the Zheng family owe you?

107
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Let go!

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,800
Aren't you good at calculating?

109
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Why don't you calculate how much the Zheng family owes me?

110
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,040
The Zheng family owes you 83 million.

111
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
83 million.

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,930
You've never seen that much money in your life, have you?

113
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,330
Here's the deal.

114
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll give you a chance to help the Zheng family.

115
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,280
You.

116
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
Kneel down and kowtow to me.

117
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,640
Each kowtow is worth 10,000.

118
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,220
If you try hard enough,

119
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,680
kowtowing until your head bleeds,

120
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,080
you might be able to pay back

121
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,000
2 or 3 million.

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,640
How about that?

123
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
I'm being quite generous, aren't I?

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
This 83 million...

125
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,600
I'll pay it back.

126
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,940
Then start kowtowing.

127
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,600
I really want to see with my own eyes these 83 million

128
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,480
and how long you can keep begging.

129
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,200
Drop that cliché rich playboy act.

130
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,800
Since I said I'll pay it back,

131
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,080
I'll naturally do it properly with cash.

132
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,400
Lin Dongfeng,

133
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,040
how are you going to pay back all this money?

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,330
It's none of your business.

135
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,480
Get out.

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,200
I said get out!

137
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,290
You finally manage to make a big claim,

138
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,250
but they don't even appreciate it.

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
How pitiful.

140
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,400
When I, Lin Dongfeng, speak,

141
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
my word is my bond,

142
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,500
and I always keep my promises.

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,300
Still pretending?

144
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,280
Shameless.

145
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,840
I have to say,

146
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,480
aren't you usually quite smart?

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,200
Why are you making up such ridiculous lies today?

148
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,320
80 million?

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,800
In cash?

150
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,720
You country bumpkin.

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,640
But I can't blame you.

152
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,320
You probably have no idea

153
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,720
what nearly 100 million in cash even means.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,520
He Lu,

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,000
educate him a bit,

156
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,880
let him know how ridiculous he looks right now.

157
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,640
A sheltered poor student

158
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,800
really knows how to talk big.

159
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,840
Even a major corporation like Huasheng collecting these bills

160
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,760
would use options and debt collateral exchanges

161
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,520
with minimal cash to complete the transaction.

162
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,120
Producing 80 million at once -

163
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,160
in all of Jiangbei,

164
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,720
there are probably very few companies

165
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,520
with that kind of cash flow.

166
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
You're the ones who haven't seen the world.

167
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,780
Manager Zhang,

168
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,800
I need to withdraw 83 million in cash now,

169
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,960
delivered to 25 Fulin Road within ten minutes.

170
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,320
You're quite the actor,

171
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,800
it's a shame you didn't become one.

172
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,280
In ten minutes,

173
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,570
take the money and get lost.

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,080
Still playing this game?

175
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,480
Lin Dongfeng.

176
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,520
I don't have time to play along with your act anymore.

177
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:18,980
Come on.

178
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,400
Get all this junk

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,890
and throw it all out.

180
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,200
Stay back.

181
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,690
I dare anyone to try.

182
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,570
Why are you here?

183
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,400
I couldn't reach you or Wanzhi,

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,260
so I thought something might be wrong and came over.

185
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,500
Sister is here too.

186
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,840
Why are you so free today?

187
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,160
I forgot.

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,280
Look at my memory.

189
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,320
You're a traitor.

190
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,740
Grandfather has already suspended you.

191
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,440
I heard even your accounts have been frozen.

192
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,970
Having a rough time lately?

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,930
I really regret sending someone to save you that day.

194
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,320
Scum like you

195
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,180
should have been beaten to death.

196
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,360
Gu Bingqing.

197
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,500
We'll deal with our issues later.

198
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,530
Today I'm here to deal with him.

199
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,800
Lin Dongfeng.

200
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
Today we'll settle all scores, old and new.

201
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
Today, right in front of you,

202
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,580
I'll show you how I discipline Zheng Wanzhi,

203
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,760
then beat you to a pulp

204
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,160
and throw you in the river to feed the fish.

205
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,490
How could the Gu family produce such scum?

206
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,050
You've never beaten me since we were kids.

207
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
Today, for an outsider,

208
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,450
you're going to lay hands on me?

209
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Are you okay?

210
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
You'd better worry about yourself.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,530
Get them.

212
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Let's see who dares to touch Mr. Lin.

213
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,080
Mr. Lin.

214
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
We've delivered your 83 million

215
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,560
in cash with the highest

216
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,780
level of security.

217
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,040
Push it in.

218
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Move it along.
