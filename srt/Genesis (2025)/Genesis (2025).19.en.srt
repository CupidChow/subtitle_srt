1
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,840
Come on! Let's go!

2
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,500
Hold on, Wu.

3
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,560
It's okay.

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,440
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,240
Dean Sun.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,720
Mr Wu is a national treasure scientist.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,040
You must save him at all costs.

8
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,080
Mr. Yang.

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,400
Don't worry.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,120
I know Mr. Wu's dosage.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,040
All departments are waiting inside.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,000
I will host this operation myself.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,039
I will try my best

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,080
to get Mr. Wu back from hell.

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,440
Dean Sun.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,720
Please.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,440
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
It's all my fault.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,600
I was wrong.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,890
I'm the one who should go in.

21
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,400
It's me. It's me.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,280
What are you doing?

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
Calm down.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,660
This is a hospital.

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,979
Get out of here if you keep making a scene.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,000
Does Professor Oh

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,759
want to see you like this?

28
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,400
Pull yourself together.

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,160
Professor Oh is in trouble.

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,820
We don't want anyone to see it.

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,840
But you're the one who should calm down.

32
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,360
The experiment just succeeded.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,360
What you should do next

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,320
is to lead us on.

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,480
instead of being a coward.

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,080
All you do is cry.

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Look.

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,170
We're all watching you.

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
You are our backbone.

40
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,040
You are our navigator.

41
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
At a time like this,

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,400
if you fail,

43
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,920
will you let us down?

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,420
Do you feel sorry for our country?

45
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,920
Everyone,

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,240
I understand your concern.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,280
But the operation

48
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,440
I think it will take some time.

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,840
Got it.

50
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,960
I will

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,000
as soon as possible.

52
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,480
You should

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,280
Go back and have a rest.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,600
Let Mr. Lim

55
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,120
take a break.

56
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,320
Editor Yang.

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,760
There's news.

58
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,720
Tell us.

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,600
Don't worry.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
Mr. Wu is lucky.

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,600
He'll be fine.

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,690
I'm the one who should go in.

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,720
If you think so,

64
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,200
you'll let Mr. Wu down.

65
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,240
The reason why our scientific research

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,560
for hundreds of years

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,520
That's because a generation of scientists

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,840
are not afraid of hardships.

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,440
and the spirit of sacrifice.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,720
Mr Wu.

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,920
not for you.

72
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,120
but to

73
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,760
to make the technology spirit pass on.

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,680
Let you

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,640
lead us to a further future.

76
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,040
Jung-joo.

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,800
Take Mr. Lim to bed. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,480
This is Yang Jeong Do.

79
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,480
Report the results to the national patent center.

80
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,040
to save

81
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,760
of our successful experiment in foreign institutions.

82
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,280
From now on,

83
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,290
monitor the movements of foreign institutions.

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,520
Report to me if anything happens.

85
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,640
Dr. Sun.

86
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,930
How's Professor Oh?

87
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,460
The surgery went well.

88
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,520
Professor Oh.

89
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
He's out of danger now.

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,880
but he's still in a coma.

91
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,920
That's great.

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,400
Can we meet?

93
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
The patient needs to rest.

94
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
We'll arrange ICU right away.

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,000
to let Mr. Wu stay in Gagan ward.

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,040
I've asked the chief.

97
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,450
I'll arrange it right away.

98
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,900
Dean Sun and I will go through the procedure.

99
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
Go back and rest.

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,800
Mr Wu.

101
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
when Mr. Wu gets better.

102
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,080
Come and see him.

103
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,240
Dean Sun.

104
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,080
There's no one now.

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,600
Finally,

106
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,440
tell you my truth.

107
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,040
Actually,

108
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,240
when you and Lin Dong Feng

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,040
checked the data, I knew

110
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,700
you didn't make a mistake.

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,680
It was him.

112
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,760
You're thinking about your master-disciple relationship.

113
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,720
and wanted to be passed down.

114
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,320
but he shouldered all this alone.

115
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,050
Thank goodness.

116
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,000
We did it.

117
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,440
But I regret it.

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,560
If I didn't

119
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,760
I didn't agree to your request,

120
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
You won't be like this now.

121
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,720
Mr Wu.

122
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
Can you open your eyes?

123
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,760
look at me?

124
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,360
I'm...

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
Yang Jeong Do.

126
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,520
Wake up.

127
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,440
I beg you.

128
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,200
Please.

129
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,960
Mr. Yang.

130
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,800
Let Mr. Oh rest.

131
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,560
Please

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,690
take good care of Mr. Wu.

133
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,080
Don't worry.

134
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,960
We will take care of Mr. Wu

135
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,740
in the best medical level.

136
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,040
Thank you.

137
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,960
I officially announce to the world

138
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,890
we have made breakthrough in the controllable nuclear mutation area.

139
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,200
The nuclear fusion energy control problem has been completely broken.

140
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,240
We will lead all mankind

141
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,200
to use the ultimate energy.

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
[Chief, I'm Yang Jeong-do.]

143
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm Yang Zhengdao. I'm Yang Zhengdao. I'm Yang Zhengdao.

144
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,920
A foreign institution

145
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,560
of our company.

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,080
I request

147
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,450
to use the Yellow Bird Project.

148
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,730
Thank you for your support.

149
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,040
Come here.

150
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,720
Start the Yellow Bird Project.

151
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,840
Yes.

152
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,320
all members

153
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,520
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
