1
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,280
Everyone's here.

2
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,200
Let's begin.

3
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,520
First,

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,400
I'll convey instructions from our superiors.

5
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,440
The leadership is very pleased

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,800
with our recent work.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,840
They believe our research team

8
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,170
has fully demonstrated

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,840
a spirit of hard work,

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,240
fearlessness in the face of difficulties,

11
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,600
and courage to explore.

12
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,040
After consideration, the leadership has decided

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,360
to award our research team a collective second-class merit.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,980
Additionally,

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,280
Lin Dongfeng,

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,400
Wu Wenyong,

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
and Kang Tianfeng,

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,280
who made outstanding contributions

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,680
during the second phase of experiments,

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,610
will each receive individual second-class merits.

21
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,560
Director Lin,

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,440
Wu,

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,480
Kang,

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,680
Shan Yudong

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,740
congratulations.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,759
The instructions from our superiors have been clearly conveyed.

27
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,320
Now let's discuss our upcoming tasks.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,920
Although our leaders have commended us,

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,280
we must clearly understand that

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,600
completing the second phase preparations

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,250
is just the beginning of our long journey.

32
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,759
The work ahead

33
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,560
still has countless challenges waiting for us.

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,210
The first challenge

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,560
is the day after tomorrow,

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,690
when we will conduct

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,780
the nuclear fusion energy control experiment.

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,080
Although we've done extensive preparation,

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,160
however,

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,400
until the experiment succeeds,

41
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,850
we cannot afford to let our guard down.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,520
Here,

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,079
I wish you all

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,920
great success.

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,340
May you soon

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
use the ultimate energy

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
to benefit the people.

48
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,740
Director Yang,

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
rest assured,

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
we won't let you down.

51
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,480
Team Leader Lin is right.

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
For this project,

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,200
we will definitely live up to our responsibility.

54
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,100
Ri Sheng Temple

55
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,090
Good.

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,120
Then I'll

57
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,040
leave everything to you all.

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,660
Master.

59
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,880
Today

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,600
you should go home and rest well.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,320
The day after tomorrow,

62
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,180
we'll witness history together.

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,800
Not witness.

64
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,600
Create.

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
Every step we take

66
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
is creating history.

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,360
As always, Master's insights are profound

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,450
and to the point.

69
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,120
Professor Wu,

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
please stop flattering him so much.

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm speaking from the heart.

72
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,120
Let's go.

73
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,079
That dream

74
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,079
is finally coming true.

75
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,240
You must be hungry after staying up all night.

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,040
Eat something before you sleep.

77
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,920
Thanks.

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,980
No need to thank me.

79
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,920
It's nothing.

80
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,060
Why are you up so early?

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,600
I have relatives visiting.

82
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
They insist I take her around.

83
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
Can't help it.

84
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,520
I'm heading out now.

85
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,780
Take care of yourself.

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,600
I should go too.

87
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,240
I'm not that kid who could stay overnight at internet cafes anymore.

88
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Can't handle all-nighters now.

89
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm off.

90
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,720
Bring back some food.

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,320
Sir,

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
we've reached an agreement with that genius kid.

93
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,440
The experimental data models have been backed up.

94
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,159
Very good.

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,600
What about the materials

96
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,520
needed for the experiment?

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,200
Everything is ready.

98
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,200
We can start the experiment anytime.

99
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,600
Good.

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
Let's officially begin today.

101
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,500
Pursuit of the Sun Project

102
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,920
Before we officially start the experiment,

103
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,280
all experts please double-check the experimental data

104
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,480
to ensure complete accuracy.

105
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,210
Understood.

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,760
Professor Li?

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,050
Are you feeling unwell?

108
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:57,930
I'm fine.

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't sleep at all last night.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Just feeling a bit dizzy.

111
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,520
I understand.

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,280
The first time I participated in a major experiment,

113
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,680
I couldn't sleep either.

114
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,440
Time flies.

115
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,690
It's been forty years already.

116
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,880
My data checks out.

117
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,800
All my numbers are correct.

118
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,620
No issues on my end.

119
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
Everything's fine here too.

120
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Professor Wu?

121
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,840
Everything is foolproof.

122
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,240
Absolutely watertight.

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,010
All data has been verified.

124
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,640
Very well.

125
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,640
Data entry.

126
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,160
Nuclear fusion energy control experiment

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
is now beginning.

128
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,720
Nuclear fusion proceeding smoothly.

129
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,180
Energy release is stable.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,460
What's the current value?

131
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
Currently at 100 MeV.

132
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,240
Fusion control remains stable.

133
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,560
Add another

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,360
500 MeV.

135
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,040
Control still stable.

136
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,560
Let's add more

137
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,520
and test

138
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,380
the stability at extreme values.

139
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,000
After increasing to 800 MeV,

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,400
it's becoming unstable.

141
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,850
Let's try again.

142
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,280
Try again.

143
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,570
Impossible.

144
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,720
It can't be.

145
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,840
I've calculated this countless times.

146
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,300
The controllable limit for nuclear fusion should be 1000 MeV.

147
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,160
This is wrong.

148
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,720
This value differs from my initial verification.

149
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,450
And it can't be modified through remote control.

150
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,410
I made a calculation error.

151
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,170
I've let everyone down.

152
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,960
This data...

153
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,000
I verified it myself.

154
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,680
I was careless.

155
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,880
Causing instability in the limit control.

156
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,760
I'm sorry, everyone.

157
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,480
Mr. Wu.

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,410
Any responsibility...

159
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,880
I'll take full responsibility myself.
