1
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,520
Dongfeng.

2
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,840
It's me.

3
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,120
Let's talk.

4
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,440
Is that your girlfriend?

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,960
Keep your voice down.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,800
Pretend no one's here.

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Otherwise I'll never clear my name.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,720
Dongfeng.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,640
Are you not here?

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,200
Your phone is inside.

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,620
How did you get up here?

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,100
Looking for Dongfeng?

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,120
I saw your dorm supervisor wasn't around.

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,920
I just came up.

15
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,600
Why don't you go in?

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,660
Why is the door locked?

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,640
Is he not home?

18
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,640
I don't know.

19
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,370
But his phone is inside.

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,960
He's probably fallen asleep again.

21
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,200
He's not here.

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,440
He's not here.

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,479
A man and woman alone...

24
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,410
It wouldn't be appropriate for you to come in with me.

25
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,759
It's fine.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,060
I'll just wait for him inside.

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,800
Hey!

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
He's really not here?

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,240
I told you he wasn't here.

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,720
Why don't you go home first?

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,980
I'll let you know when Dongfeng returns.

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,880
That works.

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,920
When he comes back,

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,650
make sure to tell him to find me.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,740
I'm so thirsty.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,440
This is the milk tea I bought for Dongfeng.

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,840
I know.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,720
I see this is a new flavor.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,120
Haven't tried it before.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,250
Want to have a taste.

41
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,320
We often drink each other's beverages.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,180
That's how it is in the boys' dorm.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,840
Alright then.

44
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,079
Next time I come,

45
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,810
I'll bring an extra cup for you.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
I'm leaving now.

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,640
What's wrong?

48
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
My stomach hurts.

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,840
Stomachache.

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,640
Is there something wrong with the milk tea?

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,170
Do you want me to take you to the campus clinic?

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,760
I feel like

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,480
I'm a bit better.

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Alright then.

55
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,560
I'll go first.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,690
I don't feel well again.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
I can't take it anymore.

58
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,320
You guys!

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
You were just acting.

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Wanzhi, let me explain.

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,720
She and I... she and I...

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,840
She and I... I...

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,000
Wanzhi!

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,140
You're leaving me here all alone?

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,760
Wanzhi.

66
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,839
Wanzhi.

67
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,540
What's wrong, Wanzhi?

68
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,490
Tell Mom what's bothering you.

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Wanzhi.

70
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,960
Talk to Mom about anything.

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,040
I'm fine.

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,980
Don't keep things bottled up inside.

73
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,760
Did that nasty boy bully you?

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,360
Tell Mom about it.

75
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,770
I just need some time alone.

76
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,680
All right.

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,600
When Mrs. Zhang returns from grocery shopping,

78
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,320
Mom will make you

79
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,840
your favorite childhood dish, rice cake with spare ribs.

80
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,600
Okay.

81
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,680
I'm Wanzhi.

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,240
Wanzhi.

83
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,120
Wanzhi.

84
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
It's me, Wanzhi.

85
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,760
I'm Wanzhi.

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,800
I'm here to apologize.

87
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,720
Wanzhi, I was wrong.

88
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,180
Wanzhi.

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Are you home, Wanzhi?

90
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,780
Wanzhi.

91
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,360
Wanzhi.

92
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
Wanzhi, are you home?

93
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,720
Wanzhi.

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,040
Wanzhi.

95
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,800
Wanzhi.

96
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,720
I know we've had some misunderstandings lately.

97
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
But between me and Miss Gu,

98
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,450
nothing happened, I swear.

99
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,560
I've been working for her recently.

100
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,480
Just trying to earn more money

101
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,410
to make you happy

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,240
and impress your mother.

103
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,080
Wanzhi.

104
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Being with you

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,840
isn't just about having a casual relationship.

106
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,200
I truly want to marry you

107
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,260
and spend the rest of my life with you.

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
That day at your house,

109
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,020
I took everything your mother said to heart.

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,680
Everything I've been doing lately

111
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
and all the effort I've put in

112
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,200
is to give you a happy life.

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,680
I hope that in our future plans,

114
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,000
we both have an important place in each other's lives.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,560
Wanzhi.

116
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,480
Will you believe me?

117
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,000
Wanzhi.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,520
Wanzhi.

119
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,440
Hello, ma'am.

120
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,400
Is Wanzhi home?

121
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,480
I have something to tell her.

122
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,240
Lin.

123
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,820
Wanzhi is not in a good mood today.

124
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,500
Please come back another day.

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,240
Honey, is this your boyfriend?

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,560
Lin Dongfeng.

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,280
Lin Dongfeng.

128
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't come looking for me anymore.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
I don't want to see you again.

130
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,080
Let's break up.

131
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Throw the ball over here.

132
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,240
I'm talking to you.

133
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,100
Did you hear me?

134
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,200
You got a death wish?

135
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you know who I am?

136
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,340
Do you know who I am?

137
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
Stop hitting him.

138
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,840
Stop it.

139
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,360
Stop!

140
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,690
What gives you the right to hit him?

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,060
Who are you?

142
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,040
Mind your own business.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Get lost.

144
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,920
Or I'll beat you up too.

145
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,440
Boss.

146
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
This woman...

147
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,960
She's that...

148
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,610
You got lucky this time.

149
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,170
Let's go.

150
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,680
Are you okay?

151
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,920
Thank you.

152
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
But do we know each other?

153
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,400
You don't know me,

154
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,680
but I know you.

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,680
My name is Yang Jingshu,

156
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
from the Medical School.

157
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,120
I was there that day

158
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,570
at your science innovation competition.

159
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,700
Why did you help me?

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Because

161
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,760
you're the genius Professor Wu mentioned,

162
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,400
who can change an era.

163
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,520
Being a genius

164
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,980
what's the use?

165
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,170
I'm still looked down upon.

166
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,680
Great music attracts few listeners,

167
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,160
but eventually finds its audience.

168
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,520
If you succeed with controlled nuclear fusion,

169
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,920
it will solve the ultimate energy problem.

170
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
Not just for our country,

171
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,520
but for all humanity - it would be immeasurable merit.

172
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,400
By then,

173
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,490
no one will look down on you.

174
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,340
You understand controlled nuclear fusion?

175
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Aren't you from the Medical School?

176
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,560
I'm just interested in physics.

177
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,080
But I only understand some of it,

178
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,570
not everything.

179
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
True.

180
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,720
What difference does it make if you understand it?

181
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,200
Even if I am a natural genius,

182
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
I'm still inferior to those

183
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,280
officials, businessmen, and rich kids

184
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,400
with money, power, and status.

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,320
Her mother was right.

186
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,000
Education is useless,

187
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,920
and research is just wasting your life.

188
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,160
I'd rather have done nothing

189
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,560
and still be with Wanzhi.

190
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,200
Lin Dongfeng,

191
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,080
you need to understand

192
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,640
how great your research is.

193
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,680
It will change the fate of humanity,

194
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,410
not just your personal matter.

195
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,780
You should know

196
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,720
how many people study day and night

197
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
just to advance technology a little bit more,

198
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,740
to make our lives a little better.

199
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,640
And you?

200
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
You have the opportunity to change the world,

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
yet you don't cherish it.

202
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,680
If people like Einstein,

203
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,120
Feynman,

204
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,960
and Yang Zhenning, these stars of humanity,

205
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,200
had doubted themselves because of small setbacks

206
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,360
and abandoned their research,

207
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
how would we have those brilliant moments that pushed humanity forward?

208
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,880
Change the world?

209
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
What's the point?

210
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,800
I've even lost my girlfriend.

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,080
People ahead of their time

212
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,540
are destined to be lonely.

213
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,480
However,

214
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,820
a genius may be lonely,

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,460
but shouldn't be fragile.

216
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
A genius may be lonely,

217
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,880
but shouldn't be fragile.

218
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,680
You're right.

219
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,480
Perhaps geniuses

220
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,140
are born to be misunderstood.

221
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,200
It's just a breakup,

222
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,240
not a big deal.

223
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,060
Even geniuses need to eat.

224
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,280
Let's go to the cafeteria.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,080
It's my treat.

226
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,560
How could I let you do that?

227
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,620
Let me pay instead.

228
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,260
I really need to thank you.

229
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
In my opinion,

230
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,130
you and Shaocheng make quite a good match.

231
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,760
You two were already engaged,

232
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,290
and he cares about you a lot.

233
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,920
I just broke up with someone.

234
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,120
Could you please consider my feelings?

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,160
Besides,

236
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,920
before my father passed away,

237
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,920
he already canceled my engagement with the Gu family.

238
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,780
Your father spoiled you too much,

239
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,980
he completely ruined you.

240
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,240
The Gu family is wealthy and prestigious.

241
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,440
What's wrong with marrying Shaocheng?

242
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
My father wasn't spoiling me,

243
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,800
he loved me.

244
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,080
He respected my choices

245
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,380
and let me freely control my own life.

246
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
Unlike you,

247
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,570
who just wants me to be your puppet.

248
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,170
How dare you talk like that!

249
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,960
Explain yourself clearly.

250
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
How have I treated you like a puppet?

251
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Since you were little,

252
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,080
whatever you wanted to learn,

253
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,040
whoever you wanted to be friends with,

254
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,920
which university you wanted to attend,

255
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,050
when did I ever not discuss it with you?

256
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Anyway, let me be clear with you.

257
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,920
I'm 22 years old now.

258
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,850
I can make my own decisions.

259
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,320
I want to live for myself.

260
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,040
I want to love freely.

261
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,620
Even though I broke up with Lin Dongfeng,

262
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,500
I will absolutely never be with Gu Shaocheng

263
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,500
or compromise with this feudal arranged marriage.

264
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,680
If my father were still here,

265
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,920
he would never be like you,

266
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,280
rushing to marry me off.

267
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,320
Your father, your father, your father!

268
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,580
You only know how to bring up your father.

269
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,160
Your father is dead.

270
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,160
He can't control you anymore.

271
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,720
He can't control either of us anymore.

272
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,780
Do you understand?

273
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,040
I was hoping you could marry Shaocheng

274
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,170
so I didn't want you to know about this.

275
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,560
Take a good look.

276
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,960
Our Zheng family has collapsed.

277
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,040
These are all the debts your father left behind.

278
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,640
Even this villa has been mortgaged.

279
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,680
You're no longer a young lady of wealth.
