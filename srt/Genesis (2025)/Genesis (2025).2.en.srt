1
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,340
You didn't knock when you came in.

2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,160
I don't see you get up even when you're in the sun.

3
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,360
What time is it today?

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,360
The room is so messy.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,080
Auntie Zhang asked you to go downstairs for breakfast several times.

6
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,880
It'll be cold if you don't go now.

7
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,400
Which one looks better?

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,000
This one is better.

9
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,120
My daughter

10
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,920
You look good in anything. Okay.

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,490
Let's go downstairs and eat. Okay.

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,520
Today

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,330
You should dress up too.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,530
It's just going to Huasheng Group.

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,440
If your father didn't spoil you too much

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,289
and refused the marriage of the Gu family for you,

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,880
You're 22 years old.

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,080
You should get a marriage certificate with Shao Cheng.

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,009
the Young Madam of Huasheng Group.

20
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,479
I beg you.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,240
Don't mention it again today.

22
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,960
Okay.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,200
Let's go eat.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,800
Director Liu.

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,720
The students are here one by one.

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,640
Organize it.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,370
Let's start.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,280
Welcome to

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Jiangbei University.

30
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,079
The seventh technology innovation competition.

31
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,079
The rule of this year is very simple.

32
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,160
Well,

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,560
Every contestant, please come to the stage

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,720
of technology innovation.

35
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,680
Ten minutes for each person.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
There's no limit.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,160
No limit to science. No limit.

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,640
I hope all participants

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,800
can do their best

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,040
so that we can

41
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
successfully.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,180
Let's go. Let's go.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
let’s welcome

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,880
to the stage.

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,480
When did I become No.1?

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,640
It must be arranged by the tutor.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,500
You are the best thorn in our Department of Physics.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,320
Gosh.

49
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
So many people participated in the selection.

50
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,200
What?

51
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,320
Not yet.

52
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,079
I don't think he can hear me on the way.

53
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,040
I'll try again.

54
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Brother.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,600
You need to change your habit of not picking up.

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,640
Where are you?

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,079
I have to find you now.

58
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,280
Young man.

59
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,320
Let's start when you're ready.

60
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,080
You are

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,480
an international atomic organisation for life.

62
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,810
Professor Wu Muyong, nuclear physicist.

63
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,760
You know me.

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,850
I memorized every paper you wrote.

65
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,440
Last year, when you got the national badge,

66
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
I wrote an article

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
about your research direction.

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,440
Oh Mun-yong.

69
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I guess I have my own fans

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
at my age.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,159
A century-old song is hard, but I haven't seen a bosom friend.

72
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,960
Only a scholar like Professor Oh

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,360
can understand my thoughts.

74
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,280
Looks like my chance to become famous

75
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,140
finally comes.

76
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Wanzhi.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,920
Brother Shao Cheng is calling you.

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,980
Hello, Mrs. Zheng.

79
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,020
Wanzhi.

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,080
Hello.

81
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,680
How rude.

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,780
Greet Brother Shao Cheng.

83
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,770
Hello, Brother Shao Cheng.

84
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
There's no need

85
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,850
You're welcome.

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,720
Stop pretending.

87
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Mrs. Zheng.

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,440
Why are you and Wanzhi

89
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,770
come to Huasheng today?

90
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,520
It's because of me.

91
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,050
We're just looking around.

92
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,280
I heard Hwa Sung is doing something today.

93
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,440
A talent selection.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
We're just here

95
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,360
and visit you.

96
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,620
I didn't expect

97
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,360
Mrs. Zheng and Wanzhi

98
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,200
still care about me.

99
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,280
No.

100
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,120
Zheng Wanzhi.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,930
Why are you here?

102
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,360
Where's your boyfriend?

103
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,520
I can't get through to him.

104
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,850
I'm looking for him too.

105
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,200
Your boyfriend?

106
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,340
When did you have a boyfriend?

107
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,240
Hey.

108
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,810
We're just classmates.

109
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,400
Children play house.

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
You can't be serious.

111
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Hey.

112
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
So the ace player you're looking for

113
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,240
is a kid who hasn't graduated from undergraduate.

114
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,920
You're going to give up Hwaseong's inheritance.

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
Don't underestimate him.

116
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,040
He's a genius.

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
Genius?

118
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,760
This is

119
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,480
your definition.

120
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,120
I believe in a few minutes,

121
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,480
in a few minutes.

122
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,300
Students nowadays

123
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,960
are exaggerated.

124
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,500
He doesn't know how high and mighty he is.

125
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,440
The genius Professor Oh met.

126
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,500
That's more than the food you had.

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,520
Last week.

128
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,840
Professor Wu's doctor

129
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,040
just won

130
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,280
the first prize of international nuclear physics competition.

131
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,120
He proposed

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,840
of nuclear mutation theory.

133
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,360
It made a great contribution

134
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,600
to humans.

135
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,370
You call yourself a genius in front of him.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
Isn't that ridiculous?

137
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,520
All right.

138
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,920
Introduce

139
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,600
your participation first.

140
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,680
My research project is

141
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,640
control nuclear mutation.

142
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,920
Lin,

143
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,620
do you know what is controllable nuclear mutation?

144
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,040
Normally,

145
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,440
it's a human-made sun.

146
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,720
If we succeed,

147
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
will be completely solved.

148
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,880
the crisis of human energy.

149
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Not only in China,

150
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,640
it's still a problem

151
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
it's still a problem.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Even if it's just a little progress,

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,159
you can win the Nobel Prize.

154
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,120
If you

155
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,520
just learn some academic names,

156
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,880
Don't make a scene here.

157
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,680
I've calculated the key data.

158
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,280
Within a year,

159
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,680
in a year.

160
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,370
Within three years,

161
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,159
in three years.

162
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,620
He's crazy.

163
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,890
Three years.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,530
three years of popularity.

165
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
He invited us here

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,760
to listen to such nonsense.

167
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,160
Jiangbei University

168
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,920
is really thoughtful.

169
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,920
Mr. Liu.

170
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,360
Is this the student you found?

171
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,120
Let him go.

172
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,140
Principal.

173
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,420
He is the best student in the Department of Physics.

174
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,640
Give him another chance to say something.

175
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,480
Mr. Liu.

176
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,840
It's good to care about students.

177
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
But science

178
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,800
cannot be disrespected.

179
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,520
Scientific research requires the truth.

180
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,360
My colleagues and I have studied it for decades.

181
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,419
but it didn't work.

182
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,280
A student who is still wet behind the ears

183
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,320
He said he could achieve a stable nuclear mutation in a year.

184
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,049
and three years of popularity.

185
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,880
What else could it be?

186
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,420
Professor Oh is right.

187
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,480
Young man.

188
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,640
You have to be down-to-earth.

189
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,920
Don't always think about ascending to the sky.

190
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,640
Keep going if you have any practical research.

191
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,320
If...

192
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,840
you still say this,

193
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,320
these nonsense.

194
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,920
please leave.

195
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,720
Professor Oh.

196
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,600
You haven't heard me out yet.

197
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,000
about the controllable nuclear mutation.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,240
How can you say that?

199
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,100
That's enough.

200
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,600
Professor Wu is being nice.

201
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,200
Don't push your luck.

202
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,250
Principal Wang.

203
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,400
If you don't let him go,

204
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,760
I don't think you should apply for

205
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,400
next year.

206
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,680
Where is the security?

207
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,010
Hurry up. Take him away.

208
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,560
You are so pedantic.

209
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,120
You're kicking me out before listening to the content.

210
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,880
Looks like you high-ranking people

211
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,340
are like Internet trolls.

212
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,540
Delete the comments if you can't win.

213
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,520
We have confirmed that

214
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,840
Here.

215
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,400
The IP of an anonymous poster

216
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,760
from Jiangbei City.

217
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,520
Could it be...

218
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,680
How pathetic.

219
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,160
I have ambition.

220
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
But it's hard to find a bosom friend.

221
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,240
Get down.

222
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,920
You'll be punished severely.

223
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,040
The whole school is reporting criticism.

224
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,840
Wait.

225
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,320
If you're so sure,

226
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,220
I'll give you another chance.

227
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,040
Tell me

228
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,960
How did you complete the controllable nuclear mutation?

229
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,600
Hurry up, we're late.

230
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,730
Why aren't you going in?

231
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,820
The genius you found hasn't come yet.

232
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,040
I think

233
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,730
he doesn't dare to come.

234
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,360
Today, the whole group will select talents.

235
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,400
All branch companies are

236
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,330
who studied overseas, prestigious schools and PhD.

237
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,130
If I were him,

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,060
I wouldn't have embarrassed myself.

239
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,160
Look at you.

240
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,720
It's such a big deal.

241
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,000
Find a second-rate school student.

242
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,800
Sister.

243
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,000
You know,

244
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,130
Grandpa cares about talents the most.

245
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,520
He always said

246
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
talent is the foundation of a company.

247
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,040
That's why the annual talent selection meeting is held.

248
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
If grandpa finds out you're doing this,

249
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,210
how can you compete with me for the inheritance of Huasheng?

250
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,240
Ordinary talents are everywhere.

251
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
But if you want to make a big fuss,

252
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,480
depends on Lin Dongfeng.

253
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,880
The person I like

254
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
is definitely right.

255
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,160
Lin Dongfeng.

256
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,560
I put the future on you.

257
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
Don't let me down.

258
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,640
On the ultimate guide Tokamark device,

259
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,360
make rare-earth Copper Meteorite oxide to make rare earth supernatural materials.

260
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,120
It can produce powerful magnetic field in a very small space.

261
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,050
and conduct an indoor ultrasound.

262
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,720
According to my calculation,

263
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,340
it can be realized.

264
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
energy consumption.

265
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,320
The data he just mentioned

266
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,320
is exactly the same as what Editor Yang gave me.

267
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,640
This is top secret.

268
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,240
Is he the mysterious person?

269
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,760
Room temperature ultrasound.

270
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,640
What kind of civil medicine is this?

271
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,800
That's ridiculous.

272
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,520
Professor Oh.

273
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
Don't waste your time

274
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,920
waste your time.

275
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,680
Shut up.

276
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,240
I think

277
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,260
you are the real ignorant one.

278
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,000
As

279
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,080
of the scientific association,

280
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,560
knows nothing about scientific research.

281
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,720
Young man,

282
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
What you just said

283
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,000
and the formula.

284
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,770
Where did you hear that?

285
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,160
I deduced it myself.

286
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,040
His calculation just now

287
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,690
is far better than my decades of research.

288
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,800
It seems that the person we're looking for

289
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
is him.

290
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,680
But...

291
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,010
Can a college student who didn't graduate

292
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,140
can really finish all of this?

293
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,680
No.

294
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,800
Is his data so important?

295
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,320
It can change the world.

296
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,490
Is it important?

297
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,530
Principal Wang.

298
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,840
Stop the game

299
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,290
I'm going to report to Editor Yang right away.

300
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,760
The old man gave me the wind.

301
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,720
It concerns the nomination of the next board.

302
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,200
We must do it flawlessly.

303
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,220
We can't give Gu Bingqing any chance.

304
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,140
I don't know what Mr. Bai is thinking.

305
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,760
He loves Gu Bingqing so much.

306
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,320
What's wrong with handing Huasheng over to me?

307
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,360
Don't worry.

308
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,890
Huasheng Group will be yours sooner or later.

309
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,320
Hello.

310
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,240
Mr. Gu.

311
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,000
Why did you call me suddenly?

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
Didn't we agree

313
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,600
not to let anyone know our cooperation.

314
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,720
I need you to do something important.

315
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,560
Smith, we're partners.

316
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,360
I'm not your employee.

317
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,760
Stop ordering me around.

318
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,760
Calm down.

319
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,160
We'll get what we need. Okay.

320
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,800
Don't forget

321
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,080
the technology I provided for you

322
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,520
that made your branch

323
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,920
to become the most profitable branch under Huasheng.

324
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,160
I promise

325
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,320
our cooperation will be greater this time.

326
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,200
With my help,

327
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,760
with my help.

328
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,720
And you

329
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
will become

330
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,760
of Huasheng.

331
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,490
What can I do for you?

332
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,960
Find someone

333
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,320
in Jiangbei City.

334
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
Answer the phone.

335
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,280
Wanzhi.

336
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,840
Why hasn’t Lin seen him?

337
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,560
Is he not confident

338
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,360
to come?

339
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,600
East Wind is not like that.

340
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
What he said

341
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,840
what he said.

342
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,280
He will come.

343
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,520
I'll call him a few more times.

344
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,440
Genius.

345
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,560
He's a genius.

346
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,400
Why didn't I think

347
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,160
to be recommended like this?

348
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,490
the new formula you calculated

349
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,450
will be tested and tested as soon as possible.

350
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,440
Great!

351
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,320
That's great.

352
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,600
I

353
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,400
stand on

354
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,160
on your shoulder.

355
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,120
Without the results

356
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
like you,

357
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,080
I can't calculate the value.

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,800
Young man.

359
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
I already

360
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,600
Mr. Yang on the phone.

361
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,440
They'll be here soon.

362
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,520
Set off when you're ready.

363
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,440
Let's go.

364
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,480
No.

365
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,200
Go.

366
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,330
Where are you going?

367
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,280
You are...

368
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,320
Lin Dong Feng.

369
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,720
Professor Wu.

370
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,080
Everything is ready.

371
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,200
Lin.

372
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,090
Let's go.

373
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,120
No no wait

374
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,080
Where are you going
