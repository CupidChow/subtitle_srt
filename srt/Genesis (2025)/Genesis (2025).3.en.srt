1
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:40,890
No, no, wait.

2
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,620
Where are we going?

3
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,840
I have plans later.

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,020
I promised my girlfriend.

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
You guys go ahead.

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,840
Call me if you need anything.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
Put your girlfriend on hold.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,000
Right now,

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,040
there's something more important waiting for you.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,570
Let's go.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,610
Move out.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,850
Wait,

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,050
where are you taking me?

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,170
Turn around.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,460
Let me go first.

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,610
Student Lin.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,520
We've finally found you.

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,490
I'm not a leader.

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,140
I always follow the rules.

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,720
I've been an excellent student since childhood.

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,960
I haven't done anything wrong.

22
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,520
Have you got the wrong person?

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,250
Student Lin.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Don't be nervous.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,800
We're not here to arrest you.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,720
We just want to

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,920
learn from you.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,759
We've been looking forward to meeting a talent like you

29
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,620
for a long time.

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,050
Let's go.

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,770
[Salute]

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,320
Everyone, please be seated.

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,560
Academician Li Fenghua from the Academy of Sciences.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,680
The top expert in nuclear electronics in the country.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,320
Hello.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,160
Academician from the Engineering Academy.

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,020
The legendary Professor Kang in atomic materials.

38
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,530
When I was studying the textbooks,

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,600
I always wondered

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,260
if your beard was real or fake.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,420
Finally meeting you in person today.

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,280
Professor Xue, the high-energy physics expert,

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,140
your books are way too expensive.

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,290
My heart was bleeding when I bought it.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,330
I'll get you a copy another day.

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,050
Professor Wang.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,079
Is there anything

48
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,880
on my face?

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,060
What are you doing?

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,650
Professor Wang.

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,920
My classmates and I were wondering

52
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,480
if you were balding.

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
I wear a hat

54
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,410
mainly for sun protection.

55
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,020
So you actually have hair.

56
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,480
Lin,

57
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,920
we've met now.

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,300
Please take a seat.

59
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,640
Since everyone is here,

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,440
I hereby announce

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,360
the Chase the Sun Project research team's

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
first meeting.

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,200
Now in session.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,580
Chase the Sun Project?

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,530
What's that?

66
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,320
Mr. Gu,

67
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,519
you're determined to win this time.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,020
The competition is just too weak.

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,200
Mr. Zhang,

70
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,080
can we start the exam a bit later?

71
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Mr. Gu.

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,760
I can stall until the chairman arrives.

73
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,159
Once the chairman gets here,

74
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,360
we must start immediately.

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,760
Got it.

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
Go get all our available cars

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,540
and bring them all.

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,520
Block the road from the chairman's house

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,920
to the company completely.

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,650
All the cars?

81
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,040
Your fleet of cars -

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,640
the chairman knows them all.

83
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,720
If we get caught...

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,240
We can't worry about that now.

85
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,100
Every minute we can delay counts.

86
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,720
Gu Shaocheng has put a lot of effort into this.

87
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,160
If Lin Dongfeng doesn't come,

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,820
we stand no chance of winning.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,570
Alright.

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,440
I'll give the orders right away.

91
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,650
Is this Lin Dongfeng

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
really that impressive?

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,320
This is how

94
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,820
everything happened.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,480
Lin,

96
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,760
do you have any questions

97
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,690
about what happened today?

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,280
No.

99
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Everyone has already

100
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,280
seen the comments.

101
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Now,

102
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,680
[Japanese characters]

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:41,920
[Japanese character]

104
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,040
you experts

105
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,580
should discuss this with him.

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,159
Let's discuss possible approaches to controlled nuclear fusion.

107
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,680
Feel free to speak your mind.

108
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,540
Director Yang.

109
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,240
I think we should first verify

110
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,490
if he's really the author of that commentary.

111
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,920
In my opinion,

112
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,560
he's too flamboyant

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
and impulsive.

114
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,400
No matter how I look at it,

115
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,060
he doesn't seem capable of writing such a groundbreaking thesis.

116
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,010
Mr. Kang.

117
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
I've already explained everything.

118
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,580
Academician Kang,

119
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,280
how would you like to verify this?

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,410
You're a master in materials science.

121
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,520
Should we start with rare-earth barium copper oxide's

122
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,960
extraction and synthesis,

123
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,680
or with the principles of room-temperature superconductors?

124
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,440
Rare-earth barium copper oxide is a layered crystal.

125
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,960
Barium ions and rare-earth ions

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,000
form one layer in a square close-packed arrangement.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,440
Copper ions and oxygen ions

128
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,200
form another layer in a square close-packed arrangement.

129
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,960
The two layers are nested together through oxygen ions.

130
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,640
It can be prepared using solid-state reaction,

131
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,700
vapor deposition,

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,920
or liquid-phase deposition methods.

133
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
Room temperature superconductors

134
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,760
can be prepared using

135
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,680
yttrium barium copper oxide with infrared pulses

136
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,480
to cause atomic oscillation and displacement,

137
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,200
making the copper oxide bilayers thicker and the interlayers narrower,

138
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,159
thus increasing the coupling degree.

139
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,760
All of this

140
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,560
was mentioned in my message.

141
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,050
Academician Kang can take a look at it.

142
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
So what do you think

143
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,800
is the key to making controlled nuclear fusion

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
available for civilian use?

145
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,720
The prerequisite for civilian use

146
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
is miniaturization.

147
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,880
We could try

148
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,720
a multi-module structure with detachable high-temperature superconducting coils.

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Has the data you mentioned earlier

150
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,360
been verified?

151
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,960
Most of it comes from my calculations.

152
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,800
Some parts

153
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,360
due to limited school resources and equipment

154
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,820
haven't been experimentally verified yet.

155
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,210
Moving forward,

156
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,160
we can combine numerical simulation with experiments.

157
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,400
Then using your proposed

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,320
superconducting material preparation process and optimization plan.

159
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,200
If successful,

160
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,760
it will dramatically improve radiation effects and control capabilities.

161
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,159
This would allow controlled nuclear fusion

162
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,760
to achieve breakthroughs not seen in decades.

163
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
Do you all believe

164
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,090
his reasoning is feasible?

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,560
Huangri Juice Bar.

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,880
Huyue Juice Bar.

167
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,080
Huangri Juice Bar.

168
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,680
Approved.

169
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Hengri Juice Bar.

170
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,940
I hereby announce.

171
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,680
Student Lin Dongfeng's

172
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,740
political review has been approved.

173
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,840
After consideration by higher authorities,

174
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,920
national level.

175
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,600
The Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research Team

176
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,280
has been officially established

177
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,440
in Jiangbei City.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
The team's code name

179
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
is Zhuri (Chasing the Sun).

180
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
Security classification

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
is top secret.

182
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,480
Resource priority

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
is highest priority.

184
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,240
Security level

185
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,140
is maximum.

186
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,520
All domestic resources.

187
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,160
Yang Zhengdao will be responsible for coordination,

188
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,480
all units must fully cooperate.

189
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,840
The research team members are:

190
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,240
Li Fenghua,

191
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,580
Kang Tianfeng,

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,640
Xue Tai,

193
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,600
Wang Fei,

194
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,440
Deputy Leader Wu Wenyong,

195
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,360
and the Leader is

196
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
Lin Dongfeng.

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,280
I...

198
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,380
Leader Lin.

199
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
The weight of history

200
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
now rests on your shoulders.

201
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,240
Director Yang,

202
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,890
may I ask something?

203
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
Being the leader,

204
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,940
is there a salary for this?

205
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,810
Let's follow

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,930
Professor Wu's standards.

207
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,240
What do you think?

208
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,640
Professor Wu.

209
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,000
They say university teachers don't make much money.

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,530
May I ask about your salary?

211
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Teaching and nurturing people

212
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
is indeed modest pay,

213
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,520
but my professor title

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
is still quite valuable.

215
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,520
You can put your mind at ease.

216
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,130
You old men all have children and grandchildren.

217
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,600
You have no idea how demanding mothers-in-law are nowadays.

218
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Am I being demanding?

219
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Tell me, am I asking for too much?

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,840
I never said he needs to be like Shaocheng

221
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
who's a company CEO

222
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,280
with a fortune worth billions.

223
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,340
But he should at least be comparable.

224
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,380
He should at least be able to afford a car and a house.

225
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,160
Do you think he can get into Huasheng Group?

226
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,490
I gave you both a chance.

227
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,680
And then what?

228
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,880
The interview starts in three minutes

229
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,410
and he's nowhere to be seen.

230
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,200
Let's go home.

231
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,100
Just wait a little longer.

232
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,840
If you want to wait, wait by yourself.

233
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,370
I won't stay here and be embarrassed with you.

234
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,260
Let me tell you.

235
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
If he can't get into Huasheng Group,

236
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,600
you and him...

237
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,330
There's absolutely no chance.

238
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,660
Lin Dongfeng, what are you doing?

239
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,280
Wanzhi.

240
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,680
Where's your mother?

241
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,320
My mom

242
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,640
said she wasn't feeling well

243
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,770
and went home first.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,600
Wanzhi.

245
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,960
Don't wait here anymore.

246
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,170
Go rest in my office.

247
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,840
When Lin Dongfeng arrives,

248
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I'll let you know.

249
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,340
No need.

250
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,930
Take Miss Zheng to rest.

251
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,440
Miss Zheng,

252
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
this way, please.

253
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,480
Do you know what time it is?

254
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,920
Why haven't we started yet?

255
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,250
Are you planning to keep everyone here for a midnight snack?

256
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,480
The chairman hasn't arrived yet.

257
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,410
How can we start?

258
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,760
Don't think I don't know your little trick.

259
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,340
Blocking all the roads

260
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,480
so my grandfather can't get here.

261
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,640
I've already sent a helicopter to pick up my grandfather.

262
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,770
Judging by the time,

263
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
he should be here any minute.

264
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,970
Grandpa.

265
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,680
Chairman.

266
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,960
Hello, Chairman.

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
Huasheng Group's

268
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,680
annual

269
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,820
talent selection meeting

270
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,380
is now officially beginning.

271
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,010
Is that the college student you found?

272
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,500
Did they lose their nerve?

273
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,300
Or are you hiding them as your secret weapon?

274
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,520
Gu Shaocheng,

275
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,100
why so anxious?

276
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,720
The game isn't over yet.

277
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,850
Nothing is certain.

278
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,500
Well...

279
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,210
Massachusetts,

280
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:47,960
this,

281
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,860
New Jersey,

282
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:49,840
and that

283
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Imperial Tech.

284
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,460
By the way, sis.

285
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,180
Do you know who's setting the exam questions this year?

286
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,040
Professor Wu from Qingbei University.

287
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,800
He's an internationally renowned authority.

288
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,200
If you're not acquainted with him,

289
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,660
I can introduce you later.

290
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,370
The outcome is decided.

291
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,410
It's no fun anymore.

292
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,200
Sister.

293
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
You can stay here by yourself.

294
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm going to rest.

295
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,880
When I receive the award after the competition,

296
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll even have to thank them.
