1
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,440
Lin Dongfeng,

2
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,600
if it weren't for you,

3
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,320
I would be the one in the spotlight.

4
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,960
Let's congratulate the young genius from China, Chu Tiankuo,

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,080
who ranked first in total score,

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,520
transcending age and level restrictions,

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,450
to win the gold medal at this International Nuclear Physics Olympiad.

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,320
Hello.

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,840
I'm the head of the Physics Department at Jiangbei University.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
My surname is Liu.

11
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,600
Hello.

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,530
The boss is here.

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,010
Come in, please.

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,820
I'm Tiankuo's mother.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,160
Please don't go to any trouble.

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,090
It's no trouble.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,320
Xiaokuo.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,360
Come.

19
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,440
Go buy some vegetables and meat.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,460
Let's treat our guest well today.

21
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:33,520
Chu.

22
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,729
You can't leave.

23
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,770
You're today's guest of honor.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,880
I know that

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,520
with Chu Tiankuo's competition results,

26
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,360
he could easily be admitted to top universities.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,920
However,

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,560
our Jiangbei University

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,140
is also willing to offer a full scholarship,

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,320
and we promise that

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,160
after Chu Tiankuo graduates,

32
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,420
he can teach at our university directly,

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,370
solving his employment concerns.

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
As for the salary,

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,729
you can name your price.

36
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,400
Given your family's situation,

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,759
having a university professor in the family

38
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,600
would certainly

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,260
bring honor to your household

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,900
and you wouldn't have to worry about making ends meet anymore.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,880
I'm not well-educated,

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,160
but I know that

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,560
my child will only truly succeed

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,640
if he gets into a top university.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,520
Gold will shine wherever it is.

46
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,000
I think Jiangbei University is quite good.

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,329
I'm willing to go there.

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,730
That's the right attitude.

49
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,600
People always

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,130
need to consider their practical interests.

51
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,480
Thank you, boss.

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,760
Come in and have a seat.

53
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,220
Come on.

54
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,760
What I've lost,

55
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,040
I'll definitely get back double.

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,079
It's full again.

57
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,680
Thank you.

58
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,760
I was just going to get water anyway.

59
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,690
It's no trouble.

60
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
How can you guarantee

61
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,520
that what you have is the final data?

62
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,159
Sir,

63
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,450
In the field of nuclear fusion,

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,880
apart from Lin Dongfeng,

65
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,920
I am your best option.

66
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
If you don't believe me,

67
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,280
you can always approach Lin Dongfeng

68
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,340
and see if he would betray the organization behind him.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,800
How can you guarantee

70
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
that we will definitely complete

71
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,440
the controlled nuclear fusion experiment faster than them?

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Without Lin Dongfeng,

73
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,940
how can the experiment be completed?

74
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Young man,

75
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,360
you're being too naive.

76
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,520
Director Yang

77
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,120
has been sending people

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,040
to secretly protect Lin Dongfeng.

79
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,080
No one can touch him.

80
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,360
You're mistaken.

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,730
I don't intend to use force,

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,120
but rather to destroy their trust from within.

83
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,560
As long as you follow what's written here,

84
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,220
I guarantee

85
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,480
Lin Dongfeng won't complete the experiment before us.

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,340
[Sound effect]

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,400
Ruthless and vicious.

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,280
The young are truly formidable.

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,600
Let me tell you something,

90
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
I'm a genius too.

91
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,320
Why should you get all the glory?

92
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,320
I've carefully planned every step to get here,

93
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,860
just to reclaim the glory that belongs to me.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,640
But meeting you here today

95
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,159
is quite unexpected.

96
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,210
But this works out well.

97
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,720
At least this magnificent moment

98
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
would be such a shame

99
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,570
without you witnessing it.

100
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,120
Chu Tiankuo.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,920
Stop now.

102
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,360
It's not too late.

103
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,660
I never completed the final step of the experiment.

104
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,120
If you follow my protocol,

105
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,560
it could lead to serious consequences.

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,600
Lin Dongfeng.

107
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,200
You think you're the only genius in the world?

108
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
That only you can complete the final experiment?

109
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,260
Let me tell you.

110
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,560
You're wrong.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,080
Behind me

112
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,280
is the world's top team supporting me.

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Your final experiment

114
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,620
has already been completed by me.

115
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Lin Dongfeng.

116
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,840
Finally, there's a day when you have to catch up to me.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,159
Chu Tiankuo.

118
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,300
I'm not underestimating you.

119
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,880
No matter who helps you,

120
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,680
you'll never achieve controlled nuclear fusion.

121
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,240
What if

122
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,480
I have its help?

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,000
Lin Dongfeng.

124
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,340
Don't think I don't know your secret.

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Lin Dongfeng.

126
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
What is this?

127
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,690
Grandpa.

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,610
Why are you here?

129
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,920
We've been looking everywhere for you.

130
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,580
Let's not talk about that now.

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,920
Lin Dongfeng.

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
What secrets does this notebook

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,480
actually contain?

134
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
What else are you hiding from me?

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,049
It's the origin of everything.

136
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,919
What do you mean by 'origin'?

137
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,760
Let me clarify things for Director Yang.

138
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Do you really think Lin Dongfeng

139
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,860
is some once-in-a-lifetime genius?

140
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,370
You've all been fooled.

141
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,000
Everything he has

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,720
comes from this notebook.

143
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,360
When he writes down problems he can't solve in this book,

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,440
the answers just appear out of nowhere.

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,560
I don't know why,

146
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,720
but

147
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,520
it's as if someone is secretly

148
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,720
helping him.

149
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,040
That's how Lin Dongfeng gets his crucial data.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
He's not a genius at all.

151
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
He's nothing but a fraud.

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
I, Chu Tiankuo,

153
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,880
am the genuine

154
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
prodigy.

155
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,320
With this notebook's power,

156
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,220
not just controlled nuclear fusion,

157
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
even space travel

158
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,920
can be achieved instantly.

159
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,240
Lin Dongfeng,

160
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,120
is what he's saying true?

161
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,480
On many crucial issues,

162
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,160
I did rely on hints from the notebook.

163
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,880
Including that question you asked me in the lab last time.

164
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,320
The reason I solved it in one night

165
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,290
was also because of this notebook.

166
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,400
By the way,

167
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,240
there's a set of crucial data.

168
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,760
I've been unable to calculate the result

169
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,290
and was waiting for an expert like you to help.

170
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,160
So you've really encountered a difficult problem.

171
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,760
Should we ask Professor Wu and his team to help?

172
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,540
No need.

173
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll have the results by tomorrow.

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
Tomorrow?

175
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,560
That fast?

176
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,080
Even with Professor Wu's expertise,

177
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,880
I think

178
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,280
it would take at least two weeks to get results.

179
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,010
I'll give it to you first thing tomorrow morning.

180
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
I remember now.

181
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,720
It was that set of data

182
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,560
that even Professor Wu

183
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,040
needed at least half a month

184
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,280
to calculate.

185
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,400
In completing

186
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,400
several key points of the controlled nuclear fusion theory,

187
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,260
without the help of the notebook,

188
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,120
I might have ended up like Professor Wu,

189
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,970
spending my entire life

190
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,620
