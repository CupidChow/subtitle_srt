1
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,220
Come, Xiaolin.

2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,460
Have a seat.

3
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,010
Xiaolin,

4
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
I need to speak with you privately.

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,400
The breakthrough in controlled nuclear fusion

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,239
is not just

7
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,920
a display of your personal scientific achievement,

8
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,120
but also concerns our country

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,720
and the future of our nation.

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,770
Before the experiment officially succeeds,

11
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,940
about today's matter,

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,280
you cannot reveal it to anyone.

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,980
To protect your identity,

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,980
you also cannot

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,220
join any commercial organizations.

16
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,860
I hope you understand.

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,220
Director Yang,

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,920
are you sure

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,570
I can't tell anyone,

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,200
not even a little bit?

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,320
Yes.

22
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:37,039
Oh.

23
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,720
What about my closest ones?

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,850
Not allowed either.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,530
Alright,

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,360
I understand.

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,220
Such big news and I can't tell anyone.

28
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,180
It's going to be hard to keep it in.

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,960
Of course,

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,680
it's not that

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,340
you can't say anything at all.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,280
This is what Professor Wu prepared for you.

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,340
The matters in here

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,680
you are allowed to talk about.

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,360
Professor Wu is really good to me.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,360
You could give me an appointment letter or something.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,240
This is from Professor Wu,

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,680
just written in the hallway,

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
hot off the press.

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Thank you.

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,160
Xiaolin,

42
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,740
I understand how you feel.

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,240
But don't worry.

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,170
As long as you don't break any laws,

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,720
if you have any issues,

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,200
I can personally

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,680
provide assistance.

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,100
You need to understand

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
that the entire country stands behind you.

50
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,880
By the way,

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,620
let me add your contact information.

52
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,360
If needed in the future,

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,820
I'll contact you anytime.

54
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,360
If you have any problems, you can come to me.

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,520
Dongfeng

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,079
My mom said as long as you join Huasheng,

57
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,410
she'll give us a chance.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,840
I'll be there on time tomorrow.

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,170
Why is it out of battery?

60
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,700
You four, come with me now.

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,640
Oh no!

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,060
I forgot about going to Huasheng.

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,600
Wanzi is going to kill me.

64
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,280
What's wrong?

65
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Manager Lin

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
Can I get your contact info?

67
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,760
Is it that difficult?

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
No, no, that's not it.

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,420
I didn't bring my phone today.

70
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,800
Let's not add each other for now.

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,440
I have something urgent to do.

72
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,040
I need to go now.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,640
Well then.

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,520
Let me

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,880
write down a phone number for you.

76
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,610
Remember it.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,930
Team Leader Lin.

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,380
Don't you want your certificate?

79
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,079
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

80
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:52,840
Please try again later.

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,440
Why isn't anyone answering?

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,220
I know how it feels to be betrayed.

83
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,440
Words are useless right now.

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,800
Alcohol

85
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,440
is the best medicine.

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,410
Your mother just called me.

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,339
She wants you to go home early.

88
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,040
She's tough on the outside but soft on the inside.

89
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,560
She's afraid you'll meet the wrong person

90
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,760
and that poor boy will break your heart.

91
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,880
After all,

92
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,140
you two are from completely different social classes.

93
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,159
A wealthy heiress

94
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,680
and a man from humble beginnings

95
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
never ends well.

96
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,040
Wanzhi,

97
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,700
you need to understand

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,450
that love...

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,409
and marriage

100
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:24,760
Wanzhi

101
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Wanzhi

102
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:40,960
Dongfeng

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,770
Dongfeng

104
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,900
The future depends on you.

105
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,280
The student has surpassed the master.

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,560
Good.

107
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,090
Goodbye,

108
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,400
young man.

109
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,120
I have high hopes for you.

110
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,880
The young generation is promising.

111
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,440
Keep up the good work.

112
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,100
Sure thing.

113
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,970
Team Leader Lin,

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,930
you're amazing.

115
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
Professor Wu,

116
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,370
may I borrow your phone?

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
Professor Wu,

118
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,250
can I log into my WeChat?

119
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,120
Sure.

120
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,880
Oh no!

121
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
I need to find her right away.

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,960
Thank you, Professor Wu.

123
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,720
Director Lin,

124
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,240
wait!

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
I have something to-

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,760
I have something too.

127
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,890
You must hear me out.

128
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,080
First,

129
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
I apologize

130
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,240
for my arrogance when I first met you this morning.

131
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,960
I'm truly sorry.

132
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,960
No, please don't.

133
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,480
I never expected that

134
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,360
after studying controlled nuclear fusion my entire life,

135
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,490
it would actually be

136
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,960
someone as young as you

137
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,400
who would achieve the breakthrough so easily.

138
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,200
Professor Wu,

139
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,480
you don't need to do this.

140
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm actually very grateful to you.

141
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,080
If you hadn't come as a judge,

142
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,680
I wouldn't have made it here.

143
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,620
Let me tell you,

144
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,040
with your research achievements,

145
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
you would have come here sooner or later.

146
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,040
It's just...

147
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,840
Professor Wu,

148
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
about this matter,

149
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,920
we can discuss it in detail later.

150
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,080
But I really have an urgent matter now.

151
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,800
I need to go.

152
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
I won't take much of your time.

153
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,880
Just two minutes.

154
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,740
It'll be quick.

155
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,290
Fine.

156
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,220
Actually, I want to...

157
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,040
I want to be your student.

158
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,600
Be my student?

159
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,400
Please don't joke around.

160
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,460
Look at who you are!

161
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,360
In the face of science, everyone is equal.

162
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,890
We must all bow to the truth.

163
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,240
Your research

164
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,530
is the truth of human development!

165
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,720
Professor Wu,

166
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
how old are you

167
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,400
and how old am I?

168
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,800
If this gets out,

169
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,660
I'll get a reputation for not respecting my elders.

170
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,280
If you won't think about yourself,

171
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,840
at least think about me.

172
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,360
I hadn't thought about that.

173
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,000
But

174
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,400
the sea of knowledge is boundless,

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,080
and one should never be ashamed to learn from others.

176
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,880
Professor Wu,

177
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,900
I think this matter

178
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,600
needs careful consideration.

179
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,520
At your age,

180
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,159
you shouldn't act on impulse.

181
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,020
I need to go now.

182
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
I've been thinking about this all day.

183
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,440
I've considered it thoroughly.

184
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,679
Very thoroughly indeed.

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,610
I'm telling you,

186
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,600
aren't scholars supposed to be frail?

187
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,200
How is this old man so strong?

188
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,610
Then this matter

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,770
will be done as you wish.

190
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,760
Master,

191
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,960
please accept

192
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,160
your disciple's bow.

193
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
We don't need all these formalities.

194
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,320
I really have an urgent matter.

195
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,180
I need to go now.

196
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,170
Wanzi's sister.

197
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,880
Let go!

198
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,640
Don't think about those unhappy things.

199
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,280
Let go!

200
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,020
You have your brother Shaocheng now.

201
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,490
If your damn father hadn't rejected my proposal,

202
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,580
you would have been mine already.

203
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,800
Let me go!

204
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,640
These legs,

205
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,160
this figure.

206
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,480
What I want,

207
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
I must have it all.

208
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,560
Let me go!

209
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,200
Let me go!

210
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,240
Let me go!

211
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,000
Let me go!

212
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
Let me go!

213
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,480
Dongfeng.
