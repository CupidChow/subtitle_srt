1
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,680
How is that possible?

2
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,890
You're just a poor student.

3
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,130
Where did you get so much money?

4
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,700
Something's definitely wrong here.

5
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,490
Did Director Yang take bribes?

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Or did you use his name to make money?

7
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,540
This money is suspicious.

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,640
Huasheng won't accept this.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,090
Only you would think such dirty thoughts.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,610
Every penny I've earned

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,400
is completely clean.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,880
Dongfeng.

13
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,640
That's a lot of money.

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,120
Where did you get it from?

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,039
Haven't I been working at Gu's place lately,

16
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,280
doing projects for some tech companies?

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,960
I didn't expect these companies to be so generous.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,600
So you're saying all this money

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
is from that card?

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,760
That's right.

21
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,479
I was shocked when I checked the account today.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,240
Mr. Lin,

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,800
the 83 million in cash

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,160
has been safely delivered.

25
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Do you have any other instructions?

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,860
That's all.

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,039
You can go now.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,680
Yes, sir.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,740
Call me anytime if you need anything.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,650
Gu Bingqing.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,050
Did you secretly embezzle company funds?

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,490
I'll tell Grandfather about this.

33
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,890
He'll throw you out of the family for good.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,199
This money

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
is all legitimate income from Lin Dongfeng's work

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,000
with the tech company.

37
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,000
With Lin Dongfeng's abilities,

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,880
it's not that he needs the tech company,

39
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,640
but the tech company needs him.

40
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,760
Given time,

41
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,780
he might achieve even more than Huasheng Group.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
How impressive.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,400
Today, I've settled the score with the Zheng family,

44
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,329
once and for all.

45
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,000
But your good days are over.

46
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
I will use all of Huasheng Group's resources

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,400
to destroy you.

48
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,100
If any company dares to work with you,

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,690
they'll be making an enemy of the entire Huasheng Group.

50
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,120
Gu Shaocheng, you're going too far!

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,840
You have no right to talk to me like that.

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,600
You and Lin Dongfeng starting your own business

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,040
is the second betrayal to Huasheng.

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,840
It's you who

55
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,080
became blinded by greed

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,010
and forgot your original mission.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
You're not wrong.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,730
They are the ones who are wrong.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,120
Huasheng Group

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,380
was once a great company leading in technology,

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,690
but now it has become a slave to profit.

62
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,600
This kind of Huasheng

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,810
doesn't deserve your attachment.

64
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,130
Everything they've done to you

65
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,860
will be punished accordingly today.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,060
How presumptuous.

67
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,640
Even if you pay off the Zheng family's debt today,

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
in front of Huasheng,

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,440
you're still nothing but slightly larger ants.

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,770
Huasheng can crush you whenever it wants.

71
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,960
Who are you to judge Huasheng?

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,280
Such arrogance.

73
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,840
Ants may be small,

74
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,320
but they can destroy the foundation of a building.

75
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,040
Today I want to see

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,320
if ants can really shake a mighty tree.

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,600
Fine,

78
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,840
no problem.

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,800
You're my master after all.

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,520
Rest assured.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,760
Mr. Kang

82
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,000
is right here with me.

83
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,240
Oh.

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,800
Lin Dongfeng.

85
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,240
About the experiment progress.

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,089
It's a personal matter.

87
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,200
Mr. Kang,

88
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,180
I need to discuss something with you.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,760
Now,

90
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,520
take this money

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
and get out of the Zheng family immediately.

92
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
Otherwise, when you see the news later,

93
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,040
I'm afraid you'll be crying miserably.

94
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,320
Lin Dongfeng,

95
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,720
don't push your luck.

96
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,640
You think I'd believe you just because of a phone call?

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,970
To bring down Huasheng,

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,770
you'd need extraordinary powers.

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,050
You're lucky today.

100
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,700
Next time you come,

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,380
I'm afraid you won't be so fortunate.

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,200
Wanzhi, Mrs. Li,

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,920
are you both alright?

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Bring that good-for-nothing Gu Shaocheng

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,480
to me.

106
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,920
Mr. Wu,

107
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,120
is this what you call

108
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,700
a personal matter?

109
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,840
It has nothing to do with the project.

110
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,100
It is indeed personal.

111
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Something with such a big impact

112
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
and you're being so casual about it.

113
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
Isn't that going too far?

114
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
Lin Dongfeng,

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,159
he's young and doesn't know better,

116
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,400
but at your age,

117
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,440
are you also being reckless?

118
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,580
And you,

119
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,740
my dear Academician Kang,

120
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,360
don't you know Mr. Wu's temperament by now?

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
But instead,

122
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,120
you not only failed to dissuade him

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,650
but became his accomplice.

124
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,780
I mainly just couldn't stand that Gu brat

125
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
one bit.

126
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,920
You two are over 100 years old combined,

127
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,120
can you please give me a break?

128
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,820
Director Yang,

129
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,280
say no more.

130
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,920
I understand.

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,120
You, me, and old Kang,

132
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,400
we all were once Lin Dongfeng's age.

133
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,960
At such a young age,

134
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,680
he's accomplished something extraordinary,

135
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,520
yet we demand he keeps it strictly confidential

136
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,120
and can't say a word about it.

137
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,080
Wouldn't he

138
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
feel frustrated?

139
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,520
We should

140
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,920
understand him.

141
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,760
At my age now,

142
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,960
I don't care about

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,760
what people say anymore.

144
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,480
Lin Dongfeng has been my student.

145
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,400
As long as

146
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,320
it's not illegal or against regulations,

147
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,250
whatever Lin Dongfeng wants to do,

148
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,400
I, Wu Wenyong,

149
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
will stand by him.

150
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,240
Besides,

151
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
Huasheng Group in recent years

152
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,920
has been using our technology and patents

153
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,040
to do many questionable things.

154
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,920
This company seems only interested in making money

155
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
and has forgotten

156
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,900
its original purpose and mission as a tech company.

157
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,360
We old-timers

158
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,900
have long wanted to stop cooperating with Huasheng Group.

159
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,960
Mr. Wu,

160
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,080
you're still in good shape,

161
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,160
not some old-timer at all.

162
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,800
You still need to contribute more to academia.

163
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,300
Let's put this Huasheng Group matter

164
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
to rest.

165
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,140
Don't let it happen again.

166
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,280
That's right,

167
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,840
this is our beloved Director Yang!

168
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,160
But this time,

169
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,080
it seems

170
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,080
that old man Gu has got what's coming to him.

171
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,400
You worthless fool!

172
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,080
All for a woman,

173
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
you've messed with people you shouldn't have.
