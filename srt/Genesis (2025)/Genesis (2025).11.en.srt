1
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,320
Chairman

2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,890
You wanted to see me?

3
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,700
Kneel down.

4
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,760
Do you know why I called you here?

5
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I messed up Mr. Gu's product launch.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,520
He will definitely come to you about it.

7
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,700
Did you just mess up a product launch?

8
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
You've damaged Huasheng's stock price.

9
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,920
You've ruined Huasheng's reputation.

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,880
Chairman

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,170
There are problems with Mr. Gu's technology.

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,400
Can't you just call me Grandpa?

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,039
Chairman,

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,410
Gu Shaocheng's technology

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,500
really has issues.

16
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,520
It seems

17
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,600
you still can't forgive me

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
for driving your mother away back then.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,360
Forget it.

20
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,479
Since

21
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,080
you call me Chairman,

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,009
let's keep this strictly business today.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Do you know

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,200
how much money Huasheng lost

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,840
in just half a day

26
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,680
because of your stubbornness?

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,840
Can't you see that

28
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,040
there's an issue with the source of Gu Shaocheng's technology?

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
A hero's origins don't matter.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,250
As long as it benefits the company.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,600
Some details don't need to be scrutinized.

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,920
It seems you've known all along.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,010
Then why didn't you stop him

34
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,820
instead of continuing to fan the flames?

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,560
Technical infringement is a major taboo in the industry.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,200
If he continues to act recklessly,

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,460
it will destroy Huasheng's foundation.

38
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,680
Do you think Huasheng

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,600
got to where it is today by playing it safe?

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,360
What's not forbidden is permitted.

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,240
Business is about constantly testing

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,320
the boundaries of the law.

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,840
No, it's not.

44
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,770
That's not true.

45
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
You taught us

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,560
that Huasheng's principle is

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,480
truth

48
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,760
never yields to profit.

49
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,440
When the profit is big enough,

50
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,400
profit becomes the truth.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
So you believe

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,280
everything Gu Shaocheng did

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,600
was right?

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,880
Not right,

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,640
but it serves the company's interests.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
If you hadn't ruined this press conference,

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,320
Huasheng's market value would rank among the world's top.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,320
With more capital then,

59
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,800
Huasheng would have more leverage to compete for talent globally.

60
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,120
Only then could we become

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,360
a truly great company that impacts the world.

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,570
Even though you know

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,680
all of this is wrong?

64
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,570
As long as you reach the top,

65
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,240
no one cares about the path you took.

66
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Then how are you

67
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,920
any different from those who use any means to achieve their ends?

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
How dare you!

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,330
Since you can't think clearly,

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,100
take your time to reflect.

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,730
To succeed at Huasheng,

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,680
passion alone is useless.

73
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,720
Starting today,

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,920
don't come to the office anymore.

75
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,839
Your card

76
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,380
will be suspended too.

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,880
When

78
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,200
you figure things out,

79
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,280
come back to me.

80
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,360
Look into it.

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
This Lin Dongfeng,

82
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,520
what exactly is his relationship with Director Yang?

83
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,360
How can he stop the approval with just one phone call?

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
Yes, I'll take care of it right away.

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,320
Also,

86
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,920
we need to put more pressure on the Zheng family.

87
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,840
She may run, but she can't hide.

88
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,040
Zheng Wanzhi,

89
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,760
she will be mine sooner or later.

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,760
Check the energy level before release

91
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,120
and these pre-reaction values

92
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,160
once more.

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,760
Lin.

94
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,680
For the Shanghai Day Project,

95
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,040
we should invite these people as witnesses.

96
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,200
Is that okay?

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,240
Wow!

98
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,120
This is too formal.

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Professor Wu.

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,400
I think this matter

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,860
should just be between us.

102
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,960
No need for an apprenticeship ceremony,

103
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,560
right?

104
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,080
That won't do.

105
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,640
Since I've proposed to be your apprentice,

106
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,000
it should be official.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,960
Perhaps

108
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,400
you think

109
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,960
I'm not qualified to be your student?

110
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,120
No, not at all.

111
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,040
How could that be?

112
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,640
You're a towering figure in academic circles.

113
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,960
Good then.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,680
I'll invite everyone on this list.

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,060
Director Yang,

116
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,200
you're just in time.

117
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,160
Please help me talk some sense into Professor Wu.

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,840
He insists on making me his mentor

119
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,240
and wants to hold some formal ceremony.

120
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,100
This... this isn't appropriate.

121
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,960
Professor Wu,

122
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,560
the budget for this ceremony

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
can't be too modest.

124
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
It won't be.

125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,000
Group Leader Lin,

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
why don't you take me as your student too?

127
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
For the ceremony,

128
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,450
Wu and I will split the bill.

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,200
Sounds good.

130
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,760
Academician Li, Master Kang,

131
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,520
please stop teasing me.

132
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,400
Director Yang,

133
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
please say something to help me.

134
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,960
Professor Wu,

135
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
our work is of a special nature.

136
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
Given the confidentiality requirements,

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,960
let's cancel the ceremony.

138
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,840
Yes,

139
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,530
but we can still do something internally.

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
You can treat everyone to a meal.

141
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,400
It can still serve as a witness too.

142
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,480
Right?

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,800
Fine, let's do what Director Yang says.

144
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,120
You...

145
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,080
Alright, carry on.

146
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Oh, you.

147
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,440
These aren't scientists.

148
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,970
They're just a bunch of old children at heart.

149
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,960
Finally escaped from that crowd of old folks.

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,690
The school still has such a youthful atmosphere.

151
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,800
Wanzhi.

152
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,370
What are you doing here?

153
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,400
I just went to your dorm to find you

154
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,060
but you weren't there.

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,280
It's nothing.

156
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,160
Wanzhi,

157
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,250
do you think you can hide anything from me?

158
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Tell me

159
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,000
what's wrong.

160
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,560
Can you ask Sister Gu about

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,420
the money she promised to lend me?

162
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
My mom called and said

163
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,780
creditors came to our house again to collect debts.

164
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,960
Okay, I'll go right now.

165
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,120
I'll come too.

166
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,880
Alright, let's go.

167
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,360
I'll be straightforward with you.

168
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,760
You promised to help Wanzi pay off her debt.

169
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
When will the money be transferred?

170
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,000
It probably

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,800
won't happen.

172
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,600
Why not?

173
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Because of what happened at the press conference,

174
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
I've been suspended by the company.

175
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,760
My accounts have been frozen too.

176
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,580
I didn't realize it was this serious.

177
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,640
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,480
They're the ones who made the mistake.

179
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,880
Why are you apologizing?

180
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,080
Besides,

181
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,560
I'm not that fragile.

182
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,170
So what are you planning to do next?

183
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,160
I haven't decided yet.

184
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,820
I'll take a few days off first.

185
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,490
About the Zheng family's debt,

186
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,280
I'll find a way to delay it for now.

187
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,200
Some creditors

188
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
will still give me some face.

189
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,080
Wanzhi.

190
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,080
Gu said

191
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,480
the money should arrive in a few days.

192
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,760
Don't worry.

193
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,400
Thank you, Gu.

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't mention it.

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,080
I only agreed because of Lin Dongfeng.

196
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
That's all.

197
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Dongfeng,

198
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,000
go get me a coffee.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,130
I'm dying of thirst.

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,330
Vanilla latte as usual.

201
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,300
Wait for me!

202
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,580
You like Lin Dongfeng too, don't you?

203
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,600
Yes.

204
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,400
If I'm not mistaken,

205
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,320
you and he have officially broken up now.

206
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,280
So me saying this now should be fair competition,

207
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,320
not being a homewrecker, right?

208
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,920
That's right.

209
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,370
I've noticed it for a while.

210
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,370
Since you've been honest about it,

211
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,320
I'm willing to compete with you fairly.

212
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,840
Tell me,

213
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
how do we compete fairly?

214
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,020
I remember you said before

215
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,900
that Dongfeng's talents are very valuable.

216
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,360
Why don't we help Dongfeng make money together

217
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,620
and see who earns more?

218
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,160
I want to show you

219
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,720
who is truly Dongfeng's better half.

220
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
Fine, little sister.

221
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,460
I was thinking the same thing.

222
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,000
But if you lose,

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,680
your dear Dongfeng will be mine.

224
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,560
I won't lose.

225
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,050
You don't know him like I do.

226
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,730
Let's go back to school.

227
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,090
Let's go.

228
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,130
You're here too.

229
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,720
When I don't have classes,

230
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,650
I'm always here.

231
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,120
I think that all this work I do

232
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,720
even if it saves you just a little time,

233
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,050
it's still worthwhile.

234
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,760
Thank you for your hard work.

235
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,810
Well, I am your research assistant after all.

236
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
I'll do it.

237
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,720
By the way,

238
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,280
there's a set of critical data

239
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,610
that I can't figure out.

240
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,860
I've been waiting for an expert like you to help.

241
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,960
No problem.

242
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,280
We've really run into a problem here.

243
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,940
Should we ask Professor Wu and his team for help?

244
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,240
No need. I can have the results by tomorrow.

245
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,000
Tomorrow?

246
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,400
That fast?

247
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,840
Even with Professor Wu's expertise,

248
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,000
I would think

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,600
it would take at least two weeks to get results.

250
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,400
I'll have it for you first thing tomorrow.

251
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,520
Now I need to go back and focus completely.

252
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
See you tomorrow then.

253
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,440
See you tomorrow.

254
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,320
Right on time.

255
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,360
Piece of cake.

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,130
The data is correct.

257
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,600
Lin Dongfeng,

258
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,560
you're amazing!

259
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
It's nothing.

260
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,480
Congratulations.

261
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
It involves classified information.

262
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,920
Let's discuss it at the center.

263
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,450
Let's go.

264
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,160
Professor Wu wants us to go to the research center now.

265
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,960
Okay.

266
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,240
Listen to me.

267
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,320
Don't look around once we're inside.

268
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,280
And don't talk carelessly.

269
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,880
This place contains top-secret information.

270
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,440
[Salutes]

271
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,000
Did you see that?

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm an important figure now.

273
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,340
They all have to salute me.

274
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,800
Wait for me.

275
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,760
Do you know your way around?

276
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,840
This place is huge.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,240
Why does it seem like she's

278
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,440
more familiar with this place than I am?

279
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,520
Mr. Wu.

280
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,800
The data Yang sent,

281
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,960
I've already reviewed it.

282
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,420
It perfectly solves our current key issues.

283
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,700
Professor,

284
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,500
I have a few more data sets here

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,920
that I'd like to verify with you.

286
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,450
Alright.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,280
Regarding the theoretical limit of nuclear fusion,

288
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,140
it's like this.

289
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
Entering the meeting room without knocking

290
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,200
is very rude.

291
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,800
I'll definitely

292
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,500
be more careful next time.

293
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,120
No, what are you talking about?

294
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,920
He is actually

295
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,100
Our team leader Lin is having an important discussion.

296
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,000
Unauthorized personnel please leave.

297
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Don't get me involved when you offend the boss.

298
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,080
I'll just observe from the side.

299
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,440
You all continue your discussion.

300
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,280
No.

301
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,880
Director Yang, please sit here.

302
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,600
No way.

303
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,160
Discussing issues is the job of research staff.

304
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,120
No matter who you are,

305
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,560
you have no right to interfere.

306
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,090
Once we reach a conclusion,

307
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,840
we will report to leadership accordingly.

308
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,040
He is the leadership.

309
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,760
So,

310
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,599
do I really have to leave?

311
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,720
Yes.

312
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,400
You continue your discussion.

313
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
I'll go first.

314
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,500
Director Yang,

315
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,960
got put in his place, huh?

316
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,810
Let's continue.

317
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,540
She's really impressive.

318
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,320
This place is too remote.

319
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
We can't even get a taxi here.

320
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,080
Let's scan a bike and ride back to school.

321
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,040
You go back first.

322
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,880
I have something to do.

323
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,280
I'm not going back to school yet.

324
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,960
Okay then.

325
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,680
See you later.
