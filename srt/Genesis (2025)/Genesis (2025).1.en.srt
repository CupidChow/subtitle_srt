1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,840
Lin Dong Feng.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,380
He is 22 years old. He is

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,210
I'm a genius.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,280
I've reached the current physical limit.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,690
I was about to complete the controllable nuclear mutation.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,320
But unexpectedly,

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,680
died before success.

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,000
You all see it now, right?

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,360
The government spent billions of dollars

10
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,480
to build

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,760
the best nuclear assembly lab in the world.

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
The online comments

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,400
Find him by any means.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,800
Bring him here.

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,960
to have a look.

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
It's open.

17
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,960
If we use the theory and data to reverse it,

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,400
many problems

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,160
will be solved.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,680
Yes.

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,680
This...

22
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,600
How is that possible?

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,360
My research for decades

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
my research for decades.

25
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,840
Kang,

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,120
You are an expert in nuclear physics.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
You should know

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,680
the content of this comment

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
It's about

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,120
controlling nuclear mutation.

31
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,760
If

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,880
the data model is correct,

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,040
will be enough to change

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,360
the human history process.

35
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,680
Mr. Yang.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
He's a talent.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,560
We must find a way

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
to find this person.

39
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,970
Captain Cao.

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,320
Go back to China now.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,730
to find someone.

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
The kid who plays with his phone.

43
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,120
Stand up!

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,280
You didn't listen to me in class.

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,410
Did you learn it all?

46
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,440
Explain it to me.

47
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,300
the principle of these formulas.

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,600
East Wind.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,680
East Wind!

50
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,560
East Wind.

51
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,840
No.

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
Your parents

53
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,320
to support you to go to college.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
to play with your phones in class.

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,760
You don't have to listen if you don't want to.

56
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,360
All you do is play with your phone.

57
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,080
What are you

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,140
to society?

59
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
A student like you

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,440
shouldn't go to college.

61
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,010
It's better to sell talent online.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
Singing and dancing

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
When the most popular

64
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,720
is called

65
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,440
It's called the Online Wind. It's called the Online Wind. It's called the Online Wind.

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,560
Hello. Hello.

67
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,079
I’m fine.

68
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,000
You can't graduate if you skip class again.

69
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,520
It's okay.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,360
It's fine if you don't attend such a level class.

71
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,490
If you want to learn,

72
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,340
I'll teach you when I get back.

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,520
Stop!

74
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,440
Lin Dong Feng, right?

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,320
You sleep in class every day.

76
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,840
You don't hand in your homework.

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,240
You overestimated yourself to teach others.

78
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
Do you know what classic physics is?

79
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,760
Do you know what Einstein is?

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920
Lin Dongfeng.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,340
What are you doing?

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Sir.

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,360
I learned

84
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
I learned it in my third year.

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,520
And there are many theoretical mistakes.

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
To me,

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,240
is as good as waste paper.

88
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,280
[This is ridiculous.]

89
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,480
This textbook

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
is made by my mentor,

91
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,800
the editor-in-chief.

92
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,690
You've only been in school for a few years.

93
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,760
How dare you question the authority of a doctor?

94
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Sir.

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Power

96
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,290
doesn't mean the truth.

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
Newton, Einstein, Planck,

98
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
These physicists

99
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,080
broke the authority of physics

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,920
to develop physics.

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,900
Look how arrogant you are.

102
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,320
I want to see

103
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,280
what's wrong

104
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
What's wrong?

105
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,300
If you can't say anything,

106
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,450
don't blame me for failing you.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,480
East.

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Sure.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,320
That's what you said.

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,480
about nuclear mutation.

111
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,560
I think Dr Kang's previous understanding

112
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,920
was wrong.

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
Next,

114
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,840
is my theoretical guidance process.

115
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Kang.

116
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,680
Jiangbei University has a scientific research competition tomorrow.

117
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,000
I want to go.

118
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,080
I have a meeting tomorrow.

119
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,409
Tell Editor Yang for me.

120
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,920
I'm not going.

121
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,600
Okay.

122
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,780
These days,

123
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,159
for the past few days.

124
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,000
It's all because of the online comments.

125
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
But until now,

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,880
I still haven't found him.

127
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Nonsense.

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,320
Look at these formulas.

129
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
The numbers are confused.

130
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,560
It doesn't make sense.

131
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,640
And the theory

132
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
controlling nuclear mutation.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
That's nonsense.

134
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,880
This is the best scientific research team

135
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
in the world.

136
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,640
for decades.

137
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,840
for decades.

138
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
What do you know as a undergraduate?

139
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,010
Study hard if you're ignorant.

140
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,720
If you admit your mistake now,

141
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,520
sit down and listen to the class.

142
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,240
As for me,

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,050
let bygones be bygones.

144
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
Why did you fail the exam?

145
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,560
Forget it then.

146
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,360
Sir.

147
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,360
I think I’m right.

148
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,440
East Wind.

149
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,159
Stop arguing with the teacher.

150
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,480
Apologize to him.

151
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,120
That's right.

152
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
It's because he can't understand it.

153
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,060
Why should I admit my mistake?

154
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,400
Ridiculous.

155
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,560
Class is over.

156
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
East Wind.

157
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,720
I’m sorry.

158
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,980
I got you into trouble.

159
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,400
It's okay.

160
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,840
As long as I can pass the exam,

161
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,240
I'll see how he hung up on me.

162
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,960
Let’s go.

163
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,320
East Wind.

164
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,280
I’ll show you something later.

165
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,040
What is it?

166
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You'll know soon.

167
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,160
Hurry up.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
Young Lady.

169
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,080
That's right.

170
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,080
It's him.

171
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,040
Okay.

172
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,360
Open your eyes.

173
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320
This is the latest watch.

174
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
It costs 10,000 yuan, right?

175
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,000
I know you always want it.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,520
You did well today.

177
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
as a reward.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,640
I love you so much, Wanwan.

179
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Give me a kiss.

180
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,440
Don't do this.

181
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,400
No!

182
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,140
Be careful.

183
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,159
Isn't that Lin Dong Feng?

184
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:46,800
What are you doing?

185
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Go take a look.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,240
What's wrong with you?

187
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,480
Why are you driving so fast at school?

188
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,810
What if you hit someone?

189
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,240
You are Lin Dongfeng?

190
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,760
I'm the CEO of Huasheng Technology.

191
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,560
Gu Bingqing.

192
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
I've been following you online for a long time.

193
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,320
I've seen all your comments and comments.

194
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,650
It's very foresighted.

195
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,760
This is the invitation

196
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,240
of Huasheng Group.

197
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,520
There are detailed assessments and contents.

198
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,320
If you can win,

199
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,720
I can provide you a job that earns millions a year.

200
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,240
Huasheng Group?

201
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,160
And

202
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,490
in the name of the group.

203
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:28,800
Huasheng Group

204
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,200
I recommend you to study at Ma Sheng Technology.

205
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Think about it.

206
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,280
Mary Science.

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,840
Is he the number one in the world?

208
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,600
Lin Dong Feng.

209
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,880
You're rich.

210
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,919
I knew it.

211
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,799
the man I like must be excellent.

212
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,400
The assessment content and material are related.

213
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm not interested

214
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,450
in your work.

215
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,330
I still want to focus on my studies.

216
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,140
Thank you for the invitation.

217
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,000
East Wind.

218
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,920
We did background research on you.

219
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,880
Although your grades are average,

220
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,200
you got full marks in math and physics in the college entrance exam.

221
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,520
You are a genius.

222
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,540
And a genius

223
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,850
will only bloom in a suitable soil.

224
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,240
Obviously,

225
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,560
Gangbuk University.

226
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,040
This ordinary university

227
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,440
is not a place for you.

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
I think it suits me.

229
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,960
Besides,

230
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,160
studying abroad

231
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
to study abroad.

232
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,000
I have something more important to do.

233
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Here.

234
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,220
You don't have to make a decision.

235
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,540
I'll give you one night to think about it.

236
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Little boy,

237
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,680
The future is in your hands.

238
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,560
Think about it carefully.

239
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,080
Let’s go.

240
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,560
East Wind.

241
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
I think she’s right.

242
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,680
Only in a better school

243
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,840
in a better school.

244
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,880
If I study abroad,

245
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,120
if I go abroad.

246
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,050
Are you willing to leave me?

247
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
Anyway,

248
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,600
this is a good chance.

249
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,480
By the way,

250
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,680
it's my mom's birthday tonight.

251
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,880
Go to my house to see my mom.

252
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,480
Get ready.

253
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,240
Go to your house.

254
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,560
and your mother.

255
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
This is Lin Dong Feng.

256
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,720
My boyfriend.

257
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
Hello, aunt.

258
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,120
I'm Lin Dong Feng.

259
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,380
Have a seat.

260
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,080
Have a seat.

261
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Go play.

262
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:52,820
Auntie.

263
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,200
I came in a hurry.

264
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,480
I didn't prepare much.

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,920
I heard from Wanzhi

266
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,120
you like tea.

267
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,000
This is the best tea

268
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,040
for many stores.

269
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,360
Thank you, Lin.

270
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,160
Thank you.

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,400
Auntie Zhang, take this.

272
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,360
Okay.

273
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,240
Serve tea

274
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,880
Yes, madam.

275
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,080
Madam.

276
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Dinner is ready.

277
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,160
Thank you.

278
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,840
Rude

279
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't you know the seat of guests?

280
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,640
Sorry, madam.

281
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Mr. Lin.

282
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
This way, please.

283
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,880
Thank you.

284
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,200
Thank you for the meal, Lin.

285
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Today’s dishes are simple.

286
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Try it later.

287
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,880
Thank you.

288
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,440
It’s done. It’s done.

289
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,480
Lin,

290
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,280
What do your parents do?

291
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,200
My parents don't do business.

292
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,560
My family is just a normal salary class.

293
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,160
How old are your parents now?

294
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,680
at your age?

295
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,340
Is it a department or a department

296
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,080
Which department do you work in?

297
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,240
My dad is just a minor officer.

298
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,160
My mom has been a housewife for a long time.

299
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:39,960
She has no job.

300
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,120
Where do you live now?

301
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,600
Hongfu Road.

302
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,480
Hongfu Road?

303
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,320
It seems that Auntie Zhang's house used to live there.

304
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,280
Maybe you met before.

305
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,640
I haven't been there for decades.

306
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,980
I'm not familiar with that place.

307
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,880
By the way,

308
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,000
Meijuan went back to her hometown last month, right?

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,080
Yes, madam.

310
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,380
Your mom happens to have time at home.

311
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,200
Do you want to do housework here?

312
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,080
Aunt Zhang can't handle it alone.

313
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,980
How about this?

314
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,680
I'll pay her at the highest price in the market.

315
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,680
When Aunt Zhang worked,

316
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,320
her monthly salary

317
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,520
is not as much as I earn a day.

318
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,040
Right?

319
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,080
Yes.

320
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,680
My wife has been very nice to me.

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,760
Enough!

322
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,240
It’s his first time here.

323
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,640
Don’t make it hard for him.

324
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,640
Besides,

325
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,920
it's inappropriate

326
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,780
to ask her that.

327
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,920
East Wind.

328
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,890
My mom is straightforward.

329
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
but she doesn't mean anything else.

330
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,740
Don’t take it to heart.

331
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,720
I’m sorry, Lin.

332
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,840
After her father passed away,

333
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,880
Wanzhi went to college.

334
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,760
It's so quiet at home.

335
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,800
I thought I could have a peer at home

336
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
at home.

337
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Forget it if it's inconvenient.

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,720
It's okay.

339
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,400
I have something to tell you

340
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,680
to tell you and Wanzhi.

341
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,810
I've been with Wanzhi for three years.

342
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,160
I really love her.

343
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,860
Although I'm still a student,

344
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,840
I have confidence in my ability.

345
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,280
I can make Wanzhi happy.

346
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
Although Dongfeng Family

347
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,880
is not as good as our family,

348
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,760
But as the saying goes,

349
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,610
Don't bully the poor young.

350
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Besides,

351
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
East Wind

352
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,880
received an invitation from Huasheng Group.

353
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,280
As long as he can pass the competition tomorrow,

354
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,800
he can join Huasheng.

355
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:56,960
By then,

356
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,640
Lin.

357
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,160
Since you are an elder,

358
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,840
you should say something.

359
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,840
It's good for young people to be ambitious.

360
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,840
But at your age with Wanzhi,

361
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,640
many things are still immature.

362
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,880
You are going to graduate soon.

363
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,800
You should focus on your studies now.

364
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,210
As for Wanzhi's future,

365
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,770
about Wanzhi's future.

366
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,680
I’ll arrange her happiness.

367
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
Lin,

368
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,720
There are many things

369
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,040
can't be achieved just by working hard.

370
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,160
If you have any difficulties in life,

371
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,890
just tell me.

372
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,300
It's getting late.

373
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,640
I won't keep you.

374
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,360
Mrs. Zhang.

375
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,620
Bring some good tea leaves to Lin.

376
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,330
and send him back to school.

377
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,120
Okay, madam.

378
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,040
Don't bother.

379
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,600
I can take the bus.

380
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,280
I almost forgot.

381
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,060
There is a bus stop at the door.

382
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Okay, Lin.

383
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,080
I won’t see you off.

384
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,280
Let me see you off.

385
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,360
Sit down.

386
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,760
Too bad.

387
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,080
Can you play?

388
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,480
East Wind.

389
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,000
My mom said as long as you join Huasheng,

390
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,520
you'll give us a chance.

391
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,320
I know you don't like the company environment.

392
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,000
Just do it for me.

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,480
for me.

394
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,600
Okay?

395
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,010
I'll be there on time tomorrow.

396
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,130
Don't worry.

397
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,560
I will make you happy.

398
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,890
Then go to bed early.

399
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,359
Mom and I will cheer for you tomorrow.

400
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,020
Good night.

401
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,599
I'll delete the post if you can't convince me.

402
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,599
Civil Affairs Department.

403
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:28,160
I can't afford it.

404
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,960
Forget it.

405
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,340
Just prepare for Hwaseong's tryout.

406
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,610
Did you receive the documents?

407
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
The importance of this mission

408
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
is very important.

409
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,080
You can only succeed.

410
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,000
Failure is not allowed.

411
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,920
Please rest assured.

412
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
We will do our best to cooperate.

413
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,360
Leaders work

414
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,000
Even if you have to dig three feet,

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,130
to find this person.

416
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,050
Chief, this way please.

417
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,360
Coming.

418
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,080
Professor Oh.

419
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
Hello.

420
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,760
Nice to meet you.

421
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,800
Thank you, Professor Oh.

422
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,160
It's a great honor

423
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,520
to be the judge.

424
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,000
In order not to lose talents,

425
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,640
while I'm still healthy,

426
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,880
I'd like to run more.

427
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,080
Professor Wu, please.

428
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,680
Please.

429
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,880
My genius.

430
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,820
It's another night of forgetting sleep.

431
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,640
Thank you.

432
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,380
Why is the battery out?

433
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,440
You four come with me.

434
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,120
What are you waiting for?

435
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,080
Move.

436
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:56,920
Wei.

437
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,320
What brings you here so early in the morning?

438
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,600
I want you to participate in a competition.

439
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,640
Make up the number.

440
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,240
Come to the office now.

441
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,520
Sir.

442
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
Can I not go?

443
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,560
I have to go out this afternoon.

444
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,840
This kind of competition is just a formality.

445
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,040
It's too easy for you.

446
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,240
It won't take long.

447
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,440
Let's go.

448
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,050
Let's go.

449
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,760
Let's go.

450
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,520
It has a wide and deep impact.

451
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Isn't this

452
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,290
Professor Oh Mun-yong?

453
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,080
Why is he at Gangbuk University?
