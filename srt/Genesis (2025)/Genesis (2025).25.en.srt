1
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,320
It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand. It's in my hand.

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,160
Without it,

3
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,640
you're useless.

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,240
Really?

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,210
I'll give it to you then.

6
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
What did you say?

7
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,780
I'll give it to you.

8
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,820
I don't need it anyway.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,080
You said that.

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,840
Don't regret it.

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
When you understand,

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,000
you can only rely on yourself.

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,520
You won't need it either.

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,680
Sir.

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,280
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
I'm late.

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,280
Get him.

18
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
Ms. Yang! Jung-joo!

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,840
Are you okay?

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,920
We're fine.

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,640
Lin Dong Feng!

22
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,320
saved the whole city.

23
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,220
What should we do with him?

24
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,770
Take him away first.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,570
The law will punish him.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
Take those

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,759
who just escaped

28
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,760
who just escaped.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,720
Take him away.

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,120
Lin Dong Feng.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,480
Just you wait.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,400
One day,

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,039
I will become famous one day.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,479
One day?

35
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,240
Next life.

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Are you okay? Yes.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm fine.

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,120
Just a scratch.

39
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:20,280
Hey.

40
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,079
Do you know how dangerous it was?

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,720
Do you know how worried we were?

42
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,680
She's right.

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Do you know how dangerous it was?

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Wanzhi! Wanzhi!

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,840
Get out of my way!

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,480
I won't allow you to bully my boyfriend.

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,440
Alright.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,160
This is no time to mess around.

49
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,160
Their device

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,200
It's a complete failure.

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,840
Exactly.

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,760
It's almost ammonia.

53
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,420
Can the nuclear mutation still be possible?

54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,120
Without the help of that mysterious notebook,

55
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,880
can we still complete

56
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,440
of controlling nuclear mutation?

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,240
It's a great dream

58
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,160
It's a great dream of humans.

59
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,380
I can't surpass myself with any external power.

60
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm confident

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,920
to complete the final experiment within specified time.

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,000
and let our country

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
Ultimate Energy Age!

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,740
Good. Good.

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,720
Well said.

66
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:17,760
Editor Yang.

67
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,880
Our men are here.

68
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,600
The evidence that they stole national secrets has been fixed.

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,480
Gu Yongbang, Gu Shaocheng, Smith,

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,340
We've confirmed their location.

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,840
Let's go.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Go! Go! Go! Go!

73
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,440
Go! Go!

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,480
Master.

75
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,720
The nuclear assembly is about to come true.

76
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,640
You should think about your marriage.

77
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,840
Professor Oh.

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,560
This is not a joke.

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,440
It's serious.

80
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm waiting for you

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,060
a younger brother.

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,720
Please forgive me.

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,850
To be honest,

84
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,680
Who will you choose

85
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
Who will you choose?

86
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,280
I haven't thought about that yet.

87
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,080
In terms of sacrifice,

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,210
Gu Bingqing sacrificed the most for his righteousness.

89
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,920
In terms of family background,

90
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,780
[Jing Shu is the best in the family.] [In terms of family background,]

91
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,640
In terms of relationship,

92
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,640
you and Zheng Wanzhi are the closest.

93
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,320
These three girls

94
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
are neck and neck.

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,159
Actually,

96
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
you don't have to choose.

97
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,200
No.

98
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,920
What are you doing?

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,520
Mr Wu.

100
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,800
Legal society.

101
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,360
You're too old-fashioned.

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm telling you not to make a choice.

103
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,300
Follow your heart.

104
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
Waiting for time

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
What are you thinking about?

106
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,280
Actually,

107
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,920
I think so too.

108
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm happy.

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Everyone gathered here

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
and witness

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Now, let's go. Let's go.

112
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,520
Next,

113
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,600
Let's welcome

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
controlling nuclear mutation technology.

115
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
It's them.

116
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,880
who made a breakthrough

117
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,159
to make a breakthrough.

118
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,560
and let Aoran lead the world.

119
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,280
With the approval of superiors,

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,040
Lin Dongfeng’s research team

121
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,800
of Lin Dongfeng.

122
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,040
Lin Dongfeng.

123
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,280
It's time for you to dream.

124
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,460
Say something.

125
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
Wang Dongchuan.

126
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,420
Dongchuan.

127
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,560
Mr. Yang said

128
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
to say something.

129
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,560
Let me say something.

130
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,240
say something sincere.

131
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,760
Actually,

132
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,360
I think this day

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
for a long time.

134
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,600
Since the first time

135
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,260
the formula of controllable nuclear mutation,

136
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,800
I thought one day

137
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200
and become famous.

138
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,520
You can have both fame and fortune. And you can have both fame and fortune.

139
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
But later,

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
I gradually changed.

141
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
I saw it.

142
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,920
Professor Oh's efforts.

143
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,440
I saw

144
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,080
I saw it.

145
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,210
Doctor Kang's reluctant day and night

146
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,800
Aoran is ahead of

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,440
Aoran takes the lead. I also saw Editor Yang and too many comrades.

148
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
I also saw that Mr. Yang and many comrades

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Aoran is ahead.

150
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,320
You're right. You're right.

151
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,240
for this.

152
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:08,320
and

153
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,600
I know.

154
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,960
it's definitely not my own success.

155
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
Not really.

156
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,240
Wang Dongchuan,

157
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:18,520
[I'm not the only one who can rely on you.] [I'm the only one who can help you.]

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,640
will succeed.

159
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,200
Here,

160
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,680
I just want to

161
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,360
who have worked hard

162
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,960
who have worked hard

163
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
Say thank you.

164
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,559
Special honor group.

165
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,730
Wang Dongchuan.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,720
I'm lucky

167
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,280
I didn’t let you down.

168
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,640
Here,

169
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,040
I have an announcement.

170
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,360
That is Huasheng Group.

171
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,700
is officially named Dongfeng Group.

172
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
We will devote ourselves to developing

173
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,800
to control nuclear mutants.

174
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,140
In many fields like transportation agricultural education,

175
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,840
in many fields.

176
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,720
and let more people know

177
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,000
the benefit of technology progress.

178
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,000
Special honor group.

179
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,850
You have entered the charger stake. Start charging.

180
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,840
Thank you for the charging.

181
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,080
[0.1 won has been paid.]

182
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,040
The artificial sun is on. Enter acceleration growth mode.

183
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,560
After the controllable nuclear assembly,

184
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,680
electricity is almost limited.

185
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,160
Now all industries

186
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,440
are enjoying the benefits from cheap energy.

187
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,720
You're a superstar of all mankind now.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,260
What's your next plan?

189
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,040
Actually,

190
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,640
it can do more than that.

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
For example?

192
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,930
For example,

193
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,640
