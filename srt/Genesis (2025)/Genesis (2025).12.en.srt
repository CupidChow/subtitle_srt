1
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,520
Mr. Gu, come dance!

2
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Mr. Gu!

3
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,000
Come on!

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,320
Who wants to?

5
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,640
Come on!

6
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,880
Mr. Gu!

7
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,560
Mr. Gu!

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,920
Mr. Gu!

9
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,400
Mr. Gu!

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,520
I found it.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,130
I've got information about Lin Dongfeng.

12
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,840
After extensive investigation,

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,240
Lin Dongfeng and Director Yang have no substantial connection.

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,170
They're probably not acquainted.

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
Then how could he

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,080
stop the approval with just one phone call?

17
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,960
Although Lin Dongfeng has no direct contact with Director Yang,

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,020
he seems to be quite close to Director Yang's daughter.

19
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,960
Perhaps because of this relationship,

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,890
Director Yang is particularly concerned about him.

21
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,840
Women again.

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,520
This guy stole Wanzhi's sister from me,

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,160
helped Gu Bingqing against me,

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,640
and now Director Yang's daughter too.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,440
Lin Dongfeng,

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,760
you really know how to live off women, don't you?

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,800
However,

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,040
if he's just a man living off powerful women,

29
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,820
he'll be easy to deal with.

30
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,610
Pass down the order.

31
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,370
Proceed as planned.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,720
I'll make him understand

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,130
what happens when someone offends me, Gu Shaocheng,

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,290
and what the consequences will be.

35
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,680
Wanzhi

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,400
You're back.

37
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,880
Come with me quickly.

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,400
Where to?

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,480
You'll see when we get there.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,010
Let's go.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,400
This is the exclusive streaming room I invested heavily to create for you.

42
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,120
From now on,

43
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
you'll be responsible for

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
solving math problems online here.

45
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,240
We're creating a new lane in the streaming world.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,360
I've already come up with a slogan.

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,120
It's

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,520
'Genius, genius, challenge if you dare!'

49
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,079
Are you kidding me?

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,960
Me,

51
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,960
streaming?

52
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,280
Why did you suddenly come up with this idea?

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,280
Don't worry about that.

54
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,920
Anyway, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday,

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,480
you'll need to come here to stream.

56
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm going to start pushing you to make money now!

57
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,920
What?

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,880
Monday, Wednesday, Friday?

59
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,240
What about Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday?

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,720
Those days...

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,130
Stop asking so many questions.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,570
Hurry up, the stream is about to start.

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,170
Give me your bag.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,120
Hurry up!

65
00:03:59,079 --> 00:03:59,960
It wasn't me.

66
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,640
Three, two, one, we're live!

67
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,240
Boring.

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,920
What should I say?

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,960
But there's nobody watching.

70
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,960
Don't worry,

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,820
I've already paid for promotion.

72
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,610
You have to pay for that too?

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,320
1+1 equals 3.

74
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,840
Watch your attitude.

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,720
Which elementary school kid is this?

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,360
Do your own homework.

77
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
So many.

78
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,280
It's done.

79
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,520
Just keep streaming like this.

80
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,920
I definitely won't lose.

81
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Lose what?

82
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,280
Wanzhi,

83
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,340
are debt collectors after you again?

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Didn't Sister Gu promise to lend me some money?

85
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,220
I'll pay back some of it when I can.

86
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
You don't need to worry about money.

87
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,080
That's not the reason.

88
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,080
Just focus on your streaming for now.

89
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,140
You'll understand later.

90
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,800
Lin Dongfeng.

91
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,480
Come to my place at 8 tomorrow morning.

92
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,120
I have something important to tell you.

93
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,560
Wait.

94
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,720
What are those two up to?

95
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Um...

96
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,160
Miss Gu,

97
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,760
maybe I should come back after you get dressed.

98
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,160
Lin Dongfeng,

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
today you're mine.

100
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,000
No,

101
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,320
Miss Gu.

102
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,240
Isn't what we're doing wrong?

103
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,760
How can we face Wanzhi like this?

104
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
What are you thinking about?

105
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,330
What is this?

106
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,040
According to my agreement with Miss Zheng Wanzhi,

107
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,760
you'll livestream at her place on odd-numbered days,

108
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,090
and work at my home on even-numbered days.

109
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,640
I've arranged projects from major tech companies for you.

110
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,400
You just need to calculate the data they require.

111
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,480
The compensation is very generous.

112
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,010
This pays much more than your livestreaming.

113
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
Besides, don't you want to help your girlfriend pay off her debt?

114
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,300
That's your workstation.

115
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,210
I knew you two were up to something these days.

116
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,080
What kind of bet did you guys make anyway?

117
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,010
Even if you wanted me to make money,

118
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,640
shouldn't you have discussed it with me first?

119
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,679
And it's just you and me at your place.

120
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,480
What if Wanzhi misunderstands?

121
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,039
That camera is connected to Zheng Wanzhi's phone.

122
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,840
Every move you make at your workstation,

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,000
she can see anytime.

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080
Wait,

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
that's allowed?

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,080
This is a total violation of human rights.

127
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,480
If you're not satisfied,

128
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,520
you can leave anytime.

129
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,280
Alright.

130
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,080
Then I'll tell Zheng Wanzhi

131
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,480
that Lin Dongfeng can livestream on even-numbered days.

132
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,840
I'll stay here then.

133
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,600
After all, I'm really not good at livestreaming.

134
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,060
I've assigned you some system design tasks.

135
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,840
You'll see them when you open the computer.

136
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,320
Get to work.

137
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,920
All right.

138
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,040
Wanzi.

139
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,480
I protest.

140
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,560
What's wrong?

141
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,120
I can't work properly when you're like this.

142
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,360
What's wrong?

143
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,280
Is your big sister too tempting?

144
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,540
Anyway, I can't work well with you like this.

145
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
This is my home.

146
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,720
I can do whatever I want.

147
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,380
I can wear whatever I want.

148
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,480
You have no right to interfere.

149
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,280
Besides,

150
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,520
if you have so little self-control,

151
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,920
you might as well give in to your big sister.

152
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
The camera is recording.

153
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,700
Wanzi can see everything.

154
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,680
The camera can only see the workstation

155
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,480
but not me.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
Besides,

157
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,960
a man and woman alone together is like dry wood near fire.

158
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,920
It's only natural if something happens between us.

159
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,420
Don't look at impropriety. Don't look at impropriety.

160
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,770
Let's look at this problem.

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
Suppose Group A has x people,

162
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
then Group B has 85-x people.

163
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,620
Thanks to the boss for the rocket!

164
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,360
Wipe it clean.

165
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,560
What?

166
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,040
Making me dance?

167
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
Even if you send 100 rocket gifts, it's not happening.

168
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I'm an educational streamer, okay?

169
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,280
Wow!

170
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,160
5,000!

171
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
All the money you earned this month is in here.

172
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
Take it.

173
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
The password is your birthday.

174
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,680
You finally paid me my salary.

175
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,500
You didn't withhold any of my earnings, did you?

176
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
This is what you earned with your talent.

177
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,840
I wouldn't take any of it.

178
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,900
I don't even know how much is in there.

179
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,480
I just had all the companies deposit the money into this card.

180
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:48,840
Besides,

181
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
what I want

182
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,120
is you.

183
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,810
Alright,

184
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
I'll stop teasing you.

185
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
Let's go check at the bank

186
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,620
to see how much money you made this month.

187
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,360
Hello, I'd like to check the balance on this card.

188
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,220
Go get a number.

189
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
You need to get in line first.

190
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,320
Password.

191
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,920
Password.

192
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,640
What's wrong?

193
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,440
Is there no money in the account?

194
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,240
Manager, something incredible has happened.

195
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,370
We have a VIP client.

196
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,560
Is the coffee to your liking?

197
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,290
We also have premium Longjing tea from West Lake.

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,960
No need for tea.

199
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,500
The coffee is fine.

200
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
Our bank has been operating in Jiangbei for many years,

201
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,360
but this is the first time we've had such a distinguished guest as yourself.

202
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm truly honored.

203
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,360
Please forgive any shortcomings in our hospitality.

204
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:22,960
Actually,

205
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,200
Manager,

206
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,320
I came here

207
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,840
just to check how much money is in my card.

208
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,410
Is there 10,000?

209
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,440
Mr. Lin,

210
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
please don't joke around.

211
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,120
10,000 is nothing to someone like you.

212
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,580
Then how much is it?

213
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,280
100,000?

214
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,880
It can't be several hundred thousand, right?

215
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,000
Mr. Lin, please stop teasing us.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,040
Please stop beating around the bush.

217
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,520
Just tell me exactly how much money there is.

218
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,200
Okay.

219
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,560
Mr. Lin, please calm down.

220
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,560
Please calm down.

221
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,220
Let's check Mr. Lin's asset balance.

222
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,400
Mr. Lin,

223
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,800
your account balance is

224
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,640
167,524,832

225
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,240
yuan and 56.6 cents.

226
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,690
Get Mr. Lin another cup.

227
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,520
This coffee must taste terrible.

228
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,680
I'm really sorry about that.

229
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,280
We'll remake it for you right away.

230
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,000
Wait.

231
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,600
What did you say

232
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,680
about the price?
