1
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,040
Director Yang,

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,720
it's me,

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,520
Lin Dongfeng.

4
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,000
I suspect

5
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,600
there are issues with Huasheng Group's chip technology,

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,560
involving serious intellectual property infringement.

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,440
I request

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,640
to immediately terminate the approval process.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,320
I've sent the evidence to your email.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,760
I've received it.

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,360
The documents look fine.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,520
You'll have a decision

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
within 5 minutes.

14
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,200
Okay.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,140
Thank you, Director Yang.

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,640
You just contacted Director Yang from the Science and Technology Department.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,840
You'll have results in five minutes.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,240
Kid,

19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:19,080
if you're going to pretend, at least make it believable.

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,410
Calling Director Yang?

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,380
And getting results in five minutes?

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,240
Do you know how high-ranking Director Yang is?

23
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,720
You can only see him on TV.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,520
You'd never meet him in person.

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,760
Exactly.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,960
Even Mr. Gu senior

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,560
would find it difficult to meet Director Yang.

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,440
If you can call Director Yang,

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,720
then I must be

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,180
the Jade Emperor himself.

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,600
Hey, you there,

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
on the big screen,

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,820
give me a five-minute countdown.

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,259
Go ahead and laugh.

35
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,120
I hope later

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,520
you'll still be laughing this happily.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
Since you're being so stubborn,

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,729
I'll give you five minutes.

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,199
In five minutes,

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,040
I will take the stage with both chairmen

41
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,680
to announce the new technology to the world.

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,760
At that time,

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,440
I will definitely have my lawyers sue you for defamation.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Let everyone see

45
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
just how ridiculous and laughable you are.

46
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,760
Hello.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,200
This is

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,520
Yang Zhengdao from the Technology Department.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,579
Listen carefully.

50
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,960
I don't care what instructions Chairman Tang gave you.

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,400
If you dare to give Huasheng Group

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,160
a green light for their allegedly plagiarized technology,

53
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,320
you will bring everyone on your team tomorrow

54
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,680
with resignation letters to see me.

55
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
Only one minute left.

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,600
If you kneel down and beg for mercy now,

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
for Wanzhi's sake,

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,040
I might still spare you.

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,120
I was enjoying the mountain view from the tower,

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,920
when I heard commotion outside the city.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,360
Time's up.

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,880
Chairmen,

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
let's go on stage.

64
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,450
Alright.

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,280
Did I trust him wrongly?

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:09,730
What?

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,440
Fine.

68
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,680
Yes.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,560
What's wrong?

70
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,959
The approval was rejected.

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,200
The new technology launch has been suspended.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,560
Chairman Tang,

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,400
we're about to go on stage.

74
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,860
Please don't joke around.

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,200
It's true.

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,650
That's impossible.

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,180
You both told me...

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,720
Today's plan will go without a hitch.

79
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
Mr. Gu.

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,120
This is what the higher-ups want.

81
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,640
We have no choice.

82
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
We hope you

83
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,370
can understand our situation.

84
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,640
When you made your promises,

85
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,880
you all beat your chests saying nothing would go wrong.

86
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,600
Now that there's trouble, you want to abandon ship

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,000
and ask me to understand?

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,640
No way.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,920
This stage today,

90
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,640
you're going up whether you like it or not.

91
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,440
You have no choice.

92
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440
No, no, no.

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,930
How dare you!

94
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:54,960
Gu Shaocheng,

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,850
I've been too lenient with you.

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,280
If it weren't for your grandfather's sake,

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
who do you think you are

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,210
to negotiate terms with us?

99
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,160
You really think you're something special.

100
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
You're just a board director.

101
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,720
Who do you think you are?

102
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,200
You're a dime a dozen.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,880
Let me tell you something.

104
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,480
If you dare to be disrespectful again,

105
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,600
I'll make sure your Huasheng company never has a good day again.

106
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,320
Mr. Nie!

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,440
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
That's going too far.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,720
Young Gu,

110
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
today's approval process

111
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,040
did encounter some issues.

112
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,000
However,

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,200
that doesn't mean

114
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,930
it won't pass in the future.

115
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,800
After all,

116
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,520
Mr. Nie and I are both here to help.

117
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,080
Right?

118
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,159
Besides,

119
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,240
we've had a friendship with your father for so many years.

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,520
That's right.

121
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,880
How could we possibly ignore his own child?

122
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,680
Mr. Tang, I...

123
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,880
Don't worry.

124
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,810
We'll continue to follow up

125
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
on everything here.

126
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,760
We won't be staying today.

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,960
Mr. Tang.

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,120
Dongfeng.

129
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,120
I thought you were just a genius student,

130
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,200
but I never expected

131
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,460
your background would be so impressive.

132
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,680
Not really.

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,280
Director Yang,

134
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,200
thank you.

135
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,720
I should be thanking you.

136
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,570
Thank you for discovering this issue in time.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,130
Otherwise, if that patent infringement had gone to market domestically,

138
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,260
we would have become an international laughingstock.

139
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,320
It's my duty.

140
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,440
Director Yang,

141
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,770
there's one more thing.

142
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,760
There's a Chairman Tang

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,159
and a Chairman Nie.

144
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,530
They seem to be deeply involved with Huasheng Group.

145
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,920
I've already spoken with the relevant departments.

146
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,320
We'll take action once the evidence is confirmed.

147
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,450
You're so wise, sir.

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,280
You know,

149
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,400
less flattery

150
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,820
and more experiments.

151
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,050
The weight of history still rests on your shoulders.

152
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Yes, understood.

153
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,290
Let's go.

154
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,530
He just left.

155
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,330
What's going on?

156
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,530
The number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

157
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,680
What's happening?

158
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,240
Mr. Gu.

159
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,720
Is the press conference still happening or not?

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,520
Exactly.

161
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
Is it still on?

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,120
Mr. Gu.

163
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,440
Why did the two chairmen leave?

164
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
There's not a problem, is there?

165
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,159
No, no, no.

166
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,360
I've already transferred all the money to you.

167
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,280
Can this new technology still be launched today?

168
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,200
We all came here because of your promising news.

169
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,840
Heavily invested in Huasheng stocks, huh?

170
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,640
That's right.

171
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,680
Put everything into it.

172
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
What should we do?

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Exactly.

174
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,000
Is it happening or not?

175
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,760
Well, it's like this.

176
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,159
The two chairmen said

177
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,240
the new technology documents are still being processed.

178
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,159
Today's release is postponed.

179
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,280
Postponed?

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,880
What?

181
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,700
The release is postponed.

182
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,680
Please stay calm.

183
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Huasheng stocks hit the limit down!

184
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,360
Give us our money back!

185
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,000
No, no.

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,360
Please, please.

187
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,200
Everyone, don't worry.

188
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,680
Pay us back!

189
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,360
Everyone, please calm down.

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,760
Give us our money!

191
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,280
Everyone, please.

192
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,200
There's no problem.

193
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,760
Stop right there!

194
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,220
I won't.

195
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,960
Stop!

196
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,420
You won't lose your money.

197
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,620
Do you know who I am?

198
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,560
We see you clearly.

199
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,520
You're Director Gu!

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,600
If you hadn't promised the stock would rise today,

201
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,240
we brothers wouldn't have mortgaged our houses.

202
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,700
That's right! Beat him up!

203
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Beat him! Beat him!

204
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
No, no, no!

205
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,600
Stop hitting him!

206
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,160
Hit him!

207
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,760
Stop it!

208
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,320
Beat him!

209
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,160
Stop!

210
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,720
Wanzhi,

211
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,880
are you okay?

212
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,960
Stop fighting!

213
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,120
It's too chaotic here.

214
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,160
Let's go outside to talk.

215
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Let's go.

216
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,320
Hey, Miranda,

217
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
bring some people over

218
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,920
to take the young master home.

219
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,050
As soon as possible.

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Wanzhi.

221
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,480
I want to explain my relationship with Miss Gu.

222
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,800
We really don't have...

223
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,520
Shut up.

224
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,120
Let me explain.

225
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,160
Miss Zheng, it's like this.

226
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,240
Lin Dongfeng and I are just business partners.

227
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,600
Hmm.

228
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,360
You had too much to drink at the selection meeting.

229
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,160
I was the one who brought you back.

230
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,680
To repay me, Lin Dongfeng

231
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,240
rushed to participate in

232
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,840
Huasheng Group's competition before the selection ended.

233
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,560
The next day, I had some data that needed processing.

234
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,320
I paid Lin Dongfeng to help me.

235
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,480
What you saw in the dormitory

236
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,440
was absolutely not what you imagined.

237
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,600
I accidentally spilled water on my clothes.

238
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
I had no choice but

239
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,930
to change into his clothes.

240
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,040
I don't know if what I'm saying

241
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,360
makes sense to you.

242
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
What about these?

243
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,970
It's not Wanzhi.

244
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,720
I and her...

245
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,180
Shut up.

246
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,040
Miss Zheng,

247
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,320
a few staged photos,

248
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
what are you trying to prove?

249
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,840
I don't deny the scenes in these photos.

250
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,170
Lin Dongfeng did go to the mall with me,

251
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,300
but that was to make you happy,

252
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,880
to buy you a gift.

253
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
I can retrieve the security footage from that day

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,120
and show you

255
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,840
what really happened at the mall.

256
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,920
I think the reason you broke up with Lin Dongfeng...

257
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,980
It's not just these few photos, is it?

258
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,200
Your relationship

259
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,640
doesn't seem that cheap.

260
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,560
I was too selfish before.

261
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,290
About the marriage with the Gu family,

262
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,800
I'll think it over carefully.

263
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,400
Perhaps

264
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Dongfeng and I

265
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,450
are truly not meant to be together.

266
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,570
It's related to the Zheng Group's debt, isn't it?

267
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,050
How did you know?

268
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,400
When I heard Gu Shaocheng introducing you on stage,

269
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,330
I figured it out.

270
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,370
Years ago, your father borrowed a lot of money

271
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,800
from the business world to prevent Zheng Group from being acquired.

272
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,000
Perhaps Gu Shaocheng

273
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,100
is using this to threaten you.

274
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,340
He didn't threaten me.

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
It was my own choice.

276
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,000
Besides marrying him,

277
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,040
I can't think of any other way to save our family.

278
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,680
Wanzhi, trust me.

279
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,320
I have the ability now.

280
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
What I'll create in the future

281
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,960
will be worth more than 10 billion.

282
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,490
I can definitely help you clear all the debts.

283
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,880
Dongfeng.

284
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,490
When will you ever be more down-to-earth?

285
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,400
Let me prove it.

286
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,560
This guy might be exaggerating about the billions in value.

287
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
But with his talent,

288
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,220
he should be able to pay off your family's debts.

289
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,760
Besides,

290
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,200
he knows such influential people.

291
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,760
If the creditors are pressing,

292
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,420
I can lend him the money first,

293
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,210
as long as he's willing to give Huasheng a chance.

294
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,080
I'm willing.

295
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,640
As long as it helps Wanzi,

296
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,720
I'll do anything.

297
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,960
So.

298
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,500
Actually that day,

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,660
you attended Huasheng's selection,

300
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,090
and you got a perfect score.

301
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,120
Your mother would definitely approve of us if she knew.

302
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
As for what really happened that day,

303
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,960
I'll tell you everything later.

304
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,360
Mm.

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,560
Alright.

306
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,080
Mission accomplished.

307
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
You must be hungry.

308
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,680
I'll treat you all to a feast.

309
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,480
Miss,

310
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,800
the master wants you to return immediately.

311
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,960
Please come with us.
