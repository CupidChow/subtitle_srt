1
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,370
What are their chances of success?

2
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,760
Chu Tiankuo is indeed a rare talent.

3
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,170
With his natural abilities

4
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,440
and the help of the notebook,

5
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,200
he's very likely to complete the final device.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,360
The way you talk,

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,680
I actually feel a bit of kinship with you.

8
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,800
Pah!

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,760
You shameless wretch!

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,610
You're nothing but a thief.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,520
Lin Dongfeng, oh Lin Dongfeng.

12
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,320
If you had told me earlier,

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,640
I would have sent someone

14
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,320
to protect the notebook,

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,740
and we wouldn't be in this situation now.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,400
What's done is done.

17
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,460
What's the use of saying all this now?

18
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,720
You young people,

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,800
only concerned with immediate gains and losses,

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,880
have no idea

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,820
of what's truly at stake here.

22
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,640
If

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,160
Chu Tiankuo's device is verified today,

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,200
allowing Gu Yongbang and Smith

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,160
to obtain the patent for controlled nuclear fusion,

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
then they will

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,880
create patent barriers internationally,

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,940
completely blocking the technology

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,560
making decades of effort go to waste.

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,479
Our Professor Wu

31
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,240
risked his life

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,840
to complete the experiment,

33
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,640
all for the future.

34
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,280
We won't let foreign powers control us,

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,960
so our future generations

36
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,920
can stand tall at the top of the world.

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,040
Director Yang,

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,280
it's too late

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,640
to say these things now.

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,600
Lin Dongfeng.

41
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,530
From this moment on,

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,840
people will only remember the name Chu Tiankuo.

43
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,680
Decades.

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
Generations.

45
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,520
It's over.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,120
No.

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,520
That's wrong.

48
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop it now!

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Dream on.

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,880
Lin Dongfeng.

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,280
Such a wonderful moment,

52
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
how could we stop now?

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,650
Increase the power.

54
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,570
Chu, what's happening?

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
Don't worry, everyone.

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,960
This is normal.

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,420
It'll be fine once the reaction stabilizes.

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,120
Increase the power.

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,450
Stop!

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,280
Keep increasing the power.

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,920
The reaction will explode if it reaches critical level.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,520
Nonsense.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,130
Don't listen to him.

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,320
Our equipment is perfectly safe.

65
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,000
Nuclear fusion reaction is controllable.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,079
We have completely mastered

67
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,800
the controlled nuclear fusion technology.

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,400
There won't be any problems.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,800
Stop it now! It's too late!

70
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,250
Impossible.

71
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
That can't be.

72
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,920
We can't stop it now.

73
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
What should we do?

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
How did this happen?

75
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Lin Dongfeng,

76
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,839
there's a problem with the data you gave me.

77
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,839
I never calculated it would come to this.

78
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,839
This miniaturization process

79
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,240
even I couldn't guarantee its completion.

80
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,300
You were too hasty.

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,680
The nuclear fusion reaction is now irreversible.

82
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,400
It will continue colliding endlessly

83
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,460
until it explodes.

84
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,330
Grandpa,

85
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
let's go quickly.

86
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,159
What should we do?

87
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,020
It won't really explode, will it?

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
Bingqing,

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,960
what are you waiting for?

90
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,080
Run!

91
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,159
I'm not leaving.

92
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,120
Dongfeng is still here.

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,920
I want to stay with him.

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,159
You silly child.

95
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
What are you waiting for?

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,200
Run!

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
It's too late now.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,730
We only have a few minutes left.

99
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,600
This nuclear reactor

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,280
will level the entire city.

101
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,900
Running is pointless now.

102
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,650
In these final moments,

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
we should be with those closest to us

104
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,040
and say our goodbyes.

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,120
Dongfeng,

106
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,290
I'm not afraid to die. I'm with you.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
You'll always be my brilliant brother.

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,920
Meeting a genius like you

109
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,080
has made me so happy.

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,960
Don't be afraid of death.

111
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
Your sister is here with you.

112
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,600
Lin Dongfeng,

113
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
is there really no other way?

114
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,020
This explosion

115
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,120
will claim so many innocent lives.

116
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,130
Hey, classmate,

117
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,400
what are you drawing?

118
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Is that Iron Man?

119
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,580
This is a miniature nuclear fusion reactor I've designed.

120
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
Theoretically, once it works,

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,640
we'll never need to charge our devices again.

122
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,770
We'll have unlimited energy forever.

123
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,360
Nuclear fusion?

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,650
Isn't that like a nuclear bomb?

125
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Won't it explode?

126
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,360
I've already made contingency plans.

127
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,480
I've installed a fail-safe program

128
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,080
on one of the reactor coils.

129
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
If the reaction goes out of control,

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,960
we can remove the coil

131
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,960
and stop the reaction at the molecular physics level.

132
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,600
Dongfeng,

133
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,720
did you strictly follow

134
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,159
the blueprints and procedures in my notebook

135
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,560
to build this reactor?

136
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
So what if I did?

137
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,440
Lin Dongfeng,

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,280
I know what you're thinking.

139
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,610
You want to be a hero.

140
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,570
Even if you succeed,

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
you'll still die.

142
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,400
Is it worth it?

143
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
What does he mean?

144
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,450
Lin Dongfeng, what are you going to do?

145
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,640
But the teacher just said

146
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,640
that during nuclear fusion

147
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,360
the temperature reaches tens of millions of degrees

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,000
and there's deadly radiation.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,800
How can we dismantle it?

150
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,680
Well,

151
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,160
future robots can do that.

152
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,040
You have an interesting way of talking.

153
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,760
I'm Zheng Wanzhi,

154
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,200
from Basic Physics Class 2.

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,760
And you?

156
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,000
My name is Lin Dongfeng.

157
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm a genius.

158
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,320
The reaction just went critical.

159
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,960
Temperature and radiation haven't reached maximum levels yet.

160
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,159
Though I don't know how long it can hold.

161
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,800
This is the only way.

162
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,280
Dongfeng, don't!

163
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,680
No!

164
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,560
This is your last chance.

165
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,760
Go now!

166
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
Dongfeng, no!

167
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,080
Dongfeng!

168
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,920
Hurry up.

169
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,680
You finally came.

170
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,500

171
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,320
