1
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,280
Mr. Wu.

2
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,040
I'm confident that there's no one else in the world

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,840
who could complete the experimental calculations for controlled nuclear fusion.

4
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,170
If what was said in the livestream is true,

5
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,250
then I'm afraid there's a traitor within our research team.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,120
I won't allow anyone

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,690
to destroy the results you protected with your life.

8
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,700
No matter who it is,

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,800
I will definitely find this traitor.

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,960
This time,

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,840
let me be the one to protect our work.

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
Lost again. Damn it.

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
Look at their equipment.

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,240
They're too powerful. How can we beat them?

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,280
Smith is actually working with Huasheng.

16
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,520
Director.

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,880
We recently discovered that

18
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,240
Huasheng Group, through offshore companies,

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,240
has jointly registered overseas patents with Smith.

20
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,300
I knew there was something wrong with Huasheng.

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,600
It's been so long since we've seen each other.

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,260
Maybe I should send a message first to say hello.

23
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,240
What if she's still mad at me?

24
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,840
Forget it.

25
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,000
This is too important.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,660
I'll just go see her directly.

27
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,200
No.

28
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,560
Excuse me, officers.

29
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,200
No.

30
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,800
You've got the wrong person.

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,640
No.

32
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,240
Officer Cao, it's you.

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,720
Get me out of here.

34
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,520
I have urgent business.

35
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,160
Sit still.

36
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,700
Take a look.

37
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,760
You'll understand after you see it.

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,000
Wait.

39
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,980
What's going on, Officer Cao?

40
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,680
You sent people to arrest me?

41
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Unexplained wealth.

42
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,650
Large overseas transfers.

43
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,320
And suspicious ties to Huasheng Group.

44
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,850
Which accusation is false?

45
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,840
You finally paid me.

46
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,220
You didn't withhold any of my earnings, did you?

47
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,140
You earned this with your talent.

48
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,100
I don't want it.

49
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,300
I don't even know how much money there is.

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,890
Captain Cao,

51
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,560
please give me my phone back.

52
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,280
I need to contact Director Yang.

53
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,680
You don't need to call me.

54
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,480
All of this

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,480
was done on my orders.

56
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,900
Director Yang,

57
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,480
you suspect me too?

58
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,640
This involves national interests,

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,240
I must be cautious.

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,340
Director Yang,

61
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,240
without my theoretical work,

62
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,520
this experiment would never have been possible.

63
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,250
I made controlled nuclear fusion a possibility.

64
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,159
If I wanted to leak information,

65
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,420
I wouldn't have collaborated with you from the beginning.

66
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
That point

67
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,820
has occurred to me too.

68
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,800
But faced with the evidence,

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
I've considered another possibility.

70
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,720
What if from the beginning

71
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,640
you had planned to work with foreign entities,

72
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
but because

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
Professor Wu discovered this

74
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,320
and consequently

75
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,650
you were forced to join the research team?

76
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,840
That would also make sense.

77
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,440
Director Yang,

78
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,040
you've seen everything I've done.

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,000
I couldn't possibly do such a thing.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,320
How could you suspect me?

81
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,080
Dongfeng,

82
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,090
it's not that I want to suspect you,

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,040
but the evidence points to you.

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,880
Only when

85
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,120
the investigation is complete

86
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,240
can we reach a final conclusion.

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,960
It's my duty,

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,650
please understand.

89
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,760
Treat him

90
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,600
well.

91
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,600
Until the final results come out,

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Lin Dongfeng is still our comrade.

93
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,920
Why did you arrest Lin Dongfeng?

94
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
It's classified information,

95
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,770
I can't disclose anything.

96
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,840
Don't think I don't know

97
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,800
that you've had Cao Dahua investigating us.

98
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,660
You can suspect whoever you want.

99
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,360
Dongfeng has dedicated himself to this project.

100
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,840
He's worked so hard.

101
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,100
How could he possibly leak information?

102
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,400
Could you?

103
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,280
It's not up to your word alone.

104
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,720
We need evidence.

105
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
Stop causing trouble here.

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:26,960
Go home.

107
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,040
Search your conscience.

108
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,760
If Lin Dongfeng leaked information,

109
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,960
how could our second phase experiment possibly succeed?

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,960
There are things you don't understand.

111
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,090
And I don't need to explain them to you.

112
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,380
Yang Zhengdao.

113
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,159
You're abusing your power.

114
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,960
If there's an internal investigation,

115
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,560
then I could be suspected of leaking information too.

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
You might as well arrest me too.

117
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,360
You think I wouldn't dare?

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,000
If evidence points to you,

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,120
I'll personally put you behind bars.

120
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,880
If Old Wu were here,

121
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,840
he would never do this.

122
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
Don't mention Old Wu.

123
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
If Lin Dongfeng's leak is proven,

124
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:11,760
Old Wu

125
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,620
would be the first to condemn him.

126
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,040
I know you two are close.

127
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,520
You don't need to worry about him.

128
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,680
He'll be fine.

129
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,240
Anyway,

130
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,160
until the investigation is over,

131
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,890
Lin Dongfeng

132
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,919
has to stay in the detention room

133
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,179
and can't go anywhere.

134
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,940
You should go home now.

135
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,610
Officer Cao,

136
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,770
I'd like to go in and have a word with Lin Dongfeng.

137
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,090
Dongfeng

138
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,280
Jingshu

139
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,450
Why are you here?

140
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,160
Where's your father?

141
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,090
I need to see him.

142
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,520
There's no use finding him now.

143
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,000
He won't listen to anything.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,730
Don't worry.

145
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,040
I'll definitely prove your innocence.

146
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,400
Actually,

147
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,260
I already have some ideas.

148
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,240
I've carefully examined all the research team members

149
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,680
and found none of them had any motive to leak information.

150
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,800
So it's highly likely

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,080
that it was someone on the periphery of the research team,

152
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,210
staff who had access to the materials.

153
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,320
Indeed,

154
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,740
all the academicians are very reliable.

155
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,280
Also,

156
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,820
among the evidence against me

157
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,570
is a contract signed by Gu Bingqing and Smith.

158
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,000
But I've thought carefully about it.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,680
At the time the contract was signed,

160
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,520
I was with Gu Bingqing.

161
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,040
So this contract must be forged.

162
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,080
Since both Gu Bingqing and I are being framed,

163
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,560
she definitely has nothing to do with the leak.

164
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,890
Asking for her help now would be reliable.

165
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
Go find her now

166
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,360
and do as I say.

167
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,640
Wait for me.

168
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
I'll definitely get you out of here.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,040
Who are you?

170
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,000
What can I do for you?

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm Lin Dongfeng's classmate.

172
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
Something happened to Lin Dongfeng.

173
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,600
Miss Gu,

174
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,720
I need your help.

175
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,520
What?

176
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,970
What did you say?

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,560
Something happened to Dongfeng.

178
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,760
What happened to him?

179
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,280
You must be Zheng Wanzhi.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,800
Tell me quickly.

181
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,720
What happened to him?

182
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,000
Wanzhi, calm down.

183
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,570
Let her come in and talk.

184
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,900
That's how things are.

185
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,120
The only person who can save him now is you,

186
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Miss Gu Bingqing of Huasheng Group.

187
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,320
So you mean

188
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,090
all those things before

189
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,880
were just my misunderstanding?

190
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,480
He really wasn't lying to me.

191
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,800
No wonder

192
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,780
he's always had connections with those important people.

193
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,400
By the way,

194
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,130
why are you at her place?

195
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,180
Aren't you two supposed to...

196
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
The school says

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,980
Dongfeng hasn't been to school for days.

198
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,080
He doesn't answer his phone,

199
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,680
and he can't be found at home.

200
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,280
I thought

201
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,040
he might be here with Miss Gu,

202
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,380
but to my surprise,

203
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,880
she doesn't know either.

204
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,280
That's when I realized

205
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,680
he's really missing.

206
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,480
We were just discussing what to do.

207
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,040
Alright,

208
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,400
there's no time to waste.

209
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,660
We need to act quickly.

210
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,280
Tell me,

211
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,930
what do you need me to do?

212
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,400
Wait,

213
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,920
what are you guys talking about?

214
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,200
What should we do?

215
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,560
But in this matter,

216
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
she needs to be involved.

217
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,020
It concerns Lin Dongfeng,

218
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
and she's absolutely trustworthy.

219
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,840
Then let's go.

220
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Okay, let's move.

221
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,680
I'm here today

222
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,320
to proudly announce something important.

223
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,560
Tonight,

224
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,240
Huasheng Group

225
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,240
and Mr. Smith's research team from Country A

226
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,320
will join forces

227
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,400
to livestream

228
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,600
the

229
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,960
controlled nuclear fusion model release.

230
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
With all of humanity as our witness,

231
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,400
we welcome the ultimate energy

232
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,640
revolution.

233
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,760
Okay.

234
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,180
Director Yang.

235
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:33,840
This is

236
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,720
an invitation sent by Gu Yongbang,

237
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,450
inviting you

238
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,210
to attend the launch event.

239
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,280
It seems

240
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,200
Huasheng Group

241
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
is determined this time

242
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,780
to work with these foreigners

243
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
against us.

244
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Get the car ready.

245
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
Let me see

246
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,040
where they get the nerve from.
