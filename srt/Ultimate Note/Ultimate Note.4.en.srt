1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,910
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 4</i>

4
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,810
Wu San Xing doesn't trust you much.

5
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,490
He only left you a clue
the entire way here.

6
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:00,130
The rest are up to you alone.

7
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,970
That is known as trust.

8
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,610
Besides,

9
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,270
he must has his reasons.

10
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,810
Try to recall

11
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,810
the obscure clue left at the campsite.

12
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,830
He doesn't want someone
in particular to find out.

13
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,920
Are you saying that

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,640
it is inconvenient for
Wu San Xing to leave a clue?

15
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,190
Yes.

16
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,890
It seems like

17
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,750
Master San doesn't trust
the crew he recruited.

18
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,130
We need to find them quickly.

19
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,490
We do need to hurry up.

20
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm running out of water.

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,840
Your backpack looks heavy.

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,520
Did you only pack food?

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,720
Honestly,

24
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,490
food is running out as well.

25
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,140
Wu Xie.

26
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,060
Don't move.

27
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,850
There's a silk thread here.

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,720
I almost got caught.

29
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,810
Who knows what kind of trap is in here.

30
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,900
How old is this ship?

31
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,130
It's wrecked.

32
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,290
The contraptions wouldn't work either.

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,480
It's better to be safe than sorry.

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,880
Who is in the coffin?

35
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,090
It should be a relative
of Heavenly Queen Mother.

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,240
This person fell ill at the age of 18.

37
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,560
The queen fed her a
pill to extend their life,

38
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,290
but it didn't work.

39
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,860
Wu Xie.

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
Do you know the story of Heavenly Queen
Mother's quest for the Pill of Immortality?

41
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Are you saying that

42
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,540
the tomb's owner ate the pill?

43
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,700
Such medication do not exist.

44
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,870
Based on the information we gathered,

45
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,530
in order to extend life,

46
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,040
the Queen tried many ways
to cultivate the pill.

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,200
She wanted to extend her life.

48
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,020
She probably consumed
the Pill of Immortality.

49
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,510
Look at the corpse.

50
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,579
Eighteen years old.

51
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,850
The body structure is too small.

52
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,110
It's impossible for royalty

53
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,790
to be buried in garments that do not fit.

54
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,680
There's only one possibility.

55
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,300
Her body experienced reversed growth.

56
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,860
The pill did not extend her life.

57
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
It also mutated her body after death.

58
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
It seems like

59
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,860
she consumed a failed product
of the Queen.

60
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,600
Do you really believe the
Pill of Immortality exists?

61
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,050
I allowed you to tag along,

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,760
but you're not allowed to
inquire about my trade.

63
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,980
What?

64
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,420
Wu Xie went on a rescue mission?

65
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,980
He's so unreliable.

66
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,810
There's no news about
Master Xiao San for some time.

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,210
Is he in danger?

68
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,770
Let's go, Pan Zi.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,880
We're off to Devil City.

70
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,420
Sit tight.

71
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,370
What is going on?

72
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,370
We're out of gas.

73
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,530
This is awkward.

74
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,150
Fatty,

75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,440
you chose this car.

76
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,650
You filled the gas.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,610
You're indeed lucky.

78
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,590
My luck

79
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,720
is great.

80
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,480
Zhang.

81
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,980
Wait for me!

82
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,330
We've been walking for long time.

83
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,530
There's nothing around here.

84
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,950
We're going to die of thirst.

85
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,120
Don't worry.

86
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,010
I'll not let you die.

87
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,080
This is the Camel's Thorn.

88
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,010
The most common plant found in the desert.

89
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,840
The leaves may look wilted,

90
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,100
but the root is a treasure.

91
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,600
Are you going to make me eat its roots?

92
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,590
Camels rely on this.

93
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,210
If you don't want to,

94
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,250
I'll not force you.

95
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,040
I don't need you to feed me.

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll feed myself.

97
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,090
Watch out!

98
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,240
These piles of stones

99
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,520
were left by Wu Xie and his crew.

100
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,590
It's easy to lose one's way.

101
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,830
The pile of stones serve as a mark.

102
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,040
There are a lot of junctions.

103
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,950
Following the pile of stones

104
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,750
will lead us to Wu Xie.

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,160
You're right.

106
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
It's getting late.

107
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,100
Let's go, Fatty.

108
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,010
Wait a minute.

109
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,240
Devil City.

110
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm coming.

111
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,860
Let's go.

112
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,170
It's impossible for us to
go back the way we came.

113
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,110
Let's go forward.

114
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,810
It's deep.

115
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,920
There's nothing in here.

116
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,460
Did we end up in somebody's
cellar by mistake?

117
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,520
It smells like an abandoned oil pipeline.

118
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,690
I don't smell anything.

119
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,559
It's very subtle. You can't sense it.

120
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,090
It doesn't smell like anything.

121
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,610
I'm guessing

122
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,020
this belongs to the Republic of China.

123
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,450
It seems like

124
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,750
your eyes aren't working,

125
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:51,970
but your nose is pretty sharp.

126
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,060
My ears work even better.

127
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,540
That means

128
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,940
we're in the oil pipeline of
the period of Republic China.

129
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,820
Yes.

130
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,990
I heard

131
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,610
that a team was sent during that era

132
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,960
to mine for oil.

133
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
However, none of the members

134
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,070
of the team ever returned.

135
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,220
Eventually,

136
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,820
this became one of the unresolved
mysteries of Republic of China.

137
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,510
This structure looks well-built.

138
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,990
It should have succeeded.

139
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,780
How could they vanish?

140
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,940
Watch out.

141
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,310
What is that?

142
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,260
It isn't opaque.

143
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,270
It doesn't look like oil.

144
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,340
It's tacky.

145
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,890
It looks like bodily fluid

146
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,430
from a life form.

147
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,410
What do you know?

148
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,610
This is so disgusting.

149
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,010
Would you like some?

150
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,330
-Master Hua'er.
-Get your filthy hands off me.

151
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,970
Gross.

152
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,620
You're pretty particular.

153
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,190
Do you want this disgusting
handkerchief back?

154
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,460
No.

155
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,210
Are you sure?

156
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,150
Throw it away.

157
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,040
Devil's...

158
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,920
It's the Devil's Child.

159
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,490
The Devil's Child is here.

160
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,850
I want to find out

161
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,770
who's trying to mess with us.

162
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,060
The bulkhead is hollow.

163
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,280
Something is inside.

164
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,250
This is human skin.

165
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:37,930
This is weird.

166
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,610
The skin is sealed with
a layer of beeswax.

167
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,510
Under the beeswax is a
layer of white phosphorus.

168
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,050
White phosphorus self-ignites.

169
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,720
The pale light penetrates the human skin,

170
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,230
creating shadows.

171
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,060
Is this

172
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,110
the Devil's Child?

173
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,570
The Devil's Child.

174
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,900
It's trying to kill us.

175
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,050
Shut up.

176
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,380
He's suffering from Crush Syndrome.

177
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,860
If this is delayed, his kidneys will fail.

178
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,240
We need to leave right now.

179
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,020
Dao Zai, pass me the flying claw.

180
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,110
I'll climb up first.

181
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,180
I'll pull you guys up.

182
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
Be careful.

183
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,330
Are you alright?

184
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,990
Devil's Child.

185
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,410
There are many Devil's Children!

186
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,130
Quit hesitating.

187
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,370
Let's find a way out of here.

188
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,180
It's toxic.

189
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,840
Make way.

190
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,580
Go on first.

191
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,210
I'll drag them over.

192
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,630
I'm exhausted.

193
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,410
Night has fallen.

194
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,080
The bottom of my feet are
covered with blisters.

195
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,930
We have not reached the next pile.

196
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,200
This route is too long.

197
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,390
Stop whining.

198
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,760
Take a break if you're tired.

199
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,890
We travelled together.

200
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,350
You're not the only one who's exhausted.

201
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,660
Don't lecture me.

202
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,210
I'm not in the mood.

203
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,840
Don't irritate me.

204
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,440
Look.

205
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,150
How did this happen?

206
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,400
The pipes are massive.

207
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,020
It should be sturdy.

208
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,960
It's also covered in sand.

209
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,870
It wouldn't corrode to this extent.

210
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,880
I'm afraid it was heavily
damaged from the outside.

211
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,940
A destruction caused
by such immense force.

212
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,370
If it was alive,

213
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,830
it must be massive.

214
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,400
If it was an object,

215
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,960
it must be caused by a
long-distance collision.

216
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,470
Could the slimy liquid
that fell on your hand

217
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,200
belong to its saliva?

218
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,990
That is disgusting.

219
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm feeling hungry.

220
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,660
Lao Jia.

221
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,120
We're by the bow.

222
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,230
Hurry over.

223
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,580
Send someone to make a report
at the local police station.

224
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,400
We have casualties.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,400
We're doomed.

226
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,990
Where is the pile of stones?

227
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,420
Is someone trying to sabotage our route

228
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,820
by removing the stone piles?

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,280
This is Devil City.

230
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,000
It's not a tourist's attraction.

231
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,910
No one will come around
to destroy your pile.

232
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,650
Don't mock me.

233
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
What do you think happened then?

234
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,070
This is the wrong way.

235
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,150
Zhang.

236
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,430
Pardon me,

237
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,290
but we all know that.

238
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,960
Everyone knows we took the wrong way.

239
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,080
Pan Zi, your zodiac sign must be a dog.

240
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,570
You bite everyone you see.

241
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,090
You're the smartest.

242
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,610
Guide the way. Where should we go?

243
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,930
Should we go left or right?

244
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,210
Calm down.

245
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,790
I'm very calm.

246
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,810
Very calm!

247
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,010
What do you mean, Fatty?

248
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,480
Are you picking a fight?

249
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,150
Don't push me!

250
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,590
-Come at me!
-Hit me!

251
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,830
What do you mean, Zhang?

252
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,780
I'm on your side, but you're on his.

253
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,170
Zhang is an understanding man.

254
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,300
Stop messing around!

255
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,810
Zhang is an understanding man.

256
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,070
You're the good person,

257
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,750
so I must be the evil one.

258
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,110
I'll go on my own.

259
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,510
Goodbye!

260
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,090
Fatty!

261
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,020
Ignore him.

262
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,890
He is so ill-tempered.

263
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,040
You two

264
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,570
have been affected by Devil City.

265
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,520
Check that out.

266
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,160
I can't see. There is too much sand.

267
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:16,849
I'm out of ideas.

268
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,250
It's your turn.

269
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,609
It's fine.

270
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,839
If we can't get out of here,

271
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,890
at least we have each other.

272
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:29,510
Our ghosts will not be alone.

273
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,050
Don't drag me with you if you want to die.

274
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,620
They didn't come after me.

275
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,450
No sense of brotherhood at all.

276
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,320
Zhang.

277
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,720
Pan Zi.

278
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,780
From today onwards,

279
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,080
I'll cut all ties with you!

280
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,740
Cutting all ties with you!

281
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280
Fatty!

282
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,900
Fatty!

283
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,830
He went pretty far.

284
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,400
Let's hurry after him.

285
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,940
Okay.

286
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,670
Fatty!

287
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,110
Stop joking around.

288
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,510
Zhang.

289
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,130
Could Fatty be in danger?

290
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,670
Someone started a fire.

291
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,110
It must be Fatty.

292
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,710
Fatty!

293
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,220
Stupid fatty.

294
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,980
Why didn't you say anything?

295
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,650
I do as I promised.

296
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,250
We shall go our own ways.

297
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,330
That's enough.

298
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,530
You started a fire

299
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,170
visible thousands of miles away.

300
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,240
You were worried we couldn't find you.

301
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,900
You're getting comfortable.

302
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,260
You even started a barbecue.

303
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,140
What a load of crap.

304
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,810
It's freezing at night.

305
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,680
Since I started a fire,

306
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,710
I made use of what I had.

307
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,610
It's high in protein. Would you like some?

308
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,390
You ate it for real.

309
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,750
This is nothing.

310
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,410
I tried everything back
when I was a soldier.

311
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,990
If I'm being honest,

312
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,170
scorpions taste better eaten live.

313
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,040
Fine.

314
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,780
I admit defeat.

315
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,720
Mr Pan.

316
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,480
From now on,

317
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,700
I'll listen to you.

318
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
To be honest,

319
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,740
what happened today wasn't your fault.

320
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,190
Zhang said,

321
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,200
we're influenced by the Devil City.

322
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,220
He said this is the law of the highway.

323
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,100
An unchangeable rock.

324
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,980
An unchangeable rock?

325
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,130
That's true.

326
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,880
That means, as we moved along
in the same environment,

327
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,290
it's like being on the highway.

328
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,640
Under such circumstances,

329
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,080
people get irritated easily.

330
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Who could have known?

331
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,440
Devil City played with humans' psyche too.

332
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,980
Yes.

333
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,570
I didn't know such theories exist.

334
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,350
We need to be mindful.

335
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,940
What should we do now?

336
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,300
Where should we go?

337
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,760
At the fourth junction,

338
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:25,280
we didn't notice any stone pile.

339
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
That means we took the wrong way.

340
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,290
In my opinion,

341
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,720
we should rest for the night.

342
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,610
Early tomorrow morning,

343
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,160
we return to the junction
with a stone pile.

344
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,600
We will determine what happened then.

345
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,280
I was thinking the same.

346
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,150
What do you think?

347
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,680
Fine. It's decided then.

348
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,720
I'm going to catch some scorpions.

349
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,010
How are they?

350
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,510
They are safe for now.

351
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,860
Tashi, you know the way around.

352
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,220
Return and bring everyone here.

353
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,400
Don't be afraid.

354
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,420
There's a coffin in the shipwreck.

355
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,300
The Devil's Child you were referring
to is a mechanism of shadow play.

356
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,980
It is to scare the tomb raiders.

357
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,750
Really?

358
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,590
They fainted due to injuries.

359
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,660
When they are awake,

360
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,860
you may ask them yourself.

361
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,010
Good gracious.

362
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,930
We finally got out of there.

363
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,320
Look.

364
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,550
The stone pile is right here.

365
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,540
Where did we go wrong?

366
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,190
Did they place it wrongly?

367
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,620
It doesn't seem like it.

368
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,180
We're wasting time.

369
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,500
If it isn't left, it must be right.

370
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,770
We will just go the other direction.

371
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,810
We can't do that.

372
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,270
Devil City is huge.

373
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,420
If we keep going around,

374
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,260
it will take forever to find Wu Xie.

375
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,510
What should we do then?

376
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,980
This stone pile

377
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,300
was probably left by the
guide of Ah Ning's team.

378
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,540
If he placed it this way,

379
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,100
he must have his reason.

380
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,530
It's not as simple as guiding the way.

381
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,460
It's the Mani stone piles.

382
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,170
That makes sense.

383
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
Luckily I paid close attention.

384
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,340
The first one.

385
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,220
The second one.

386
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,370
The third one.

387
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,710
I got it.

388
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,580
The Mani stone piles

389
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,540
are made to pray for blessings
as well as cast out evil spirits.

390
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,900
Different stone piles

391
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,550
show different meanings.

392
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,200
The first and second stone pile

393
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,160
have six layers.

394
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,960
The third one has seven layers.

395
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,420
It is different.

396
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,180
Based on the first two piles,

397
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,220
we were on the right path.

398
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,700
While we followed the third,

399
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,820
we took the wrong path.

400
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,720
That means the previous six layers

401
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
were correct.

402
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:27,250
The third pile that consist
of seven layers

403
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,260
was incorrect.

404
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,200
Don't you think I'm right, Zhang?

405
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,830
Thanks to your photos, Fatty.

406
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,650
Otherwise, we'd be in trouble.

407
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,260
The person who stacked the stones

408
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,540
is filled with bad intentions.

409
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,900
He isn't a good man.

410
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,540
Let's hurry up.

411
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,310
Why are you doing this?

412
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,720
To make money?

413
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,900
If you weren't in this field,

414
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,460
what would you be doing?

415
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,520
I'd die.

416
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,180
Haven't you thought about your life?

417
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,170
This is my life.

418
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,970
There's only one way.

419
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,490
Since I made my choice,

420
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,910
I'll disregard other possibilities.

421
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,960
It's pointless.

422
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,880
Just like how you're willing

423
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,040
to sacrifice everything for Zhang.

424
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,230
For my choice,

425
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,630
I'm willing to sacrifice everything.

426
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:48,590
Your stamina is impressive,

427
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,940
but you're not that efficient.

428
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,420
Master Hua'er.

429
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,540
Hurry up and dig more.

430
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,350
I'm left with the last portion of food.

431
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,990
After eating this, I'd run out of food.

432
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,480
I found something.

433
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,560
A leg of a stool?

434
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,500
Number nine.

435
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,720
It must be a numbering

436
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,730
used back in the day.

437
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,590
or they came from the
Room no. 9 or something.

438
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,140
This should be the
location of the landslide.

439
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,500
It closed the original pathway off.

440
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,770
If we continue to dig,
we will get out of here.

441
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,030
You brought a shovel?

442
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,740
Yes, these are essential tools.

443
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,130
Why didn't you take it out just now?

444
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,380
I forgot.

445
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,280
Hold on.

446
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,880
-What were you doing?
-I'm sorry.

447
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,240
Look, my eyesight is worse than yours.

448
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,540
I lost half my life
losing this fried rice.

449
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,120
If the remaining half
wants to get out of here,

450
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,540
hurry up and get digging.

451
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,720
It's another stone pile.

452
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,590
We finally figured it out.

453
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,770
My legs are exhausted.

454
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
Fatty.

455
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,420
We noticed its pattern.

456
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,710
Why do you keep taking pictures?

457
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,320
Who knows if anything would happen?

458
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,960
I'm preparing for the worst.

459
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,440
Zhang.

460
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,100
Zhang.

461
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,200
Slow down, Zhang.

462
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,660
No wonder Wu Xie is constantly
worried about losing him.

463
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,610
Come on.

464
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,600
Zhang.

465
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,600
Wait up.

466
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,820
Boss.

467
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,050
Our apologies.

468
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,370
We did our best.

469
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,730
This wasn't your fault.

470
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:00,990
If they decided to leave,

471
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,070
you can't stop them either.

472
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,300
You're right.

473
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,340
They were crazy.
They almost burnt me to death.

474
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
Where did they go?

475
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,910
That's what I wanted to ask.

476
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,070
Fatty Wang is here.

477
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,190
Fatty came?

478
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,160
Zhang left with them.

479
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,540
I'm not sure where they went.

480
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,350
Why is he here?

481
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,750
Wu Xie.

482
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,020
It's your forte.

483
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,130
Let's study them together.

484
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,800
These were found on the shipwreck.

485
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,140
Sanqing Bird.

486
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,350
Yes.

487
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,270
Look at the broken one next to it.

488
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,350
The diameter of the skull is
larger than the opening of the jar.

489
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,480
What does this mean?

490
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,120
<i>This is a cruel method of torture.</i>

491
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,580
<i>On ancient battlefields,</i>

492
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,940
<i>the victor is very cruel to the loser.</i>

493
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,580
<i>They'd seal the children's
heads of the defeated tribes</i>

494
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,820
<i>in clay jars.</i>

495
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,730
<i>Food and drinks</i>

496
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,890
<i>were inserted through the gap.</i>

497
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,260
<i>When food no longer</i>

498
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,300
<i>fits through the gap,</i>

499
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,400
<i>their heads would long be stuck.</i>

500
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,500
<i>They would be decapitated then.</i>

501
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,620
<i>The jars are then sealed.</i>

502
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:19,520
<i>This acts as a warning to other tribes.</i>

503
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,530
<i>During that era,</i>

504
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:25,260
<i>rulers employ cruel rituals of mysticism</i>

505
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,320
<i>to propagate their supernatural powers</i>

506
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,870
<i>with the purpose of
actualising their dominion.</i>

507
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,110
That's too evil.

508
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,240
They'd be punished by the deities.

509
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,360
Something's wrong with the skull!

510
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,800
Something is inside!

511
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,180
Corpse Bugs!

512
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,780
Don't go near, they are poisonous!

513
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,450
Ah K!

514
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,560
We need to kill the insects!

515
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,080
Catch!

516
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,340
My grandma!

517
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,700
Inform everyone!

518
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,100
Check the necessary equipment!

519
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,220
Run!

520
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,690
Run!

521
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,680
Brother Si!

522
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,510
-Run! We can't make it!
-Ah Ning!

523
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,150
Don't move.

524
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,850
Let's go.

525
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
Come on!

526
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,300
Run!

527
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,260
Run!

528
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,290
It's done.

529
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,300
Really?

530
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:05,470
Yes.

531
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,080
It's only this big.

532
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,650
Only my head fits.

533
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,100
I know.

534
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,520
My chest,

535
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,400
rear,

536
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,360
thighs and important body parts
need to be able to go through.

537
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,290
Do you know?

538
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,400
Yes.

539
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:24,740
What should I do?

540
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,580
I'll contort my body and head over.

541
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,660
I'll wait for you on the other side.

542
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,240
You're being selfish.

543
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,380
If I've to dig a way out alone,

544
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,060
it will take forever.

545
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,160
Come on.

546
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Stay here and keep me company.

547
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,210
Get your filthy hands off me.

548
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,000
I'll give you all the good stuff.

549
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,500
No, thanks.

550
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,610
I'm used to the metal bat.

551
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,140
Fine, Master Hua'er.

552
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,420
Get some rest.

553
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,760
I'll dig.

554
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,520
Exert some force.

555
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:16,949
This way.

556
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,920
That way.

557
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,659
Where should we go from here?

558
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,429
Only Tashi understands.

559
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:31,610
Follow the footprints.

560
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,179
There are too many.

561
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,610
Whatever, let's get out of here first.

562
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,740
The Corpse Bugs
are coming after us. Run.

563
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,720
Calm down.

564
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,150
Let's find somewhere to hide.

565
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,300
Over here.

566
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,540
Wu Xie.

567
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,960
Get up.

568
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,840
Run.

569
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,600
What does this mean?

570
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,440
Why is there a huge ship?

571
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,060
The one next to it must
be Ah Ning's campsite.

572
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,340
After all our effort,

573
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,310
Ah Ning and her team
found this place first.

574
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,260
No wonder Master San insists
to trail along Ah Ning's team.

575
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,890
They'd always find a way.

576
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,360
We will prioritise negotiation over force.

577
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,080
Let's decide after finding Wu Xie.

578
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,340
Let's go.

579
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
What happened?

580
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,060
Corpse Bugs.

581
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,090
The ones we encountered
at Qixinglu Palace?

582
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,700
Why are they here?

583
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,050
Let's find Master Xiao San first.

584
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,940
This is Wu Xie's jacket.

585
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,000
Long time no see.

586
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,050
I'm going to kill you!

587
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,940
Thankfully it wasn't Wu Xie.

588
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,580
I wasn't with him for once.

589
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,470
Otherwise,

590
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,990
I'll have to spend the
rest of my life as a monk.

591
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,370
Search the entire campsite.

592
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,880
This was a sudden occurrence.

593
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,170
Zhang.

594
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,210
You were scared too, weren't you?

595
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,800
Did you think Wu Xie died?

596
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,760
No.

597
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,940
Don't deny it.

598
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
You almost minced

599
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,920
the Corpse Bugs to bits.

600
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,090
What a huge grudge.

601
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,670
It's a dead end.

602
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,850
We're surrounded. There's no way to run.

603
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,270
There's a hole here.

604
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,790
Someone was here before.

605
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,190
Let's go inside first.

606
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,540
Open a small gap for me.

607
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,380
These insects

608
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,580
are thirsty for blood.

609
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:24,590
That shirt will keep them occupied.

610
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,300
You should let me do it instead.

611
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,970
It sounds quiet.

612
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,800
I'll check it out.

613
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,960
Even if there's only one left,

614
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,600
we will die if we go outside.

615
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,770
Let me check it out.

616
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,640
The Corpse Bugs didn't come for us.

617
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,110
They were going in our direction.

618
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,770
Here.

619
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:20,930
Give me your hand.

620
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,420
You saved my life

621
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,710
back at the campsite.

622
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
It's not a big deal.

623
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,810
It was my duty.

624
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,210
I'm not going to thank you.

625
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,670
Under such an emergency,

626
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,870
you should prioritise your own life.

627
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,260
Saving a partner without certainty

628
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,710
may cause greater damage.

629
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,620
Nonetheless, I won't leave
my partner alone.

630
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,220
That's your problem.

631
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,750
Let's go.

632
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,840
Wait up.

633
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,340
Something doesn't smell right.

634
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,330
A lizard?

635
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,160
A gerbil?

636
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,180
A snake.

637
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,860
Look, human bones.

638
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,780
How did they die?

639
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,900
They suffocated to death.

640
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,380
Suffocated to death?

641
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:55,790
They are wrapped in these webs.

642
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,670
They are hyphae.

643
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:04,530
Hyphae?

644
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,410
Yes.

645
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:18,654
