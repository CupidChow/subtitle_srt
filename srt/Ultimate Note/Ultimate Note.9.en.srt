1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,860
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,759
<i>Episode 9</i>

4
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,820
I never imagined

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,979
a python could put us in such a mess.

6
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,100
How much equipment do we have left?

7
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,300
Whatever is left isn't enough.

8
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:57,979
Also,

9
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,979
Zhang lost his sword.

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,620
It's a real loss.

11
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,720
I'll try to find

12
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,370
your Black Golden Ancient Sword.

13
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,170
Wu Xie,

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,640
before you do that,

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,960
can you please try

16
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,160
to soothe my broken heart?

17
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,280
A chubby guy like you

18
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,600
needs a beating or two.

19
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,040
Let's take a break.

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
Then we'll go back for our equipment.

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,290
Ah Ning,

22
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,120
just make do with what we have.

23
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,320
It's too risky to go back.

24
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
It's not just the equipment,

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
but the provisions, too.

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,200
We must survive in this rainforest

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,000
before we find Wu San Xing.

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,680
It's easy for you to say.

29
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,920
We were running like

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
headless chickens from the python.

31
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,360
We don't even know where

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,240
we lost our equipment.

33
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,400
When the python chased us,

34
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,880
many trees were
destroyed along the way.

35
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,760
We should be able to find it

36
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
by following the trail.

37
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,840
We'll move out in five minutes.

38
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,640
Yes, sir.

39
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,840
Ah Ning, come here quickly!

40
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
What's wrong?

41
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Ah Ning!

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Ah Ning!

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,680
Ah Ning!

44
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,850
I...

45
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,370
I...

46
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,370
That's right,

47
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,390
leave all these with her.

48
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,690
<i>I'll go with you.</i>

49
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,170
<i>He cares about your life.</i>

50
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,390
<i>I don't.</i>

51
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,050
<i>Go down first.</i>

52
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,650
<i>Wu Xie.</i>

53
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,810
<i>What's wrong?</i>

54
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,450
<i>You want to kill me, don't you?</i>

55
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,250
<i>If it was in the past,</i>

56
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,330
<i>I would not hesitate to kill</i>

57
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,650
<i>in order to survive.</i>

58
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,350
Ms Ah Ning,

59
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,010
life and death is in fate's hands.

60
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,270
Rest in peace.

61
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,130
Wu Xie,

62
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,650
let's go.

63
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:56,570
Wu Xie,

64
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,730
you're not carrying Ah Ning

65
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,610
to the Palace, are you?

66
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,690
Yes.

67
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,650
She came for the Palace.

68
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,250
I'll carry you too if you die.

69
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,090
Since we entered the rainforest,

70
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,450
we haven't found a single marking.

71
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,679
We're also running out of food.

72
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,610
If we don't join Wu San Xing soon,

73
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,580
we'll have to subsist on wildlife.

74
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,090
We can have a barbecue.

75
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,440
That's not a bad idea.

76
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,770
Can you smell it?

77
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,890
It's poisonous gas.

78
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,970
Let's get out of here!

79
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,250
Ah Ning,

80
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,450
I promised

81
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,770
to take you to the Queen Mother's Palace.

82
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,170
Wu Xie,

83
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,410
slow down a bit.

84
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,170
Wu Xie, look.

85
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,250
That's...

86
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
Let's go.

87
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,210
It's easy to get lost in the rainforest.

88
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,740
Master Hua'er,

89
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,820
don't get left behind.

90
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,070
Don't worry,

91
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,360
I won't be a hindrance.

92
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,920
Oh my god.

93
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,080
Could this be the ruins of the
Queen Mother's Palace?

94
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,950
Most likely.

95
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,960
This piece of rock that we're standing on

96
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,920
should be a part of the underwater statue.

97
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,240
Its motif looks ancient.

98
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,360
Must be the remnant
of the Queen Mother's Palace.

99
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,900
This underwater sculpture

100
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,620
could be a statue in the fortress.

101
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,420
Its purpose

102
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,420
was to intimidate incoming envoys.

103
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,680
Makes sense.

104
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,620
Back then,

105
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,620
the Queen Mother was the
spiritual leader of the western region.

106
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,650
Her palace had to be decked out.

107
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,920
This is spectacular.

108
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,240
But

109
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,060
how did the palace end up underwater?

110
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,480
It's said that the palace was abandoned

111
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,480
after the Queen Mother's kingdom fell.

112
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,540
As time passed,

113
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,100
the drainage system failed.

114
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,700
The underground water gushed up

115
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,260
and mud flowed into the palace.

116
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,900
Thus, the palace sank under water.

117
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,100
The Queen Mother's Palace
should be massive.

118
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,500
What we're seeing now

119
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,700
is only a small part of it.

120
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,020
But it has already sunk into the mud.

121
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,990
How do we get in?

122
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,220
Wu Xie,

123
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,800
you've been carrying
Ah Ning the whole journey

124
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,160
without letting us help.

125
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,060
I think

126
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,620
we should camp nearby for the night.

127
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,900
We'll think of something tomorrow.

128
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,380
I agree! I'm exhausted.

129
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,460
Let's go.

130
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,180
The Palace of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

131
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,460
We're finally here.

132
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,980
You've been poisoned by the gas.

133
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
What are you doing?

134
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,330
It hurts!

135
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,850
It hurts!

136
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Master Hua'er,

137
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,060
you're really dependable.

138
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,540
Enough talk. Let's go.

139
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,340
What's wrong?

140
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,580
I'm stuck in the swamp.

141
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,980
This isn't a swamp,

142
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,580
it's a snake's corpse pit.

143
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,100
Master Hua'er, what are you waiting for?

144
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,160
Do you want to die with me?

145
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
Don't move.

146
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,150
Hold on to this.

147
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,200
At this rate,

148
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,510
I'll sink even deeper.

149
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
Look!

150
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,140
A miasma.

151
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,970
Miasma is the most poisonous gas.

152
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,180
We're doomed.

153
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,260
Come!

154
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,260
Just leave me.

155
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,390
Cut this rope.

156
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,580
Are you sure?

157
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,460
Before you leave,
tie this rope to the tree.

158
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,060
Why aren't you leaving?

159
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,420
Lean on your back to
maximise your surface area.

160
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,350
I'll pull you out.

161
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,150
How much are you charging me?

162
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,380
Stop with your nonsense!

163
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,020
Be gentle, okay?

164
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,100
Shut up.

165
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,410
One, two, three!

166
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
Pan Zi!

167
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,980
What's the matter, Wu Xie?

168
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,340
Why is Ah Ning's sleeping bag open?

169
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,500
When we were asleep,

170
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,020
something must've crawled over.

171
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
There are footprints.

172
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,910
That thing is still here.

173
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Fatty!

174
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,460
Fatty!

175
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,860
Fatty!

176
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,660
There are footprints here too.

177
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,380
What is it?

178
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,150
Tiger keelback.

179
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,240
That scared me to death.

180
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,599
Luckily, I was smart enough

181
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
not to move.

182
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,930
Otherwise, I'd be dead.

183
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,140
This place is so scary.

184
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,630
Could this sleeping bag
be opened by the snake?

185
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,300
No,

186
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,860
these are human footprints.

187
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,860
Who's there?

188
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,450
Stop chasing.

189
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:48,530
We can't catch up.

190
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,720
That guy doesn't look that big.

191
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,560
And he runs in the water
like a rabbit.

192
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,760
He was scared of us.

193
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,460
Looks like a human.

194
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
Fatty, let's head back for the equipment.

195
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,460
Wu Xie,

196
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Zhang knows what he's doing.

197
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,120
We'll be of no help even if we go.

198
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,240
He's right, Wu Xie.

199
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,780
Why don't we head back
and wait for him?

200
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Oh no!

201
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,060
Wu Xie!

202
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,140
Wu Xie!

203
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,020
Where's Ah Ning?

204
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,840
Don't tell me the snake
took her body away.

205
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,170
It's possible.

206
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,250
And by the looks of it,
there was more than one.

207
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,920
We've only been gone a short while.

208
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,840
Ah Ning must still be nearby.

209
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,900
I'm going to look for her.

210
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,050
Wu Xie,

211
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,140
there are hundreds of snakes.

212
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,380
-It's too dangerous.
-We can't leave her in the snake pit.

213
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,160
Only the living is human.

214
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,620
Once they're dead, they're flesh.

215
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,690
There is no way

216
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,410
for us to take her back now.

217
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,220
That's the fate she chose.

218
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,980
<i>What would you do
if you were not in this field?</i>

219
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
<i>I'd rather die.</i>

220
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,100
He's right, Wu Xie.

221
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,940
If I die

222
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,340
someday,

223
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,820
just cremate me.

224
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,940
Don't leave me to the snakes.

225
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020
Who knows what they'll do to my body?

226
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Anyhow,

227
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,060
we must leave this place right away.

228
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,580
If the snakes return,

229
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,300
the three of us can't hold out
even for a few minutes.

230
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,650
If we meet Ah Ning in hell,

231
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,570
she'll definitely laugh at us.

232
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
He's right, Wu Xie.

233
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,290
We should find a safer place

234
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,950
and wait for Zhang's return.

235
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,340
You can come out.

236
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,580
Is everything going smoothly?

237
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,980
Remember,

238
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,060
Wu Xie must enter the Palace of
the Heavenly Queen Mother.

239
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,160
If only there's a wild fowl
or a rabbit.

240
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,080
Some chilli powder, some cumin,

241
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
and they'd be perfect.

242
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,900
Wu Xie,

243
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,380
something was fishy about
the mud man last night.

244
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,980
Did something happen to Zhang?

245
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,500
He'll be fine.

246
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,780
Enough,

247
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,900
stop pretending.

248
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,900
If you're worried about him,

249
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,300
just tell me.

250
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,500
I'll help you find him.

251
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Pan Zi,

252
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,140
we'll just wait for Zhang here.

253
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,420
Why don't you send a signal to Uncle San?

254
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,880
Okay.

255
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,980
If Master San sees it,

256
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,060
he'll definitely respond.

257
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,650
As long as Uncle San responds,

258
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,700
things will be much easier.

259
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Wu Xie,

260
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,980
there's no response at all.

261
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,470
Wu Xie,

262
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,580
is your Uncle San abandoning you?

263
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,620
Look!

264
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,780
A response!

265
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
That's great.

266
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,540
The smoke is red.

267
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,800
What does it mean?

268
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,020
It means they are in danger.

269
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,540
We must go there quickly.

270
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,740
Zhang will head there
when he sees the smoke.

271
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,860
Look.

272
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,860
A smoke signal.

273
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,460
It must be Master San.

274
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,860
They are in danger.

275
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,660
No, look.

276
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,040
Why is there another one there?

277
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,500
Do you know which one
belongs to Wu San Xing?

278
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,460
No, I don't.

279
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,840
But the red smoke indicates
that they are in danger.

280
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,540
The red smoke is nearer to us.

281
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Let's go and take a look.

282
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Let's go.

283
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,940
This smoke won't last for long.

284
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,310
The rainforest is huge

285
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,960
and there's no smoke signal.

286
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,450
Can we still find Uncle San and the rest?

287
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,600
I've marked several reference points.

288
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,590
If we follow this,

289
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,720
we should be able to find
Master San and the rest.

290
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,580
Then we should go now.

291
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,260
Master San could be in danger

292
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,740
and you two are wasting time?

293
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,780
He might already be...

294
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,580
Okay, I'll shut up.

295
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
A smoke signal.

296
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,140
But it's not from your camp.

297
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,060
Wu San Xing.

298
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,700
-I need to leave.
-Wait.

299
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,700
We still don't know what

300
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
or where it is.

301
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,300
But it must be among
the team members.

302
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
At least

303
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,830
it's not Wu Xie.

304
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,180
Then what about the rest?

305
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,820
You know

306
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,330
we can't take the risk.

307
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,410
I can't let Wu Xie
face the danger by himself.

308
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,610
The snake attacked the guard.

309
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,090
I'll go there and take a look.

310
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,320
Wait here and prepare to back me up.

311
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,660
Master San,

312
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,700
you still got it.

313
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,580
If you came any later,

314
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,980
I'd be dead.

315
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,090
Don't be mad.

316
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,860
Better late than never, am I right?

317
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,860
Save us first.

318
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
Master San.

319
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Okay.

320
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,980
What are you looking at?

321
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,460
I burped out of hunger.

322
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,180
Am I not allowed to be hungry?

323
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,060
Hunger is a psychological instinct.

324
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,580
I can't live without meat.

325
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,420
But now, I have to live off this junk.

326
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,810
My taste buds are protesting.

327
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,260
Pan Zi,

328
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,020
why don't we hunt a couple
of birds for some meat?

329
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,200
This is the nest of the tiger keelback.

330
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,090
Do you think they'll...

331
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,460
I thought something

332
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,830
wasn't quite right.

333
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,680
Turns out the tiger keelback
has disappeared.

334
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,100
Isn't this a good thing?

335
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,380
What? Are you planning
to greet these snakes?

336
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,260
Hey, snakes.

337
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,580
Have you eaten?

338
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,540
This is what I'm worried about.

339
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,380
There could be something
more dangerous than the snakes.

340
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,100
The tiger keelback was bad enough,

341
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,600
and you're saying there's
something worse?

342
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,380
No matter what,

343
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,180
we shouldn't hang around.

344
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,330
We should move quickly

345
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,610
and join Master San.

346
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,640
Just bear with it.

347
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,520
Have some more hardtack, okay?

348
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,440
When we go back,

349
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,360
I'll buy you hot pot, roast duck and lamb.

350
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,060
Stop talking big.

351
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,780
You'll just try to pacify me

352
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
with instant noodles again.

353
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,630
You didn't burn yourself, did you?

354
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,980
I'm fine.

355
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,180
Thanks to the linoleum.

356
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,920
I told you to mind

357
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,280
your own family's business.

358
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,100
Why did you follow us here?

359
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,940
Master San, I have something to ask you.

360
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,520
Youngsters like you

361
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,480
just can't curb your curiosities.

362
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,680
You said this job would be easy.

363
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,740
Instead, we got injured.

364
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,210
It's been days,

365
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,790
we're nowhere near our destination,

366
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,150
and I'm half a squad down.

367
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,300
You said you know
your way around the forest.

368
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,500
My foot!

369
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,300
Camping near a snake den.

370
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,860
Do you even have a brain?

371
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,940
What are you doing?

372
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,860
Why are you washing your
hands near where I'm sitting?

373
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,850
Look, it's all wet!

374
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,410
I'll feed you to the snakes!

375
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,600
Boss, the ground doesn't collect water.

376
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,820
Touch it if you don't believe me.

377
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,920
Do you take me for an idiot?

378
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,460
If I knew it was this hellhole,

379
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,820
I wouldn't have come
for thrice the pay.

380
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,870
Let me have some water.

381
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,460
Oh...

382
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,740
My hand slipped.

383
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,090
Oh, no.

384
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,550
It slipped again.

385
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,780
You're trembling?

386
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,060
I think you're just trying
to pick a fight.

387
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,660
Master Hua'er,

388
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,840
calm down.

389
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,260
When you're away from home,

390
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,300
harmony brings wealth.

391
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Am I right?

392
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
Enough.

393
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,240
He's right, it doesn't collect water.

394
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,420
Order your men to start digging.

395
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,800
Start digging.

396
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Okay.

397
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,620
This statue looks ominous.

398
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,420
This is too sinister.

399
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,500
Let's get out of here quickly.

400
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,380
It's not just me, right?

401
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,460
I hear it too.

402
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Sinister.

403
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,020
It's too sinister.

404
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,180
Let's leave!

405
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,220
Let's check it out.

406
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,330
Let me do it.

407
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,620
Be careful down there.

408
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,000
Pull the rope if you're in danger.

409
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,080
The statue wasn't facing us, was it?

410
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,240
I told you that statue looked sinister.

411
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,860
It was facing that way just now.

412
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,500
How did it turn around?

413
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,740
Now I've seen everything.

414
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,430
Run!

415
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,740
I can't run anymore.

416
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,820
I'm too tired.

417
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,060
I don't care what they are.

418
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,580
They're going down!

419
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
Get up quickly.

420
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,180
When we came,

421
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
these weren't around, right?

422
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,980
Fatty, looks like we'll do as you say.

423
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,480
Let's fight them off!

424
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,100
These moths are poisonous.

425
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Run quickly!

426
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,450
It's a dead end.

427
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,160
This way!

428
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,620
That hurts.

429
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,560
I'm sorry.

430
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,280
It's not that I don't trust your friends.

431
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:38,860
Just that I must be vigilant.

432
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,320
Looks like they've left.

433
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,840
I distinctly remember

434
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,430
each person only got one canned food

435
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,620
and one self-heating rice.

436
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,880
Wu Xie left this for me.

437
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,940
<i>Zhang,</i>

438
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,220
<i>we're off to look for Uncle San.</i>

439
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,460
<i>The rainforest is dangerous.</i>

440
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,540
<i>Be careful.</i>

441
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,740
They lack the experience.

442
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,520
But it's hiding among the team.

443
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,220
We must not take the risk.

444
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,740
Follow them.

445
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,710
You mean follow and
protect them in secret?

446
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,200
Wait.

447
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Take this way.

448
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,950
That's indeed the shortest route.

449
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,150
But it passes through

450
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,590
the most dangerous
and forbidden area here.

451
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,590
To get to Wu San Xing's camp,

452
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,230
we must take this detour.

453
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
But they have no clue.

454
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,740
They'll take a shortcut.

455
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,350
How far?

456
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,350
About one hour on foot.

457
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,620
The moths didn't follow us, did they?

458
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,330
I think so.

459
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,610
I almost end up as roasted meat skewers.

460
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,530
Wu Xie,

461
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,970
what did you touch?

462
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,820
Looks like a pressure sensor.

463
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,760
Whenever an animal falls down,
the trap would activate,

464
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,100
and the blades would impale it
like a meat skewer.

465
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,650
Is this the Queen Mother's Palace?

466
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,390
Why is there a booby trap?

467
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,870
It's blood.

468
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,270
Wu Xie,

469
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,350
there's blood all over the ground.

470
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,360
This isn't the palace.

471
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,550
It's an altar for sacrifice.

472
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,630
An altar?

473
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:38,770
For whom?

474
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,760
The Heavenly Queen Mother, probably.

475
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,510
Look.

476
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
It's all depicted here.

477
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,470
They threw humans and
animals down here alive

478
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,630
as sacrifice for the
Heavenly Queen Mother.

479
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,310
She must be one conceited queen

480
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,360
to actually build an altar for herself.

481
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,270
No one builds an altar for himself.

482
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,180
This must've been built

483
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,520
by the Queen's people

484
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,760
in order to worship her.

485
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,990
Look at this.

486
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,910
They even carved out

487
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,470
the escape route for us.

488
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,150
The Heavenly Queen Mother's
people were pretty generous.

489
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,200
That statue should be the way out.

490
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,530
But it's too high.

491
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,240
It's difficult to climb up there.

492
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,760
I don't think it's that simple.

493
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,260
Think about it,

494
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,390
if this is where the offerings were made,

495
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,030
there should be a lot of
skeletons on the ground.

496
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,140
But there are only blood
stains and no bones.

497
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,820
They've cleaned them up.

498
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,450
Don't tell me the Queen Mother's subjects

499
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,770
carved out these
murals just to deceive us.

500
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,030
Something's not right.

501
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,430
Watch out!

502
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,140
Master Hua'er!

503
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,270
Master Hua'er!

504
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,510
Xie Yu Chen!

505
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,590
What?

506
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,200
What happened?

507
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,310
Nothing!

508
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,440
Then why did you pull
the rope for nothing?

509
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,460
I slipped, okay?

510
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,350
Einstein once said,

511
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,390
"Give me a fulcrum,"

512
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,460
"and I shall move the world!"

513
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,110
But I say,
