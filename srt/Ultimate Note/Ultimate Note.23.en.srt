1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,910
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,700
<i>Episode 23</i>

4
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,509
It's been quite a while.

5
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,770
Wu Xie has no experience in scuba diving.

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,820
I have every reason

7
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,550
to believe that he has faced danger
in the water.

8
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,460
Our boss said...

9
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,590
Whatever your boss has to say,

10
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,280
tell him to say it to my face.

11
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,200
Or else, I'd go to him personally

12
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,410
and hear what he has to say.

13
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,700
He has to give me
a reasonable explanation.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,850
Sorry,

15
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,680
but my friend's life is at stake.

16
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,190
I can't just stand by

17
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,690
and let it happen.

18
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,820
Hurry up!

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,780
Here!

20
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,760
Hurry up!

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,590
Hurry!

22
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,920
Find something to block the door!

23
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,190
Quick!

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
Get out of the way!

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,450
This is so weird.

26
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,730
Did you realize that

27
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,890
the witch chasing after us

28
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,480
looks a bit like Chen Wen Jin?

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,460
You must've been mistaken.

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,600
-How is that possible?
-There's no way I'm mistaken!

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
I'll never forget

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,860
a woman's figure.

33
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,050
I can't be completely sure,

34
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,660
but I'm pretty certain it's her!

35
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,680
How did she

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,310
come all the way here from Tamutuo?

37
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,610
What is this place?

38
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,560
Isn't this Zhang family's old pavilion?

39
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,660
No,

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,950
this place

41
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,610
looks a lot like Golmud Sanatorium.

42
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,020
We're in Guangxi!

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,490
How is it possible that
the Golmud Sanatorium is in Guangxi?

44
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,000
Look,

45
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,640
it's really the Golmud Sanatorium!

46
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,690
Even the passage is exactly the same

47
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,810
as I saw it before!

48
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,760
Is Golmud Sanatorium

49
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,140
really located inside

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,790
the Zhang family's old pavilion?

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,260
How did we suddenly

52
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,300
get here from Guangxi?

53
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,079
As you said,

54
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,590
he had been down there for a long time.

55
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,710
He could have fainted

56
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,530
at the bottom of the lake

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,220
or something happened.

58
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,430
He hasn't run out of oxygen yet.

59
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,320
My thought is that he is heading in

60
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,620
the right direction

61
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,660
and he's looking for the right thing.

62
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,440
What are you looking for

63
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,130
that is more important than
someone's life?

64
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,740
Take it easy, man.

65
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,220
I'll send my man

66
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,990
down for him before it's too late.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,880
I'm not going to risk

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,450
losing my partner.

69
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,120
How could I trust you now?

70
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,350
If you don't want your man to go down,

71
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,310
then I'll go down by myself.

72
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,230
I'm not going to

73
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,630
leave my friend in danger,

74
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,980
understood?

75
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,240
He's my big boss,

76
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,860
I have to protect him.

77
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,230
Wait a minute, please.

78
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,130
How do you feel about

79
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,030
getting paid a bit more?

80
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,200
Where are you going?

81
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,170
To steal the equipment.

82
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,050
Steal the equipment?

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,520
What equipment?
How are you going to do it?

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,550
Did you not understand
what Cox Hendry said?

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,040
He wants to risk Wu Xie's life

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,220
so that he can find what he wants.

87
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,540
We'll disrupt his plans if we go in.

88
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,500
That's why he'll never

89
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,400
give us the diving equipment

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,400
to save them.

91
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,860
Do you think it's that easy?

92
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,590
Cox Hendry brought many men with him.

93
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,710
If his mind is set on not letting us go,

94
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,560
we have no choice but to take
the equipment by force.

95
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,350
Do you think we have

96
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,380
any chance against them?

97
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,710
We'll take it by force, then.

98
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,960
I can't possibly let Wu Xie die.

99
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,800
But I was paid

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,870
to protect you.

101
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,060
Are you trying to stop me?

102
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,920
Can I stop you?

103
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,650
Listen to me,

104
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,120
how could I possibly
let anything happen to Wu Xie?

105
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,220
I still have to collect the retainage
from his second uncle.

106
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,260
Take your dirty hands off me.

107
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,760
I can understand your feelings,

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,190
but you mustn't act rashly.

109
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,650
Cox Hendry has so many men with him.

110
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,600
We'll stand to lose

111
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,940
if we were to fight with them.

112
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,659
So, you're saying...

113
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,900
I'm saying...

114
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,500
Hold on a second.

115
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,750
Is the Golmud Sanatorium

116
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,280
built based on the structure
of Zhang family's old pavilion?

117
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,960
And the videotape I received,

118
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,680
was it recorded in Golmud

119
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,260
or here?

120
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,670
Can the door hold up?

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,680
Is she seriously breaking in?

122
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,240
Let's go!

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,659
Stop wondering whether
it is Golmud or Mudgol!

124
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,820
We have to leave,

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,890
or else...

126
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:55,810
It really is Chen Wen Jin.

127
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,620
Why is Aunt Wen Jin here?

128
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,460
When did she get out from Tamutuo?

129
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,300
Could it be...

130
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,470
It smells familiar.

131
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
It smells like Huo Ling, doesn't it?

132
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,960
It's a sign that I'll undergo changes

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,940
soon after.

134
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,510
My body

135
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,690
will skip the step of dying

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,260
and straight away

137
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,210
turn into a monster.

138
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,110
She has mutated too.

139
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,810
Then, she came here.

140
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,720
Let's go.

141
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,870
As expected,

142
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,770
the black coffin is here.

143
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,950
Expected?

144
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,090
Did you know there's a coffin here?

145
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,570
This place is exactly the same

146
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,860
as the Golmud Sanatorium.

147
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,570
Wu Xie, do you want to die?

148
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,680
It might be another witch!

149
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:09,430
Who are you?

150
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,780
Zhang,

151
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,670
why is Wu Xie chatting with the witch?

152
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,810
Or should I ask,

153
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,040
who am I?

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,510
<i>Wu Xie,</i>

155
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,930
<i>you don't exist in this world.</i>

156
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,630
<i>You don't exist.</i>

157
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,190
<i>You're dead already,</i>

158
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,540
<i>Wu Xie.</i>

159
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,140
Wu Xie!

160
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,470
Wu Xie,

161
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,490
how come the witch looks exactly like you

162
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,390
and disappears in an instant?

163
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,320
Who...

164
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,420
Who exactly am I?

165
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,930
This place is weird,

166
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,130
we should leave quickly.

167
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,840
Let's go.

168
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,590
I'd been to this room.

169
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,070
I found Chen Wen Jin's notes

170
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,590
in a room exactly like this.

171
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,310
How is this possible?

172
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,360
Did Chen Wen Jin

173
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,990
use two separate notebooks

174
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,130
and divide them into two volumes?

175
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:44,870
<i>Notebook</i>

176
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,290
I don't know who you are
among the three of you.

177
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,260
<i>No matter who you are,</i>

178
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,040
<i>when you found the notes here,</i>

179
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,000
I believe you're already involved.

180
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,860
Does it have the same content?

181
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,320
Even if the Golmud Sanatorium

182
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,280
was built based on this structure,

183
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,560
there's no way they would produce

184
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,740
the exact same handwriting.

185
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,130
It doesn't make sense!

186
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,550
Think about

187
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,530
everything we'd encountered.

188
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,890
None of them

189
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,990
make sense.

190
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,750
Someone's here.

191
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,580
I'm your man!

192
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,970
Your man.

193
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,110
Shades?

194
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,820
You all are really here.

195
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,240
Master Hua'er has come as well.

196
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,060
Everyone's here today.

197
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,130
We followed Wu Xie here to save you,

198
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,480
but he came here first.

199
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,660
I was worried about him,

200
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,790
so I came down, too.

201
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,920
I've been calling you over the intercom.

202
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,910
Did you hear me?

203
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,240
No, that's why

204
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,500
we came here to look for you.

205
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,720
We followed your position

206
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,720
and Zhang's marks all the way here.

207
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,240
We didn't expect you to be here.

208
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,630
However,

209
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,110
how are we going to get out?

210
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,450
Do they recognize my marks?

211
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,650
I never tell them.

212
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,380
Only one person knows the marks, is it?

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,230
Alright, stop fooling around

214
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,340
and get down to business.

215
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,730
Cox Hendry finally admitted.

216
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,660
The thing he's searching for

217
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,380
is in a black coffin.

218
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,350
Has he been lying to me?

219
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,570
He buttered me up so that

220
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,900
I would come here alone.

221
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,660
What's his intention?

222
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,210
You need not know his intention.

223
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,920
Since we've found Zhang and Fatty,

224
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,450
let's take the thing outside

225
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,780
and give it to Cox Hendry.

226
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,660
Then we'll go

227
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,540
our separate ways.

228
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,660
The thing is out there,

229
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,780
let's go and take a look.

230
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,600
The thing in the coffin

231
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,550
is what Cox Hendry
has been looking for decades.

232
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,770
Let's open it and see.

233
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,170
We should check if it's valuable.

234
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,540
Don't simply give it to others.

235
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,140
Wu Xie,

236
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,420
stay here.

237
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,900
Every time you open a coffin,

238
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,700
something bad happens.

239
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,320
Alright, everyone.

240
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,300
Give me a hand.

241
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,670
Wu Xie,

242
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,990
guess what

243
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,050
is inside the coffin?

244
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,380
Is it

245
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,730
the Bronze Fox Mask?

246
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,220
Clever boy.

247
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,360
It's the fox mask Tie Mian Sheng wore

248
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,430
when we saw him

249
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,820
in the tomb of

250
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,540
Seven Star Palace.

251
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,140
So this is what Cox Hendry
has been looking for.

252
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,560
I don't understand,

253
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,610
what does it have to do
with the Law of Longevity?

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,240
When I put on the mask back then,

255
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,870
I had hallucinations.

256
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,560
I almost killed you

257
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,000
and you almost killed me too.

258
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,100
Put them down.

259
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,250
Well, am I immortal now?

260
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,900
Take it off!

261
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,070
Take off Xiao Hua's mask!

262
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,180
Got it!

263
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,990
As I said,

264
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,690
these fox masks are a bad sign.

265
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,170
Touch wood!

266
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,180
I had a strange feeling.

267
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,680
How could Chen Wen Jin

268
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,900
have had two notebooks?

269
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,780
Even if they duplicated it,

270
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,470
it couldn't be exactly the same.

271
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,970
Since Chen Wen Jin
went into the Jade Meteorite,

272
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,950
she wouldn't have become a witch.

273
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,690
Not to mention coming to this place.

274
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,920
So,

275
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,450
Xiao Hua and Shades never appeared.

276
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,040
This is an illusion.

277
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,020
Illusion?

278
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,010
Did you figure it out long ago?

279
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,110
No wonder you seemed strange

280
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,540
when I talked to you before.

281
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,820
You asked me what was in the coffin

282
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,800
and I purposely answered

283
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,030
Bronze Fox Masks.

284
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,580
And the masks

285
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,330
really appeared in the coffin.

286
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,680
You're saying that

287
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,670
we'll see

288
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,800
what we want to see.

289
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,410
It's an illusion indeed.

290
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,160
When did the illusion start?

291
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:49,590
From the moment Xiao Hua
and Shades appeared,

292
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,480
we were already in the illusion.

293
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,540
Hold it.

294
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,250
Cox Hendry

295
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,580
talked to me just now.

296
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,000
He wanted me to tie you up

297
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,500
so you won't go in the lake.

298
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,859
I'm such a kind person.

299
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,540
How could I do that?

300
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,839
So,

301
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,720
I pretend to agree to him.

302
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,579
When he let down his guard later,

303
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,960
we'll go steal the equipment

304
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,760
and I'll go in the lake with you.

305
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,859
Isn't this

306
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,710
a perfect plan?

307
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,590
Come,

308
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,570
try to break it.

309
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,270
Do you have to go this far?

310
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,440
Of course,

311
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,920
Cox Hendry is too clever.

312
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,980
The rope is specially made for you

313
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,500
and your Bone Shrinking Art.

314
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,320
Would he believe it
if it doesn't seem real?

315
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,900
Don't take it too far.
Go steal a car quickly.

316
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,220
Wu Xie's been in the water for too long.

317
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Stop wasting time.

318
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,350
Let me take a break.

319
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,310
You've tied him up?

320
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,570
Yes.

321
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,480
Don't worry,

322
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,260
your boss paid a fortune.

323
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,240
I'll make sure it's worth every penny.

324
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,810
Here.

325
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,080
Thank you.

326
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,890
How awesome you are,

327
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,220
you're working for Cox Hendry now.

328
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,860
You sure don't miss any opportunity
to make money.

329
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,170
Life got in the way,

330
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,740
it's not easy for me either.

331
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,470
Alright, eat...

332
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,650
There's no capsicum.

333
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,630
Take a bite.

334
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,890
Fine.

335
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,520
Is it necessary to rack your brain

336
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,740
to deceive me?

337
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,100
My new employer, Cox Hendry

338
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,220
paid me to keep an eye on you,

339
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,380
so that we won't go in the lake.

340
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,050
Do you think

341
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,040
he's concerned about our safety?

342
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,730
No,

343
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,580
he's afraid that we'll disrupt his plan

344
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,360
to find the Zhang family's old pavilion.

345
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,500
If we insist on going in the lake,

346
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,850
he'll surely get in our way.

347
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,590
In that case,

348
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,130
why don't we take a break here

349
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,650
and earn some money?

350
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,680
My new employer, Cox Hendry entrusted me

351
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,580
to talk about business with you.

352
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,500
If you don't disrupt his plan,

353
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,710
he'll give you

354
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,540
something you want

355
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,890
as a reward.

356
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,880
What is the thing?

357
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,210
My new employer, Cox Hendry said

358
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,050
he'll only give it to you

359
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,800
when the mission is over

360
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,360
or when it has failed.

361
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,460
My old employer, Master Wu Er

362
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,090
paid me to protect you too.

363
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,070
So,

364
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,650
for the sake of my new employer

365
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,050
and old employer,

366
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,760
I can't let you go.

367
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,520
Have you ever considered

368
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,120
that your new employer

369
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,670
doesn't even care about our lives?

370
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,430
He wouldn't care about
Wu Xie's life either.

371
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,720
My new employer doesn't care,

372
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,420
but my old employer cares about it.

373
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,790
Master Wu Er

374
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,700
wouldn't let anything happen to Wu Xie.

375
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,670
Don't forget that

376
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,950
I'm also your employer.

377
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,110
Yes, Mr Xie.

378
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,250
I've safely escorted you to Guangxi.

379
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,420
Your order

380
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,190
is completed.

381
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,430
The illusion must've started from here.

382
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,700
Someone's here.

383
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,660
I'm your man!

384
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,840
Shades?

385
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,600
You all are really here.

386
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,060
Master Hua'er has come as well.

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,790
Everyone's here today.

388
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,570
We followed your position

389
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,670
and Zhang's marks all the way here.

390
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,240
We didn't expect you to be here.

391
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,840
It's impossible

392
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,860
for Xiao Hua and Shades

393
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,190
to know about Zhang's marks.

394
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,760
All four of them

395
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,260
don't exist.

396
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,060
When did I enter into the illusion?

397
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,200
I major in architecture.

398
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,930
Gravity should always exist.

399
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,150
There cannot be

400
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,590
two different gravities in the same space.

401
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,350
Humans cannot walk on water.

402
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,840
Ever since Zhang and Fatty appeared,

403
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,610
I was already in an illusion.

404
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,620
<i>The Queen Mother's Palace's artefacts</i>

405
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,600
<i>shouldn't be in the Zhang family's
old pavilion.</i>

406
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,900
Water surface

407
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,510
cannot become vertical.

408
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,460
<i>Right,</i>

409
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,900
<i>I heard the bell</i>

410
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,040
<i>on my way in.</i>

411
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:08,770
The Hexagon Bell.

412
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,680
Boss,

413
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,610
Wu Xie's signal is moving again.

414
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,590
Look!

415
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,950
Wu Xie.

416
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,090
Can you hear me, Wu Xie?

417
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,210
You're running out of oxygen.
Come out quickly.

418
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,000
I'll come up right now.

419
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,990
<i>SOS, follow the siphon</i>

420
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,380
Wu Xie,

421
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,180
what are you doing?
Come out quickly!

422
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,000
I found them!

423
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,680
I can't go back yet,

424
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,500
Zhang and Fatty are waiting for me.

425
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,580
I must take them home.

426
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,090
Wu Xie?

427
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,570
Wu Xie!

428
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,300
Wu Xie!

429
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,130
Wu Xie!

430
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,180
Wu Xie!

431
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,080
Wu Xie!

432
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,520
Boss,

433
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,900
he's gone through the siphon.

434
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,140
He's crazy!

435
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,170
Now we lost Wu Xie again.

436
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,710
<i>Wu Xie disappeared again.</i>

437
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,850
Do you still refuse to let me go?

438
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,290
Black!

439
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,540
Wu Xie is really in danger now,

440
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,810
aren't you going to do anything?

441
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,830
Xiao Hua,

442
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,880
are you in an idol drama?

443
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,930
He's our brother.

444
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,800
We've been through
thick and thin together!

445
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,090
Have you forgotten that?

446
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,390
Since we're all from the Mystic Nine,

447
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,000
we should unite against the enemy!

448
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,300
We must save him!

449
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,850
I promise you.

450
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,310
I promise you.

451
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,440
I promise you.

452
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,310
It's tiring to be an actor.

453
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,740
But if I do that,

454
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,520
I would suffer huge losses.

455
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,890
You can claim your loss from Wu Xie.

456
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,260
If Wu Xie refuses,

457
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,320
you can claim it from Master Wu Er.

458
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,860
Now that you've said so,

459
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,100
I can feel relieved now.

460
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,380
Let's talk about

461
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,410
what we should do next.

462
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,910
The lake

463
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,860
is at least 70 metres deep.

464
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,170
If we jump straight into the lake,

465
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,950
we'll get ourselves killed.

466
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,200
Cox Hendry has plenty of equipment.

467
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,120
We'll borrow some.

468
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Just call it stealing.

469
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,810
No need to be polite.

470
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,970
Do you know where he keeps the equipment?

471
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,700
I'm just a temp.

472
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,760
How would I know

473
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,100
such an important matter?

474
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,540
I observed his camp before.

475
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,990
All the tents are made of
defensive material.

476
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,560
He must've kept the equipment

477
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,140
in one of the tents.

478
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,360
There are so many tents

479
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,940
and all of them are guarded.

480
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,180
If we were to search the tent one by one,

481
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,650
we'll stumble right into the net.

482
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,560
We've tried everything,

483
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,780
and he still can't wake up.

484
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:45,980
Zhang,

485
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:47,920
why don't we try

486
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,340
the trick in the fairy tale?

487
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,520
You scared me.

488
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,720
Wu Xie.

489
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,270
Wu Xie,

490
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,310
what are you doing?

491
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,440
Don't be naive.

492
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,680
It's not an illusion.

493
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,940
I'd never seen you

494
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,090
in such a state,

495
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,520
so this is not an illusion.

496
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,970
If you come two days later,

497
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,980
we might have turned into an illusion.

498
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,690
I get it now.

499
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,800
You can't enter

500
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,610
the old pavilion from above.

501
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,650
This is the real entrance.

502
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:51,870
What are you talking about?

503
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,570
What old pavilion? What entrance?

504
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,480
Did you not see it before you got here?

505
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,590
At the bottom of the lake,

506
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,720
there's an ancient Chinese pavilion.

507
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,660
There was a sign that read
"Head of Zhang Family."

508
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,060
There were many bronze bells inside.

509
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,010
I was entranced as soon as I went in,

510
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,100
and I almost died.

511
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,730
I'm more confused now.

512
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:08,650
You mean there's an old pavilion
in the lake?

513
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,550
Yes, Xiao Hua and Xiu Xiu

514
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,820
found Master Buddha Zhang's map.

515
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,280
<i>China, India, Myanmar,
Thailand, Vietnam</i>

516
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,630
<i>All the locations of Zhang family's
old pavilion were marked on the map</i>

517
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,240
and this is one of the locations.

518
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,920
Zhang,

519
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,650
turns out this is your home.

520
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,550
Do you remember anything?

521
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,830
Did it remind you

522
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,430
of your childhood?

523
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
You haven't answered me.

524
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:33,960
Did you not see the old pavilion?

525
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,960
No.

526
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,330
How did you get inside then?

527
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,230
Here's what

528
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,210
had happened.

529
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,430
Zhang and I

530
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,970
had nothing to do while waiting for you,

531
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,050
so we dove under the lake

532
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,670
for the expedition team's remains.

533
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,730
As we were searching,

534
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Zhang got hungry

535
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,780
and he wanted to have fish.

536
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,880
As you know, I'm very kind-hearted.

537
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,180
So I went fishing.

538
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,780
As I was fishing,

539
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,160
I encountered the siphon passage.

540
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,130
When I opened my eyes,

541
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,370
I was already here.

542
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,770
You fell down?

543
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,020
Nice equipment you have there.

544
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,030
Who gave it to you?

545
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,370
What an amazing experience you had.

546
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,480
Come over.

547
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,320
Keep an eye on him,

548
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,420
I need to use the bathroom.

549
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,540
Right,

550
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,450
he's a good fighter.

551
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,470
Be careful

552
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,010
while keeping an eye on him.

553
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,040
Don't worry,

554
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,020
he won't escape.

555
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,290
What a great skill.

556
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,400
Did you really go to the bathroom?

557
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,380
Well,

558
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,260
I was giving you a free hand.

559
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,260
I didn't expect so many things

560
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,890
to happen while we were away.

561
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,520
Since you're missing,

562
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,540
Cox Hendry should send out
a search team, right?

563
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,310
If they come down here,

564
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,920
they'll see the old pavilion first.

565
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,830
If everything goes smoothly,

566
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,260
they will enter the pavilion

567
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,370
and be greeted by

568
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,630
the Hexagon Bell Formation.

569
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,650
<i>Just like how I was before,</i>

570
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,100
<i>they would be trapped inside as well.</i>

571
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,370
The Hexagon Bell of the Qin Mountains?

572
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,720
It's the perfect defence mechanism.

573
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,720
What does the Zhang family's
old pavilion

574
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
look like?

575
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,920
I didn't get the full view.

576
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,320
<i>I only saw the top two floors
of the building.</i>

577
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,220
<i>It looked like
an ancient Chinese pavilion.</i>

578
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,970
But the rest of the building

579
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,340
was buried at the bottom of the lake.

580
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,990
The lake is at the top of the mountain

581
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,110
while the old pavilion is at
the bottom of the lake.

582
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,250
That means the building
is right inside the mountain.

583
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,400
I'm guessing

584
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,300
the only way to the old pavilion

585
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,160
is through a siphon

586
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,440
in the mountain.

587
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,370
I never thought

588
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,320
the old pavilion would be
so brilliantly designed.

589
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,770
Siphon passage?

590
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,710
Are you saying that

591
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,370
we can go into Zhang family's
old pavilion from here?

592
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,480
Isn't it?

593
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,720
No.

594
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,890
No?

595
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,890
We've been here for a long time.

596
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,270
If we can get in through the siphon,

597
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,820
we would've done it long ago.

598
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,520
Are you telling me that

599
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,040
this is a dead end?

600
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,960
It's worse than that.

601
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,830
At least there's an entrance for you
to come to a dead end,

602
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,570
but here,

603
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,140
we only have a water entry.

604
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,780
Where did you find the giant salamander?

605
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,160
From this water entry.

606
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,910
Isn't this the metal ingot we found

607
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,090
in Zhang's old house?

608
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,570
This thing?

609
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,830
I forgot to tell you.

610
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,790
Me and Zhang discovered something.

611
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,100
The designer of this tunnel

612
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,380
had equipped the wall

613
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,600
with a trap that spits corrosive gas.

614
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,270
This metal ingot

615
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,030
is used to block the nozzle.

616
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,190
Which means,

617
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,560
even if one escapes
from the Bell Formation

618
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,320
and gets here through the siphon,

619
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,170
he's as good as dead

620
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,690
when he encounters the traps.

621
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,840
Zhang,

622
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,400
what are the treasures

623
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,510
that your family kept under the ground?

624
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,070
Why did they set up so many traps?

625
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,239
This is your home.

626
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,239
Think about it.

627
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,170
I'm a kind person.

628
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,220
How could you do this to me?

629
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,480
Of course I have to do this.

630
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,980
We must put on a convincing act.

631
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,090
That's how actors should be.

632
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,030
I'm not an actor,

633
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,130
I'm a singer.

634
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,550
You've brought a full set of equipment

635
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,960
and a flare gun.

636
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,020
Have you considered
breaking open the water entry?

637
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,470
Don't even think about it.

638
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,060
We'd thought about everything

639
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,210
that you can think of now.

640
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,280
This is granite.

641
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,670
Unless we have a hydraulic engine,

642
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,820
we can't break it open

643
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,200
manually.

644
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,860
Is the whole tunnel made up of this stone?

645
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,080
Not the living room.

646
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,190
Living room?

647
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,790
We were waiting for you at the entrance.

648
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,460
The living room

649
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,170
is right there.

650
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,260
Take it.

651
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,240
How is it,

652
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,220
Wu Xie?

653
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,210
Do you feel warmer now?

654
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,190
Wu Xie,

655
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:22,200
it's meaningful for me that you're here.

656
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,410
Most importantly,

657
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,090
I finally have someone to talk to.

658
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,110
You know

659
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,170
Zhang won't say more than three sentences.

660
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,090
I was so depressed.

661
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,940
Hey,

662
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,810
are these jades?

663
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,640
Glass type jades.

664
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,340
When I first came here,

665
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,630
I thought I could make
huge profits from it.

666
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,410
The mine is so big!

667
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,040
I would be as rich as Croesus!

668
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,400
I can buy three courtyard houses

669
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,710
on Second Ring Road!

670
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,030
One for you, one for Zhang

671
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:57,270
and one for me!
I could take Yun Cai to Beijing

672
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,800
and buy her anything

673
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,080
since I'm rich!

674
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,430
Would it kill you to stop talking?

675
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,490
What's the noise?

676
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,430
Nothing. You heard wrong.

677
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,340
Come here

678
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,380
and take a seat. It's warm here.

679
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,720
Listen to me,

680
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,410
when I first came here,

681
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,950
I thought of all the ways to spend money.

682
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,650
This is such a huge jade mine.

683
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,270
I can see it,

684
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,130
but I can't take it with me.

685
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,190
There's nothing I can do

686
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,910
but bemoan my fate.

687
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,310
Will you get real?

688
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,140
Let's think about

689
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,280
what we should do next.

690
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,320
This place was constructed by humans,

691
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,540
and so it cannot be

692
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,770
a confined space.

693
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,000
Or else, they wouldn't even
be able to come inside.

694
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,130
Something's written here.

695
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,420
<i>Danger</i>

696
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,420
Dan...

697
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,780
Danger.

698
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,230
What danger?

699
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,890
What else?

700
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,850
It must be referring to
our present situation.

701
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,100
We have no food or drink.

702
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,660
Look at my fat,

703
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,480
I'd lose them in a few days.

704
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,180
This is not how I should lose body fat.

705
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,560
Isn't this dangerous enough?

706
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,970
It's not about that.

707
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,980
What is it then?

708
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,450
Is it possible that some people are

709
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,970
trapped in the jade mine?

710
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,850
Perhaps

711
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,810
they are not human.

712
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,070
I didn't see clearly
under the dim light before.

713
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:07,210
There's a crack here.

714
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,590
We can go out if we move the jade away,

715
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,890
is it?

716
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,340
Put the fire closer.

717
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,260
There's one more.

718
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,400
These Stone Men

719
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,820
are guarding the jade mine!

720
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,710
Something's wrong.

721
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,140
How come the jade servants are so agile?

722
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,820
It's not jade,

723
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,120
but more like resin.

724
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,500
Do you mean amber?

725
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,010
No wonder they are tough.

726
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,600
Pierce through his heart!

727
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,410
Wu Xie, be careful!

728
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,450
There's another section behind the wall.

729
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,380
Turns out it's a vending machine

730
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,880
that gives out jade servants.

731
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,400
They are coming out one by one,

732
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,780
it's like a never ending battle.

733
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,110
Help.

734
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,800
He ran away.

735
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,890
Help.

736
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,100
Help.

737
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,160
Help.

738
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,020
Guards.

739
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,350
He ran away?

740
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,400
Why didn't you call for us?

741
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,900
I've been shouting the whole day,

742
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,200
but all of you ignored me.

743
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,900
Listen, I've shouted myself hoarse.

744
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,180
When did he run away?

745
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,870
Just...

746
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,030
Just now,

747
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,870
right after we lost Wu Xie's signal.

748
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,410
A great fighter like you

749
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,560
couldn't beat someone
who was tied up?

750
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,750
It's not my fault.

751
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,960
Although I have great kungfu skills,

752
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,560
I still have to answer the call of nature.

753
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,380
I went to the bathroom just now.

754
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,440
Before I left,

755
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,040
I told your men to

756
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,620
keep an eye on him.

757
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,750
But in the end,

758
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,640
he sneaked up and attacked me
when I got back.

759
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,090
Master Xiao Jiu wants to save Wu Xie.

760
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,240
He wouldn't go in the lake unequipped.

761
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,640
Check the equipment.

762
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,620
Yes.

763
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,600
Untie me.

764
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,220
<i>Storage room, no admittance</i>
<i>No smoking</i>

765
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:46,244
