1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,950
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 31</i>

4
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,680
You talked nonsense in front of
the human-faced tortoise.

5
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,280
The password you gave was wrong too.

6
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Yes.

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,720
It seems that the model

8
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,759
is not delicate enough.

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,160
No.

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,200
The workmanship of the model
is exquisite.

11
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,120
In fact, I didn't see through your trick.

12
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,720
However,

13
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,040
I have made a minor mistake

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,840
and accidentally found out the truth.

15
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it because

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,760
you didn't press the correct rivet?

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,360
The rivets drawn on the paper

18
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,360
aren't round in shape.

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,840
They are ovals.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,640
It means that from my perspective,

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,480
it should be at the side of the poles.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,720
However, I neglected the said fact.

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,160
I pressed the rivet
right in front of me instead.

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
You didn't find the right rivet,

25
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,560
but the passage opened automatically.

26
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,400
Therefore, I suspected

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,600
I was not the person
who opened the passage.

28
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,720
Someone controlled the passage in secret.

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,640
In order to examine it,

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,240
I pressed the wrong rivet on purpose.

31
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,880
Let's go.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,000
As expected,

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,520
the passage opened nevertheless.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,960
You also mentioned

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,600
the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era,

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,040
Eight Trigrams and Five Elements.

37
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,150
What trick were you playing?

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,320
Mrs Huo,

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,800
it was just a distraction.

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,160
I will write it again

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,640
and you will get it.

42
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
"Gen" symbolises the mountain.

43
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,840
"Kun" symbolises the ground.

44
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,240
The first trigram in the Readings
of the Taiping Era was "Gen,"

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
followed by

46
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,680
"Kun" and "Kan."

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,320
"Kun" represents the earth.

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,040
"Kan" represents water.

49
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,160
I'm guessing it means

50
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,560
although the human-faced tortoise
is the God of Earth,

51
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,600
it can't live without water.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,160
The human-faced tortoise
is a mystical beast.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,360
"Zhen" represents thunder.

54
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,840
It can summon the God of Thunder
and Goddess of Lightning.

55
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,230
"Qian" represents heaven.

56
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,560
It means that the human-faced tortoise
can communicate with the gods.

57
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,760
CCTV.

58
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,080
T, A, O, T, U.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,200
When I wrote it down, Fatty
immediately understood.

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,159
I wanted to say

61
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,880
we are spied.

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,960
The Huo family is trying to
get the drawing from me.

63
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,800
You looked as if you were
drawing trigrams,

64
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,720
when in fact it was Morse code.

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,400
You played the trick in front of me.

66
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,840
The Wu family always has something
up its sleeve.

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,840
Just one of my cheap tricks.

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
But sometimes,

69
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,920
cheap tricks work the best.

70
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,920
Thanks to your special arrangement,

71
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,120
I realised that the secret behind
the Yangshi Lei Archives

72
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,360
is Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

73
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,960
You are right.

74
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,440
Since you have the Yangshi Lei

75
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,280
and so much information,

76
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,960
and you want to enter
Zhang family's Old Pavilion,

77
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
then

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,440
let's work together.

79
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
Starting from Xin Yue Restaurant,

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,640
you have never planned to work with me.

81
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
I think it is a little too late

82
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,060
to talk about collaboration now.

83
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,260
If you don't agree with it,

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,120
don't blame me if I act mercilessly.

85
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Hold on.

86
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,880
Are you looking for this?

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
Yes.

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,040
Wu Xie, what are you doing?

89
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,520
Eat it.

90
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,200
Eat slowly.

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,000
I may not have brought glory

92
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,960
to the Wu family,

93
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
but I still have spine.

94
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,080
I have memorised

95
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,960
the content on the paper.

96
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,360
I would be ripped open at the worst.

97
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,400
Rip him open.

98
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Wu Xie, you will puke soon.

99
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,200
Don't move!

100
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,120
Wu Xie.

101
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,200
Is he the one

102
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,880
with the Qilin tattoo?

103
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,000
Leave.

104
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,760
Show me your hand.

105
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,640
Mrs Huo!

106
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,520
-Grandma.
-What are you doing?

107
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,800
Here.

108
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,280
Get up.

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
It's you.

110
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,960
I have no idea at all.

111
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
Mrs Huo.

112
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,400
What is going on?

113
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
You...

114
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,200
Do you still remember me?

115
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,320
That is right.

116
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,040
If you still remember me,

117
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,040
you wouldn't have come
to the Huo family.

118
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
If you come along,

119
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,720
we will succeed for sure.

120
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,440
Come.

121
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,720
This is your seat.

122
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,800
Is she getting muddle-headed

123
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
due to old age?

124
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,960
Forget it.

125
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,240
In that case,

126
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't have to hide anything
from you anymore.

127
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,400
Bring it here.

128
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,360
These blueprints were drawn
in the 25th year of Daoguang's reign.

129
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,960
The designer was Lei Si Qi.

130
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,840
I have seven pieces in total.

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,680
In the past years,

132
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,040
based on these blueprints,

133
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,400
I built that model.

134
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,960
However, I realised

135
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,760
besides the blueprints that I own

136
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
there is one more blueprint.

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,240
Because of that,

138
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,200
I couldn't crack

139
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,520
the secret of the hidden passage.

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,860
Why do you need the blueprint?

141
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,320
My master likes it.

142
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,080
We have to find it out for her.

143
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,680
Mrs Huo,

144
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,520
they carved a bunch of characters.

145
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,320
We couldn't get a clear shot

146
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
of Wu Xie's Yangshi Lei drawing.

147
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,280
It's okay.

148
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,800
Whether he takes the long way,

149
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,200
or hand it directly to me,

150
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,480
it makes no difference.

151
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
I knew about the things

152
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,280
you've just said.

153
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,680
Then do you know

154
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,040
how I got these blueprints?

155
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,920
They were hidden inside
the video tapes

156
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,280
found by Xiu Xiu.

157
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,800
As for the content of the video tapes,

158
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,840
I guess you already know.

159
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,680
You don't have to stare at me that way.

160
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,680
Perhaps everyone

161
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,840
thought that I couldn't take the pressure
due to my age.

162
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,600
I would go crazy

163
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,760
after watching the videos.

164
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,320
Though I am old,

165
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,200
I am not muddle-headed.

166
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,680
Someone tried to threaten me

167
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,640
with my daughter's life.

168
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
They forced me to go inside
Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

169
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,200
Since they are eyeing something

170
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,600
in Zhang family's Old Pavilion,

171
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,320
I must get it before them

172
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,960
so that they are left with no choice
but to appear.

173
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,720
I don't know who they are.

174
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,520
I don't know their whereabouts.

175
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
I only know that

176
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,240
none of them are kind.

177
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,280
Some of them put
my daughter's life in danger.

178
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,360
Some of them

179
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,040
fooled me for many years.

180
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,640
For my daughter,

181
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
for the whole Huo family,

182
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
for the Mystic Nine,

183
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,880
I won't easily let go of them.

184
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,640
Therefore,

185
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,440
I must enter Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

186
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,520
Because the Huo family

187
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,080
always

188
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
gets its revenge.

189
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
Grandma.

190
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,400
I have shown you

191
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,760
all the blueprints.

192
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,730
Now, you know

193
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
how I obtained the blueprints.

194
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
The Ghost Seal that you stole
from Xin Yue Restaurant

195
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,520
is still with you, right?

196
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,080
It is returned to the original owner.

197
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,080
Yangshi Lei Archives.

198
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,080
Ghost Seal.

199
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,720
Qilin.

200
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Wu Xie,

201
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,080
so you're already involved.

202
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,040
Mrs Huo.

203
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,280
What do you mean?

204
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,520
You have no choice now.

205
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,560
You must work with me.

206
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,480
In that case,

207
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,280
there is something

208
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,880
I need to figure out.

209
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,440
On the metal shelf in the old shop
belonged to the Huo family,

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,480
there was a photo taken
a few decades ago.

211
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,390
That person in the photo

212
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,680
who looks exactly the same as me

213
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,120
appeared at Golmud Sanatorium.

214
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,160
What is with that photo?

215
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,920
All the answers to the secret can be found
in Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

216
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,760
Why don't you see it for yourself?

217
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,920
You are just one step away

218
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,040
from the truth.

219
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,040
I don't trust you.

220
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,240
Take me home.

221
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,560
Let's go.

222
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,080
You don't have to chase.

223
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,440
Inform everyone that

224
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,400
we will depart three days later.

225
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Yes.

226
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,520
Zhang Qi Ling has just turned us down.

227
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,760
Don't worry.

228
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,800
They will come.

229
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,440
You, on the other hand,

230
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,880
claim that you want to work with me,

231
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,830
when in fact you just want to
help Wu Xie out.

232
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,400
You want me to bring him along.

233
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,400
I'm not trying to help him.

234
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,440
As you said,

235
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,760
Wu Xie

236
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,440
is already deeply involved.

237
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
One, two, three, four, five, six.

238
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,080
It's 260 million?

239
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,920
Why isn't it a whole number?

240
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,440
Three of you

241
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,760
are still alive

242
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
because I became your guarantor.

243
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,240
You tricked me once.

244
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,920
Let's

245
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,800
call it even.

246
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,960
We've been over this.

247
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,120
I pretended to side with Mrs Huo

248
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,120
to get the information
from the Huo family.

249
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,240
I am helping you.

250
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,760
Master Hua'er.

251
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,680
Since you're eager to help,

252
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,920
you may as well double down.

253
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
Please settle our tab

254
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
at Xin Yue Restaurant.

255
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Stop.

256
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
I am just your guarantor.

257
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,920
You have to

258
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,240
pay back the money on your own.

259
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,480
Unless

260
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,480
Wu Xie agrees to work with the Huo family.

261
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,160
Then, I shall consider helping you...

262
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
To clear the debt?

263
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,240
To buy more time for you.

264
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Otherwise,

265
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,200
if Xin Yue Restaurant
comes after you again,

266
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
I won't interfere again.

267
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,480
You are talking rubbish.

268
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,480
Zhang

269
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,080
doesn't trust Mrs Huo.

270
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,560
His sixth sense is accurate.

271
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,680
Zhang said that she can't be trusted.

272
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,200
We will not join her.

273
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,360
She can't be trusted,

274
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,360
but we have to join her.

275
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,400
What?

276
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,920
You have to agree with him, right?

277
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,440
Where is the destination?

278
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,680
Like Mrs Huo said,

279
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,800
in the upcoming mission,

280
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,840
we'll be divided into two teams.

281
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
One team will go to Banai,

282
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,120
while another team

283
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,840
will go to the Four Ladies Mountain
in Sichuan.

284
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,120
Four Ladies Mountain?

285
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Isn't Zhang family's Old Pavilion
located in Banai?

286
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,560
This mission

287
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,560
isn't a solo mission.

288
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,920
Both teams have to work together.

289
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,560
We will have to wait for

290
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,680
the instructions from Mrs Huo.

291
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
That is all.

292
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,760
By the way,

293
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,680
as for the equipment, expenses,

294
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,680
and relevant permits for this mission

295
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,440
will be borne by the Huo and Xie families.

296
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
I'll go get ready.

297
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,040
Call me if you need anything.

298
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,440
By the way,

299
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,240
since we've decided to go,

300
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,880
let's run an errand.

301
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,840
Sure.

302
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,580
<i>Commoner's Hall</i>

303
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,720
Take a look.

304
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,580
All the weapons that
can be found in the market

305
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,480
are already here.

306
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,040
Look at this Qinglong Yanyue Glaive.

307
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,230
Back in the day, Guan Yu

308
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,440
used it to vanquish his foes.

309
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,840
He was known for his loyalty
and worthiness.

310
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
You are not satisfied?

311
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,800
Look at this.

312
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,000
This was the dagger Jing Ke used

313
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,400
to assassinate Emperor Qin.

314
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,160
Is it too small?

315
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,200
It may be short,

316
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,560
but it's kind of like a sword.

317
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,240
This dagger

318
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,080
can only fool children.

319
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,800
Look at this.

320
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,560
What do you think?

321
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,480
It is not as practical as mine.

322
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,260
You two are so hard to please.

323
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,840
None of these weapons caught your fancies.

324
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,680
Mr Jin.

325
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,860
I have already shown you
the drawing of the sword.

326
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,800
You need to get me the sword
based on the drawing.

327
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,200
How dare you mention that drawing?

328
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,640
Have you seen the drawing
with your own eyes?

329
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,640
The drawing doesn't make sense.

330
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,560
Look at the handle.

331
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,600
It's so small the user would be
literally holding the blade.

332
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,600
You'd sooner cut off your
fingers than kill anyone.

333
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,080
It is not usable.

334
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,880
Why do you care if it is usable?

335
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,360
Just find it according to the drawing.

336
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,440
I am looking for a sword.

337
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
A sword!

338
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,640
I am not looking for antiques

339
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,800
or broken toys, okay?

340
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,840
Controlled weapons?

341
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,760
I can't help you out.

342
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
Listen, I don't do illegal things.

343
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,240
Fatty.

344
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,080
Do you remember Xiao Hua said,

345
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,200
the expenses and equipment
of this mission

346
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,280
will be borne by the Huo and Xie families?

347
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
Yeah.

348
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,600
So can the sword...

349
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,680
It can be considered as equipment.

350
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,560
I knew we could count on
Master Hua'er.

351
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,590
It's great to be from a rich family.

352
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,040
He gave us such a nice sword right away.

353
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
What are you doing?

354
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,880
I am leaving a mark for Zhang.

355
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,320
The first time I met Zhang,

356
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,680
my third uncle sent me a text message.

357
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
He said,

358
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,080
"Bring the Dragon's Back
and come quickly."

359
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,480
Dragon's Back?

360
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,240
Does it refer to Zhang?

361
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,320
It refers to the
Black Golden Ancient Sword.

362
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,960
We refer to the items we safekeep

363
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,440
as "Dragon's Back."

364
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,640
The sword is indeed quite nice.

365
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,560
However, the carving is unpolished.

366
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,760
Wu Xie.

367
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,080
Xiao Xie and you

368
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
will go to Four Ladies Mountain.

369
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,160
You

370
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,920
will go to Banai with Fatty Wang.

371
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,680
No.

372
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,040
You are separating us apart.

373
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
We have to act separately.

374
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,720
I can't act solo

375
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,920
while the three of you team up, can I?

376
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,480
I have my reasons

377
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,680
for such an arrangement.

378
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,760
Based on previous experience,

379
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,880
both teams

380
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,640
need to act simultaneously
at Four Ladies Mountain

381
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,600
and Banai.

382
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,600
As for the detailed arrangement,

383
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,040
I will explain to you guys
when we are there.

384
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,680
Both the teams

385
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,760
have to work closely

386
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,280
and stay seamlessly connected.

387
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,560
Therefore, both the teams

388
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
must work in perfect synchrony

389
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,480
despite the long distance.

390
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,120
She sounds like she is fooling us around.

391
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
If you want to enter
Zhang family's Old Pavilion alive,

392
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
we must do so.

393
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
Sure.

394
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
I have made myself clear.

395
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,400
We shall depart tomorrow.

396
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,280
Is the Dragon's Back ready?

397
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,240
Of course.

398
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,280
I kept it at Xiao Hua's house.

399
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,040
You are a reliable man.

400
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,520
Let's go.

401
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Zhang.

402
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,040
I am good at writing,

403
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
but carving

404
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,200
is not my strong suit.

405
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,840
It is okay.

406
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,240
The name is great.

407
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,960
Little Black Goldie.

408
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,720
Zhang.

409
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,040
What do you think?

410
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,560
It is not bad.

411
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,880
The sword suits him perfectly.

412
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,520
It's just as good as
the Black Golden Ancient Sword.

413
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,640
Wu Xie.

414
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,400
It's time to think.

415
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,440
About what?

416
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,720
About my gift.

417
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,760
You two have been helping

418
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,760
each other all this time.

419
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,800
When you were in danger,

420
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,920
Zhang came to rescue.

421
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
When Zhang lost his memory,

422
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
you found it for him.

423
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,880
Now, you gave him a sword.

424
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,840
How about me?

425
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,600
You need to give me something.

426
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,320
What is wrong?

427
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,640
Are you hesitating?

428
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,640
Don't be so stingy.

429
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,520
No.

430
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,840
I suddenly recall Uncle Panma's words.

431
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,200
If you stay together with him,

432
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,320
you won't end well.

433
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,440
Soon or later,

434
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,760
one of you will kill another.

435
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,120
He said that either Zhang or I

436
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,880
will kill one another.

437
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
No.

438
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,040
Don't worry.

439
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,480
Let's go.

440
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,640
Zhang.

441
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,680
Now,

442
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,440
you are getting more and more humane.

443
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,600
Don't worry.

444
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,000
You will see him again.

445
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,280
By the way,

446
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,480
Mrs Huo said

447
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,040
someone is waiting for us in Sichuan.

448
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,880
Let's go inside.

449
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,960
Mrs Huo, we are almost there.

450
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,200
Look.

451
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,720
This is the eldest sister.

452
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,120
This is the second sister.

453
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,600
This is the third sister.

454
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,840
That is the youngest sister.

455
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,520
The youngest sister is the tallest and
the most beautiful mount among the four.

456
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,600
It is 6,000 m above sea level.

457
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,360
No wonder it's called
the Four Ladies Mountain.

458
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,760
It's the Alps of the east.

459
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,480
Xiao Hua,

460
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,040
your staff in Sichuan

461
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,000
is quite fond of his hometown.

462
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,560
Wu Xie.

463
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,880
You are not here for sightseeing.

464
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,680
Seize the chance to take a break.

465
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,120
We are heading to the village

466
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,640
to find the person entrusted by Mrs Huo.

467
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,440
Do you know who that person is?

468
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,560
No.

469
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,680
Is anyone there?

470
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,240
Is anyone there?

471
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Is anyone there?

472
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
No one is here.

473
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,520
Is this the place?

474
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,520
Yes, this is the place.

475
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,620
The fire is burning.

476
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,560
I guess that person will be back soon.

477
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,360
Stay away from the fire.

478
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,560
You are being too cautious.

479
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,430
He's hired by Mrs Huo.

480
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,560
You think he'd set a trap for us?

481
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,320
This is no ordinary fire.

482
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,320
The locals

483
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
call it Ximi.

484
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,400
According to the legend, millennia ago,

485
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,560
the God of Fire gave it to the people.

486
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,080
The fire has been burning since.

487
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,120
If you do something disrespectful

488
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,300
in its presence,

489
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,520
bad things will happen to you.

490
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,720
That is so creepy.

491
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,000
The forever burning fire
is quite sacred it seems.

492
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,840
What if someone touches it?

493
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,520
Will that person be tied up
and grilled to death?

494
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,980
Grill him! Where are you going?

495
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,300
I didn't plan to run away.

496
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,520
Where are you going
if you are not trying to run away?

497
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,000
I just need to use the loo.

498
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,560
The loo is not in this direction.

499
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
Mr Black?

500
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,040
Get back.

501
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,590
I am a kind person.

502
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,000
No way I will run away.

503
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:45,960
Am I right?

504
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,960
Get back.

505
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,000
Fine, here, let me give you a massage.

506
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,220
Here, take a seat.

507
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,280
Here.

508
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,800
Let me show you

509
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,640
my skills.

510
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,840
Here.

511
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,360
It is called the Tianzong acupoint.

512
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,920
You work all year long.

513
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,400
Your back gets hurt easily.

514
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
Give it a massage.

515
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,280
You will feel relaxed immediately.

516
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,720
Harder.

517
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,840
No.

518
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,840
Your body is so strong.
You don't need a massage.

519
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Let's try it on someone else.

520
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Let's try it on someone else.

521
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,000
It's my turn.

522
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,760
Here, take a seat.

523
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,640
This is the Shenyu acupoint.

524
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,260
Your forehead is dark

525
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,160
and bloated.

526
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,360
Your kidneys are weak.

527
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,960
I have to massage

528
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,080
this part.

529
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,040
How do you feel? Is it painful?

530
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,000
No, it is not painful.

531
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,040
It is not painful?

532
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,920
How about this?

533
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,800
Is it painful?

534
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,360
I still don't feel a thing.

535
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,520
They are rich.

536
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,400
Boss.

537
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,400
As you know,

538
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,280
the convoy is on the way.

539
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,199
I think it must be Mrs Huo.

540
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,760
They are coming.

541
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,679
Right on time. Get my gift ready

542
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,560
and deliver it to our acquaintance.

543
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:53,960
Grandma.

544
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,760
When are we going to the mountain?

545
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
Let's take a break first.

546
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,280
We shall do the scouting tomorrow.

547
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,360
You guys are going into the mountain?

548
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,120
It's been raining non-stop lately.

549
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,000
There could be a mudslide.

550
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,510
It is not safe

551
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,880
to enter the mountain.

552
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
We can't put it off.

553
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,840
Just wait for half a month.

554
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Go inside the mountain
only when the rain dies down.

555
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,840
You don't want to

556
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,840
sacrifice your life for nothing, do you?

557
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,760
Besides,

558
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:28,840
look at

559
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,040
them.

560
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,960
Those are only young kids.

561
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,880
Some debts

562
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,160
have to be repaid even if it means

563
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
sacrificing your life.

564
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,480
He sold information about me,

565
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,720
and he still has the guts to come here.

566
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,320
I'm not seeing him.

567
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,680
I have transferred the money to them.

568
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
I knew it.

569
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,120
The price of a thousand goats

570
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,880
is peanuts for our kind Master Hua'er.

571
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,560
Thank you.

572
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,680
Thank you for the care.

573
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,080
Thank you.

574
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,480
May we

575
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
never meet again.

576
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,880
Mrs Huo.

577
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,160
Cox Hendry's people are here again.

578
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,680
They sent us something.

579
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
A message written in
Zhao Meng Fu's words.

580
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,760
"The long-lived tortoise..."

581
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,040
To think he was able to find this.

582
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,560
Such sincerity.

583
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,000
"The stabled old horse"

584
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,120
"yearns to travel a thousand li."

585
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,400
"Even the long-lived tortoise"

586
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,520
"has its end."

587
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,520
This Westerner is ambitious.

588
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,720
He thinks that even tortoises
don't live long enough.

589
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,560
Grandma.

590
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,640
Are you a friend of Cox Hendry?

591
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,360
When my third step-mum
headed the family,

592
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,160
the Huo family came into contact with him.

593
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,800
I was still young back then.

594
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,440
I met him once or twice.

595
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,440
Wu Xie said

596
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,360
he was working with Cox Hendry

597
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,920
to explore the mountain.

598
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,560
Who knew

599
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,480
he would surrender to you so soon.

600
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,880
I don't trust him.

601
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,560
Send it back.

602
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,440
Yes.

603
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Boss.

604
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,080
She has rejected it

605
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,640
and sent it back to us.

606
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,280
Okay, send my second gift

607
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,000
and don't worry about it.

608
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,560
She will take it in.

609
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,360
But I don't understand,
why are we doing that?

610
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,400
I am telling you,
we have to cooperate with her.

611
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,600
From Tamutuo to the West Empress Palace,

612
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,320
we spent a lot of money and resources

613
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,120
looking for what we want,

614
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,400
and we lost a lot of men.

615
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,160
When we were just about
to reach the Palace,

616
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,440
Ah Ning was killed by the tiger snake.

617
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,720
Until now, we still get nothing.

618
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,030
After arriving in Banai,

619
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,720
I started to gain
the cooperation of Wu Xie.

620
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,040
Little did I expect that he didn't
find the Old Pavilion's location,

621
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,760
he nearly died in the water.

622
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,960
So I know

623
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,080
I can work with Mrs Huo.

624
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,800
So I passed all the information

625
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,040
to Wu Xie,

626
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,760
and aided him to lure her here.

627
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,600
What we should do next?

628
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,560
Give her the gift.

629
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,760
Okay.

630
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
Master Hua'er is indeed a loyal friend.

631
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,720
You are really generous
in helping your friend.

632
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,960
If something happens to you,

633
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,160
you can ask for my help anytime.

634
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,280
I will give you a discount.

635
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,480
No need.

636
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,120
Just pay me back the money.

637
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,520
If I could pay them back,

638
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,000
I wouldn't have to give massages.

639
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,040
Mr Black,

640
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,840
what did you do

641
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,680
to get yourself in such a huge debt?

642
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,560
Don't mention it.

643
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,520
It's because of the sacred fire.

644
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,120
I was thinking...

645
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,000
Forget it.

646
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,880
Let's not go into that.

647
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,040
You're the person Mrs Huo wants us

648
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,560
to find, aren't you?

649
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,680
Yes.

650
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,160
However, this transaction

651
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,360
is a big loss.

652
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,600
Transfer money to my bank account

653
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,640
to pay for the goats.

654
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,120
Are you serious, Master Hua'er?

655
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,320
You are such a kind person.

656
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,520
How could you be so heartless?

657
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,240
I suggest you keep working
on repaying that debt.

658
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,800
Let's go.

659
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,000
Allow me.

660
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,800
If I become your driver,

661
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,240
would it be worth ten goats?

662
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,360
Half a goat.

663
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:50,504
