1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,000
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,860
<i>Episode 11</i>

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,180
Zhang?

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,420
You left without a word again!

6
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,300
What is it?

7
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,539
Food.

8
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,860
Just wait.

9
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,700
I would say

10
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,740
I'm good at stitching up wounds.

11
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,900
How about

12
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,980
I put a dragon tattoo on your back?

13
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,500
I guarantee it'll be lifelike.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,260
Give me a break.

15
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,260
Just keep it simple.

16
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,340
Your wound

17
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,660
gets the maximum on a scale of one to ten.

18
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,380
It's really serious.

19
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,620
It may look disgusting,

20
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,940
but it's just a skin injury.

21
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,540
Cherish your life.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,740
You may not get a second chance next time.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,900
I can take it.

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,180
That's my style.

25
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,700
Every time, I get injured.

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,140
And every time,

27
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,140
I survive.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,880
Master San relies on you.

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,460
You can't live like that.

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,940
It's as if you're suicidal.

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,860
I...

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,920
I have to stop being suicidal.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,579
Master San needs me.

34
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,500
We made a deal.

35
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,260
We'll live together in a nursing home

36
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,060
when we get old.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,579
Weren't you in pursuit of the mud man?

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,300
What happened then?

39
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,300
He got away.

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,580
Just tell me.

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,900
Why did you leave as soon as you saved me?

42
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,100
Come with me.

43
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,340
Zhang.

44
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,659
Why have you brought me here?

45
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,260
Are you nuts?

46
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,260
What are you trying to do?

47
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,920
For snake prevention.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,900
Why didn't you...

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,060
You should have just told me earlier.

50
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,420
I'll do it myself.

51
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,380
By the way,

52
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,420
Pan Zi and Fatty are still inside.

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,180
Something terrible just happened!

54
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,500
Fatty.

55
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,720
We're in trouble!

56
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,500
-What's going on there?
-Come quickly!

57
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,020
What's going on?

58
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,560
Are you crazy?

59
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,620
The mud is good for your skin
and snake prevention.

60
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,640
-Spread it evenly.
-Who said that?

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,159
-Zhang.
-Him?

62
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,360
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

63
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,940
Better to be safe than sorry.

64
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,220
Is that good enough?

65
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,540
It's spread evenly, right?

66
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,220
Stop.

67
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,420
The mouth of the water
channel is just in front.

68
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,380
But it's getting dark now.

69
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,380
We'll set up camp here for the night.

70
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,820
Send a team to light up
the water channel.

71
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,660
We'll enter at dawn.

72
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,420
Take a few men with
you to the water channel.

73
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
The rest of you will prepare for dinner.

74
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,820
Set up a sentry for the night.

75
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,100
Sure.

76
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,060
Let's move.

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,460
We've found the entrance.

78
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,580
Separate the blind man and the pretty boy.

79
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,100
We'll do it tonight.

80
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,500
Are we still doing this, boss?

81
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,820
We failed in our previous attempts.

82
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,740
Can't you use your brain?

83
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,120
They won't be suspicious of us.

84
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,860
It's the right time to do it tonight.

85
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,160
You're the man, boss.

86
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,200
That truly was

87
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,980
a brilliant idea.

88
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,260
We're exposed.

89
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,440
Impossible.

90
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,820
Go.

91
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,760
Master San, perhaps you can assign

92
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,320
someone capable to come with us.

93
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,940
We're worried we may not be able

94
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,140
to handle it if anything happens tonight.

95
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,700
I'll go.

96
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,780
I'll go.

97
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,580
The night is getting cold.

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,900
Take this.

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,380
Keep it.

100
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,340
Is he always this positive?

101
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,559
Not at all.

102
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,220
It's a rare case tonight.

103
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,700
Wu Xie.

104
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,560
Does this really work
for snake prevention?

105
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,540
Of course.

106
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,300
Zhang said that.

107
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,660
He's back.

108
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,900
Both of them are applying
the mud on the tents.

109
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,940
Pan Zi.

110
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,700
You must keep your back dry.

111
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,180
Later, I'll get a cloth with
mud to cover your back.

112
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,560
Okay.

113
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,940
Fatty's a better suturer than I thought.

114
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,380
It's a little uncanny.

115
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,260
As if I've seen it somewhere before.

116
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,620
He was using

117
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,900
a shoe repairing technique.

118
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,080
Fatty is indeed talented in many ways.

119
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,060
Wu Xie.

120
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,160
Something's wrong. Come quickly.

121
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,460
I've already put on the mud.

122
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
That has nothing to do with the mud.

123
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,000
Your uncle left you a message.

124
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,980
You must come now.

125
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,740
Just remain still.

126
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,140
I'll tell you the situation when I'm back.

127
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,480
Earlier Zhang and I
were collecting some mud.

128
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,620
We saw this when we moved the mud.

129
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,800
<i>We've found the entrance
to the Ultimate.</i>

130
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,800
<i>We've found the way into the Ultimate.</i>

131
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,660
<i>Once entered, there shall be no return.</i>

132
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
<i>Once you enter, there is no return.</i>

133
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
<i>Farewell.</i>

134
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,020
<i>My wish is fulfilled.</i>

135
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,740
I have no regrets. Forget about me.

136
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,160
It's dangerous here.

137
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,940
Leave now.

138
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,160
<i>I have no regrets. Forget about me.
Leave now. It's dangerous here.</i>

139
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,420
Your third uncle

140
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,060
didn't intend to come home alive.

141
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,860
Wu Xie.

142
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,900
Who's this Wu San Xing?

143
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,680
We can never tell for sure.

144
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
Not to worry.

145
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,820
Tomorrow we shall find
out more information.

146
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,940
This old fox.

147
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,540
He just wants me to turn back
by hook or by crook.

148
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,940
Take this.

149
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,420
I'm going to put on some more mud.

150
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,590
Wu Xie.

151
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,300
What did Master San say?

152
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,860
He said

153
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,660
that the path ahead is dangerous.

154
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,260
He wants me to stop.

155
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,460
But he has gone in instead.

156
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,420
What he said makes sense.

157
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,820
Wu Xie.

158
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
Why don't you listen to him?

159
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,420
It's dangerous.

160
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,660
I can't let him go alone.

161
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,320
-He's doing this for your own good.
-Don't I want the same for him, too?

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,620
I understand how he feels.

163
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,900
Let's try putting myself in his shoes.

164
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,620
The secret I've been pursuing
is right in front of me.

165
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,220
But the path ahead is dangerous.

166
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,620
I can't let my nephew come,

167
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,980
yet I can't tell him the truth.

168
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
I can only give him a silly excuse.

169
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,940
You would have cried by now

170
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,580
if it were

171
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,660
the old you.

172
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,180
That's right.

173
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,140
Previously, I would have cried

174
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,340
if I knew my uncle

175
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,220
was going to die.

176
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,300
Now I just know

177
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,900
that the unsolved mysteries

178
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,660
are beyond the control of my uncle.

179
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,380
I wonder if you remember this.

180
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,460
When you were a kid,

181
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,980
Master San took you

182
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,900
and your buddies out shopping.

183
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,780
The lot of you met a fortune teller,

184
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,300
and he took a look at your palm.

185
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,500
He said you were born discomposed.

186
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,940
You'd have much

187
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,420
on your mind in the future.

188
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,920
After that?

189
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,020
Those comments displeased Master San.

190
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,820
He thought it was nonsense.

191
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,620
He insisted

192
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,300
that you were perfectly all right.

193
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
And he even wanted to
take you to Master Qi Ba

194
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,300
to have your fortune told.

195
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,800
Was Master Qi Ba still alive back then?

196
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,880
Actually,
Master San didn't visit him eventually.

197
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,560
He thought that people
have their own destinies.

198
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,680
You should take a good look at yourself

199
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,380
and ponder about your destiny.

200
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,440
Didn't you go after the fortune teller

201
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,420
for his unfavourable comments
about Wu Xie?

202
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,400
He was just casually making
a divination for Wu Xie.

203
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,500
His divination may not be accurate,

204
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,020
but we can't blame him.

205
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,580
I even left him a tip afterward.

206
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,100
What happened next?

207
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,300
I didn't see him again

208
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,980
after that encounter.

209
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,600
Aren't you curious

210
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,460
what the fortune teller
had said about you?

211
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,480
I wouldn't believe it

212
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,460
even if you tell me.

213
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,700
Fine.

214
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,560
I'll tell you anyway

215
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,780
in case you're curious.

216
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,060
He said

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,900
you're a lucky star.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,900
A lucky star?

219
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,260
I'll meet my lucky star?

220
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,500
No.

221
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,500
You're a lucky star.

222
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,660
You're everyoneâ€™s lucky star

223
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,420
except for yourself.

224
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,980
The men from my family
all died mysteriously.

225
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,260
It's as if they were cursed.

226
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,180
I was only eight when I
became the head of my family.

227
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,780
I'm nobody's lucky star.

228
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,060
The fortune teller had made a mistake.

229
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,990
Master San.

230
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,540
Have some tea to refresh yourself.

231
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,100
Thanks.

232
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,460
Do you still

233
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,780
hang a black cloth over
your bedroom's windows?

234
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,820
You knew about it?

235
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,600
Keep it to yourself.

236
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,760
Don't let others

237
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,380
know about your mind and actions.

238
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,420
You know how to protect
yourself better than Wu Xie.

239
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,190
Wu Xie.

240
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,660
For you.

241
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,620
This camp of your third uncle's

242
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,940
is a bit weird.

243
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,580
It's well equipped,

244
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,820
but the men are nowhere to be found.

245
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,080
Could they have found the way in

246
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,300
that they didn't bother to
take anything with them?

247
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,420
Or there were fewer men than bags

248
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,780
when they left.

249
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,420
That could mean

250
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,260
many of them died here.

251
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,580
The mass death

252
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,700
should be happening
after this camp is set up.

253
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,690
There are traces of snakes on the rocks.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,940
Snake wave.

255
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,850
Tonight we'll take turns at keeping watch.

256
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,830
I'll watch the whole night.

257
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,940
I'll go with you for half a night.

258
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,540
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

259
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,820
-Count me in for the watch.
-No.

260
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,660
You take care of Pan Zi.

261
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,780
My eyes are itchy.

262
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,380
You're just too tired.

263
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,400
Take this.

264
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,620
It's for Pan Zi.

265
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,860
Take a good sleep tonight.

266
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,740
Just stay in the tent.

267
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,620
Why did Shades scout the trail for me?

268
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,520
He was worried that
you couldn't make it back.

269
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,500
Me?

270
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,820
Not make it back?

271
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,740
Give me his jacket.

272
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,220
Pick one and put in on.

273
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,180
Pick one that is windproof.

274
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
Master San.

275
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,940
Why are you wearing
the shades at this hour?

276
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,740
Isn't the campfire too glaring?

277
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,060
It's hurting my eyes while
keeping myself warm by the fire.

278
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,180
I'm getting old

279
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,339
and I'm not as strong as you guys.

280
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,300
Then what about Master Hua'er?

281
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,380
I don't wish to see any ghosts.

282
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,560
-Why don't you put it on, too?
-No.

283
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,460
They're too hip for me.

284
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,820
Too hip for me.

285
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,340
The two of them over there

286
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,060
have put on the shades.

287
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,940
Something's wrong.

288
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,640
Should we follow suit?

289
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,620
Hold on.

290
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,860
Wu San Xing was asking
me to put on the shades.

291
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,820
He's playing cat-and-mouse.

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,140
I added something to their drinks.

293
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,500
We'll begin as soon as

294
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,860
the effects kick in.

295
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,100
All of us

296
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,620
need to be on full alert.

297
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,220
Okay.

298
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,940
What a thick fog.

299
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,140
I'm being outnumbered.

300
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,260
Isn't that ungentlemanly?

301
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,080
Forgive us, Mr Black.

302
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
Boss told us to get rid of you two.

303
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,580
We must obey the order.

304
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,340
If you're lucky, a snake might show up

305
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,740
and give you a swift,

306
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,060
painless death.

307
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,920
Otherwise,

308
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,140
you'll be mauled by a bear

309
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,860
and die a terrible death.

310
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,780
My friend,

311
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,540
there's something you don't know.

312
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,100
The bear doesn't live in a rainforest.

313
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,180
You're just full of crap.

314
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,310
Aren't you reconsidering your action?

315
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,020
Aren't you guys curious

316
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,580
how he looks without the shades?

317
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,060
Hold on.

318
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,580
Rumour has it that

319
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,020
everyone who saw his eyes died.

320
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,940
I want to find out

321
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,740
if this is true.

322
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,380
Go ahead. I'm going to die anyway.

323
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,260
I might as well reveal the reason

324
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,100
why I'm always wearing shades.

325
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,720
The reason is simple.

326
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,980
It's because I'm going blind soon.

327
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,260
Do you know why others
called me Mr Black

328
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,740
instead of the Blind Man?

329
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,060
Your name

330
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,420
is Black?

331
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,620
They called me that

332
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,620
because I possess something

333
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,860
that no one else knows.

334
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,740
What's that?

335
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,820
I could take away

336
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,220
all your eyes.

337
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,100
What's the time now?

338
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,820
Who put off the lamp?

339
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,740
Even the campfire, too.

340
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,720
Where's the lamp?

341
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,700
Where's it?

342
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,020
The lamp is broken.

343
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
Mr Black.

344
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
You'll be dead soon.

345
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,900
Stop kidding there.

346
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,020
How the hell are you going
to take away our eyes?

347
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,780
Why don't you dare to look at my eyes?

348
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,700
Are you daring me?

349
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,420
I...

350
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,540
I can't see a thing.

351
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,160
-What's going on?
-Kill him!

352
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,780
Kill him!

353
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,080
-I can't see a thing!
-What's going on?

354
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,060
I can't see a thing, too!

355
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,040
Me, too!

356
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,780
Now we're all the same.

357
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,580
Now we're a happy blind family.

358
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,400
Why should we make it hard for each other?

359
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,440
We can't see a thing!

360
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,540
Guys!

361
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,820
Learn from me

362
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,140
from now on.

363
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,820
A blind man

364
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,820
can also earn a living by giving massages.

365
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,060
Pan Zi.

366
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,480
Pan Zi.

367
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,960
Pan Zi.

368
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,580
Pan Zi.

369
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,420
Why is your body so hot?

370
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,900
You're having a fever?

371
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
Hang in there, Pan Zi.

372
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,660
I'll go get Zhang and Fatty.

373
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,020
Just wait here.

374
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,900
Wu Xie.

375
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,180
Is that you, Fatty?

376
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,340
Calm down.

377
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,460
I can't see a thing.

378
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,500
Put this on.

379
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,580
Calm down. Put this on.

380
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,300
You'll be fine in a moment.

381
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,440
There's poisonous gas outside.

382
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,780
Keep your voice down.

383
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,140
The snakes are
everywhere around this place.

384
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,620
Where have you guys been?

385
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,520
Do you think it was an easy task

386
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,360
to search for masks in the dark?

387
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,340
No.

388
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
Pan Zi is having a fever.

389
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,600
Wu Xie.

390
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,140
Wu Xie.

391
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,340
Be silent.

392
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,580
Take this.

393
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Listen.

394
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,820
I've given him an injection.

395
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,540
Stay here.

396
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,500
Where are you going?

397
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
-Where's Zhang?
-He got bitten by a snake.

398
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,460
I'm going to give him the serum.

399
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,020
Stay still.

400
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,260
You'll be able to see in a moment.

401
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,620
Wait.

402
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,960
Zhang got hurt?

403
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,140
Stay still.

404
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,180
Boss.

405
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,400
They've fallen asleep.

406
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,380
Let's do it.

407
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,700
Grab your weapons.

408
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,860
Shout at me!

409
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,300
Vent your anger at me!

410
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,780
Aren't you always thinking you're great?

411
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,340
And you.

412
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,700
Aren't you particular about cleanliness?

413
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,440
Being fussy out here in the rainforest.

414
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,660
Are you silly?

415
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,900
It's not that I'm boasting,

416
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,620
-I, The Mop...
-Boss.

417
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,560
-I, The Mop, have been in...
-Boss.

418
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,780
What is it?

419
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,580
Do you feel it's getting darker?

420
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,220
It seems so.

421
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,740
And you can't

422
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,460
see a thing?

423
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,940
It seems so.

424
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,700
-Who's that?
-It's me, boss.

425
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm shouting at you.

426
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,260
I'm venting my anger at you.

427
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,820
Aren't you thinking you're just great?

428
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,820
You even drugged us.

429
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,960
Master San.

430
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,940
Take your hands off, you're dirty.

431
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,140
Master San.

432
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,820
There aren't any
abnormalities at the entrance.

433
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,160
The lamps are working well.

434
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,380
We can leave first thing in the morning.

435
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,220
Good.

436
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,500
You look better in shades than me.

437
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,700
Of course.

438
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,440
Let's cure their eyes.

439
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,540
I don't want them to be a burden for us.

440
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,580
Let me tell you one thing.

441
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,140
There can only be

442
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,780
one good-looking blind man
in this team and that's me.

443
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,940
Master San.

444
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,220
Since when you knew something
was wrong with the mist?

445
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,900
Before we came to this rainforest.

446
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,620
What about you?

447
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,780
When you asked me
to pick the windproof shades.

448
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,140
Shades' isn't windproof, right?

449
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,460
Why didn't he become blind?

450
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,930
You want to know why?

451
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,060
It's because he's capable.

452
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,740
I've applied the antidote.

453
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,460
Don't open your eyes
until half an hour later.

454
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,420
Remember it.

455
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,820
Keep your face unwashed for half a year.

456
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,080
Otherwise,

457
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,600
you'll be a blind man
for the rest of your life.

458
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,100
I'll remember it.

459
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,580
Who's that?

460
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,180
Hold it right there!

461
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,300
Wu Xie.

462
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,420
Wu Xie.

463
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,380
Go back.

464
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,620
Are you all right?

465
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,920
The snake bit through my shoe.

466
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,980
I got bitten.

467
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
I can still take it.

468
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,860
Zhang let me have the serum.

469
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,920
I have to go save him.

470
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,560
-Where's he?
-He's bleeding.

471
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,560
The mud is useless now.

472
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,100
We're being surrounded by snakes.

473
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,240
I'll go.

474
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,760
That's suicidal.

475
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,280
You'll be dead if you go out now.

476
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,700
I'm always lucky.

477
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,820
Just go if you must insist.

478
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,280
You must remember

479
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,900
to keep your movement slow.

480
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,100
Keep your movement slow.

481
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,400
Take the waterproof cloth with you.

482
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,380
Okay.

483
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,460
Zhang!

484
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,860
Get into the tent.

485
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,900
Give him the serum, quick.

486
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,780
The snakes are approaching.

487
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,560
Oh, no.

488
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,960
The tent is going to collapse.

489
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,940
Quick.

490
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,460
Watch out.

491
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,860
It's hot here.

492
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,340
It's finally over.

493
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,060
Oh my god.

494
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,900
Here, Pan Zi.

495
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,260
You need something to eat.

496
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,400
The three of you lost
your eyesights yesterday?

497
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,860
We got blind suddenly.

498
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,900
There was a sudden blindness!

499
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,380
It sure was weird.

500
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,180
I wonder if this camp is cursed.

501
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,260
There were snakes and poisonous gas.

502
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,500
The mist in the rain forest

503
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,180
is all condensation.

504
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,220
If the water's clean,

505
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,380
so is the mist.

506
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,580
I guess there's contaminated
water around this area.

507
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,160
Something in the
mist causes blindness.

508
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,220
That was why we couldn't see.

509
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,160
It has nothing to do with a curse.

510
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,220
Wu Xie.

511
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,420
Didn't you say the mud is
useful for snake prevention?

512
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,880
I even covered myself with mud.

513
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,260
It was totally useless.

514
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,100
When the mud solidifies,
it'd fall off easily.

515
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,580
That was also not perfect mud.

516
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,300
You seem to be always making sense.

517
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,820
Zhang.

518
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,140
Are you all right?

519
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,460
Have some porridge.

520
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,580
We'll leave as soon as we finish our meal.

521
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,340
I can't do this whole thing again.

522
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,220
We're still losing
contact with Master San.

523
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,580
Where can we go?

524
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,860
We should go to a higher place.

525
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,760
I've done a survey around this area

526
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,060
with the binoculars.

527
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,420
There's a temple over in that direction.

528
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,740
No matter what it is,

529
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,390
we must leave here.

530
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,180
I think I've lost my weight

531
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,240
after this whole episode.

532
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,140
Look at my deflated tummy.

533
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,900
By the way,

534
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,500
When I got blind yesterday,

535
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,640
I felt something come into the tent,

536
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,220
and there was a muddy smell.

537
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,820
Was that the mud man?

538
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,080
Is the girl having a crush on you?

539
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,640
The mud man is a girl?

540
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,380
Didn't you notice it previously?

541
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,580
She was like this.

542
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,060
Stop kidding.

543
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,860
I'm not kidding.

544
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,040
I run a shop at Panjiayuan.

545
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,560
I can see through anything,

546
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,160
even clay tiles,

547
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,660
let alone mere mud.

548
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,140
Stop bragging.

549
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,980
Think carefully.

550
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,580
Tell us all the women

551
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,020
that you know.

552
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,480
My mum.

553
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,460
My granny.

554
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,040
Ah Ning, Madam Dolma.

555
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,900
-Her daughter-in-law, Huo Xiu Xiu.
-Okay.

556
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,220
You're digressing.

557
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,740
Go straight to the point.

558
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,060
The point is...

559
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,650
There's one more.

560
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,420
The one who was combing
her hair at the sanatorium.

561
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,500
Guess she's half a woman.

562
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,900
There's actually one more.

563
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,740
I'm not sure if she's still alive.

564
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,100
Chen Wen Jin.

565
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,260
And she left a message with Madam Dolma,

566
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,060
saying she'll await us at
the destination for ten days.

567
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,340
She'll enter alone if we
don't show up on time.

568
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,320
-"It?"
-Yes.

569
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,340
Still remember the "it"
in Chen Wen Jin's diary?

570
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,700
She was scared of "it."

571
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,780
"It?"

572
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,980
So the mud man is Chen Wen Jin.

573
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,820
No wonder she's been hiding from us.

574
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,120
There's a mole among
us who works for "it."

575
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,100
That's impossible.

576
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,740
There were only four of us back then.

577
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,460
We could have been infiltrated
by someone in disguise.

578
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,580
I'm the real deal. See?

579
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,920
That's it?

580
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,140
I don't think you are.

581
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,740
I think you could be fake.

582
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,900
I have to check on you.

583
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,880
Your whole family is fake.

584
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,580
You're fake.

585
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,660
I checked on Pan Zi's head
when he was having a fever.

586
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,440
-He's absolutely real.
-Yes.

587
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,560
He can't be fake.

588
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,080
I don't think

589
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,300
his muscles are fake.

590
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,040
Here, Zhang.

591
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,740
Stand right here.

592
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,860
Why don't we check on him together?

593
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,460
Coward.

594
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,200
-He's real.
-He's real.

595
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,080
Great.

596
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,760
-He's real.
-Don't hold a grudge against me.

597
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,900
You have to hold a grudge
against him, too if you must.

598
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,000
Why is the water getting weaker?

599
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,220
Increase the flow.

600
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,980
Where's your mercy?

601
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
You're abusing a wounded man.

602
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,620
And you're simply being demanding.

603
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,480
It's not that, Pan Zi.

604
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,240
Didn't you have your back sutured?

605
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,360
You must keep it dry.

606
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,820
We're taking good care of you.

607
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,940
Pan Zi!

608
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,500
<i>I have no regrets. Forget about me.
Leave now. It's dangerous here.</i>

609
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,260
Let's move!

610
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,420
Quick.

611
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,820
It's here.

612
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,060
Easy.

613
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,420
Easy.

614
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,260
It feels great

615
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,020
to be away from the water.

616
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,660
The relief sculpture.

617
00:41:22,614 --> 00:41:32,614
