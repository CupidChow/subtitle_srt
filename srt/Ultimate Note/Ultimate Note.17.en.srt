5
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,910
Come back to Hangzhou.

<i>I'll tell you in person.</i>

7
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,720
Okay. Fine.

8
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,650
See you tomorrow.

<i>Voice call connected, Wu Xie</i>

10
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,770
What is it?

11
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,780
Did you accept a new job?

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,290
Do you need my help?

13
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,010
It was Uncle Er.

14
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,880
He's even more cunning
than that sly fox, Uncle San.

15
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,000
I told him

16
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,850
I'm going back to Hangzhou
to see him tomorrow.

17
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,660
But if I go back tomorrow,

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm sure he'll be long gone.

19
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,900
So I'm planning to depart now.

20
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,680
I'm going to catch him
completely off guard.

21
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,790
Okay.

22
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,130
Take care of yourself.

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,500
Once Zhang gets better,

24
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,079
I'll bring him to visit you.

<i>Wushanju</i>

26
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
They are all liars.

27

Liars.

28
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:53,970
Boss,

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,440
about that number you gave me,

30
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,760
I've called it using
four different numbers,

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,190
but I still couldn't get through.

32
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,550
We agreed to speak in person in Hangzhou.

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,630
No matter where I go,
they are never there.

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
I can never reach them by phone.

35
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,940
None of these elders are reliable.

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Boss,

37
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,329
when you were gone,

38
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,650
there hasn't been much
business in Wushanju.

39
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,190
But I...

40
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,910
I have updated the computer, you see.

41
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,350
I cleaned all the old stocks.

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,360
And the floor, I've...

43
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,020
You'll get your salary in a few days.

44
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,900
I didn't forget.

45
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,380
Okay.

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,670
<i>Wushanju</i>

47
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,970
You've read that notebook so many times.

48
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,690
You've probably memorized it by now.

49
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,280
Boss, let me tell you,

50
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,890
I won a box of instant
noodles two days ago.

51
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,210
It tastes so good.

52
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,800
Would you like to try some?
I'll go get it for you.

53
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,680
Alright.

54
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,659
I'll pay you your salary
after I finish this wine.

55
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,310
Get out. Stop bugging me.

56
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,100
My dear ancestors,

57
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,670
why couldn't you have written something
that happened among the Mystic Nine?

58
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,080
Boss.

59
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,650
I haven't finished my wine yet.

60
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,560
Stop bugging me, please.

61
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,820
It's not about that, Boss.

62
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,600
We have a guest wanting to see you.

63
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,920
He said he wants to pick up
an item belongs to Wu San Xing

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,370
in our Wushanju.

65
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,720
Why would we have Uncle San's stuff here?

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Ask him to leave.

67
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,370
Our guest said his name is

68
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,390
Jin Wan Tang.

69
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,400
Mr Jin.

70
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,400
Kid!

71
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,880
How may I help you?

72
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,600
"I, Wu San Xing, owe
Jin Wan Tang a large vase."

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,159
"The item will be delivered
two weeks later."

74
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,100
"Wu..."

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,000
Mr Jin,

76
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,590
it's Uncle San who owes you something.

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
Why are you looking for me?

78
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,880
He said you have it here with you.

79
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,400
-I have it here?
-Yes.

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,900
Why would I have it here?

81
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,880
Why are your Wu family being so difficult?

82
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,080
I just want to take something from you.

83
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Why are you making it so hard?

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,440
Your Uncle San is either tricking you,

85
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,810
or me.

86
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,630
If I don't bring home something today,

87
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,050
then I have to get...

88
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,280
You know?

89
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,130
What vase is that?

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,840
A large vase with pastel bird picture.

91
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,730
How much is it worth?

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,740
RMB120,000.

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,580
I don't have the vase

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,520
nor the money.

95
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
I don't care.

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,250
Your Uncle San told me personally that

97
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,440
if he didn't deliver it to me
within two weeks,

98
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,490
I could get it from you.

99
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,240
Either you give me my vase,

100
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,940
or you give me some money today.

101
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,250
Boss,

102
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
we haven't purchased anything for a year.

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,870
I'm here every day.

104
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,620
I haven't seen any vase.

105
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:47,970
Hold on.

106
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,320
Wang Meng,

107
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,540
didn't you say you won
a box of instant noodles?

108
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,670
Yes.

109
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,990
Move it here.

110
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,590
Hurry up.

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,430
Instant noodle?

112
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,860
Where are my instant noodles?

113
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,720
Mr Jin,

114
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,910
take a look at it.

115
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,050
-Is this it?
-Yes, this is it.

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,840
This looks like a fake.

117
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,920
How did you two get fooled by its colours?

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,520
That's impossible it is a fake.

119
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,800
This was obviously made during the
reign of the Daoguang Emperor.

120
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,510
-Daoguang Emperor?
-How is it impossible?

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,270
I'll believe you even if
you say it was made last year.

122
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,120
No one has such
craftsmanship these days.

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,700
Look at its pattern.

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,040
Look at it.

125
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,570
Tell me.

126
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,690
Other than asking you to
come find me two weeks later,

127
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,010
he must have said something else.

128
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,880
Kid,

129
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,760
I'll come clean with you now.

130
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,160
Your Uncle San paid me RMB20,000,

131
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,350
asking me to come and
see you after two weeks.

132
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,940
He also told me that

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,960
if I'm the one who break this vase,

134
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,800
then I'll probably have to pay
you the money for the vase.

135
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,150
I'll have to give you the RMB20,000
given to me.

136
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,190
Now this is great.

137
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,200
You broke the vase yourself.

138
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,870
I had nothing to do with it.

139
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,320
I just earned RMB20,000.

140
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,560
Sly old fox.

141
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,840
Me?

142
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm talking about Uncle San.

143
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,170
Speaking of which,

144
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,280
word on the street is your
Uncle San is in trouble.

145
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,549
Is he still alive?

146
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,429
I have no idea.

147
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,850
If anything happens to him,

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,470
your guardian for this shop is gone.

149
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,130
Many will come looking for trouble.

150
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,020
You have to be careful, kid.

151
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,360
I understand.

152
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Thank you.

153
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,690
See you.

154
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,770
This was recorded before he went to
Palace of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

155

170
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,440
<i>Me and Wu San Xing</i>

171
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,890
<i>are all a hoax.</i>

172
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,040
<i>Wu Xie,</i>

173
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,970
<i>It doesn't matter whether I'm Wu San Xing
or Xie Lian Huan.</i>

174
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,470
<i>After all these years,</i>

175
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,650
<i>you're my nephew</i>

176
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,100
<i>and I'm your uncle.</i>

177
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,140
<i>Although I have lied to you
so many times,</i>

178
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,080
<i>but all I really wanted to
do is to protect you,</i>

179
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,410
<i>I never thought of harming you.</i>

180
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,500
<i>Wu San Xing and I</i>

181
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,350
<i>will not do anything that harms</i>

182
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,840
<i>the Wu family and Xie family.</i>

183
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,270
<i>The truth is</i>

184
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
<i>even I am not sure</i>

185
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,120
<i>whether I'm Xie Lian Huan
or Wu San Xing.</i>

186
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,520
<i>I've worn the disguise for too long</i>

187
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,920
<i>and I can no longer take it off.</i>

188
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,680
<i>But actually,</i>

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,200
<i>everything that happened has a cause.</i>

190
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,280
<i>It all began when an accident happened</i>

191
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,960
<i>at the bottom of sea in Paracel Islands.</i>

192
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,260
<i>Wu San Xing and I had no
choice but to switch identities.</i>

193
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,600
<i>It was a mistake, or
perhaps it was meant to be.</i>

194
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,410
<i>There was no turning back for us.</i>

195
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,140
<i>I have too many questions
for what happened</i>

196
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,600
<i>at the bottom of the sea in
Paracel Islands 19 years ago.</i>

197
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,090
<i>After Wu San Xing and I</i>

198
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,840
<i>separated with Wen Jin and the others,</i>

199
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,790
<i>we had never been able to find them.</i>

200
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,740
<i>After that,</i>

201
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,480
<i>we investigated the
whole archaeological team.</i>

202
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,360
<i>The backgrounds of several people
in the team</i>

203
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,280
<i>were untraceable.</i>

204
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,320
<i>If even we couldn't find
out their background,</i>

205
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,720
<i>that means there must
something bigger behind this.</i>

206
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,900
<i>No matter where we are now,</i>

207
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,780
<i>there is something I must do.</i>

208
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,120
<i>This is something that Wu San Xing and I
have to find out.</i>

209
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,580
<i>We have to find the answer,</i>

210
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
<i>even if it costs us our lives.</i>

211
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,370
<i>But Wu Xie,</i>

212
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,890
<i>for you,</i>

213
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,800
<i>I hope this is the end of it.</i>

214
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,040
<i>Stop investigating it.</i>

215
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,120
<i>Live your life.</i>

216
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,880
<i>Don't get caught up in it anymore.</i>

217
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,640
<i>These have nothing to do
with you anymore.</i>

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
Nothing to do with me?

219
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,040
You said that every time.

220
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,860
Yet I'm still going to keep
investigating it in the end.

221
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,160
<i>Yes.</i>

222
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,030
<i>I know you won't listen to me.</i>

223
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,640
<i>You'll still keep investigating it.</i>

224
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,050
<i>But</i>

225
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,920
<i>as a farewell message to you,</i>

226
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
<i>keep in mind.</i>

227
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,320
<i>This was what your grandfather
told us when he was alive.</i>

228
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,030
<i>What's more terrifying than a ghost</i>

229
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,760
<i>is human.</i>

230
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,080
<i>Wushanju</i>

231
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,720
Boss.

232
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,680
Boss.

233
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,910
Stop yelling.

234
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,960
I'll pay you your salary
after I finish shaving.

235
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,220
It's not about that.

236
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,640
Boss.

237
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
We have a guest.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,480
We've come to visit you.

239
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,090
How could you not roll out
the red carpet to welcome us?

240
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,660
I didn't expect it would be you two.

241
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,240
Wu Xie,

242
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
I've missed you so much.

243
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,180
Why are you standing there?

244
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,810
Go make a pot of tea for our VIPs.

245
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,340
We've finally sneaked out of the hospital.

246
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Since Zhang's condition hasn't improved
despite eating all the medicines.

247
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,060
It's better to take him out

248
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,160
for a walk.

249
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,840
Come on, Zhang. Let's sit here.

250
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,840
It's so messy here.

251
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,720
Here.

252
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,640
You'll sit here.

253
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,080
Zhang,

254
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,360
Wu Xie usually isn't like this.

255
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,690
That's right.

256
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,460
You guys came so suddenly.

257
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,790
You didn't even inform me in advance.

258
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,590
Zhang here

259
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,430
is updating his brain now.

260
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,780
You have to make a
good impression upon him.

261
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
<i>Name: Zhang Qi Ling</i>
<i>Contact number: 132612177</i>

262
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,070
"I am lost."

263
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,660
"Please call my family."

264
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,530
"You will be rewarded."

265
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,240
Zhang has fragmented memories now.

266
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,840
The doctor said

267
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,680
mental stimulation

268
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,040
could help him get better.

269
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,000
He's just staring
blankly like this everyday.

270
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,400
Nothing works, despite I've
fed him pig brain every meal.

271
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,160
Zhang,

272
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,470
do you remember me?

273
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,480
Wu Xie.

274
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,160
Now that you're here,

275
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,950
is there anywhere you would like to go?
I'll take you out for a walk

276
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,440
To places with my memories.

277
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,860
Okay.

278
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Stay here for a bit.

279
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,460
I'm going to cook some pig brain for you.

280
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:30,110
<i>Harvest and Cultivation</i>

281
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,920
This is the best he could get.

282
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,430
He can't remember any useful information,

283
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,160
but he wants to find his memories.

284
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,550
What do you think we should do?

285
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,240
He has no other family.

286
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,780
He only has us.

287
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,240
If we just leave him,

288
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,200
he would become a
homeless guy on the street.

289
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,480
If we let him live with me,

290
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
it's fine, I guess.

291
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,850
But if I keep a boy toy in my house,

292
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,360
I'm not going to be able to find a wife.

293
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,410
<i>Harvest and Cultivation</i>

294
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,920
How can you be so ungrateful?

295
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,320
How am I ungrateful?

296
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,410
You just are.

297
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,540
Zhang has saved our lives more than once.

298
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,310
Why are you worrying about those nonsense?

299
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,240
I think

300
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,960
we'll just do what Zhang said.

301
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,050
Sign him up for a tour.

302
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,590
And give him some money.

303
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,360
Let him travel around alone.

304
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,810
But he can get lost easily if we do that.

305
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,280
That's no difference with abandoning him.

306
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,440
If you ask me,

307
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,520
let's get him a wife.

308
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,220
Get him a rich wife.

309
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,760
With Zhang's looks,

310
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,230
it's a guaranteed profit for us.

311
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,360
You're unethical.

312
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,270
All he wants now is to find his memories.

313
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,960
But the more he does,
the more I feel bad for him.

314
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,830
I am afraid that he will
go back to the old way.

315
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,650
Just kept losing his memory,

316
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,940
looking for his memory,

317
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,150
losing memory again,

318
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,349
and looking for his memory again.

319
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,599
<i>I am a man without a past or a future.</i>

320
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,599
<i>If I disappear in this world,</i>

321
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,910
<i>no one will notice.</i>

322
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,300
Didn't you work with Zhang before?

323
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,150
You can ask your team-mates.

324
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,510
You think I haven't thought about it?

325
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,680
Those people were brought
together for the job.

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,480
They all went their way after we got out.

327
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Where can I find them?

328
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,800
I remember there was this one guy.

329
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,870
When we went to Cloud Top Palace,

330
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,850
this guy conspired with
others to cheat my Uncle San.

331
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,600
And then, Uncle San took
care of him and sent him to jail.

332
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,200
He's probably still in there now.

333
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,520
I hope he's been reformed.

334
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,220
So that he can give us
some useful information.

335
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,820
Master Xiao San,

336
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,400
Fatty.

337
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,340
I'm a reformed man now.

338
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,780
During my year in the prison,

339
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,760
I've made two contributions

340
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,590
and received a commendation.

341
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,200
So

342
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,170
now that I've completed my sentence,

343
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,960
I'm no longer the

344
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,970
cynical Bald-headed Chu I used to be.

345
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,220
My friend,

346
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,470
you've counted the money four times.

347
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,880
Pardon me.

348
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,240
Pardon me.

349
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,150
Don't worry.

350
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,000
You'll get this RMB10,000's worth.

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
You just want to know about

352
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,640
Mute Zhang's background, right?

353
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,600
I can tell you two

354
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,520
something that no one else know.

355
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,530
When Master San was anxious

356
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,040
to look for a good fighter,

357
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,080
I had investigated

358
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,590
Mute Zhang's background back then.

359
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,400
Do you guys know

360
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,600
who was Mute Zhang working for

361
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,450
before he worked for Master San?

362
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,730
Who?

363
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,680
Grandpa Si.

364
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,430
Zhang had worked for Chen Pi Ah Si before?

365
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,640
That's right.

366
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,530
Why was he working for Chen Pi Ah Si?

367
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,840
Have you heard of

368
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,950
fish bait?

369
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,440
Grandpa Si,

370
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,760
they are hiring us to
come so far this time.

371
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,550
Can we trust them?

372
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,280
Nothing to be afraid of.

373
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,720
We're all looking for the same thing here.

374
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,160
I think there must be
something fishy going on here.

375
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,800
Maybe someone died

376
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,040
when they went in the first time.

377
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,240
That's why they are
asking us to come this time.

378
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,160
Aren't we here

379
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,720
to look for dead people?

380
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,050
This is the place.

381
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,610
What's that stench?

382
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,010
Let's go down and take a look.

383
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,180
Hold on.

384
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,950
Let Kun scout it first.

385
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,440
Hurry up.

386
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,760
Hurry, hurry.

387
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,070
Hurry up.

388
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,680
Move.

389
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,910
They're using a human?

390
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,200
This is immoral.

391
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,300
Two levels.

392
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,870
Mass grave.

393
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,320
The space inside is too narrow.

394
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,450
Only a little over one meter.

395
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,340
There is standing water.

396
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,440
The coffin is probably
soaked in the water.

397
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,840
No wonder it stinks.

398
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,360
You, you and you.

399
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,240
Go inside and take a look.

400
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,080
Hurry up.

401
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,160
Help!

402
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,320
Help!

403
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,480
-Come up!
-Help!

404
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,380
Come up now!

405
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,300
Help!

406
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,360
Come up!

407
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,280
Seal the hole.

408
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,790
Wait. There are people inside.

409
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,760
Help!

410
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,390
This place is really jinxed.

411
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,060
We shouldn't touch it.

412
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,040
That's Grandpa Si.

413
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,450
He's not someone who would get scared.

414
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,040
He was simply trying to scare
those treasure hunters away

415
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,810
and take it all for himself.

416
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,960
A week later,

417
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,920
he brought his men
and returned to that site.

418
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:36,890
Qi Lue,

419
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,070
move the rocks away.

420
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,080
Grandpa Si,

421
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,720
this place is not a joke.

422
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,690
It's fine that we can go down there.

423
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,920
But if you want to go,

424
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,920
-what if...
-Move it.

425
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,440
Yes.

426
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,600
Move the rocks.

427
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,120
Hurry up, hurry up.

428
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,050
There is something coming out.

429
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,880
You...

430
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,190
How is this possible?

431
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,930
You've been down there for a week.

432
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,430
How are you not dead?

433
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,270
What have you been eating and drinking?

434
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,190
If you go in,

435
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,800
you'll die.

436
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,180
Where did those local treasure hunters
find Zhang?

437
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,940
In a village in Guangxi.

438
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,520
He looked disoriented.

439
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,590
They thought he was a retard.

440
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,050
So they kidnapped him

441
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,960
to be their bait.

442
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,840
I didn't know Zhang had
such a miserable time.

443
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,730
We've managed to keep
him well and healthy now,

444
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,120
and his temperament is quite good.

445
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,650
It hasn't been easy.

446
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,260
For so many years,

447
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,580
he has been alone.

448
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,130
Fake.

449
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,920
Fake.

450
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,690
Fake.

451
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,080
Fake.

452
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,530
Say whatever you like.

453
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,680
Fake.

454
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,680
After that,

455
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,600
Grandpa Si

456
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,320
brought Mute Zhang back with him.

457
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,030
He gave him a job.

458
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,550
And a few years later,

459
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,840
Master San

460
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,020
borrowed Mute Zhang from Grandpa Si.

461
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,300
Master San was particularly
concerned about his identity.

462
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,960
I was ordered to ask
around with his photo.

463
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,420
I had spent two months

464
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,400
and visited countless villages
in Guangxi to ask about him.

465
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,110
Until I found some clues

466
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,640
in Banai, a small village

467
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,840
from last time.

468
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,640
Banai?

469
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,490
That's right. Banai.

470
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,880
There's a stilt house in the village.

471
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,640
Mute Zhang lived there before.

472
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,780
Inside the house,

473
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,600
there was a bed and a table.

474
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,360
There were a lot of photos

475
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,130
under the glass top of that table.

476
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,130
Speaking of which, hold on.

477
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,220
I took this photo

478
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,910
from there.

479
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,640
Why are this man's shoulders so sloped?

480
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,630
And do you find

481
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,860
this place is quite familiar?

482
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,920
Master Xiao San.

483
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,160
Turn it over.

484
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,080
At the back.

485
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,060
<i>Golmud Sanatorium</i>

486
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,490
"Golmud Sanatorium."

487
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,550
Look at the furnishings.

488
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,120
This photo of this Golmud Sanatorium

489
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,890
was taken earlier than the video tape.

490
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,060
Do you have any other photos?

491
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,760
Master Xiao San,

492
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,320
stop kidding.

493
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,040
I investigated it in secret.

494
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,800
I couldn't leave too many traces.

495
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,500
What do you think?

496
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,670
It's worth your money, right?

497
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,720
If you two are interested,

498
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,440
you can visit the place.

499
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,240
Maybe you'll find the remaining photos.

500
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,050
Oh, I almost forgot.

501
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,960
Found it.

502
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,330
Here. This is the address of Banai.

503
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,890

If you really want to go there,

you're going to suffer
a little on the way.

You need to take the

Take the bus after the train.

508

You have to take the ox cart
after you get off the bus.

I'll get to the point.

642
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,449

Fine.

649
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,469
It was a big deal

650

How many of them were there?

655
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,440
About a dozen.

656
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,990

<i>Banai, 1976</i>

658
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,100
It was said that they were

659
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:12,150
They wanted to study our village.

660
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,880
My father was the correspondent.

661
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,520
He then arranged accommodation
and a guide for them.

662
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,130
How long did they stay here?

663
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,240
About six or seven months.

664
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,870
Most of the time, they
travelled in and out of the mountain.

665
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,720
There was nothing unusual about that.

666
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,680
The only unusual thing

667
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
was that the woman

668
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,880
told the guide that

669
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,380
he needed to enter the
mountain every three days.

670
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,280
She stressed that

671
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,780
he shouldn't be earlier than that

672
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,280
or later than that.

Obsessive compulsive disorder.

674
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
That guide,

675
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,270
at first, he entered the mountain

676
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,520
every three days.

677
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,790
He didn't notice anything unusual.

678
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,370
Until that one time,

679
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,320
<i>he needed to help his relative to mow.</i>

680
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,760
<i>So he thought it would be fine if
he just went there one day early.</i>

681
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,240
<i>But on that day,</i>

682
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,030
<i>when he reached the campsite,</i>

683
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,500
<i>he found that it was vacant.</i>

684
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,070
<i>It was like everyone
had vanished into thin air.</i>

685
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
<i>He was terrified,</i>

686
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,900
<i>thinking that maybe he had met ghosts.</i>

687
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,840
<i>But he didn't dare to tell anyone.</i>

688
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,260
<i>So he looked for them alone.</i>

689
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,580
<i>He searched the nearby mountains
and still couldn't find them.</i>

690
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,480
<i>But the next day,</i>

691
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,960
<i>when he came to the campsite again,</i>

692
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,690
<i>he found that those people</i>

693
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,360
<i>had showed up.</i>

694
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,760
<i>They were bustling around the campsite</i>

695
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,800
<i>like nothing happened.</i>

696
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,140
That's spooky.

697
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,080
That guide

698
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,110
just thought it could be
the mountain god's doing.

699
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,840
He didn't dare to say anything.

700
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,460
Only after the expedition team left that

701
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,530
he told the incident to the villagers.

702
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,890
Drink some wine.

703
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,160
-Allay your fear.
-Okay, I need to allay my fear.

704
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,540
And

705
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,500
when the expedition team left,

706
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,940
they brought a dozen crates with them.

707
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,240
It was said that the things inside
were found around this area.

708
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,490
This photo

709
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,520
was taken

710
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,080
before they left.

711
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,130
Because my father had done

712
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,040
a good job helping them,

713
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,680
he became a village officer afterwards.

714
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,160
Yun Cai,

715
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,450
how many words did I say?

716
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,020
<i>Banai, 1976</i>

717
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,960
Are you drunk?

718
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,280
Don't be ridiculous.

719
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,880
Based on my alcohol tolerance,

720
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,040
this amount of liquor...

721
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,480
The man with sloped shoulders.

722
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,440
Where?

723
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,600
Over there.

724
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,350
You're really drunk, aren't you?

725
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,880
I'm not.

726
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,160
I saw him. He's right over there.

727
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,720
Are you drunk, Mr Fatty?

728
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,610
I'm drunk, yes.

729
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,720
Your wine is intoxicating.

731
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,540
Why are you showing me these photos?

732
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,720
I don't know the content in it.

733
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,450
There is nothing in it.

734
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
So it's all static in them?

735
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,520
So many tapes here.

736
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,170
I've watched them a dozen times.

737
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,700
I almost became blind.

738
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,680
There was only static in them.

739
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,740
However,

740
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,880
one of the tapes has
30 seconds of content.

741
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,240
What content was that?

742
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,900
A woman crawling on the floor.

743
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,370
Zhang,

744
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,700
you have quite a luxurious house.

745
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,670
Zhang,

746
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,760
does this wooden house
look familiar to you?

747
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,450
Come on.

748
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,330
Let's check it out.

749
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,630
Let's go.
