1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,970
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 30</i>

4
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,080
You're drawing the Gen symbol
of the Eight Trigrams.

5
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,120
It's incomplete.

6
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,520
Keep going.

7
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,960
This pen seems to have run out of ink.

8
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,360
It's not working.

9
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
Listen, Professor Wu.

10
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,210
Don't you know a simple life hack?

11
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,190
You need to shake the pen for a bit

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,480
for the ink to come out.

13
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,000
Now look.

14
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,440
Gen represents mountain.

15
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,680
Kun represents earth.

16
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,520
Gen appears first in
the Imperial Readings of the Taiping Era.

17
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,840
Because this human-faced tortoise

18
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,360
is a mythical creature
that lives in deep mountain.

19
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Why do you keep looking at me?

20
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
There isn't any word on my face.

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,930
Carry on.

22
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,640
Trigram Gen is followed by Kun and Kan.

23
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,520
Kun represents earth.

24
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,110
Kan represents water.

25
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,350
I'm guessing that this means

26
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,079
the human-faced tortoise
is a god of the earth,

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,079
but its life is tied to water.

28
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,820
Therefore, although it
lives in the mountains,

29
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,880
there must be water around it.

30
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,840
Next, we see another Trigram Kun.

31
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
For this second Trigram Kun,

32
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,480
I'm guessing that

33
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
this must be some kind of combination.

34
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,560
We need to interpret the
whole trigram in context.

35
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,760
And this...

36
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,640
And this...

37
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,520
And...

38
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,520
Alright, alright.

39
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,920
That's enough.

40
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,560
I got it.

41
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,440
You aren't the only
knowledgeable one here.

42
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,720
Actually,

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,640
I've read the Imperial Readings
of the Taiping Era before.

44
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,440
And I

45
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,790
just remembered it.

46
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,360
This human-faced tortoise
here is a mythical creature.

47
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
Trigram Zhen represents thunder.

48
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,350
It means the ability to summon thunder.

49
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,960
Trigram Qian represents sky.

50
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,400
Means this creature can
communicate with deities.

51
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,640
Is my analysis correct?

52
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,920
Absolutely correct.

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,000
The symbols of mountain, earth,
water, earth, thunder and sky here

54
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,750
not only explain the
characteristics of human-faced tortoise,

55
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,320
the hexagram must also

56
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,120
be conveying something else.

57
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,030
Professor Wu,

58
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
you tell me.

59
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,120
I'm thinking that

60
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,640
Chinese culture is extensive and profound.

61
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Among so many mythical beasts,

62
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,200
why did the owner of this mortuary

63
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,360
choose this human-faced tortoise?

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,880
Fatty,

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,900
let me test you.

66
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,720
Why's that?

67
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,280
Why?

68
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,440
Why?

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,650
Why?

70
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,480
Maybe the living environment
of this human-faced tortoise

71
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,080
<i>is similar to the
environment of this building.</i>

72
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,460
<i>It's an old forest with
mountains and water,</i>

73
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,710
<i>with occasional</i>

74
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,560
<i>thunder and rain.</i>

75
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
<i>Am I right?</i>

76
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,120
<i>It's not bad.</i>

77
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,690
Smartypants.

78
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
Madam,

79
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
do we need to check the Imperial
Readings of the Taiping Era?

80
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,990
Never mind.

81
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,110
Let them figure it out.

82
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,320
I just need to make sure

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,200
I will get what I want in the end.

84
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,159
Professor Wu,

85
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,680
this old forest with mountains and water

86
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,480
can either refer to the
Daxing'anling Prefecture

87
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,080
or the Xishuangbanna Prefecture.

88
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Should we look up other information

89
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
and study this human-faced tortoise?

90
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,600
We should

91
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
get out of here first.

92
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,240
We can look up the information anytime.

93
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,560
But the opportunity to examine
the Huo's training ground

94
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
doesn't come easily.

95
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,330
That's right.

96
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,530
You got a point, Professor Wu.

97
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,600
This is such a rare opportunity.

98
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,680
Let's check out the pillar.

99
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,590
Madam, we've recorded it.

100
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:46,390
Come on.

101
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,830
This floor is dedicated
for precious items.

102
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,730
This is quite an effort
by the Huo family.

103
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,060
Using so many quality goods as props.

104
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,180
No kidding.

105
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,650
Everything in this building is
replicated exactly the same.

106
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,810
Mrs Huo went through
so much trouble to set this up.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,160
It must mean it is very important for her.

108
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,080
She did this to familiarize herself

109
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,760
with the environment.

110
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,800
She wants to make
sure she knows this place

111
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,520
well enough that she can travel
in it even with her eyes closed.

112
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,100
She's preparing herself
to minimize risks.

113
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,480
Her purpose is to

114
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,360
visit the place personally.

115
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,160
If what you said is true,

116
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,200
then Mrs Huo is a very rigid person.

117
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
I thought so too.

118
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,520
So maybe I should just give
her the Yangshi Lei Archives.

119
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,080
No need to hide it.

120
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,760
You made such a big fuss

121
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,080
at Xin Yue Restaurant.

122
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,800
Frankly, it's all because of the archives.

123
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,680
I think you've got a point.

124
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,600
After you get out of here,

125
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,920
you should hand over

126
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,560
the archives to her personally.

127
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
She's so old now.

128
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,480
It hasn't been easy for her.

129
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
There isn't any tarpaulin sheets
in the first three floors.

130
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,560
These are all grave goods.

131
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,840
Is it for waterproofing?

132
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,270
Probably.

133
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,560
There's something behind.
Let's tear this off.

134
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,040
Here you go.

135
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,800
It's Lei style architecture indeed.

136
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,170
So generous.

137
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,860
Even a pillar is beautifully designed.

138
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,040
They've covered up this pillar.

139
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,480
No one can see it no
matter how beautiful it is.

140
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,800
Let's rip off all the tarps.

141
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,560
If you put these pillars together,

142
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,320
it forms a backbone.

143
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,560
The reinforcement
measures are well done.

144
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,050
<i>Fourth Floor</i>

145
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,240
This is the fourth floor.

146
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,200
There are three more levels above.

147
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
The reinforcement is
installed in the middle

148
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,720
to resist earthquakes.

149
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,160
You're right.

150
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,820
But the information
was too much to process.

151
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,580
I'm a little confused.

152
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,390
Looks like we should
stay here a little longer.

153
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,680
Let's get this straight first.

154
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,520
Fetch me brush and ink.

155
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,000
Is this really necessary?

156
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,120
Brush and ink?

157
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,710
So that you can see it clearly.

158
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Get it for me.

159
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,160
Brush.

160
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Ink.

161
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,520
Ink stone.

162
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,440
Here you go, professor.

163
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,480
Let's break it down.

164
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,040
<i>When we first came in,</i>

165
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,840
<i>we came across a
simulated quicksand pool.</i>

166
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,560
<i>The building itself
is moisture-resistant.</i>

167
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,580
<i>And this floor</i>

168
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,440
is for the storage of valuable items.

169
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,100
There is an extra layer
of waterproof sheets.

170
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,560
It means that the building
itself is in a very humid location.

171
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,080
Good point.

172
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,310
But southern part of the
Yangtze River is humid.

173
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,970
This building could be located anywhere.

174
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm not finished.

175
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,760
Will you let me finish first?

176
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
-Relax.
-Fine, fine.

177
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,400
Please go on.

178
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,620
<i>I don't know if you guys
have noticed that</i>

179
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,870
what we have seen most since we came in

180
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
is the Qilin sculpture.

181
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,870
<i>And there was a human-faced
tortoise sculpture</i>

182
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,320
<i>in that previous room.</i>

183
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,970
Let me draw a tortoise
shell here as a symbol.

184
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,380
Your tortoise painting is too abstract.

185
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,810
The point is you know what it is, right?

186
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,280
Alright.

187
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,920
Human-faced tortoise and
Qilin are mythical creatures.

188
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,440
It means that...

189
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,580
It means that...

190
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,600
This family that owns a mortuary

191
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,340
must be very ancient.

192
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,360
Yes.

193
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,840
The worship of totems.

194
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,960
<i>Some people even have
the tattoo of Qilin.</i>

195
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,310
<i>But China has 5,000 years of history.</i>

196
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,850
<i>There are countless ancient families</i>

197
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,160
<i>in the south.</i>

198
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,120
Why don't you take over then?

199
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
No, no. I'll prepare the ink for you.

200
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,680
Let's look back at its
reinforcement measures.

201
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,920
The need of such a
large structure for support

202
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,920
<i>indicates that this building is located</i>

203
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,680
<i>in a very unstable location.</i>

204
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
<i>Possibly in the earthquake zone</i>

205
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,160
<i>or landslide prone area.</i>

206
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,990
<i>Landslides must be
a frequent occurrence there.</i>

207
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,710
<i>You're good.</i>

208
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
<i>Here.</i>

209
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,560
This is a mountain.

210
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,520
<i>This is the building.</i>

211
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,560
Now we've narrowed it down
to the south-west mountainous areas.

212
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,530
But the scope is still large.

213
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,480
<i>Actually there is one more thing that</i>

214
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,160
<i>served a crucial role.</i>

215
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,410
<i>If we don't talk about this matter,</i>

216
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,119
<i>Mrs Huo will not know.</i>

217
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,710
Tell me now then.

218
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,320
Do you remember Cox Hendry said that

219
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,280
the source of the Yellow Silk rubbing

220
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,570
<i>has an inextricable connection</i>

221
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,160
<i>with Mrs Huo?</i>

222
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,520
<i>The Yellow Silk can connect Mrs Huo</i>

223
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,380
<i>and Cox Hendry together.</i>

224
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,440
Guess why.

225
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm guessing that

226
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,920
they are after the same thing.

227
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,600
Correct.

228
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,950
If she could make Cox Hendry

229
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,320
to come all the way to Banai

230
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
to lead the team in person,

231
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,040
it's worth it.

232
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,200
So Mrs Huo's effort to study it

233
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,350
and construct a replica building,

234
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,600
it's not really a big deal.

235
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
The trap in the first
floor is alkali powder.

236
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,560
<i>If it was to prevent theft</i>

237
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
<i>or keep certain animals out,</i>

238
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,520
there are many things
that work better than alkali powder.

239
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,400
Unless,

240
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,060
it is to use against things
that are afraid of alkali.

241
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,760
<i>That thing...</i>

242
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,640
<i>That thing...</i>

243
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,400
What is the name of that
human-shaped thing again?

244
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,120
It's called...

245
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
Mi Luo Tuo.

246
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,750
I told you Zhang is the smartest one here.

247
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,520
-That's right.
-You got it right.

248
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,440
Actually,

249
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,520
this place is no stranger to us.

250
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,290
It is

251
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,880
<i>See you in Banai</i>

252
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,550
Zhang

253
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,480
family's

254
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,920
Old

255
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,760
Pavilion.

256
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,910
Mrs Huo,

257
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,390
thank you for telling me that

258
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,920
<i>my Yangshi Lei Archives is also
part of the Zhang family's Old Pavilion.</i>

259
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,040
And,

260
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,920
it is a very crucial part.

261
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,970
<i>Mrs Huo,</i>

262
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,550
<i>we could've talked about this deal</i>

263
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,040
<i>over some drinks.</i>

264
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,310
But you see, now not only
did you not get the archives,

265
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,390
but we even got the information we need.

266
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,970
Awkward.

267
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,360
<i>Master Xiao San,</i>

268
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,790
<i>you've got character.</i>

269
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,960
The truth is the mechanisms on the pillar

270
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,480
set up by Mrs Huo are fake.

271
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,720
These pillars and rivets are empty shells.

272
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,680
She has been controlling them.

273
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Her purpose is

274
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,000
to snatch the archives from us.

275
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,000
Clever boy.

276
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,510
<i>Did you think</i>

277
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,910
<i>your plan would be foolproof</i>

278
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,120
<i>by watching us through a few machines?</i>

279
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,800
Is tricking us the decent thing to do?

280
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,760
Come on.

281
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,860
Let's do what Zhang said.

282
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,880
Let's go.

283
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,840
We have the archives now.

284
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,080
She has to beg us for it.

285
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,960
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

286
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,720
Hold on.

287
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,320
I seem to have forgotten one thing.

288
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,400
What is it?

289
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,130
We are stuck here.

290
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,640
The remote control is still
in the hands of the old lady.

291
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,560
Members of the Wu family.

292
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,600
Each one is more naive than the other.

293
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,200
We only thought about looking cool.

294
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,920
We have no way out.

295
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,680
Someone is smashing the wall.

296
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,680
This is a society governed by law.

297
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,060
Be good.

298
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,400
Huo Xiu Xiu?

299
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,570
Come with me.

300
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,050
Again?

301
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,330
We've fallen for it once.

302
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,600
I really want to help you.

303
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,440
I was tricked by my
grandmother too this time.

304
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,620
Knock it off.

305
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,310
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing.

306
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,200
You...

307
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,320
Wu Xie, you don't trust me too?

308
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,240
If she really was scheming
with her grandmother,

309
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
she wouldn't have to
smash the wall, would she?

310
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,320
Yes.

311
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,640
Let's get out of here first.

312
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,360
I have other things to tell you.

313
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,840
We can come with you.

314
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,360
But we get

315
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,760
to pick the place.

316
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,280
Come on.

317
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,650
Did it have to be here?

318
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,280
This is the safest place.

319
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,560
This is

320
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,600
is most comfortable place.

321
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,120
Wu Xie,

322
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,960
I didn't know Granny would set you up.

323
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,800
And Xiao Hua.

324
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,100
It was him who asked me
to take you to that old store.

325
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,400
I never thought he would

326
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,560
team up with grandma so soon.

327
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,680
When I see him again next time,

328
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,040
I'll ask him about it.

329
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,600
But no matter what,

330
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,040
if I had been more careful,

331
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,840
you wouldn't have to go through all that.

332
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,400
Xiu Xiu,

333
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,800
you were only trying to help us.

334
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,400
Besides, after what we've gone through,

335
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
we actually learnt a lot of things.

336
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,680
By the way,

337
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,690
didn't you say

338
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,410
you have something to tell us?

339
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,770
Wu Xie,

340
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,620
do you remember the two
videotapes you received?

341
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,260
<i>Kunlun Road, Golmud City, Qinghai Province</i>

342
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
Actually you are not

343
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,640
the first person to receive the tapes.

344
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Ten years ago,

345
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,760
someone had sent those
tapes to my grandmother.

346
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,760
Ten years ago?

347
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,320
This situation went on for a long time.

348
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,410
Grandma had hidden those tapes well.

349
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,600
But I've figured out a way recently.

350
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,680
And I found those tapes at last.

351
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,280
Although I didn't find anything

352
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,880
inside those tapes,

353
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
I watched its content.

354
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,920
I saw my aunt Huo Ling
crawling on the ground.

355
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,760
Xiu Xiu,

356
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,200
about the tapes...

357
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,160
I know.

358
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,640
Xiao Hua told me that

359
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,840
another person
was seen crawling in that place too.

360
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,360
-It was you.
-No, it wasn't me.

361
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,520
He told me the same thing.

362
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
He believes that what you saw

363
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,720
was just a person who looks like you.

364
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:09,830
So what I saw,

365
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,650
could also be a person
who looks like my aunt.

366
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
To verify it,

367
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,450
I went through some old photos.

368
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,630
Look at this.

369
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,360
This photo was taken when
my aunt was 18 years old

370
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,000
at Wangfujing Street.

371
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I looked up the model of this mailbox.

372
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,560
Its height is 1.43 metres.

373
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,560
The height of the mailbox in
the photo is five centimetres.

374
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,400
The scale is at 1:28.6.

375
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,480
According to the calculation
based on this scale,

376
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,760
my aunt's height should be

377
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,040
between 1.67 to 1.69 meters.

378
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,200
Look at that photo.

379
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,520
<i>Paracel Islands Archaeological Team, 1985</i>

380
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,890
The archaeological team
of the Paracel Islands.

381
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,040
The camera hanging around this man's neck

382
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,680
was produced by the
Beijing Camera Factory back then.

383
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,400
The model is Great Wall PF-1 SLR.

384
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,160
The length of the actual object

385
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,520
is 14.5 centimetres.

386
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,420
I've made a comparison.

387
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,360
My aunt's height is about

388
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,560
the length of eleven cameras.

389
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,040
So this person's height

390
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,680
is at most 1.6 meters.

391
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,430
There's a difference of eight centimetres.

392
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,600
I mean, eight centimetres.

393
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,640
Look closely.

394
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,200
There's still a difference, right?

395
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,920
Xiu Xiu, actually,

396
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,160
we knew...

397
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,590
So this person in the group photo

398
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,120
is not my aunt.

399
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,640
I went through the old photos in my house.

400
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,800
I noticed that my aunt liked to
take photos since she was a child.

401
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,240
Her photos are sorted by year.

402
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,540
But since 1976,

403
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,550
there hasn't been any more photos
of her in the house.

404
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,870
<i>And then, I found that</i>

405
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,880
<i>in 1976,</i>

406
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,690
<i>she went on an expedition.</i>

407
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,350
<i>I speculate that</i>

408
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,930
<i>after that expedition,</i>

409
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,470
<i>the person who came home
is the one in this photo.</i>

410
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,760
Yes.

411
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,360
Xiu Xiu, listen...

412
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,240
It's fine.

413
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,880
You don't have to console me.

414
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,000
It's been so long.

415
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
I'm just feeling sorry for my grandmother.

416
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,240
I think

417
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,040
the real Aunt Huo Ling

418
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,070
is dead.

419
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,310
But who on earth is the person

420
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,230
who disguised as my aunt?

421
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,790
And why is this person doing this?

422
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,670
Xiu Xiu,

423
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,260
calm down.

424
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,970
You leaned forward when you're emotional.

425
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,680
It made me think you were going
to give me a foot massage.

426
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,240
Since the woman in
the tapes is not my aunt,

427
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,640
then what is the person

428
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
who mailed these tapes trying to do?

429
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,520
Are they trying to deceive my grandmother
that her daughter is still alive

430
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,920
and threaten her?

431
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,560
Or is this simply a warning?

432
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,210
The expedition your aunt went on,

433
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,800
was it in Banai?

434
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,820
How did you know that?

435
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,760
In 1976,

436
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,160
the expedition team in
Banai had an accident.

437
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,000
The guide back then told us that

438
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,720
the whole team was replaced.

439
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,640
After that, the new team

440
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,220
continued to operate under the identities

441
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
of the original members.

442
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,680
According to what you just said,

443
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,600
I think this should be
your aunt's case too.

444
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,400
So,

445
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,920
Xiu Xiu,

446
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,430
about what you just said,

447
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,010
we knew that already.

448
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,590
Wait, you...

449
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,480
You guys...

450
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,260
Xiu Xiu,

451
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,770
we didn't mean to hide it from you.

452
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Besides, a young girl like you

453
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,600
was capable of gathering
so much information.

454
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
That's really impressive.

455
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,040
That's right.

456
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,920
Wu Xie, I understand.

457
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,680
Actually, Xiao Hua, you and I,

458
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,920
we're the same.

459
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,770
Our elders have kept many
things from us since childhood.

460
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
I just don't want our generation

461
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,880
to keep secrets from each other like them.

462
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,160
I consider Xiao Hua and I are friends,

463
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,310
but I can feel that

464
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,880
there are a lot of things
he doesn't tell me.

465
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,960
I don't want you to be like him.

466
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,280
-Actually it's all for your good.
-All for your own good.

467
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,560
Nonsense.

468
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,960
Yes, it's nonsense.

469
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,670
When we were little,

470
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,700
all we knew was playing games.

471
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,160
None of us would have imagined that

472
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,620
the adults in our families

473
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,280
had been caught in
such a complicated mess.

474
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,680
If even we managed to find out
my aunt was swapped,

475
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,120
Granny must have known it long ago.

476
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,320
That's her daughter.

477
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,720
However,

478
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,690
she still has to act

479
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,920
as if nothing had happened.

480
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,760
It must be really tough for her.

481
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,840
Xiu Xiu,

482
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,070
maybe when your grandmother

483
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,720
received the tapes,

484
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,440
she didn't notice it because

485
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,600
because she was overwhelmed
with emotions.

486
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,230
Doesn't matter whether
she noticed it or not.

487
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,600
It's still a devastating
news for my grandmother.

488
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,840
And Xiao Hua told me that

489
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,680
she was the one who organized

490
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,040
the expedition in Banai.

491
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,320
The existence of the swapped team

492
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,720
was meant to defy It.

493
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,970
You know quite a lot.

494
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,400
And that's not all.

495
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,120
From Granny's generation,

496
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,400
the Mystic Nine has
been under Its influence.

497
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,200
Moreover,

498
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,440
Xiao Hua suspected that

499
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,470
It is not a force,

500
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,760
but a compulsion.

501
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,160
A psychological influence.

502
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,680
That's why it could exist anywhere,

503
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,830
anytime.

504
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,440
Otherwise, it would be
difficult to explain all this.

505
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,940
What do you mean?

506
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
I have another thing
I wanted to tell you.

507
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,510
Back then,

508
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,820
he and Granny

509
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,770
were still young.

510
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,510
Who's he?

511
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,950
Granny and Jin Wan Tang.

512
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,990
Don't interrupt.

513
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,080
You...

514
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,680
"Thin clouds delicate in creation."

515
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,680
"Falling stars carry profound sorrows."

516
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,160
There were so many stores in Liulichang.

517
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,760
Yet Fairy,

518
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,080
my grandmother,

519
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,520
walked into Jin Wan Tang's
store out of all the stores.

520
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,240
I don't know what happened

521
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,480
after Jin Wan Tang was kicked out.

522
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,440
However,

523
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,800
after that operation,

524
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,400
It hasn't made any big move.

525
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,240
Until 1976.

526
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,780
I never thought It has the power

527
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,840
to influence the actions of three
generations of the Mystic Nine.

528
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,640
Maybe more than three generations.

529
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
The generations before that,

530
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,690
there's no telling.

531
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,310
Looks like Xiao Hua's speculation
actually made sense.

532
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,560
Chen Wen Jin's expedition team,

533
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,110
Master Hua'er's Yellow Silk,

534
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,820
and Mrs Huo

535
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,320
have a connection with Zhang
family's Old Pavilion in Banai.

536
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,280
Since the Yangshi Lei Archives
depict the Old Pavilion,

537
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,990
could it be that

538
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:59,150
the real Old Pavilion
was actually a mortuary?

539
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,720
The place where the
Zhangs deposited corpses?

540
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,840
No wonder Zhang said

541
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,920
that place is his end.

542
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,620
Zhang might have lost his memories,

543
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:14,610
but his intuition is still quite accurate.

544
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,340
Zhang family's Old Pavilion?

545
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,910
So it's actually
Zhang family's Old Pavilion?

546
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,240
You got guts contacting me.

547
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,600
Alright.

548
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,590
You guys rest up.

549
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,740
I'll see you tomorrow.

550
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Xiu Xiu,

551
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,000
since you're already here,

552
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,640
why don't you take a foot bath first?

553
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,810
You're missing out the joy of it.

554
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:13,790
Wu Xie,

555
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,409
you're still thinking about it.

556
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,670
Stop dwelling on it.

557
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,969
I'm not thinking about anything.

558
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,750
I just thought that

559
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,560
I should've listened to my mum long ago.

560
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,960
My mum's right.

561
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,159
Men should take more foot bath.

562
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,000
From now on, I'm going to take a foot bath

563
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,380
whenever there is a momentous occasion.

564
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,280
That's right.

565
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,960
In a tranquil time.

566
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,159
A foot bath is always the best.

567
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,969
What about you, Zhang?

568
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,639
How are you feeling, Zhang?

569
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,199
It's too comfortable for him.

570
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,679
He fell asleep.

571
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,159
What brought you back?

572
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,040
Regret it, don't you?

573
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,320
Come on, grab a bucket.

574
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,160
Join us.

575
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,640
Come with me now.

576
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,080
Nobody is going to take
me away from this bucket.

577
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,740
What are you doing?

578
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,560
You could've just used words.

579
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,160
Why did you have to break my bucket?

580
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,440
Well, you refused to let it go.

581
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,440
If I hadn't kicked it away,

582
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,320
would you have come with me?

583
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,000
Wu Xie,

584
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,840
you'd better keep the
Yangshi Lei Archives close with you.

585
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,630
When Granny wants something,

586
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,400
she always makes sure she gets it.

587
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,970
I will.

588
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,700
Fatty, what are you looking at?

589
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,250
Xiu Xiu,

590
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,040
we've been circling around all day.

591
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,880
Where exactly are you taking us?

592
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,000
I'm taking you guys

593
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,240
to a completely safe place, of course.

594
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,800
Where are the masks I gave you?

595
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,680
Put it on now.

596
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,920
The three of us are upright and honest.

597
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,560
We are not afraid to show our true faces.

598
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,640
Besides, this mask is so ugly.
I don't want to wear it.

599
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,760
Miss Xiu Xiu, they are?

600
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,080
My friends.

601
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,200
We're having a masquerade party tonight.

602
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,320
-Go and get things ready.
-Copy that.

603
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,320
Xiu Xiu,

604
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,920
are you trying to set us up

605
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,000
by bringing us here?

606
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
What do you know?

607
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,320
This is called hiding in the plain sight.

608
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,920
Xiu Xiu,

609
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,120
are you sure this will work?

610
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,340
Absolutely.

611
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,160
Xiao Hua said

612
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,440
you guys have been discovered.

613
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,360
Just as I thought.

614
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,460
Hiding in plain sight?

615
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,760
More like standing in the spotlight.

616
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
He's coming to our rescue now.

617
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,600
But I think that

618
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,640
we can't really believe
everything he said now.

619
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
You know what, Wu Xie,

620
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,680
why don't you give me the
Yangshi Lei Archives first?

621
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,880
We'll see

622
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,240
what Xiao Hua is up to later.

623
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,400
Go on.

624
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,320
Keep pretending.

625
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,840
I may have trouble remembering faces,

626
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,200
but I never forget

627
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,000
a woman's figure.

628
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,730
You are not Huo Xiu Xiu.

629
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,880
Xie Yu Chen.

630
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,240
Xiao Hua?

631
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,080
That was no fun.

632
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,720
You saw through me so quickly.

633
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,360
There really is such disgusting stuff.

634
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
This outfit came as an disadvantage

635
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,360
when I'm trying to fight you.

636
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,800
You betrayed your friends.

637
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,510
We've got a score to settle.

638
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,240
That's enough, Fatty. Not now.

639
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,640
Master Hua,

640
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,260
what do you mean by this?

641
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,520
Wu Xie, we're after the same thing.

642
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,120
If we want to know the truth,

643
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,840
Mrs Huo is the key.

644
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,280
Besides,

645
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,150
Mrs Huo wants the archives.

646
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,800
If I don't give it to her,

647
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,920
she won't really believe
that I want to work with her.

648
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,760
That's your reason for betraying us?

649
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,560
If I really wanted to betray you guys,

650
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,640
would I have given myself
away and let you find out?

651
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,520
Wu Xie,

652
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I truly hope that

653
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,040
you can meet with Mrs Huo.

654
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
Trust me.

655
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,270
There is no harm in cooperating with her.

656
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,240
Madam, I've brought them to you.

657
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,250
Mrs Huo.

658
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,950
Master Xiao San of the Wu family,

659
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,360
well done.

660
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,480
You're just as slick as your grandfather.

661
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,120
It's nothing.

662
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
It's all thanks to the
appreciation from my elders.

663
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,880
Get up.

664
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,740
That is not your seat.

665
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,240
The Mystic Nine has its rules.

666
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,000
That seat belongs to the Xie family.

667
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,760
A member of the Wu family

668
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,570
should sit there.

669
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,880
Mrs Huo.

670
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,730
Where should I sit then?

671
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,880
You have no place here.

672
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,600
Fine.

673
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,880
The replica in my store

674
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,200
failed to fool you.

675
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,080
And you've seen through

676
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,920
Xiao Xie's disguise as Xiu Xiu.

677
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,360
Looks like Wu Lao Gou

678
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,050
has taught you well.

679
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,700
I'm flattered.

680
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,590
You started to make things up when you

681
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,040
talked about the human-faced tortoise,
didn't you?

682
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,720
Even the password you gave was wrong.

683
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,040
That's right.

684
00:41:27,264 --> 00:41:37,264
