1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,920
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,979
<i>Episode 5</i>

4
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,930
What's the origin of the King Shibie?

5
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,920
I've only seen them twice.

6
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,720
The first time was
at the Seven Star Palace.

7
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
<i>At that time,</i>

8
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,370
<i>it also flew out from a skull.</i>

9
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,520
<i>It only took one</i>

10
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,520
<i>to jeopardise all our lives.</i>

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,640
<i>Though we finally managed to kill it,</i>

12
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,320
<i>we didn't expect</i>

13
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,080
<i>more Shibie insects to show up.</i>

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,360
<i>We escaped the palace by the skins
of our teeth.</i>

15
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,360
I've never seen such a big swarm

16
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
until today.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
Is there any connection
between the King Shibie

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
and the Heavenly Queen Mother?

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
I think so.

20
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,200
I think the ghost jar is used

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,760
to breed the King Shibie.

22
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,480
The Queen Mother uses it
as a biological weapon

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,640
to rule the western region.

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,760
I don't think these bugs

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,000
are only used as weapons.

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
What do you mean?

27
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,640
Everything is still just a guess.

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,720
We can only find the answers at the
Palace of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
We took the wrong way just now.

30
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,900
I don't remember this path.

31
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,030
But I noticed the direction
of the sun as we walked.

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
We're probably heading

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,040
north-north-east.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,240
We don't know
our current location.

35
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,200
So we can only head this way.

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,560
If we're lucky, we might just
make it out of here.

37
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,110
If we're not...

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,390
We'll leave it to fate.

39
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,650
Who knows what else lurks

40
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,050
in the Devil City.

41
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,250
Luckily it's cloudy.

42
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,170
We're not even properly equipped.

43
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,570
We'd definitely be
dehydrated if the sun is out.

44
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,370
The temperature here is extreme.

45
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,530
The weather is also unpredictable.

46
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,690
It's best to leave this
place before night falls.

47
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,010
Otherwise,

48
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,210
we'll die here.

49
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,770
We only have six hours.

50
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,850
I think we're on the right track.

51
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,090
Let's go on.

52
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,890
Hyphae?

53
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,120
That's a type of fungus.

54
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,570
which means we have
something to eat later.

55
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,410
Stop joking around.

56
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,530
Do you hear anything?

57
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,130
Of course.

58
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,930
I'm a blind man.

59
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,770
This thing has been
following us all day.

60
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,770
Not human?

61
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,930
Definitely not.

62
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,530
Humans don't glide.

63
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,890
What is it then?

64
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,130
A huge mushroom.

65
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,850
I heard there's a type of fungus

66
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,010
that feeds on petroleum.

67
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,250
It also discharges

68
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,200
silk-like filaments.

69
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,290
Theoretically, it shouldn't be too big.

70
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,370
But think about it,

71
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,740
it has been here for 70 to 80 years.

72
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,010
Who knows how big it is now.

73
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,370
Does it attack people?

74
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,770
No, it doesn't.

75
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,600
But it's instinctively clingy.

76
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,810
Isn't that even more terrifying?

77
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,890
Yes, indeed.

78
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,690
With these hyphae,

79
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,340
we're pretty much doomed.

80
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,490
So many people died here.

81
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,170
They must have disturbed the
Shibie nest.

82
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,730
I think Wu Xie went out.

83
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,370
He left so suddenly.

84
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,530
He must have not brought any supplies.

85
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,930
We must find him quick.

86
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,170
Where should we search?

87
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,890
Nobody leaves marks nowadays.

88
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,320
Back then, the guide said

89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,480
the Devil City is about
80 square kilometres wide.

90
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,690
We must find Wu Xie

91
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,370
no matter what.

92
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,890
-Okay.
-Let's go.

93
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,730
Look at this guy.

94
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,610
I thought he's not worried about Wu Xie.

95
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,930
Apparently, it was all talk.

96
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,610
How long have we been walking?

97
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,270
Almost four hours.

98
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,409
Assuming we walk five kilometres an hour,

99
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,890
We would've walked about 20 kilometres.

100
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,440
We must have walked
more than 20 kilometres.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,040
Tashi mentioned before

102
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,080
that this Devil City

103
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,860
is about 80 square kilometres.

104
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,610
Even if we're unlucky,

105
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,490
we should get out in three days

106
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,290
if we just walk in one direction.

107
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,570
We "should?"

108
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,170
That's the kind of thinking

109
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,010
that gets you killed.

110
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,030
My vitals are declining.

111
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,930
Please don't scare me.

112
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,050
I'm not scaring you.

113
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,560
Without physical activity,

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,520
a person can survive for three days
without water.

115
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,350
But now, we're too exhausted.

116
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,710
We won't make it through the night.

117
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,530
I can do without water.

118
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,410
I can drink urine.

119
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,690
But in your case...

120
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,890
I'll live long after you're dead.

121
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,370
Because I can eat you.

122
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,030
I told you not to scare me!

123
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,210
I'm not scaring you.

124
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,840
If push comes to shove,

125
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,080
I won't hesitate to do so.

126
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,409
Blood can replenish water

127
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,810
and meat can replenish energy.

128
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,210
Also, I'm warning you.

129
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:44,610
The Devil City has a unique
geological structure.

130
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,290
If you go around digging for plants

131
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,650
just to fill your empty stomach,

132
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,130
it can cause a huge landslide.

133
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,090
Then, we'll be dead.

134
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,690
I don't want to die with you.

135
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,210
Let's get going.

136
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,570
I hope we're not lost.

137
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,090
Do you think I want to follow you?

138
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,260
You're more terrifying
than the Devil City!

139
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,370
What's that?

140
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,550
Gerbil.

141
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,570
That's good news.

142
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,730
Yes.

143
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,930
If a gerbil can come in through a gap,

144
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,090
it means we can also get out.

145
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,050
That's right.

146
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,130
Wait,

147
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,910
you mean you can squeeze
through the gerbil hole?

148
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,680
After you get out,

149
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
you should learn contortion.

150
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,490
Only kids can do that.

151
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,570
It's too late for me.

152
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,090
The path of the gerbil
hole looks irregular.

153
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,750
It's a desert above us.

154
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,490
There's no place that is wet here.

155
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,890
How are we supposed to dig?

156
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,010
Are you crazy?
Why are you messing with it?

157
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,610
I just want to study it.

158
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,730
You're too quick. I can't
even get a glimpse of it.

159
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,610
Hurry up.

160
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,650
If we don't leave,

161
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,610
we'll be hung and air-dried
by these things.

162
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,320
How?

163
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,970
With your help.

164
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,610
It's almost dark.

165
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,570
It's dark.

166
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,970
It's getting chilly.

167
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,370
You're out of sweat.

168
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,930
Here,

169
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,330
take this.

170
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,610
You still have water?

171
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,809
Why are you giving me this
when there's no water?

172
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,320
While you're alive,

173
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,940
I should collect your sweat

174
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,289
for later use.

175
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,850
Are you even human?

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,610
If we don't think of something,

177
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,830
neither of us would be human
for much longer.

178
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,630
You want to kill me, right?

179
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,050
Fine,

180
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,130
pass my message

181
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
to Zhang,

182
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:10,690
Fatty

183
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,930
and my uncle.

184
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,250
Your hands were shaking just now.

185
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,330
The convulsion is obviously
due to heatstroke.

186
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,730
I hit you to stimulate your muscles

187
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,290
so you won't die from seizures.

188
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,290
Leave your last words for another time

189
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,690
to avoid the embarrassment.

190
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,530
We've been walking for ages.

191
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,210
These rocks

192
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,290
and this fork

193
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,170
look familiar.

194
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,080
Did you leave marks along the way?

195
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,570
We can't turn back.

196
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,210
It's the same.

197
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,370
The picture.

198
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,810
We've been bamboozled
by this city.

199
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,570
What do you mean?

200
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,250
Pan Zi, look.

201
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,250
Both paths at the fork

202
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,530
have rocks.

203
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,810
One path has more rocks than the other.

204
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,670
The path with less rocks

205
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,570
looks easier to traverse.

206
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,010
So people tend to choose it.

207
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,350
It's the same everywhere.

208
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,850
Subconsciously,

209
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,370
one will take the path with lesser rocks.

210
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,530
It may seem we're the
ones who choose the path,

211
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,050
but the direction

212
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,330
has already been decided by others.

213
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,610
I remember

214
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,890
we took three paths with more rocks.

215
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,600
Master Pan has a really good memory.

216
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,430
But here's the strange thing.

217
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,130
Even though we sometimes
chose the path with more rocks,

218
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:11,410
we still ended up on the path
with less rocks.

219
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,530
As if guided by the city itself.

220
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,850
Here on out,

221
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,930
we'll stick to paths with more rocks.

222
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
Wait,

223
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,250
it looks like

224
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,400
it's going to be dark soon.

225
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,560
And cold.

226
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,450
Let's set up a camp here.

227
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,650
We'll move out when it's light.

228
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,930
Okay.

229
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,590
I didn't expect the temperature difference
to be this huge.

230
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,090
Take it off.

231
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,170
No way.

232
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,890
My clothes have been wet since day time.

233
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,610
And now it's cold.

234
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,490
If I take them off,
I'll freeze to death.

235
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,250
Wearing wet clothes at night

236
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,690
is practically suicide.

237
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,970
What are you thinking about?

238
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,850
I was thinking

239
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,350
we could get out of here

240
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,690
if we continue walking.

241
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,080
And if we fail,

242
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,730
we'll die from dehydration.

243
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,410
I don't even know

244
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,410
if I'll live to see tomorrow.

245
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,810
We'll probably die tomorrow.

246
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,680
Are you ready to give up?

247
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,990
Can you not ask such difficult questions?

248
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,330
Survival and death

249
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,730
is a philosophical question.

250
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,700
Can't I think
about it occasionally?

251
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:16,290
Other than wasting

252
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,250
time on these questions,

253
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,090
think about how
to get through the night.

254
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,150
We should conserve our energy.

255
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,360
Let's hide from the wind in this hollow.

256
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,520
Let's use these rocks

257
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,610
to build a barrier.

258
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,170
Good.

259
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,490
A little exercise will keep me warm.

260
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,020
The rocks you carry

261
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,040
shouldn't be more than
half of your body weight.

262
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,970
Otherwise, you'll strain yourself.

263
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,370
It's not worth it.

264
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,050
Half my body weight?

265
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,700
You think too highly of me.

266
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,980
Are you sure this method works?

267
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,100
There's no other way.

268
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,630
I know my hearing is good,

269
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,730
but are you sure you want me

270
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,970
to listen to the wind?

271
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,330
That's better than

272
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,170
being wrapped by hyphae alive.

273
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,730
That's true.

274
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,410
But

275
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,570
this concerns both our...

276
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,170
-Both our what?
-Quiet.

277
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,810
Listen.

278
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,810
What is it?

279
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,370
Come over this side.

280
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,970
Can you hear it?

281
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,850
Come over a little if you can't hear it.

282
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,530
So? Can you hear it?

283
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,450
-No.
-Then move over here a little.

284
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,560
Come, it's here.

285
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,960
Come over and listen.

286
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,550
You can hear the wind.

287
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:03,650
Here it is.

288
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,130
All pipes have a connection point,

289
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,730
let alone those from the Republic.

290
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,690
The gerbil must have come in through it.

291
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,130
Alright,

292
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,570
let's blast it.

293
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,970
By the way,

294
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,520
I will throw the detonator
into the pipe over there.

295
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,920
Once it explodes,

296
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,090
the cracks in the pipe
should open up,

297
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,720
and the quicksand will flow in.

298
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,620
I'll climb up the slope towards
where the sand is falling

299
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,750
and pull you up.

300
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,610
The only problem is,

301
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,130
we must hurry

302
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,300
because this is a petroleum pipeline.

303
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,250
Before the explosion hits this side,

304
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,560
you must climb up.

305
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,130
You've already planned it so well,

306
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,880
what else can I say?

307
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,010
Then hurry up.

308
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,490
Since I'm a kind person,

309
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,440
I'll definitely make you

310
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,690
a plate of
capsicum meat strips fried rice

311
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,290
without the capsicum if
we get out of here safely.

312
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,730
Hurry up.

313
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,140
It feels much warmer now.

314
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,410
Why did you build it so far apart?

315
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,920
Don't we need a big space
for two people to sleep in?

316
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,770
The rock barrier is to keep the heat in.

317
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,040
What's the difference between
having such a large space

318
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,800
and the open air?

319
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,900
I see. Give me a few minutes.

320
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,710
I'll do it over again.

321
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,370
Hurry up.

322
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,610
Your hearing is pretty good.

323
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,770
It can really crack a hole.

324
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,810
There's no quicksand. Now what?

325
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,610
Hurry!

326
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,570
I'll give you a boost.

327
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,730
Hurry!

328
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,130
What's wrong?

329
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,750
What kind of method are you
using to stop spasm this time?

330
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,230
You want to kill me, right?

331
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,490
May as well do it.

332
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,250
But you must live

333
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,290
for both of us.

334
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,870
I really wanted

335
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,650
to kill you just now.

336
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,980
Without water and food,

337
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,500
we can't survive for two days.

338
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,810
Then, why didn't you make your move?

339
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,470
If it was in the past,

340
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,860
I wouldn't show any mercy

341
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,900
in order to survive.

342
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,250
You've changed.

343
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,940
Stop your nonsense.

344
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:44,620
Let's get going.

345
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,370
It's as if the Devil City is cursed.

346
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,090
What are you doing?

347
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,220
If someone is searching for us,

348
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,770
this may be our hope.

349
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,010
At least

350
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,840
they can find our bodies.

351
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,080
This mark

352
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,640
is pretty expensive.

353
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,740
It's as if you're putting
a gold brick here.

354
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,930
This is worth our lives,

355
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,720
which are priceless.

356
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,410
Hopefully,

357
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,070
it doesn't point

358
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,160
to the direction of our resting place.

359
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,130
What are you doing?

360
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,250
Since last night,

361
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,030
everything before my eyes
is spinning.

362
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,120
Even my hand

363
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,050
is spinning now.

364
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,430
I just want to see

365
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,290
whether it's my hand

366
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,810
or the ground that's spinning.

367
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,530
You're just

368
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,210
dizzy.

369
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:49,170
Not necessarily.

370
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,050
No one knows what lurks

371
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,130
in the Devil City.

372
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,210
Are you starting to confuse

373
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
the possible

374
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,650
with the impossible?

375
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,170
Yes.

376
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,760
Was I flying?

377
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,770
I really felt

378
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,130
as if I was flying.

379
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,370
That's because you're exhausted

380
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,130
and you can't feel your legs.

381
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,370
I'll enjoy the scenery then.

382
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,610
Look.

383
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,530
The sun sure is big today.

384
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,730
I hope it'll rain.

385
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,890
Did you know every culture

386
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,290
has a rain-making dance?

387
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,430
Why not give it a try?

388
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,970
Why didn't you defend yourself

389
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,810
when I tried to kill you just now?

390
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,500
After bickering with you,

391
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,270
I've grown attached.

392
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
But you,

393
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,680
why are you always so rational?

394
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,370
This is a normal response
from the computer program.

395
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,050
That's right.

396
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,350
You're a robot.

397
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,190
That makes sense.

398
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,120
Why do you have the energy

399
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,130
to talk so much

400
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,660
but none for walking?

401
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,490
I'd pass out if I don't talk.

402
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,930
You'd better

403
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,590
use another way to stay conscious.

404
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,450
You'll only

405
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,690
tire yourself out this way.

406
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,500
If we can see the Gobi Desert

407
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,730
after that rocky mountain,

408
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,140
I'll immediately...

409
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,930
Ah Ning?

410
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,210
Ah Ning?

411
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,310
We must hurry.

412
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,990
Jeez,

413
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,070
stop rushing.

414
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm fed up with these rocks.

415
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,370
These lousy rocks.

416
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:20,840
Wait a minute.

417
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,690
A Dangshi Copper Coin?

418
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,330
People have been here since
the Qing Dynasty?

419
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:43,330
Nonsense.

420
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,030
It looks so clean.

421
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,950
How could it be from the Qing Dynasty?

422
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,570
You have a point.

423
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,000
I should take a good look at it.

424
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,870
Interesting,

425
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,960
you know that this coin is valuable too?

426
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,250
It's going to rain.

427
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,450
We must hurry then.

428
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,590
Another Dangshi Copper Coin.

429
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,730
I'm going to be rich.

430
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:29,770
Could this be used

431
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,090
by somebody for marking?

432
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,690
Who would use something
valuable for marking?

433
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,410
In all my years of adventuring...

434
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,500
It's Ah Ning.

435
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Over here.

436
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,130
These coins belonged
to Ah Ning's collection.

437
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,690
Wu Xie must be with Ah Ning.

438
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,490
Unless she's desperate,

439
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,690
she wouldn't use such a valuable item
for marking.

440
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,300
We must find them quickly.

441
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,960
It's too cold.

442
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,520
Are you a person or something else?

443
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,140
I'm a person.

444
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,490
A live or dead person?

445
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,650
I'm a live person.

446
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,240
Then, why did you

447
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,760
lie on the sand for no reason?

448
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,570
I just want to dig

449
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,930
some cactus for us to eat.

450
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,670
Why didn't you move when I kicked you?

451
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:56,970
I saw you walking over

452
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,410
and wanted to scare you.

453
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,530
I think

454
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,420
you're trying to run off with the money.

455
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,200
Otherwise, those things won't be there.

456
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,920
I was being kind.

457
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,310
I was afraid you won't be able
to find me when you wake up.

458
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,650
So I came here.

459
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,130
Is this okay?

460
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,130
Should we squeeze together

461
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,490
like real pals?

462
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:24,650
Zhang,

463
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,130
come closer.

464
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,490
Fatty, this won't do.

465
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,670
It's obviously fake if
Wu Xie's head is placed that way.

466
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,750
You're so troublesome.

467
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,570
Zhang, make a sign.

468
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,050
Your fingers.

469
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,170
Two of them.

470
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:48,930
That's it.

471
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,650
Ready.

472
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,610
Three,

473
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,530
two,

474
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,610
one.

475
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,290
Am I dead?

476
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,370
Yes, you're dead.

477
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,410
We're reunited in hell.

478
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,330
Hit yourself if you don't believe me.

479
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,170
Why didn't you hit him?

480
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,570
I'm no match for him.

481
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,200
He was awake the whole time.

482
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,370
Pan Zi.

483
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,450
Wu Xie.

484
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,470
You don't have to say anything.

485
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,620
It's my uncle's doing.

486
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,350
So, you've heard what we said.

487
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,720
I've been awake for some time.

488
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,370
I was just too lazy to move.

489
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:38,480
Wu Xie isn't as innocent as he used to be.

490
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,410
He's being naughty now.

491
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,770
Do you know where
your uncle is heading?

492
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,330
He's going to Tamutuo in search of
the Queen Mother's Palace.

493
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:50,810
It's because of Chen Wen Jin, right?

494
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,250
The things they're seeking

495
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,570
are the same.

496
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:57,970
This kid knows quite a lot.

497
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,610
I know a certain fatty

498
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,490
who received a phone call

499
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:06,850
after I finished watching a video.

500
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,410
A big job, he said.

501
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,250
Turns out the job

502
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,120
was to run away with my uncle.

503
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,610
Look,

504
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,690
chill out.

505
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,490
Your uncle made me an offer

506
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,170
I couldn't refuse.

507
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,530
Of course I was tempted.

508
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,610
Besides you,

509
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,210
even Zhang

510
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,370
and Mr Black

511
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,730
went over to Ah Ning's side.

512
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,530
Everybody has a cut

513
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,050
or two.

514
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,210
I'm the only one

515
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,090
who comes here

516
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,450
without any monetary gains!

517
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,610
I feel ripped off.

518
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,690
Calm down.

519
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:36,970
Don't be mad.

520
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,050
Okay,

521
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,410
since we've found Wu Xie,

522
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,930
we should head back.

523
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,030
I'm not going back

524
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,890
until we set things straight.

525
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,930
I'm not going back to be fooled
by my sly uncle again.

526
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,170
Besides,

527
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,740
I'm sure Zhang has some questions.

528
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,630
Throughout our journey,

529
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,010
from the Seven Star Palace

530
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,210
to the Paracel Island

531
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,460
to the Cloud Top Palace,

532
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,970
aren't we searching for the same things?

533
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,540
Including the Mystic Nine.

534
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,850
All these years,

535
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,850
we had the same goal.

536
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,560
We're searching for the same things

537
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,200
as our elders.

538
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,610
Third Uncle,

539
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,610
Huo Ling, Chen Wen Jin.

540
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,930
Didn't their archaeological team

541
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,650
walk down this path too?

542
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,190
We're getting close to the truth.

543
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,010
I must know the truth.

544
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,650
The Mystic Nine is in the past,

545
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:27,120
it has nothing to do with you.

546
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,450
Why not?

547
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,370
I saw my doppelganger

548
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,570
in the Paracel Islands.

549
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,010
There's even a footage
of me crawling on the floor.

550
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,320
How do you explain that?

551
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,610
She's also searching

552
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,040
for something, isn't she?

553
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,130
It's my boss,

554
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,000
Cox Hendry, who's searching.

555
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,050
He has to find it.

556
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,290
Or else he'll die of old age.

557
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,530
I saved you.

558
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,610
But no need to thank me.

559
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,210
I've already received my commission.

560
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,420
String them together

561
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
and don't lose them.

562
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,450
Buy seven free one.

563
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,740
There's even a free gift.

564
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,890
Not bad.

565
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,790
Since everyone is
searching for the same thing,

566
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,290
do you want to split up

567
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,610
or join forces?

568
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,730
Ms Ah Ning,

569
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,310
are you telling us

570
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,370
you want to search with us?

571
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:20,810
Don't worry,

572
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,010
I understand.

573
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,450
We can divide the spoils

574
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,020
once we find it.

575
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,570
It's a team effort, after all.

576
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,310
Since we're going to search together,

577
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,080
why not share information?

578
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,600
Information?

579
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,720
The tape.

580
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,320
Didn't you give the tape to Wu Xie?

581
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,970
Since we're working together,

582
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,250
don't pretend to be ignorant.

583
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,210
You've seen

584
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,090
what we've been through

585
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,530
since Paracel Island.

586
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,730
I only have fragments of the clues.

587
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:50,130
To be precise,

588
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,250
those aren't clues

589
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,610
but orders.

590
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,210
My boss told me

591
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,170
the tape would lead me
to the porcelain plate

592
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,450
and the Queen Mother's Palace.

593
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,850
Madam Dolma is our only clue.

594
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,170
Only she knows how to enter.

595
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,250
Then where is she?

596
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,130
We got separated.

597
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,490
But time is of the essence.

598
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,130
We're running out of time.

599
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,810
If we miss it,

600
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,490
we'll have to wait five years.

601
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,930
So we must enter the Devil City

602
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,410
to find the Queen Mother's Palace.

603
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,570
Ah Ning,

604
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,640
you received a tape

605
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
and so did I.

606
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:27,590
But there's three of them.

607
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,490
Who has the third one?

608
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,250
How did you know there are three tapes?

609
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,970
That's because I have
Chen Wen Jin's notes.

610
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,680
<i>Notebook</i>

611
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,610
Wait a minute.

612
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,930
The situation has changed.

613
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,650
The information we have
is more useful than yours.

614
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,330
The coins

615
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,690
aren't enough.

616
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:53,810
Wu Xie, you...

617
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,810
You know nothing about business.

618
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,310
I've gone through the whole thing.

619
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,000
There's just one thing I don't get.

620
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,570
What is it?

621
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
"It."

622
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,690
Here, have this.

623
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,040
We're out of packed lunch?

624
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,330
You bet.

625
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,469
You demolished the last one.

626
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,650
Just think of it

627
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,530
as fried rice.

628
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,929
By the way,

629
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,290
what's your name?

630
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,810
Just call me Black.

631
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,290
Come on, you expect me

632
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,600
to call you Black?

633
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,090
What's your real name?

634
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,650
It's an ugly name.

635
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:39,889
I can't say it.

636
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,469
Then write it down.

637
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,850
I guess I'll just call you Shades

638
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,090
or Black next time.

639
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,250
The tapes were their last

640
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,840
security measure.

641
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,450
<i>When the tapes are sent out,</i>

642
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,210
<i>it means the person
who safeguards the tapes</i>

643
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,490
<i>has lost contact with me.</i>

644
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,170
<i>Either</i>

645
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,290
<i>I'm already dead</i>

646
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,450
<i>or "it" has</i>

647
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,850
<i>already found me.</i>

648
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:14,090
Or maybe

649
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,010
"it" has already found her.

650
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:18,370
They?

651
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,690
"It?"

652
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Wu Xie,

653
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,310
I'm confused.

654
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,000
It's complicated.

655
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,880
But there seems to be a huge secret

656
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,620
associated with "it".

657
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:33,130
Not even Chen Wen Jin and his
team could figure it out

658
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,450
after so many years.

659
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,130
Let alone us, in such a short time.

660
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,730
We should take one step at a time.

661
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,550
The problem now is,

662
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,300
how do we get out?

663
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,650
I noticed something a long time ago.

664
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,450
Do you realise,

665
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:51,210
this is no longer the original Devil City?

666
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,130
It's not the original one?

667
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,330
We're in an elaborate system of yardangs.

668
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,790
<i>It's made up of over ten
little Devil Cities.</i>

669
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,760
<i>Smack in the middle is the Gobi.</i>

670
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,040
<i>This Devil City connects</i>

671
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,880
<i>through the rocky mountains</i>

672
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,600
<i>to other Devil Cities,</i>

673
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,840
<i>forming a huge chain</i>

674
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:12,530
of Devil Cities.

675
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,860
You're saying

676
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,530
we've been following this chain...

677
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,610
Or,

678
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,890
we've been misled all along.

679
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,650
Wu Xie is indeed clever.

680
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,210
There are many rocks in Devil City.

681
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,940
They may look messy.

682
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,690
But they're meticulously placed.

683
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:28,730
For example,

684
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,770
after climbing over a mountain,

685
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,330
there will be a path with more rocks

686
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,770
and a path with less rocks.

687
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,730
I get it now.

688
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,810
When you don't know

689
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,570
where to go,

690
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:40,930
your subconscious mind

691
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,200
will tell you

692
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,930
to take the path with less rocks.

693
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,090
Correct.

694
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,450
Besides,

695
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,810
almost every path looks the same.

696
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,770
If you take a wrong path,

697
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,490
the odds are you'll end up
where you started.

698
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,450
This phenomena is nothing new.

699
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,490
Some obscure guy from ancient times

700
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,250
even gave it a name,

701
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,330
which is

702
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:04,090
Qimen Dunjia.

703
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,650
These rocks seem very old.

704
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,650
This must've been a battlefield.

705
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,490
<i>The Heavenly Queen Mother,
adept in divination,</i>

706
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:17,730
<i>must've used the rock formation
for defence.</i>

707
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,130
Chen Wen Jin's note mentioned

708
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,290
that the Queen Mother's kingdom

709
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,710
was protected by an invisible wall.

710
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,150
<i>You may not see it,</i>

711
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,290
<i>but when you approach it,</i>

712
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,490
<i>you'll be deterred.</i>

713
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,810
<i>This place must be flooded</i>

714
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,090
<i>thousands of years ago,</i>

715
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,890
<i>which means a water belt</i>

716
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,130
<i>encircled the area</i>

717
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,310
<i>like a moat.</i>

718
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,210
<i>If this water belt</i>

719
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,610
<i>is the invisible wall,</i>

720
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,930
<i>then the Queen Mother's Palace
should be inside.</i>

721
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,250
In other words,

722
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,250
the centre of the Devil City.

723
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,070
According to Madam Dolma,

724
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,890
if we walk westward

725
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,670
along the riverbed for two days,

726
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,410
we'll reach the rocky mountain pass
where she lost

727
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,850
Chen Wen Jin and his team.

728
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,030
Madam Dolma doesn't know

729
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,600
what lies beyond that.

730
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,690
We should wait for Master San's team

731
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,730
and walk downstream.

732
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,730
The ancient city must
be nearby the river channel.

733
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,730
That was the route taken
by the team back then.

734
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,770
We can try our luck the same way.

735
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,210
But if the ancient river
reaches this area,

736
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,410
it's basically connected
to the Gobi Desert.

737
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,850
We can't even see it up close.

738
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,850
There's no need for you...

739
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,820
Is it going to rain?

740
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,730
But this is the Gobi Desert.

741
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,420
It hardly rains here.

742
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,560
It's almost time.

743
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,010
Madam Dolma said

744
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,950
if we miss this chance,

745
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,240
we'll have to wait five years.

746
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:48,010
She was probably referring to the rain.

747
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,930
It's raining intermittently

748
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,210
all over the place.

749
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,010
It can only mean one bad thing.

750
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,640
-The Devil City covers a huge area.
-Yes.

751
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,410
Besides, we haven't heard from Wu San Xing

752
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,850
for quite some time.

753
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,600
This is not a good sign.

754
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,720
We fell down the oil pipeline

755
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,880
by accident.

756
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,050
Wu San Xing's directions

757
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,130
can't be wrong.

758
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,880
What if he changed his mind

759
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,050
and went home?

760
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,920
And here we are going
after him like a fool.

761
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,330
No.

762
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:26,010
Wu San Xing has to find the
Queen Mother's Palace.

763
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,850
Look around us.

764
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,370
The rocky paths look mighty strange.

765
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,090
Must be the Qimen Dunjia.

766
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,010
There are different kinds of Qimen Dunjia.

767
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,970
We must first identify which one it is.

768
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,410
Okay.

769
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,650
We can take the opposite way.

770
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,730
This place looks a little different.

771
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,280
Why do I feel there's something

772
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,730
in this rock?

773
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,050
There's a sheen to it.

774
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,160
It's a fossil!

775
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,150
This is going to be worth it.

776
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,840
Even if we can't find the Palace,

777
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,570
a fossil is still worth it.

778
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,800
It's a good idea to excavate and study it.

779
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,840
It might help us get out of here.

780
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,610
-What's wrong?
-What rotten luck.

781
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,210
What's wrong, Fatty?

782
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,770
Is the fossil in bad shape?

783
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,510
It's too good actually.

784
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,280
See for yourself.

785
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:18,154
