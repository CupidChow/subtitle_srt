1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,880
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>Episode 22</i>

4
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,229
It's that scent again.

5
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,270
<i>Mr Panma.</i>

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,160
<i>Mr Panma.</i>

7
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,700
<i>Mr Panma.</i>

8
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,510
It's...

9
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,829
Is it Ms Chen?

10
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,520
<i>Mr Panma.</i>

11
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,600
<i>Mr Panma.</i>

12
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,860
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

13
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,040
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

14
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,020
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

15
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,590
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

16
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,030
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

17
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,930
Who?

18
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,610
You mean...

19
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,600
Do you mean Wu Xie?

20
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,440
Uncle Panma?

21
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,720
Come on.

22
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,760
Take over for a while.

23
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,340
I'll scout ahead.

24
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,650
All right.

25
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,270
Uncle Panma.

26
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
What's wrong?

27
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,290
The sun is coming out.

28
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,900
The sun is coming out.

29
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,840
There is less likely to be landslide.

30
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,550
Isn't that good?

31
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,520
So why were you sighing?

32
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,080
I thought the rain would
go on for five to six days.

33
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,050
I thought there would surely be landslide.

34
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,730
But the rain stopped.

35
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,810
It's all right.

36
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Even without the landslide,

37
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,080
you're still not getting off
Yang Jiao Mountain.

38
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,900
I was willing to help you

39
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,409
because of that person

40
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,810
who threatened me with my past.

41
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,710
I had no choice but to comply.

42
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,230
I thought you would be different.

43
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,820
I thought you could help my family.

44
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,170
But in the end,

45
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,220
even you tried to trick me.

46
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,230
You resorted to deception

47
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,760
and hoped to blackmail me with my past.

48
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,630
You want me to work for you.

49
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,910
Uncle Panma.

50
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
I was going to tell you
when we reach the lakeside.

51
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
But since you've found out,

52
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,440
I'll apologize to you.

53
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,090
As you know, after days of raining

54
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,300
the mountain paths are perilous.

55
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,950
I didn't mean to lie to you.

56
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,070
But this is urgent.

57
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,380
I must rescue my friends.

58
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,290
You're the only one
who can lead me to them.

59
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,050
It doesn't matter if you meant it or not.

60
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,530
I don't care anyway.

61
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
I took so many lives.

62
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,430
After I die,

63
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,980
there will be plenty of souls

64
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,550
who would want to have revenge on me.

65
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,350
If I can deal with him,

66
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,870
I can deal with you just as easily.

67
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,159
What do you want?

68
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,440
Uncle Panma, calm down!

69
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,030
Calm down!

70
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,920
Stay away from me!

71
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,680
Uncle Panma, stop it!

72
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,790
I didn't want to harm you.
I just want to save my friends!

73
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,510
To save them?

74
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,780
Even now you still lie to me!

75
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
I found it!

76
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,160
I didn't lie to you!

77
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,280
My friend told to me once.

78
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,660
They recovered the remains
and posed them here.

79
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,040
They can't be far now.

80
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,559
Why are you staring at me?

81
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,000
Are you all right?

82
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,980
They...

83
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,559
They are back.

84
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,780
They are all back.

85
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
You...

86
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,000
Who are you?

87
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
What are you talking about?

88
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,330
They can't be far.

89
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,830
They are close.

90
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,660
But you won't be seeing them again!

91
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,250
You are different from him.

92
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,360
You actually recovered the remains.

93
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,410
You...

94
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,310
Who exactly are you?

95
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,890
We just want to know the truth.

96
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,520
If we can find the answers,

97
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,490
Sloped-shoulder

98
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,290
won't be able to blackmail you again!

99
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,630
Uncle Panma.

100
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,720
Put your weapon down.

101
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,390
It's not too late to turn back.

102
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,850
Don't you dare try to fool me again!

103
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,040
When I murdered with my hands,

104
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,310
there was already no turning back for me.

105
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
Uncle Panma!

106
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,590
Calm down!

107
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,750
Don't repeat your own mistakes!

108
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,650
Panma, calm down!

109
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,810
It's not too late to stop!

110
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,840
Calm down!

111
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,320
I remember now.

112
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,860
It was you.

113
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,950
Uncle Panma.

114
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,980
Calm down.

115
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,740
I killed you.

116
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,290
All of you are working against me!

117
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,430
Not bad, bullying an unarmed kid now?

118
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,520
Stop!

119
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,900
He got away too easily.

120
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,520
You'll be lost in this forest.

121
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,980
We should return to the camp now.

122
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,230
We must tell Zhang and the others.

123
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,800
Right.

124
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,010
Why did you come here alone?

125
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,400
I'm not alone.

126
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,800
I brought someone with me.

127
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,330
We followed the markings you left

128
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,490
and tracked you down.

129
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,520
Had we not come in time

130
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
you would have died here.

131
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,560
You left those markings?

132
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,080
Xiao Hua told me beforehand.

133
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,400
He told me to come here

134
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,730
and place the markings for you.

135
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Xiao Hua,

136
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
you still haven't told me

137
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
why this fellow over here

138
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,920
went to you in Changsha.

139
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,920
This guy here was hired to stop me
from helping you.

140
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,820
But you both came here nonetheless.

141
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,730
And now he is working for me.

142
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,830
He is here with me.

143
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,890
The mind of a businessman indeed.

144
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,270
I'm flattered.

145
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,170
It's been a long journey, sirs.

146
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,570
You must both be starving.

147
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,450
Come,

148
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,450
have some food.

149
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,160
Fried rice with bell pepper and meat.

150
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
This here has no bell pepper in it.

151
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,030
Thoughtful, right?

152
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,360
I have a heart of gold. So the pay...

153
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,750
I'm charging extras.

154
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,870
Mr Black.

155
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,200
You...

156
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,440
You can tell Master Hua'er to relax.

157
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,280
I'll make sure that Miss Huo is sent out.

158
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,040
I am on your and Master Hua'er's side.

159
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,210
You can count on me,

160
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,530
don't worry about it.

161
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,710
Sure, Mr Black.

162
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,500
Carry on.

163
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,910
Sister Xiu Xiu.

164
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,920
Who are you calling "sister"?

165
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,030
I am not your sister.

166
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,650
Madam, please don't be mad.

167
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,540
Xiao Hua is unbelievable.

168
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,040
He always have the fun stuff to himself.

169
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,170
He never brings me with him.

170
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,460
He always sends me back to Beijing
to check on minor stuffs.

171
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,880
It's not fun staying there.

172
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,190
Well,

173
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,300
he does it for your own good.

174
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,970
He cares about you.

175
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,210
He always protected you

176
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
so you won't run into
danger at the mountainside.

177
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,790
He even ordered me

178
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,160
to escort you safely to the airport.

179
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,240
See?

180
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,920
It isn't good to make him upset.

181
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,940
Have some milk tea and calm down.

182
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,050
I'll send you to the airport.

183
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,000
Madam.

184
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,690
Your analysis was right.

185
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,610
The members of the expedition

186
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,120
were all killed by Panma.

187
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,030
Then another team

188
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,400
replaced the original expedition.

189
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,930
Poor Panma.

190
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,520
He can run all he wants,

191
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,600
but I doubt Sloped-shoulder
would let him go so easily.

192
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,950
Panma has gone berserk.

193
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,660
Once we find him,

194
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,440
we must bring him in.

195
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,570
But I did promise him

196
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,530
I would take care of his son and grandson.

197
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,650
I can't break my promise.

198
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,960
This is the best we can do for him.

199
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,470
Master Xiao San.

200
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
According to what you said,

201
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
if we walk north of the remains,

202
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,030
the lake should be right up ahead.

203
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,200
Yes.

204
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,210
After we go over this hill,

205
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,440
we'll be there.

206
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,200
I'll take point.

207
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,310
Let me scout ahead.

208
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,960
There's a tourism project here.

209
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,110
Why would anyone want a project here?

210
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,820
You must be kidding me.

211
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,020
Why would there be...

212
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,640
a tourist attraction.

213
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,720
Wu Xie.

214
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,770
Why would someone develop
a tourism project here?

215
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,600
What happened while I was away?

216
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,800
Judging by the scale of it,

217
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,820
I think it's Ah Ning's boss,

218
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,190
Cox Hendry's men.

219
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,440
Because of a Chinese friend,

220
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,970
Cox Hendry has been

221
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,780
funding archaeological expeditions.

222
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,570
He funded many local
archaeological projects.

223
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,620
We'll go around it.

224
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,440
We'll check on Zhang's camp.

225
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,470
Found anything?

226
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,740
We searched the whole place
and found nothing.

227
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,640
There is no way they disappeared
into thin air.

228
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,520
It could be their doing.

229
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,330
Ah Ning's boss is Cox Hendry.

230
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,880
I'm sure you've heard of it.

231
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,300
This old man

232
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,670
is not one to mess with.

233
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,840
I found this inside the tent.

234
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,860
In any case,

235
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,920
they got Zhang and Fatty.

236
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,480
I need to take a look.

237
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,520
Are here to meet my boss?

238
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,970
It's you.

239
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,080
My boss wishes to have
a word with you as well.

240
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,700
<i>Panasonic</i>

241
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,920
This is all we know.

242
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,680
You've been monitoring us.

243
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,650
If I hadn't,

244
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,380
you wouldn't be watching this footage.

245
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,870
They never returned after that.

246
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,330
We also want to know

247
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,630
where they are.

248
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,440
How do I know

249
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,990
you're not keeping secrets from us?

250
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,870
If you don't trust me,

251
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,110
I'll stay and go through
the footage with you.

252
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,650
Wu Xie.

253
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,190
You told me

254
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,560
there was a siphon passage
under the lake.

255
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,190
Which means there is a way

256
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,400
to another exit point.

257
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,119
The current must have carried them there.

258
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,150
Master Hua'er is right.

259
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,190
The two of them

260
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,839
might be on the mountain.

261
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,260
A ground search might locate them.

262
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,069
If they aren't on the mountain?

263
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,700
If they aren't on the mountain,

264
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,000
they would likely be under the lake.

265
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,540
That location...

266
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,420
We're searching for it as well.

267
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,600
You may not know me.

268
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,440
But I know your elders very well.

269
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,080
I am Cox Hendry.

270
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,670
I invited you to discuss a partnership.

271
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
What do you want?

272
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,930
I've been to this lake before.

273
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,780
You can't dive into the lake without
proper equipment.

274
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,730
Master Xiao San.

275
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,950
Your equipment aren't good enough.

276
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,940
If you want to dive into the lake,

277
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,440
I can provide all the equipment you need.

278
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,320
Since you have everything,

279
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,680
why would you need us?

280
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,590
Did you come all the way here to do

281
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,860
charity work?

282
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,680
Partnership is all about honesty.

283
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,590
You want to explore the lake,

284
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,610
but I have the same intention.

285
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,100
Not to mention

286
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,530
our interest aligns.

287
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,220
You know what's down there.

288
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,950
I can understand if you refuse to share

289
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,950
information with me.

290
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,240
I was just like you when I was young.

291
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,790
But now,

292
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,140
I realized I must trust my own partners.

293
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,590
Working with you

294
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,110
means I will tell you all I know.

295
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,840
Under the lake

296
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,420
lies Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

297
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,640
Zhang family's Old Pavilion?

298
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,870
How do you know?

299
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,880
It doesn't matter how I found out.

300
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,440
But it seems like

301
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,220
not all of you know about this.

302
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,140
Wu Xie.

303
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,640
We only found out after we
parted ways in Changsha.

304
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,100
I didn't know for sure.

305
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,620
I told you about the Old Pavilion.

306
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,240
Now I want you to know

307
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,720
that what I'm searching for

308
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,960
is the same thing you're looking for.

309
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,940
If I were at his age,

310
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,570
there is only one thing

311
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,240
that can interest me.

312
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,650
Indeed.

313
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,430
Nothing is more attractive
than immortality.

314
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,220
One last question.

315
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,610
Do you even know

316
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,010
Ah Ning is already dead?

317
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,300
I know.

318
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,610
I feel sorry for her passing.

319
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,900
She led my investigation team.

320
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,490
I've lost many talented souls like her.

321
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,070
Do you even care

322
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,000
if they would be killed?

323
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,830
If I could solve this mystery

324
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,030
while I am still alive,

325
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,900
they could all be brought back to life.

326
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,600
Xiao Hua.

327
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,270
Just trust me on this.

328
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,160
We can't trust Cox Hendry.

329
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,680
But he said only I could go in there.

330
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,050
This is likely to be true.

331
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,910
You have so many experts with you

332
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,630
and you have the necessary information.

333
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,960
Why would you need us?

334
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,360
I don't see any reason

335
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,740
why you need us for the job.

336
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,560
I need more than experts.

337
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,110
My men went into the lake before.

338
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,840
Based on what they sent back,

339
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
they should have

340
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,590
seen the sunken pavilion down there.

341
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,990
But so far,

342
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,660
they've found nothing.

343
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,950
You mean

344
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,920
Zhang and the others might have seen
the old pavilion.

345
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,360
Could they be...

346
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,360
It's hard to say.

347
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,180
They could still be alive.

348
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,920
They might have entered the pavilion.

349
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,550
But from what I know,

350
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,880
not everyone can enter the building.

351
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,710
My men can't enter it.

352
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,150
I'm not sure about Fatty Wang.

353
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,950
But the Zhang boy should be able to enter.

354
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,350
How can you know for sure?

355
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,010
Even if he could,

356
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,450
what about us?

357
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,090
You can't even go down there,

358
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,340
not to mention us.

359
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,790
You...

360
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,060
I don't know about the other two,

361
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,240
but I think you can.

362
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,510
Even if you're right,

363
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,770
and I managed to acquire

364
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,820
the item from Zhang family's
Old Pavilion,

365
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,420
aren't you worried I would
break our agreement

366
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
and take it as my own?

367
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,080
Immortality is a secret.

368
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,010
All secrets can be shared.

369
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,530
You can share it with me

370
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:22,170
without causing any harm to yourself.

371
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,120
I've been searching for this secret

372
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,440
far longer than you did.

373
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
I know much more than you do.

374
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,390
The secret inside
Zhang family's old pavilion

375
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,150
might only be one of the clues

376
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,990
to the answer we seek.

377
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,380
We need more information.

378
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,110
You still need me.

379
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,480
It's too risky to go down there alone.

380
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,800
I know you don't trust him.

381
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,360
Neither do I.

382
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,450
But because of that very reason

383
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,110
we need men here to keep an eye on him.

384
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,470
Otherwise we'll be doomed

385
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,610
if all of us run into danger down there.

386
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,880
At least one of us needs to live.

387
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,850
Xiao Hua.

388
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,150
Listen to Wu Xie.

389
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,800
Cox Hendry has his reason

390
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,960
to ask him to go alone.

391
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,480
But whatever concern we have,

392
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,800
he has one motive,

393
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,870
that is to uncover the secret
of Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

394
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,650
So

395
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,200
he needs Wu Xie to come back alive.

396
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Besides,

397
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,960
You have the Wu family and
the Mystic Nine to back you up.

398
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,250
Harming Wu Xie won't bring him any good.

399
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,400
Right?

400
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,680
Here.

401
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,360
Pay attention to your oxygen level.

402
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,870
Don't worry.

403
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,010
I'll leave markings for you down there.

404
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,890
If necessary,

405
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,680
the markings will lead you to me.

406
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,010
Search for Zhang and Fatty first.

407
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,680
They might have left tracks for you.

408
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,940
You were paid for the job.

409
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,200
So keep him safe.

410
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,650
See you.

411
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,170
Wu Xie, can you hear me?

412
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,000
Yes.

413
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,800
Stay in contact.

414
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,800
Don't worry.

415
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,400
I'll bring them back safely.

416
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,520
<i>Scanner</i>

417
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,970
This lake is at least 30 metres deep.

418
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,010
As my boss said,

419
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,280
our men had to go down to 60 metres

420
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,440
before finding anything.

421
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,890
He's at 50 metres.

422
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,940
He's at 60 metres.

423
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,590
Wu Xie?

424
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,600
Wu Xie?

425
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,550
I can't see anything.

426
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,050
I can't see an inch ahead of me.

427
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,650
There's...

428
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,920
Hold on.

429
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,730
There are some...

430
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Buildings?

431
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,520
I can see it.

432
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,160
It's the Yao Village.

433
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,130
I'm headed towards the Yao Village.

434
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,110
Hold on.

435
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,960
There is a house in the village

436
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,120
that's different from the others.

437
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,120
It looks like Han design.

438
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:43,690
I'm headed towards it.

439
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,730
Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

440
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,840
<i>Head of Zhang family</i>

441
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,200
I can see it.

442
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,960
"Head of Zhang family."

443
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,920
Head of Zhang family?

444
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,560
I am going inside.

445
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,760
He should be there by now.

446
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,860
There is no furniture,

447
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,150
no decorations.

448
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,170
The house is empty.

449
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,060
I can hear a bell ringing.

450
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,400
A bell ring?

451
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,650
That's not possible under water.

452
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,420
We Xie has no experience in deep diving.

453
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,530
It could be hallucination
caused by water pressure.

454
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,600
How is this possible?

455
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,240
Is this a dream or something?

456
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,120
Xiao Hua!

457
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,040
Shades!

458
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,200
Can you hear me?

459
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,480
You won't believe what just happened.

460
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,170
The water behind me is upright.

461
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,350
It's a wall of water!

462
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,720
Xiao Hua.

463
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,000
Xiao Hua?

464
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,510
Shades?

465
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,800
Can you hear me?

466
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,360
Wu Xie?

467
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,390
Wu Xie, can you hear me? Say something!

468
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,860
There is oxygen in here.

469
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,500
It's safe.

470
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,390
I am moving forward.

471
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,520
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

472
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,330
Wu Xie!

473
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,550
Wu Xie!

474
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,480
Wu Xie!

475
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,240
<i>S-sa-e-ge</i>

476
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,510
I see Zhang's marking.

477
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,330
They must be inside.

478
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,000
Xiao Hua, Shades,

479
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,560
I'm going in.

480
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,750
Wait for me up there.

481
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,900
I'm bringing them home.

482
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:35,650
Boss.

483
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,730
It's as the same as before.

484
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,340
Xiao Hua, Shades.

485
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,800
I don't know if you can hear me,

486
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,100
but this place is strange.

487
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,830
It's like a different dimension.

488
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,920
There's not a drop of water in here.

489
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,080
The murals...

490
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,710
It's the same Birdman totem we saw

491
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,560
at Palace of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

492
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,250
But there's no air flow in here.

493
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:35,510
I can't tell the age of these murals

494
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,240
by the weathering condition.

495
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,870
But even the murals

496
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,610
don't show much information.

497
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,990
I noticed something.

498
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,570
The Birdmen from other locations

499
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,000
were looking straight ahead,

500
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,990
but the seven Birdmen on this door

501
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,750
has a different gaze from the others.

502
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,010
From right to the left,

503
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,720
they each gazes towards

504
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,130
the left,

505
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,370
right,

506
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,840
left,

507
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,670
left,

508
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,850
left,

509
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,070
right,

510
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,320
and left.

511
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,440
I guess

512
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,240
this is the hint to opening the door.

513
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,320
Xiao Hua, Shades.

514
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,480
I'm taking a leap of faith.

515
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,560
Wu Xie.

516
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,120
Wu Xie!

517
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,090
If my guess is right,

518
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,840
I can move forward

519
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,260
and regroup with them.

520
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,420
But if I get it wrong...

521
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:19,850
His position

522
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,040
hasn't changed since
he arrived at 70 metres.

523
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,489
No signal

524
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,090
from his comms either.

525
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:29,170
Unless something happened to him,

526
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,280
otherwise his position
can't be just staying still.

527
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,820
Wu Xie, I knew you would find us.

528
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,219
But I must say you disappoint me.

529
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:53,670
-Fatty!
-What took you so long?

530
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,600
Zhang.

531
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,020
Well?

532
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,300
It must feel like ages ago since
we last met.

533
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,590
Did you miss us?

534
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,600
I missed you so badly!

535
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,240
Back to business.

536
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,000
You didn't have the proper equipment.

537
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,750
How did you get to this depth?

538
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,990
The story is exciting and exhilarating!

539
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,420
The two of us

540
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,000
got sucked into this place.

541
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,480
Sucked into this place?

542
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,300
It's over 70 metres deep.

543
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,700
How did you get sucked in?

544
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,110
And

545
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,230
you've been here for some time.

546
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,440
Do you know what's going on
with this building?

547
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,710
Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

548
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,840
They are...

549
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,840
Boss, Wu Xie's partners insist on
going down for him.

550
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,230
We'll just wait.

551
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,600
We've lost all comms with Wu Xie

552
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,280
and can't pinpoint his location.

553
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,870
If we don't go down now

554
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,490
I'm afraid...

555
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,770
The suit is bound to need oxygen.

556
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,480
If we still get nothing,

557
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,720
send someone for him.

558
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,780
Got it.

559
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,640
This...

560
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,520
-Is this...
-Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

561
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,010
After the siphon passage sucked us in,

562
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,810
we arrived in the room
behind the water wall.

563
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,110
Zhang checked the exteriors.

564
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:25,690
The Yao Village was built

565
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,540
to protect the pavilion.

566
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,840
And then

567
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,270
a flood sunk it,

568
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,430
forming the lake on Yang Jiao Mountain.

569
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,050
Which means

570
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,320
the siphon beneath the lake

571
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,320
was the village's drainage system.

572
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,560
Maybe a heavy rain

573
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,840
caused a large scale landslide

574
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,430
-Yes.
-and blocked the exit.

575
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,600
So the village was submerged.

576
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,460
Have you entered the pavilion?

577
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,750
What's inside?

578
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,150
We were about to go in there,

579
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,310
but you arrived.

580
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,600
Let's give it a try.

581
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,800
We don't know how deep the water goes.

582
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,520
Don't bother.

583
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,080
Watch.

584
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,410
You can stand on the water?

585
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,370
You can stand on the whole surface.

586
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,040
The three of us

587
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,440
can walk there, no problem.

588
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,200
It feels like water.

589
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,820
Maybe some sort of liquid.

590
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,840
But even liquid can't withstand
the weight and pressure.

591
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,080
If it's dilatant fluid,

592
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,020
it'll at least

593
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,000
be some kind of paste.

594
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,990
This defies the laws of physics!

595
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,410
Gravity

596
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,110
doesn't work here.

597
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,460
Don't be paranoid.

598
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,950
Over the days

599
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,520
I came to realize

600
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,320
the mystery under this lake

601
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,880
can never be explained.

602
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,710
The only thing we can explain

603
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,740
is that laws of physic out there

604
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,000
won't work in here.

605
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,160
Think about it.

606
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,560
We were sucked into here by the siphon.

607
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,970
And the wall of water.

608
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,280
How are they related to gravity?

609
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,780
When I came from the surface,

610
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,020
I thought the water wall
was an anti-gravity field.

611
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,950
But the same phenomenon happens here too.

612
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,670
If

613
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,130
these are all protective devices set
by the Zhang family,

614
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
I can be certain

615
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,430
there must be some
important secret inside.

616
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,550
Whatever it is,

617
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,670
we'll know

618
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,600
after we go in there.

619
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,810
Let's go down there.

620
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,730
Look.

621
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,020
I thought we would be

622
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,600
walking on the walls in here.

623
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,340
But everything is normal.

624
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,370
Gravity doesn't work here.

625
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,430
We're being affected by the gravity.

626
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,640
There's dual-linearized gravity here?

627
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:13,100
When we came from the surface,

628
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,500
gravity pulls towards one direction.

629
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,560
But the moment we entered,

630
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,320
the gravitational field changed.

631
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,890
Or you could say

632
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,380
gravity changed right after

633
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,560
we walked through the water wall.

634
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,700
I'm glad Newton didn't read his book
in this house.

635
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,860
Otherwise he would
have to wait an eternity

636
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:33,470
for the apple to drop on him.

637
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,690
What's wrong?

638
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,830
Water droplet.

639
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,650
This is strange.

640
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,020
Let's check over there.

641
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,680
The Zhang family should improve
the drainage system.

642
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,000
You have a leak.

643
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,120
I think it's sea water.

644
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,590
No, it's the witch!

645
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,600
Run!

646
00:41:56,704 --> 00:42:06,704
