1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,789
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,770
<i>Episode 14</i>

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,000
Isn't this what our forebearers

5
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,440
have been searching for?

6
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,400
It is.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But first, I must take care of
some family affairs.

8
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,400
Very well.

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,760
We'll be off, then.

10
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,400
Mop.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,880
You guys go over there.

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,479
Wu Xie.

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,040
Wait up.

14
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,160
I can't stand idly by.

15
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,600
I'll take a look.

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
<i>Do you still</i>

17
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,600
<i>cover your room with black curtains?</i>

18
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:44,880
<i>You knew?</i>

19
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,640
<i>I haven't lost my touch, have I?</i>

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
<i>Not too shabby,</i>

21
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,720
<i>but not too impressive, either.</i>

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,000
<i>This is for your own good.</i>

23
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,720
<i>Xie Yu Chen, protect the Xie family.</i>

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,640
<i>I have only</i>

25
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,080
<i>one advice.</i>

26
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,200
<i>Protect the Xie family.</i>

27
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,120
Let him rest.

28
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,200
Before we came to Tamutuo,

29
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
the last thing you told me

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,440
was to protect the Xie family.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Now, you're saying the same thing.

32
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,520
I was puzzled.

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,920
You're Wu Xie's third uncle.

34
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,600
Why didn't you ask him to protect

35
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,480
the Wu family instead?

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,440
When I heard Xie Lian Huan had died,

37
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,079
I was only six.

38
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,520
Before I knew it, 19 years had passed.

39
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
19 years!

40
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,600
I thought

41
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,040
since Master Hua'er's time,

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,079
the Xie family always had a fallback.

43
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,200
Yet Xie Lian Huan died without a trace.

44
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,000
I just want to know,

45
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,920
if you faked your death,

46
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,280
then who's your successor?

47
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,480
You're my successor.

48
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
So, you are Xie Lian Huan.

49
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,720
Wu Xie,

50
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,760
are you sure we can find
the entrance here?

51
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,159
Do you remember the two reservoirs?

52
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
They should be either filled

53
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,880
or damp with mould.

54
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,120
But it's dry as a bone here.

55
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,880
So this is no reservoir,

56
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,760
but one of the Queen Mother's tricks.

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Let's keep searching, then.

58
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,560
Let's go.

59
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
If Xie Lian Huan isn't dead,

60
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,280
the one who died at the Shipwreck Tomb

61
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,800
must be Wu San Xing?

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
He isn't dead, either.

63
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,920
Sorrow

64
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,700
and joy

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,620
are one.

66
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,600
If you're not dead,

67
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,820
and neither are Wu San Xing

68
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,100
and Xie Lian Huan,

69
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,560
that's joy.

70
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,960
Whence comes the sorrow?

71
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,680
If Xie Lian Huan came back
as Wu San Xing

72
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,320
in order to watch over me
and the Xie family,

73
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,520
then what's his deal?

74
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,200
Why did he go to the Wu family?

75
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,800
You have to ask him that yourself.

76
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,840
Fine.

77
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,120
If none of you wants to talk,

78
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,480
I'll talk.

79
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,100
Xie Lian Huan faked his own death

80
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,260
and returned as Wu San Xing

81
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,100
while the real Wu San Xing is in hiding

82
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,120
because you guys

83
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,440
needed a ghost

84
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,200
to do something the living could not.

85
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,159
It's to hide from "It".

86
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,800
But why Wu San Xing?

87
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,200
Unless there's something else

88
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,480
equally important.

89
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Something that can only be
accomplished with Wu San Xing's identity.

90
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,020
Isn't that right?

91
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,740
Go on.

92
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,400
All these years, he never got married

93
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,840
or expanded his business.

94
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,040
Instead, he went on these adventures.

95
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,840
And every time, Wu Xie tagged along.

96
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,160
The two travelled to the Seven Star Palace
of the Emperor of Lu,

97
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,440
the Paracel Islands,

98
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,100
the Qin Mountains,

99
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,120
Cloud Top Palace,

100
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,840
and finally the Bronze Gate.

101
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
Of the present generation
of the Mystic Nine,

102
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,760
only Wu Xie had such exposure.

103
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,640
So Wu San Xing's purpose

104
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,600
was to groom Wu Xie.

105
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,880
No wonder, despite his apparent refusal,

106
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,520
Wu Xie still came along.

107
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,000
Because this expedition was meant for him.

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,600
He is the Mystic Nine's successor.

109
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,680
There's wind.

110
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Let me ask you,

111
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,220
you gave Ah Ning a tape,

112
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
then him,

113
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,960
and Wu Xie.

114
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,640
You knew the Mystic Nine had planned
to groom Wu Xie.

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,960
I didn't give Wu Xie anything.

116
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,200
The first tape

117
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,840
was given to him.

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,080
The second tape went to Zhang Qi Ling.

119
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,680
But little did I know

120
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,400
Zhang Qi Ling's tape would fall
into Ah Ning's hands.

121
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,340
Must be his doing.

122
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,659
What about the third tape?

123
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,280
Cox Hendry.

124
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,120
Ah Ning's boss?

125
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,669
Weren't you afraid he might
steal your secret?

126
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,000
Cox Hendry

127
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,840
was never a threat to the Mystic Nine.

128
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,440
Besides, the more people looking,
the better.

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Cox Hendry and us shared the same goal.

130
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,280
With his help,

131
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,360
our chances are better.

132
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,880
Unfortunately,

133
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,480
the tape fell into Wu Xie's hands.

134
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,560
<i>Express Parcel,
For: Wu Xie, From: Zhang Qi Ling</i>

135
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,320
And the sender was Zhang Qi Ling.

136
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,880
"It" must have intervened.

137
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
That wasn't the first time, either.

138
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,220
Who do you mean

139
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
by "It"?

140
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,120
"It" is not a single person.

141
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,680
"It" is a force.

142
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,360
An iron ring.

143
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,580
Must be a stone door.

144
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
Your hands are bleeding. Take a rest.

145
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm fine!

146
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,960
Zhang, he's being stubborn again.

147
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,220
Mop!

148
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,480
Mop!

149
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Mop!

150
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,320
-Come on.
-Let's go.

151
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,440
Because of "It",

152
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,520
you guys made the tapes
in the sanatorium

153
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,160
as an insurance policy.

154
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,940
That's right.

155
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,000
In order to survive

156
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,280
<i>Wednesday, the ninth, sunny,
We plan to find Tamutuo...</i>

157
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
and to leave behind clues.

158
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
"It" gave the tape to Wu Xie,

159
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,680
so that he would come here.

160
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,640
Looks like Wu Xie isn't just
the Mystic Nine's chosen one,

161
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,560
but "It's" as well.

162
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,360
Perhaps only Wu Xie

163
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,320
can uncover the secret

164
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
of the Mystic Nine.

165
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,240
The real successor.

166
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,000
All of you have been living so cautiously.

167
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,280
I was wondering

168
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,920
what you guys saw under the waters
of the Paracel islands.

169
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,140
Easy.

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,120
Look, an underground chamber.

171
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,660
Fatty,

172
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
the Queen Mother's loot must be inside.

173
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
Don't act smart or you'll

174
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,320
get us into trouble.

175
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,600
If anything's inside,

176
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,720
it'd be booby traps.

177
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,680
Got it?

178
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
Besides, any loot we find

179
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,640
must be reported to the authorities.

180
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm going in.

181
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,400
Zhang.

182
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,320
Tug the rope if you need help.

183
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,080
You were put to sleep?

184
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Then what?

185
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,480
After we woke up,

186
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,600
we spent a few years
at the sanatorium.

187
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,120
We studied the data we'd collected

188
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
from the Paracel Islands,

189
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,240
and found a clue that led
to Mount Changbai.

190
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,640
But it was then

191
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,160
that we discovered we could not age.

192
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,880
Then, you guys went to Cloud Top Palace?

193
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,760
There, we saw

194
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,160
the Ultimate.

195
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,640
The Ultimate?

196
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,680
What is the Ultimate?

197
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,160
The Ultimate is

198
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
the end of all of existence.

199
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,280
If you want to know about it,

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,280
you'll have to see it yourself.

201
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,920
Then what's hidden inside
the Queen Mother's Palace?

202
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,780
I don't know.

203
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,840
But I do know that eternal youth

204
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,960
has its side effects.

205
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,400
And the cure can be found here.

206
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
What side effects?

207
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,640
We'll all go the way of Huo Ling.

208
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,680
There is no time.

209
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
Huo Ling?

210
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,680
Where is she right now?

211
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,800
Golmud Sanatorium.

212
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,060
But her transformation has begun.

213
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,240
She can hardly be considered
a human being now.

214
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,480
Zhang gave the signal.

215
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,500
Let's go.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,640
Mop, look after Master San with the rest.

217
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,040
Come on.

218
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,400
They're all gone, boss.

219
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,680
What about us?

220
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Should we find Master San?

221
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,320
With Master Hua'er around,

222
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,760
Master San will be fine.

223
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,960
The same can't be said for us.

224
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,520
I say we go down.

225
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,120
Worst case, we get scolded.

226
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,600
As expected of our boss.

227
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Your brilliant mind

228
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,760
always has a plan.

229
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,200
You.

230
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,920
Look after Master San.

231
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,640
It's the least I can do for him.

232
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,720
Me?

233
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,100
You.

234
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,320
Go down.

235
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,640
During her life,

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,120
Huo Ling didn't want her family
to know about her predicament.

237
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
I hope you can keep it a secret.

238
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
Master Hua'er,

239
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,200
we found the stone door.

240
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,320
They've gone down

241
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,160
and asked me to look after you.

242
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,260
Alright.

243
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,600
The goal right up ahead.

244
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,880
Aren't you going?

245
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,320
Someone should post here.

246
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,600
You guys scout ahead.

247
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
I'll catch up later.

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,360
I'll leave Lian Huan to you, then.

249
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,320
As for "It",

250
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,520
you youngsters are our only hope.

251
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,880
Will we see each other again

252
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,440
in this lifetime?

253
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,400
Lian Huan,

254
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,920
take care.

255
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,260
Master Xiao San!

256
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,480
Master Xiao San!

257
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,160
What are you doing here?

258
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,880
We told you to watch over Master San.

259
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,440
Don't worry, Fatty.

260
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,040
I've asked my men to do that.

261
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,720
Besides, there's Master Hua'er.

262
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,600
You can count on him.

263
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,860
Let's go.

264
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
You heard Master Xiao San.

265
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,280
Let's all follow him.

266
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,700
Come.

267
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,960
-Come.
-Where did your third uncle

268
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,760
find those minions?

269
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,760
He's not my third uncle.

270
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,800
There's no need to hide. Come out.

271
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,080
How could Chen Wen Ji not know

272
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,960
you're hiding here?

273
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,560
If she knows it's me,

274
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,680
it'll be alright.

275
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,240
This smell sure is making me drowsy.

276
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,520
It's Chen Wen Jin's odour,

277
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,440
not Tibetan incense.

278
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:14,670
Of course not.

279
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,589
It's the odour of her bones.

280
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,680
She has no time left.

281
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,960
She just said she'll

282
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,349
go the way of Huo Ling.

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,630
Looks like Chen Wen Jin's a goner.

284
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,920
Which is why she said,

285
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,320
"sorrow and joy are one."

286
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,940
Yes.

287
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,560
Sorrow

288
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,120
and joy

289
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,960
are

290
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,840
one.

291
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,200
Here.

292
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,840
So, you do care about him.

293
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,680
He's a Xie, too.

294
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,360
I heard

295
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,760
Xie Lian Huan adopted you
when you were little.

296
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,320
It'd make sense

297
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,160
for you to call him "Dad."

298
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,920
That was the arrangement,

299
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,960
but I've never called him that.

300
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,360
After all, I already have a dad.

301
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,600
Besides, Xie Lian Huan never came back

302
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,720
from the Paracel Islands.

303
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,000
A few years later,

304
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,640
my dad and my uncles

305
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,840
passed away one by one.

306
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,600
The women all left.

307
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,200
So,

308
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,560
you became the youngest leader
of the Mystic Nine?

309
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,000
So what if I'm the leader?

310
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,160
Mystic Nine's missions,

311
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,660
Mystic Nine's secrets,

312
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,120
I know nothing about them.

313
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,260
Did you forget?

314
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,000
He just said it.

315
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,520
You're the successor.

316
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,280
Me? A successor?

317
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,600
I plainly asked him,

318
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,520
and he plainly knew the answers,

319
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,760
but he didn't say a word.

320
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,120
All he said was,
"Protect the Xie family."

321
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,280
"Protect the Xie family."

322
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,440
I don't even know who the enemy is.

323
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,200
How am I supposed to protect them?

324
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,800
Cheer up, young man.

325
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,520
Have some food.

326
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,040
I don't want to.

327
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
Come on, it's free.

328
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,680
I'm not eating.

329
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:52,960
Tell you what,

330
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
if you finish it,

331
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,520
I'll let you in on a fun fact.

332
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,000
I heard of a pill

333
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,720
that contains Shibie.

334
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,000
It's said to extend one's lifespan

335
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,720
and grant youth.

336
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,120
It's called Shibie Pills.

337
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,360
I've seen it.

338
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,820
You have?

339
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,560
It's a rare pill.

340
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,720
How could you have seen it?

341
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,480
I found a Yellow Silk
bound book

342
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,440
among Xie Lian Huan's belongings.

343
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,040
The book spoke of several locations.

344
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,200
I went to one of them,

345
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,360
which almost cost me my life.

346
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,920
There, Shibie Pills were kept.

347
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,840
So you found the key to immortality?

348
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,680
Did you take them?

349
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Nope.

350
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Good call.

351
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,400
That stuff

352
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,080
will kill you.

353
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,440
Both legend and history have it

354
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,920
that the Heavenly Queen Mother

355
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,760
knew the secrets of immortality.

356
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,240
Do you remember the wall paintings
in the fake palace?

357
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,040
It depicted people begging her for pills.

358
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,600
I wonder if those were Shibie Pills,

359
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
or

360
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,360
if they have anything to do
with Chen Wen Jin.

361
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,840
Besides the Shibie Pills,

362
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,320
the silk book pointed to other locations.

363
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,360
Tamutuo was one of them.

364
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
Chen Wen Jin

365
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,000
and him

366
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
both reached here.

367
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,240
Then what did Chen Wen Jin mean
by "the Ultimate?"

368
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,040
I have no idea.

369
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,840
Perhaps we'll find out
at the Queen Mother's Palace.

370
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,120
Look, you guys.

371
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,920
These jade servants are works of art
created by the people of old.

372
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,800
They are priceless relics
of the Chinese culture.

373
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
There are so many of them.

374
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,920
Sirs, what are "jade servants?"

375
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,360
-Jade servants...
-They are jade statues crafted

376
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,280
in the likeness of servants.

377
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,920
Got it?

378
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,920
Not bad for a queen mother.

379
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,560
First, the Birdman in Cloud Top Palace.

380
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,440
Now, the jade servants
in Seven Star Palace.

381
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
She was pretty well-connected.

382
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
But did she build such a big palace

383
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,040
just to keep her playthings?

384
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,120
This is the Queen Mother's inner sanctum.

385
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,600
Xiao Hua and Shades
are taking care of him.

386
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,520
Wu Xie,

387
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,880
what if the legends are true?

388
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,680
What if the Queen Mother really
did have the pill of immortality,

389
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,720
and people came to offer her gifts

390
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,960
in hopes of attaining immortality?

391
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,520
Zhang said

392
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,120
the jade servants aren't what they seem.

393
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,240
It's dry.

394
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
Besides, what's the harm in touching it?

395
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,240
Look closely.

396
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,400
These jade servants

397
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,760
don't look too friendly.

398
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,040
You're right.

399
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,400
They do look kind of menacing.

400
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,640
After I took the reins,

401
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,960
I realised, for generations,

402
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,320
the Mystic Nine had been controlled
by a mysterious force.

403
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,120
What happened with the Mystic Nine?

404
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,320
What secrets is it hiding?

405
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,540
Perhaps

406
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,100
he knows.

407
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,940
I may be a kind man,

408
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,180
but I have a way with interrogations.

409
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,040
How about

410
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,000
I ask Master San?

411
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,640
He's not Master San.

412
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,160
His surname is Xie.

413
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,500
That's right.

414
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,840
Force of habit.

415
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,680
Then again, in all these years,

416
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,680
everybody had to go through
the Seven Star Palace,

417
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,040
Cloud Top Palace,

418
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,000
Qin Mountains, and the Paracel Islands,

419
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,600
before getting here.

420
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,640
Including Wu Xie.

421
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,480
Yet you did it all by yourself

422
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,680
with only an old Yellow Silk book.

423
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
You may be skilled,

424
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
but think about it.

425
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,560
He

426
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,840
must have helped you
to some degree.

427
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
Are you kidding me?

428
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,520
How did it lit up?

429
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,040
Zhang must've activated a mechanism

430
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,080
which kindled the flint
on the pillars.

431
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,560
The Floating Furnace.

432
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,080
The Queen's alchemy crucible.

433
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,760
By not touching the ground,

434
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,160
the furnace absorbs the full energy
of the Dragon Vein.

435
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,280
Boss.

436
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,280
Check that out.

437
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,920
It's beeswax.

438
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,160
Mop, don't touch it!

439
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,420
Relax.

440
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,860
-I'm not going to eat it.
-I said hands off.

441
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,180
-Put it down!
-You hear me?

442
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,160
The pills are arranged
in a specific order.

443
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,080
Run!

444
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,120
Oh no, we're trapped.

445
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,920
Something's wrong. Go and see.

446
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,680
Come here.

447
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,360
Stay with Master San.

448
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,360
We're going down.

449
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,260
Okay.

450
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,880
The celestial disk is a trap.

451
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,680
The pills are arranged according
to the star signs.

452
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,040
They set off the trap when they
took the pill.

453
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,600
You guys came to help?

454
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Some help you were!

455
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,820
We're going to die thanks to you!

456
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,240
Come at me, pals.

457
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,960
Let them have it!

458
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,840
Their Armour is too tough.

459
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,960
They won't budge.

460
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,320
Sneak attack! Steal their weapons.

461
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,200
Okay.

462
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,560
Are these jade servants sexist or what?

463
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,220
Why do they only attack men?

464
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,760
It's my smell.

465
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,680
They can tell gender by smell?

466
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,240
Those pricks.

467
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,360
I'll show them!

468
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,080
Why won't these dummies die?

469
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,140
Hurry.

470
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,160
Hide.

471
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,120
Come on.

472
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,200
Master Xiao San!

473
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,560
Master Xiao San, Fatty, I'm begging you!

474
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,480
Kill them! Crush them!

475
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
Team up if you have to.

476
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,200
Just do something!

477
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,560
Just hang in there. I have an idea.

478
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,440
I have an idea.

479
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,360
Who touched the celestial disk again?

480
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,960
Me, Master Xiao San.

481
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,360
I'm trying to save you guys by putting
back the pills.

482
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,440
But I think I may have messed up.

483
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,280
What's your problem?

484
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
Do you want us dead?

485
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,300
Zhang!

486
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,980
The jade servants won't die.

487
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,320
That way.

488
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,760
-Snakes.
-There are snakes in the jade servants.

489
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,800
Crack the helmet open and kill the snake.

490
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,620
Snakes again?

491
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,900
Give it a push.

492
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,000
One, two, three.

493
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,560
It won't budge.

494
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,240
We must find another way in.

495
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,360
When the ancient craftsmen constructed
these booby-trapped rooms,

496
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
they'd always include an escape tunnel.

497
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,520
Let's find it.

498
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,920
Aunt, watch out!

499
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,560
This is ridiculous.

500
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,360
The jade servants only attack men
and not women.

501
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,960
The scent on my body is protecting me.

502
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,360
The Black-Haired Snakes controlling
the jade servants

503
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,240
could smell

504
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,880
the pill I've taken.

505
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,040
We're outnumbered.

506
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,240
We can't win.

507
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,600
Let's find a way out.

508
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,840
No need to.

509
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,960
I have pipe bombs.

510
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,480
We'll blast our way out.

511
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,520
You still have bombs?

512
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,160
I've been saving them.

513
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,360
Isn't this suicide?

514
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,960
But it'll be a grand suicide.

515
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,280
I only have four pipe bombs.

516
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,520
Move quickly.

517
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,760
Once the stone door's open,

518
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,760
you must run for it.

519
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
Wouldn't that destroy the place?

520
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,840
I'm targeting the door.

521
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,000
Pipe bombs aren't that powerful.

522
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,240
Cover me!

523
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,880
Come.

524
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,440
Taste the last of my bombs.

525
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,480
Did you hear that?

526
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,080
Are they trying to blow up the stone door?

527
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,280
Let's hope so.

528
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,280
To be safe, we'll find
an escape tunnel, too.

529
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,080
Here.

530
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,600
Let's get hacking.

531
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,080
Come on.

532
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,160
Come here, baby.

533
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,520
Get down!

534
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,360
Open sesame!

535
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,500
Run!

536
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,200
It didn't work.

537
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,080
It's a bronze gate.

538
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,280
It can't be blown up.

539
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,360
We're doomed.

540
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,980
Dodge!

541
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:34,940
Let's go.

542
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,160
Looks good.

543
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,920
Oxygen level is sufficient.

544
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
This place

545
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,040
is made of zircon just like
the previous one.

546
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,080
Compared to the blinding opulence
of the fake palace,

547
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
this is a little shabby.

548
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,640
These underground palaces
aren't that simple.

549
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,240
Look at the walls.

550
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,300
Look at the floor.

551
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,080
That subtle sheen.

552
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,640
They're made from the finest zircon.

553
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
It's been 3000 years,

554
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,420
yet the colours on the wall painting

555
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,660
have not faded one bit.

556
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,040
It was made using the best materials
and craftsmanship.

557
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,480
The effort is staggering.

558
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,600
She took the trouble of commissioning
three reservoirs

559
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,720
just to hide this underground chamber?

560
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,400
The level beneath this one

561
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,720
may very well be the
Queen Mother's actual palace.

562
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
Then we'll figure out

563
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,880
what this chamber is for

564
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,800
before working out its secret mechanisms.

565
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
What a big hole.

566
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,000
Zhang!

567
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,360
This dimension and shape.

568
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,720
Must be scalpel.

569
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,080
Don't ask me how I know.

570
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,260
Just don't.

571
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Alright.

572
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,320
I'll tell you.

573
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,760
This is a scalpel.

574
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,800
How do I know?

575
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
Because I studied

576
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,520
anatomy science in Germany
back in the day.

577
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,760
I even got a degree.

578
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,920
Master Hua'er.

579
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,040
This looks fresh.

580
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Was the Queen Mother making specimens?

581
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,880
Specimen preservation was invented
after the Southern Tang period.

582
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,800
These must be crystal cases.

583
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,080
Like the ones that encased
the thousand-year-old mummies

584
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,440
in the Han Tombs in Mawangdui, Changsha.

585
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,120
The recipe of the embalming fluid

586
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,480
is still a secret until this day.

587
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,840
Could the Queen Mother have cracked

588
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,880
the formula centuries ago?

589
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,100
Possibly.

590
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,000
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to help Zhang!

591
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,400
He drove the snakes away

592
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,000
to buy time for us to escape.

593
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,120
The snakes are no trouble

594
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,000
for Zhang Qi Ling.

595
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,440
The head of a human,

596
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
the body of a snake,

597
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
the tail of a fish.

598
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,840
What is this? Build-your-own monster?

599
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,520
The Queen had interesting tastes.

600
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,900
Dragon.

601
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,940
Bird.

602
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,460
Insect.

603
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,620
Snake.

604
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,200
They are all sentient animals.

605
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,240
In the sites of Neolithic culture,

606
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,160
archaeologists found jade carvings

607
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
of human-animal hybrids.

608
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,680
Just like this wall painting.

609
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,360
And according to Lie Zi and the Taiping
Imperial Encyclopedia,

610
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,960
Fu Xi and Nu Wa were half-snake
and half-human.

611
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,120
Some say they lived up to
hundreds of years,

612
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,600
some say thousands.

613
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,400
This is Fu Xi's secret to immortality?

614
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,960
Check this out.

615
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,680
Looks like the Queen Mother

616
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,960
was experimenting with Fu Xi's secret
of immortality.

617
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,320
So this is her biological laboratory?

618
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,540
Probably.

619
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,320
And it seems Tamutuo's climate
had inspired her

620
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,240
to rear snakes.

621
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,280
But she didn't seem

622
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,760
to have used that method
to extend her life.

623
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,680
Remember that wall painting
in the fake palace?

624
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,880
She was wearing Chinese clothes

625
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
and mingling with Emperor Wu
in her human form.

626
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,880
Zhang is so valiant.

627
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,840
If you didn't touch that disk,

628
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,800
this wouldn't happen.

629
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
I'm sorry, Master Xiao San.

630
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,800
I was just curious.

631
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,360
You useless piece of trash!

632
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,160
I... I'll scout ahead.

633
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,160
They're coming again!

634
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,280
Zhang, let's go!

635
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,080
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

636
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,280
-Come on.
-Hurry.

637
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,160
Come on.

638
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,840
Check this out.

639
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,320
I saw this symbol back at the passageway.

640
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,560
Could this be a mark left by Zhang?

641
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,740
Zhang.

642
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,620
Zhang!

643
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Think.

644
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,200
How did you get out?

645
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,580
Why did you leave this mark?

646
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:58,904
