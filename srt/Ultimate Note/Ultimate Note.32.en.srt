1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,910
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,690
<i>Episode 32</i>

4
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,080
This Cox Hendry sure has a lot of ideas.

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,920
"Xiao He chases after Han Xin."

6
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,690
Success or failure,

7
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,830
it is all tied to Xiao He.

8
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Xiao He?

9
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,200
Who does he think he is?

10
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,550
Granny,

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,360
he was the one who told Wu Xie

12
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,100
about your involvement
with the Yellow Silk.

13
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,510
But who knew?

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,940
Wu Xie still decided
to work with us in the end.

15
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,380
He must be caught between the rock
and a hard place,

16
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,500
hence the apology.

17
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,950
Cox Hendry

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,329
has the map of
the whole of Mount Yang Jiao.

19
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,079
It would be a great help to us.

20
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,980
But that doesn't mean

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
he's indispensable.

22
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,800
Return it.

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,020
This is the cliff Mrs Huo mentioned.

24
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,890
So many openings.

25
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,460
There are many more holes
covered by the trees.

26
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,170
The locals here call it

27
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,540
Fairy Worms.

28
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,120
I got someone to draw
this overview diagram.

29
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,770
Each opening has a code.

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,050
Yellow denotes that it has been visited.

31
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,260
As for the rest,

32
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,970
we'll have to check them out ourselves.

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,870
How are we supposed to search
the steep cliff?

34
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,160
Even with your men

35
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,730
having rock climbing equipment,

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,880
it would still be tough.

37
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,790
Rock climbing equipment, you say?

38
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,750
That's so old-school.

39
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,790
Someone has a better idea, right?

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,450
What is it?

41
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,120
Hey, Xiao Hua.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
Xiao Hua.

43
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,180
Are you going to climb
with your bare hands?

44
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:05,900
Master Hua,

45
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,110
why don't I do it?

46
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,070
If I reach the top,

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,790
you'll give me 50 goats.

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,720
Alright?

49
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,690
Fifty.

50
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,040
You?

51
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,050
You're too slow.

52
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,930
You're not worth that price.

53
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,820
I may be using my life as collateral,

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,040
but you shouldn't underestimate
an artisan.

55
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,980
You guys go up after
I've laid the safety rope.

56
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,280
Be careful.

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,159
Don't worry.

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,730
So you like flowers.

59
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,670
There are no eternal relationship,

60
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,210
no scenery that lasts forever.

61
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:22,890
Tell Cox Hendry

62
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,520
not to waste his time.

63
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,360
My boss made it clear.

64
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,570
This item is unrelated
to the cooperation.

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,880
It's merely a sincere gift from

66
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,240
an old friend.

67
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,920
Tell Cox Hendry

68
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,970
that I'll leave marks along the way

69
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,530
to lead your men inside.

70
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:17,980
Thank you.

71
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,300
Lying on ice to catch carp.

72
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,390
Cox Hendry

73
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,680
is trying to go for the heart.

74
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,200
"Lying on ice to catch carp."

75
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,220
The mother of Wang Xiang of Dongjin

76
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,480
wanted to eat fish in the deep of winter.

77
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,560
Hence, Wang Xiang took off his clothes
and laid on the ice

78
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,090
to thaw it in order to catch a carp.

79
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,000
It is the story from
the Twenty-four Filial Exemplars.

80
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Granny,

81
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,240
Cox Hendry is despicable.

82
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,600
He knew you were anxious about aunt

83
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,270
and yet he used this to upset you.

84
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,760
Why must you cooperate with him?

85
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,780
Think about it,

86
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,880
the gifts he's been sending us.

87
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,830
<i>Main peak of Mount Yang Jiao</i>

88
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,770
I knew it.

89
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,620
He keeps sending you such
an important, rare item.

90
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,180
He's planned this,

91
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,800
waiting for you to go to Banai.

92
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,320
The moment he told Wu Xie

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,500
about my involvement with the Yellow Silk,

94
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,870
he's known that I'd go.

95
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,560
It could even be

96
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,140
way before that.

97
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,430
Cunning old fox.

98
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,940
It was my fault for underestimating him.

99
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,030
He's even given us the map.

100
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,680
There's no excuse to not go now.

101
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,300
Pass the order.

102
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,350
We're leaving immediately.

103
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,470
That Hendry guy

104
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,350
gifted the old madam a lot of items.

105
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,080
No idea what they talked about.

106
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,260
We better stay on our toes.

107
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,320
Granny, everything is ready.

108
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,640
Let's go.

109
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,610
Not bad, not bad.

110
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,560
Listen.

111
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,880
Are you going to climb a second time?

112
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,810
You could've dropped the rope down.

113
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,120
Here.

114
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,150
Take this.

115
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,970
Search according to the markings.

116
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,950
Get it right.

117
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,530
The equipment are almost all here.

118
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,120
Once the men erect the nest,

119
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,130
we'll go up from the side.

120
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,050
It's easier to climb.

121
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,290
Nest?

122
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,510
You'll see soon enough.

123
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,240
This is the entrance?

124
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,100
The surrounding landmarks tally up.

125
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,200
So according to the map,
this is the crevice entryway.

126
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,870
There isn't even a path,

127
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,200
what more an entryway?

128
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,610
Zhang.

129
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,470
Why don't we search for it ourselves?

130
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,620
We can spend a few more days.

131
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,180
I'm sure we can find the entrance.

132
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,600
Cox Hendry said this before,

133
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,570
that he found another entrance.

134
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,700
<i>Mount Yang Jiao's secondary peak</i>
<i>Crevice opening</i>

135
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,010
Here.

136
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,680
Granny,

137
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,860
Hendry said unless absolutely necessary,

138
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,390
we must not enter from there.

139
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,960
What?

140
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
What does he mean?

141
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,970
None of the men who went in
through there survived.

142
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,070
This place

143
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,040
must contain other trickery
aside from Mi Luo Tuo.

144
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,090
Whatever it is,

145
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,210
we have enough alkali supplies.

146
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,330
Let's just check it out.

147
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,770
Am I right, Zhang?

148
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,370
There are countless holes.

149
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,530
Even with markings, it'd be hard

150
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,570
to locate the opening where
the Yellow Silk was found.

151
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,650
We'll check one by one.

152
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
As long as we have time,

153
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,410
we'll be able to find it.

154
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,270
We'll be searching
until the next decade then.

155
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,560
Did Mrs Huo

156
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,140
not leave any other clues behind?

157
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,050
She didn't personally come here
back then.

158
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,400
Besides, it's been many years.
Even if she left signs,

159
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,840
they would've been erased by now.

160
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,090
One thing is certain and that the hole
is found in the middle section.

161
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,500
We'll need to search thoroughly.

162
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,680
Scared?

163
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,850
I'm being cautious.

164
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,780
It's here.

165
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,490
You lead the team inside.

166
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,160
I'll wait here for news
of Mount Four Ladies.

167
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
Wait a minute.

168
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,120
Madam.

169
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,260
I don't think your arrangement

170
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,530
is very considerate.

171
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,060
Did you secretly made a deal
with Cox Hendry?

172
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,150
Zhang,

173
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,590
we must not agree to this arrangement.

174
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,200
The one who doesn't wish to see
anyone get hurt the most

175
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,380
is me.

176
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,640
We understand if you're not going inside.

177
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,940
After all, your age is for all to see.

178
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,530
But Xiu Xiu should come with us.

179
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,650
The team needs someone
from the Huo family

180
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,360
as stake.

181
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,630
Fine.

182
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,690
That's the way.

183
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,530
Guys, get your gear ready.

184
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,780
Those in charge of alkali,

185
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,560
put on your protective gear
and lead the way.

186
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,530
The rest should take the bare minimum.

187
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,270
We'll go down one by one.

188
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,480
Xiao Hua.

189
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,330
This is the nest you talked about?

190
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,200
Is this safe?

191
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,840
Of course it is.

192
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,230
A Finnish guy invented it.

193
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,010
A birdwatching photographer

194
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,700
specially designed this in order
to film eagles on cliffs.

195
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,280
With this setup,

196
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,100
we can live on the cliff for months
without touching the ground.

197
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,210
The men won't join us.

198
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,400
They'll wait at base camp.

199
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,910
We'll be staying here for the time being.

200
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,480
My ageing limbs.

201
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,190
I couldn't climb another inch
even if you asked me to.

202
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,460
There are so many openings.

203
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,050
Why don't we stay in them?

204
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,090
Because

205
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,450
we don't know what could be inside.

206
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,150
Take care they don't crawl into your mouth

207
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,550
while you're asleep.

208
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,050
Alright, you guys better rest up.

209
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,940
We'll have to continue searching.

210
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,520
Well, the "nest" is quite comfortable.

211
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,560
I'm fine with it.

212
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,520
We just received a message.

213
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:23,870
Boss.

214
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,680
Mrs Huo has gone scouting.

215
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,710
Wu Xie has started to climb as well.

216
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,290
But we don't have any action right now.

217
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,710
What should we do next?

218
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,870
Should we take action?

219
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,830
No, we stay put for now.

220
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,640
Giving them the map

221
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,920
is quite a big help.

222
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,240
Next, it is Mrs Huo's turn.

223
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,080
We don't take action

224
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,540
unless we find something.

225
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,020
Stay close.

226
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,710
Watch your feet.

227
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:29,750
Zhang,

228
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
this place is pretty big.

229
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,660
Let's continue.

230
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,359
What's the fuss?

231
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,930
Hendry's men.

232
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,079
The bodies are placed in a line.

233
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,680
Seems like human action.

234
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:34,240
It does seem peculiar.

235
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,790
You two,

236
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,160
scout ahead.

237
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,950
Okay.

238
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,160
It's a dead end.

239
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,290
This is the thing.

240
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,200
It's like amber,

241
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,810
you can crack it using alkali.

242
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,170
The pathway is behind it.

243
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,590
Use the alkali, quick.

244
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,470
Got it.

245
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,270
Stay back.

246
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,640
Dead.

247
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,450
Smells of sulphur.

248
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,190
Someone's laid a trap.

249
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,670
Sulphur?

250
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,250
There's sulphur on the surface?

251
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,180
We can't open the door without alkali.

252
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,370
But alkali reacts with the sulphur,

253
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,710
resulting in great heat.

254
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,020
What a jerk.

255
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,520
This was a dirty trick.

256
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,170
Mi Luo Tuo!

257
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,190
Zhang, it's a dead end.

258
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,350
We'll have to fight them.

259
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,450
Don't just stand there. Attack!

260
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,330
-Yes.
-Yes.

261
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,330
Zhang!

262
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,450
We'll be overpowered if this continues.

263
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,310
Cover me. I'll get the alkali tank.

264
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,450
Zhang!

265
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,480
Watch out!

266
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,210
Fatty!

267
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,090
Fatty!

268
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,690
Fatty.

269
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,910
Fatty.

270
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,310
That hurt.

271
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm too old for this.

272
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,060
How long was I asleep?

273
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,100
About two hours.

274
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,210
Here, have an egg.

275
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,870
Thanks.

276
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,240
Say, the nest is pretty sturdy.

277
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,710
I tossed and turned inside
but it didn't move much at all.

278
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,370
Good job, Master Xiao San.

279
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,340
You've improved since we parted ways.

280
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,960
Nice.

281
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,920
Xiao Huo said the nest is sturdy,

282
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,200
so I have to trust him.

283
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,930
Don't trust me,

284
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:29,880
trust in technology.

285
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,950
The diameter of steel used for the nest
is 40mm.

286
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,440
It can withstand many times

287
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,370
the weight of a human.

288
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,610
As long as the nest is erected
properly on the cliff's surface,

289
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,660
it can even withstand earthquakes,

290
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,190
let alone strong winds.

291
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,890
How do we choose the anchor points?

292
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,940
It's not hard.

293
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,200
It's the same as choosing anchor points
for rock climbing.

294
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,770
As long as the mountain structure is

295
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,960
What's the matter?

296
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,490
Xiao Hua?

297
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,410
Who set the tents up?

298
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,280
The anchor points are collapsing!

299
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,560
This can't be safe!

300
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Wu Xie, don't move!

301
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,680
Wu Xie!

302
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,300
I'm not trying to move.

303
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,250
But,

304
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,720
the position I'm in

305
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,060
makes it impossible to get up.

306
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,340
Wu Xie, keep still.

307
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,210
Don't move!

308
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,470
Listen to my instruction.

309
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,840
Wu Xie, move slowly.

310
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,960
Clip your safety line on.

311
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,820
Master Hua'er, you too.

312
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:39,960
Hang on.

313
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,840
Now...

314
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,920
Now, if nothing weird falls onto
Wu Xie's tent,

315
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,940
we will be fine.

316
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,000
Did you just jinx me?

317
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
Wu Xie!

318
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,760
Hold on!

319
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,000
Master Hua'er.

320
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,160
Can I use Wu Xie's life to clear the debt?

321
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,200
Looting a burning house, are you?

322
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,140
Save your energy.

323
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,610
Sorry.

324
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,430
I'll have to get the money from you.

325
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,310
Five hundred.

326
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,440
Wu Xie, catch!

327
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,990
Hang tight!

328
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,600
-Don't move.
-Hey.

329
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,680
Climb up quick.

330
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,300
My shades are falling off.

331
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,350
There's a hole that looks odd.

332
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,490
Now is not the time.

333
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,450
Come up quick.

334
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,350
No.

335
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,580
You come down.

336
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,650
I can't hold on any longer.

337
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,680
Are you trying to kill us,
Master Xiao San?

338
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,880
Fatty.

339
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,830
Where are we?

340
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,010
From where we were,

341
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,150
we managed to burn an opening.

342
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,290
This is just around the corner.

343
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,140
Where is Zhang?

344
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,830
He's guarding the opening.

345
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,850
Fatty,

346
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,760
those Mi Luo Tuos are afraid of alkali.

347
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,520
We sprayed a lot along the way

348
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,350
and haven't seen one since.

349
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,160
Are you alright?

350
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,420
This is just a scratch.

351
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,810
I was just too tired

352
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,840
and needed rest.

353
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,710
You're awake.

354
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,100
Zhang.

355
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,260
What's the update?

356
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,890
The opening disappeared.

357
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,730
This place is incredible, no?

358
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,150
We had to blaze a trail

359
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,370
but the alkali and sulphur
almost blazed us.

360
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:13,040
We made a path but it closed back up.

361
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,580
The person setting these traps

362
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,530
must know chemistry.

363
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,490
He better not let me find him.

364
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,910
Otherwise,

365
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,420
I'll use him as putty
to fill the crevices.

366
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,400
We've already lost two men.

367
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,590
We also used more than half of the alkali.

368
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,710
What should we do?

369
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,250
We need to get out of here quickly.

370
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,570
Having so many people here

371
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,540
will increase the temperature.

372
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,180
If it attracts more Mi Luo Tuo,

373
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,680
that'd spell trouble.

374
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,060
We should go then.

375
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,340
Let's go.

376
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,290
Tell those who inspected the nests
to get lost.

377
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,500
Remind the newbies,

378
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,430
if anymore problems arise,
their hands will be chopped!

379
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,600
Aren't you scary?

380
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,030
Chopping their hands off?

381
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,570
Would you like to hear

382
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,980
how the Xie family treats debtors?

383
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Quiet.

384
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,800
Stop.

385
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,850
It might break.

386
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,300
This looks like armour.

387
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,370
And someone's worn it.

388
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,590
Did they prepare this for us?

389
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,440
So they're giving us the tools
to make copies?

390
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,530
Doesn't seem logical.

391
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,710
This cave had been reinforced.

392
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,430
You can tell

393
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,370
that it's to ensure safe passage

394
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,700
or to seal whatever is inside the cave
with soil.

395
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,330
This is most likely

396
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,870
the place we're looking for.

397
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,400
Look over there.

398
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,980
The trace looks a little weird.

399
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,590
This is a mixture of rock and cement.

400
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,200
We can dig it.

401
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,600
Here.

402
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,110
You said it can be dug.

403
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,960
Come on.

404
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,010
Aren't you supposed to be kind?

405
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,850
How could you ask me to dig alone?

406
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,800
Three goats.

407
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,430
Thirty.

408
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,320
Two.

409
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,410
Deal.

410
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,570
Master Hua'er.

411
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,610
Why don't I make you a stone chair

412
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,710
so you can rest.

413
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,750
One goat.

414
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,640
One?

415
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,300
Fine.

416
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,190
One it is.

417
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,680
Those who work should be proud.

418
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,870
Another dead end.

419
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,720
This is like a huge maze.

420
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,450
Here.

421
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,080
Wait.

422
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,030
Test a small portion first.

423
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:01,670
Don't get tricked again.

424
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,710
Understood.

425
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,180
Looks fine.

426
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,390
Spray away.

427
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,160
This...

428
00:31:58,530 --> 00:31:59,750
Which one do we take?

429
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,740
Wait here with your men.

430
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,000
It looks to be safe for now.

431
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,150
Zhang and I will check them out.

432
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,030
Why don't I go with you guys?

433
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,230
See, you're injured.

434
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,380
If something happened, I could help out.

435
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,870
So you have some conscience.

436
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,890
You dare attack Master Fatty?

437
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,820
Hendry's man?

438
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,370
Get up.

439
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,700
They're with me.

440
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,600
You guys work for Hendry?

441
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,220
Isn't he

442
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,380
Zhang from Tamutuo?

443
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,730
What are you guys doing here?

444
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,530
Are you lot a bunch of crazy dogs?

445
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,140
Biting whoever you see?

446
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,800
A misunderstanding,
truly a misunderstanding.

447
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:26,030
Thing is,

448
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:29,130
our boss sent us here
to map up the mountain.

449
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,320
But we were sneakily attacked.

450
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,610
Our scanning equipment was destroyed

451
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,890
and our team doctor was badly injured too.

452
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,290
So we could only back-track
the way we came.

453
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:40,550
We just arrived here

454
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,030
and heard incoming noises.

455
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,090
We thought

456
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,070
you guys were the attackers.

457
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,280
Sorry.

458
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,460
One guy?

459
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,230
Yes, one guy.

460
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,010
He is very skilled,

461
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,480
comparable to Zhang.

462
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:03,300
His skills are comparable to Zhang's?

463
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,670
Alive...

464
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,190
In Banai...

465
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,810
There has only been one such person.

466
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,870
Sloped-shoulder.

467
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,969
Sloped-shoulder?

468
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,330
What do you mean?

469
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,620
You guys came through from there?

470
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:29,989
Yes.

471
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,360
That's the opening we came from.

472
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,830
But it has been sealed.

473
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,100
Looks like this is a dead end too.

474
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,840
Turn back.

475
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,929
Then do we...

476
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Can we go with you?

477
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,659
Wait! Come on, hurry!

478
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,150
Catch up!

479
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,000
The sunset is quite lovely, isn't it?

480
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,030
But it's going to disappear very soon.

481
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,720
Is he going to dig until nightfall?

482
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
That's terrible.

483
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,490
Master Hua'er.

484
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,420
All done?

485
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,100
Not yet.

486
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,720
Get it done then.

487
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,570
Master Hua'er.

488
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,780
What is it?

489
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,820
The cement...

490
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,840
is red.

491
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,270
It's blood.

492
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,270
The soil was mixed with plasma.

493
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,140
Even if someone was injured or died,

494
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,470
they couldn't have lost so much blood.

495
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,140
Could it be dog's blood
used to deter evil?

496
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,420
Check out the blood.

497
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,220
It is seeping out from the inside.

498
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,350
There is no oxygen on the inside.

499
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,390
So the iron in the blood
was never oxidised.

500
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,360
That's why the colour remained.

501
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,410
Shades, we should continue digging.

502
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,970
-Continue digging?
-Yes.

503
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,910
I'm already spent.

504
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,910
I know.

505
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,930
Forget about the 500 you're paying me.

506
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,810
You dig.

507
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,000
Dig it yourself.

508
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,920
Alright.

509
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,760
Let's stop for the day.

510
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,460
The nests have been secured.

511
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,560
Rest early.

512
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,190
I told you.

513
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:04,060
Nobody in this world
is as kind as Master Hua'er.

514
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,350
Nobody.

515
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,010
Master Fatty.

516
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,250
What?

517
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,590
Why are you being mysterious?

518
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,260
Can't we move together, Master Fatty?

519
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,660
A formal cooperation.

520
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,700
Buddy, I'm not trying to be mean.

521
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,170
Your team's condition

522
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,110
will only slow us down.

523
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,670
We have supplies.

524
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,520
Our boss' equipment are the best.

525
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,770
What do you need?

526
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,300
Tell us.

527
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,030
You guys have been mapping out
the mountain for some time.

528
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,650
Don't you have a hard copy?

529
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,900
We do.

530
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,680
Look.

531
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,150
This is the latest copy we made
from the terrain mapping.

532
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,220
It's reliable.

533
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,120
<i>Mount Yang Jiao's secondary peak</i>

534
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,420
<i>Mount Yang Jiao's main peak</i>

535
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,350
Seems like Hendry's
highly-advanced technology

536
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,450
is of some use.

537
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,180
Well?

538
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,200
Can we team up?

539
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,360
Fine.

540
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:45,790
Wait.

541
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,180
I'll keep the map with me.

542
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,430
After all, there's a saying,
"Unload the mill to kill the donkey."

543
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,880
Not bad.

544
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,850
You know your idioms.

545
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,680
With experience, even the hog
can climb trees.

546
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,940
Who are you calling a hog?

547
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,430
-I...
-Give it to me.

548
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,830
Zhang.

549
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,580
Fate has brought us together
numerous times.

550
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,490
You won't leave us behind, right?

551
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,890
<i>Mount Yang Jiao's secondary peak</i>
<i>Crevice opening</i>

552
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,530
This way.

553
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:23,670
Zhang.

554
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,810
Why don't we call it a day.

555
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,670
We'll follow the map
and try again tomorrow.

556
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,730
This cement seal is too solid.

557
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,840
Better to err on the side of caution.
Be careful.

558
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,400
What is this?

559
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,660
Long-haired monsters?

560
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,160
The reason Mystic Nine
suffered a great loss before

561
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,590
could be due to these things.

562
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,420
Are these corpses

563
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,830
in a stacked formation?

564
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,520
They could be trying to climb out.

565
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,720
The stench of death is strong.

566
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
There must be more inside.

567
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,320
Seems like there were many
who were alive.

568
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,210
But their doom was sealed
by the inpouring cement.

569
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,790
Sounds like what I'd do.

570
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,570
What I mean is

571
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:40,660
I'd do that when push comes to shove.

572
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
I don't think this was done
by Mrs Huo's crew.

573
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,480
She would've told us about it otherwise.

574
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,110
To my knowledge, cement pouring

575
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,980
started after the 70s.

576
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,690
So after the Mystic Nine,

577
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,410
someone else had been here.

578
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,860
If different teams had been here,

579
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,940
it means the traps

580
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,090
are not one-time only.

581
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,330
And they're very dangerous.

582
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,640
We have to be careful.

583
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,530
Let's get to work.

584
00:41:13,734 --> 00:41:23,734
