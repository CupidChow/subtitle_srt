The auction will begin soon.

6
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,360
If your grandma won't come,

7
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,720
you should leave too.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,240
Don't waste my time.

9
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,720
Mrs Huo,

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,440
you must be kidding.

11
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,080
Let's not disturb

12
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,440
my grandma for this.

13
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,440
After my grandpa passed away,

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,650
she's never taken a step out of our house.

15
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,900
That's because she has bad eyesight

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
and married someone who died young.

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,280
-You...
-She and I were childhood friends.

18
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,560
Over these years,

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
she's never visited me even once,

20
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,760
but hid herself in the horrible Hangzhou.

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,880
I want her to see me here now.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,000
And you think I'm kidding?

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,880
Mrs Huo,

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,240
I have no idea about
the things that happened

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,600
to the older generation.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,680
How about this?

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,320
I'll burn some joss papers to my grandpa

28
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,880
and ask him to appear in your dream

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,320
so that you two may talk.

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,760
Show him to the door.

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
Wu Xie,

32
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,520
please leave first.

33
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,000
No one shall walk around

34
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,079
when the auction starts.

35
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,520
Just play dirty like she did.

36
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,079
Mrs Huo,

37
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
don't blame us for being shameless then.

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,200
I must get an answer
about Yangshi Lei Archives.

39
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,079
Or the three of us

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,520
will follow you

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,840
wherever you go like a shadow.

42
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,440
Since you're going to sit here,

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
we will, too.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,360
How dare you sit there?

45
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
Stand up.

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,160
How could he sit there?

47
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,810
Tell them to stand by.

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,920
Yes, sir.

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,440
Tell me,

50
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,720
or I'm not going to get up.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,840
Get someone

52
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,400
to drag these thugs out.

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,600
Mrs Huo,

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,040
wouldn't kicking us out
make you lose face too?

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,360
Master Xiao San will respect the elderly.

56
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,400
As for us, we're the real thugs here.

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,800
In case things turn violent

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,120
and you get hurt,

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,280
that would be bad.

60
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,280
Wu Xie,

61
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,800
-this seat is...
-Say no more.

62
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,280
He wishes to sit there.

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,000
So let him be.

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Mrs Huo,

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
I will do as I say.

66
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,000
Please have mercy.

67
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
Stop fooling me around.

68
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,159

69
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,560
ever did you wrong,

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,680
you may slap me.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,920
Sure.

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,400
Young Master Wu,

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,280
I surrender.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200

If you could,

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,160
I won't make things difficult for you.

78
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,760
By just sitting here,

79
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,720
you'll tell me about Yangshi Lei Archives?

80

This is going to be a great show.

86
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,610
He's asking you to sit there.

87

I'm afraid he's not.

88

is your friend

92
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,640
on the wrong seat?

93
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,600
Isn't this eye-opening?

94
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
After Master Zhang,

95
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,720
it's been a while since
anyone dare to take that seat.

96

99

when there are some suicidal fools.

100
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Please hold on.

101

104
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,600
Back then, Master Zhang

105
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,320
got to marry Yin Xin Yue

106
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
because he sat there.

107
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200

Wow.

00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,920
There's half an hour left,

174
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,320
and we'll win.

175
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,440
In the remaining half an hour,

176
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,640
I may not be able to sit tight.

177
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,800
Lighting a lantern in an auction house

178
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,080
means that for every item

179
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,200
and price bid,

180
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
a subsequent bid will
automatically be made by me.

181
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
In other words,

182
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,720
today at this place,

183
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,760
I'll pay for every item sold.

184
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,640
So, no matter how high the price is,

185
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,360
you'll be the one paying?

186
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,240
How much does the Ghost Seal worth?

187
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,120
More than the entire Wu family.

188
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
No wonder you let me sit here and wait.

189
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,600
Mrs Huo,

190
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,240
if I can't afford to pay,

191
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,320
Xin Yue Restaurant will cut off my limbs.

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,760
Listen,

193
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,360
had anything happened to me,

194
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,120
Yangshi Lei Archives
will be destroyed with me,

195
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,520
and you won't get anything.

196
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,000
So,

197
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,520
you're borrowing money from me?

198
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,040
That depends on which one matters more.

199
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,680
The Yangshi Lei Archives or money.

200
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
You should've asked around first.

201
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,600
I have never mentioned that I only

202
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,960
make deals with the living.

203
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,540
Your death makes things easier for me.

204
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,150
Master Xiao San of Wu family

205
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,520
has taken the lantern-lighting seat.

206
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,520
Aren't you going to help?

207
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:02,970
How can I help?

208
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,520
The only person who'd taken
the seat was Master Zhang.

209
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
Let Wu Xie do as he pleases.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,280
The bidding starts now.

211
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,800
The starting price for Dragon Fish
Ghost Seal is RMB 50 million.

212
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,360
Payment shall be done on pro-rata basis.

213
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,960
The lowest price for
each bid is RMB 1 million,

214
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,280
and the highest, RMB 10 million.

215
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,200
-RMB 50 million?
-You may start bidding.

216
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,680
RMB 51 million.

217
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,680
RMB 61 million.

218
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,400
RMB 61 million from second floor.

219
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,280
Great.

220
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,680
Now I've lost Wushanju.

221
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,560
RMB 65 million.

222
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,760
<i>26</i>

223
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,480
RMB 70 million.

224
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Outstanding.

225
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,200
-RMB 70 million.
-Farewell to my territory in Changsha.

226
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,320
<i>36</i>

227
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,520
RMB 75 million.

228
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,080
-There goes my ancestral house.
-RMB 75 million from No. 36.

229
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
Xiu Xiu.

230
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,800
Request a Mu Ke Zhai show
for Young Master Wu.

231
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,180
I've lost everything.

232
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,760
Since it fits the occasion.

233
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,840
RMB 80 million.

234
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,240
From No. 27,

235
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,640
-RMB 80 million.
-This can't go on.

236
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,200
RMB 90 million.

237
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,480
-RMB 90 million from No. 36.
-How terrifying.

238
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,280
Almost RMB 100 million.

239
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,560
RMB 100 million.

240
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,080
RMB 100 million from second floor.

241
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,200
It's break time.

242
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:26,079
<i>Peaceful Ambience</i>

243
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,280
This is an eye opener for me.

244
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,680
That woman sure has good hearing.

245
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,680
One rings his bell to make a bid.

246
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,000
All the ringing,

247
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,480
yet she's not been mistaken even once.

248
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,000
It'll reach RMB 200 million
in the second half.

249
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,440
I've got it.

250
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't even have RMB 10 million now.

251
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,960
We'll have to

252
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,720
play dirty.

253
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,000
Don't just stand there and watch.

254
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,280
Get ready

255
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,760
to run.

256
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,480
Seriously?

257
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,000
She heard us?

258
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,280
That hearing is really out of expectation.

259
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,670
She's probably interested in you

260
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,000
and wants to look at you.

261
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,160
Fatty.

262
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,640
Babe,

263
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,640
we're wreaking havoc later.

264
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,240
Shut up!

265
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,800
They want to destroy the lantern!

266
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,280
Crap.

267
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,200
She actually heard us.

268
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,560
How unbelievable!

269
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,800
Sit tight.

270
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,200
I'll leave it to you up here.

271
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,160
Okay.

272
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,080
It's too high. Are you out of your mind?

273
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,520
Wu Xie.

274
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,680
Mind your buttock.

275
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,840
I'll handle the guards.

276
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,520
Aren't you worried that

277
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,520
Mr Yin'd throw you into Yongding River?

278
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,200
Okay.

279
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
I'll cover you.

280
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,920
Just sit tight until half past four

281
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,120
so that Mrs Huo comes clean with you.

282
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,080
Do you know the consequence

283
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,240
of offending the boss here?

284
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,200
I don't care anymore.

285
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,920
Since we've stirred things up...

286
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,160
And I'm not one who
cares what comes after that.

287
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,920
It's already 4.25 pm.

288
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,480
We spent a long time sitting here.

289
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,010
After creating troubles and being bullied,

290
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,360
we must achieve something.

291
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,320
In the last five minutes,

292
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,280
I'll show you the
meaning of having dignity.

293
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,360
And I will work hard

294
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,160
so that Master Xiao San
will look dignified.

295
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,200
It's 4.27 pm.

296
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,580
I'm really becoming famous this time.

297
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,520
Wu Xie,

298
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,960
where's Zhang?

299
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,280
Oh, boy.

300
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,640
Open the door! Open the door!

301
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
It's 4.29 pm.

302
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,360
Pull him away from the chair.

303
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Hurry.

304
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,520
Wait.

305
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,520
Mrs Huo,

306
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,760
don't be tricky.

307
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,560
You're wrecking the place,

308
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,440
so it's right for my
bodyguards to protect me.

309
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,560
Do it.

310
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,400
Take the chair.

311
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,520
Old geezer.

312
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,280
They're fighting out there.

313
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,520
Aren't you going to do something?

314
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,240
Old geezer.

315
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
Your restaurant is wrecked.

316
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,720
Old geezer!

317
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,560
Fat... fat...

318
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,280
Why the sweet nickname?

319
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,560
Lose some weight.

320
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,080
Is it time yet?

321
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,440
Five more seconds.

322
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,440
Throw him down.

323
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,720
Yes, Ma'am.

324
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,480
Five.

325
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,600
Four.

326
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,120
Three.

327
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,600
Two.

328
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,000
One.

329
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
Old lady, time's up!

330
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,600
Mission accomplished!

331
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,760
Zhang, where's my human cushion?

332
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,720
Boss,

333
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,400
it's better to sit tight
during the auction.

334
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,160
Let's go.

335
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,440
Move.

336
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
The Ghost Seal is related to me.

337
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,160
Zhang,

338
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,400
stop fighting each other.

339
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,840
You've broken Xin Yue Restaurant's rules.

340
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,600
Mr Yin won't let you off.

341
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,200
We're already in this mess.

342
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,720
Leave us alone.

343
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,360
Fine.

344
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,600
Suit yourselves.

345
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,520
If you wish to sell the Ghost Seal,

346
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,720
come to my shop.

347
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,560
You're on your own now.

348
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,080
Listen through the door.

349
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,360
What is he doing inside there?

350
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,760
He's listening to...

351
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,920
"Two Butterflies"?

352
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,720
Old geezer.

353
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,960
Your restaurant is going to be smashed.

354
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,880
Old geezer!

355
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
Do you hear me?

356
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,440
Mrs Huo.

357
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,000
Xiao Hua,

358
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,520
you're here.

359
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,800
Mrs Huo,

360
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,480
I have a favour to ask.

361
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,400
A favour?

362
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,520
Looks like this is not something trivial.

363
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,080
It's too chaotic. I'll cut to the chase.

364
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,120
I want to ask about the Yellow Silk.

365
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,280
You're checking on the Yellow Silk?

366
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,360
The silk manuscript

367
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,840
was taken from Mount
Four Ladies by Mystic Nine.

368
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,600
You were involved too.

369
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,400
I guess you're the only
one who knows about it.

370
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,040
There's one more thing.

371
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
I know that you've been
collecting Yangshi Lei Archives.

372
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,240
When Wu Xie mentioned about selling it,

373
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
I knew you were the buyer.

374
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,640
It's just a Yangshi Lei diagram.

375
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,200
You're overthinking.

376
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,080
The entire Huo family has migrated,

377
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
but you stayed back.

378
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,880
Isn't it for the diagram?

379
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,760
I'm getting old.

380
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,280
He said that he's getting old,

381
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
and that it's time to
treat his saggy skin.

382
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,910
The restaurant's been
in business for too long.

383
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,480
Its owner's life has been too quiet.

384
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,160
Today, we'll be the nice guys,
going as far as

385
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,400
to bringing you some thrills.

386
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,600
Yeah.

387
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,960
After all you've said,

388
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,400
what exactly do you want?

389
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
Mrs Huo,

390
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,480
if you're doing something,

391
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,080
please involve me.

392
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,920
I know it's time.

393
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,960
Sit.

394
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,920
Why should I work with you?

395
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,160
The Huo family is not
as glorious as the past.

396
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,720
And your best partner

397
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,840
would be the Xie family.

398
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,000
The Mystic Nine is bogged down in this.

399
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,600
From your generation to Xie Lian Huan's,

400
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,760
none of you could get free from it.

401
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
And it's our turn now.

402
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
Mrs Huo,

403
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,280
your helping hand to us
will benefit yourself as well.

404
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,680
Okay.

405
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,440
We'll get more chances to work together.

406
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,800
By the way, Mrs Huo,

407
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,920
Wu Xie never meant
to light up the lantern.

408
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
Since you're working with me,

409
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,480
you should be siding me,

410
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,880
not Wu Xie.

411
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
Let Wu Xie

412
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,080
settle his own problem.

413
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,000
He's practising calligraphy now.

414
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,320
What should we do?

415
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,780
Leave it be as he does.

416
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,310
Return to our rooms.

417
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,200
Lock the doors.

418
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
And listen to musics.

419
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,560
Wu Xie,

420
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,600
take this.

421
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,680
What's this for?

422
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,800
You can't run about holding
the Ghost Seal, can you?

423
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,400
Mrs Huo,

424
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,400
see you again.

425
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,720
Okay.

426
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,600
I'll be waiting.

427
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,320
Let's go.

428
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Let's go.

429
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,840
We'll be easy target
running around like this.

430
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,640
If Xin Yue Restaurant suddenly remembers

431
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,640
to send people,

432
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,320
we'll all be caught. That'd be awkward.

433
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
No way.

434
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,040
We don't know the roads in Beijing well.

435
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,280
Splitting up means

436
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,880
we'll lose Zhang for sure.

437
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,520
And we have the seal.

438
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,160
They won't be doing
anything reckless to us.

439
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,120
If we go separate ways,

440
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,760
those who don't have
the seal will be in trouble.

441
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
There they are!

442
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,000
-After them!
-Let's go.

443
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,600
Master Xiao San.

444
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,680
You're incredible.

445
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,520
Why?

446
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,400
You haven't enjoyed enough
at Xin Yue Restaurant,

447
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,240
and want another round here?

448
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm here only for the Ghost Seal,

449
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,680
not expecting you to light up the lantern.

450
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,080
If you take the seal home through
a grand and honest way,

451
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,600
I'm fine with that.

452
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,040
But you broke the rules.

453
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,800
So, don't blame me for not following one.

454
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,400
The rules your Uncle San
didn't teach you...

455
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,680
I, Liu Li Sun,

456
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,280
will give you a lesson about it today.

457
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,720
Get the Ghost Seal back!

458
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,720
Bring it on!

459
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,440
Zhang!

460
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,560
Get their leader first!

461
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,800
Are we too late?

462
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,080
Not at all.

463
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,280
The scene just now isn't for you.

464
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,560
Go to my house with Xiu Xiu.

465
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
I'll be there later.

466
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,360
Get in.

467
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,920
Mas...

468
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,800
Master Hua'er.

469
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,280
Rag, who we met in Changsha...

470
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,560
He works for you, doesn't he?

471
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,160
He's long gone.

472
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,360
If you're looking for him, Master Hua'er,

473
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,720
I'll search every nook and cranny

474
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,800
to find him for you.

475
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,160
Thank you

476
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,520
for coming here

477
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,960
to save me.

478
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,840
No.

479
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,200
I'm not here to save you.

480
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
I'm here to beat you up.

481
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
<i>Master Hua'er.</i>

482
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
<i>Liu Li Sun's imprisoned</i>

483
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,320
<i>for group fighting.</i>

484
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,720
<i>He won't get away easily.</i>

485
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,570
Xiao Hua,

486
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,520
you seem to be in a good mood.

487
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,160
I was moody at Xin Yue Restaurant.

488
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,840
But Liu Li Sun getting caught

489
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,000
makes me feel much better.

490
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Hey.

491
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,639
-So, you're Huo Xiu Xiu?
-Yes, I am.

492
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,719
And I...

493
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,600
I know.

494
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,560
You're Fatty Wang.

495
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,080
Here.

496
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,520
You

497
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,159
and Zhang there.

498
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,440
He's Zhang Qi Ling.

499
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,080
Wu Xie already told me about all this.

500
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,080
You may call me Xiu Xiu.

501
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,159
What a straightforward
and undemanding girl.

502
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,719
Can I ask you something?

503
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,310
Is there

504
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,880
a less cute band-aid?

505
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,469
After all, in the capital,

506
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,960
I'm quite well-known and reputable.

507
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,600
This doesn't suit me.

508
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,840
You're lucky to even get one.

509
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,159
Don't be picky.

510
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,960
So much for the undemanding part.

511
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,880
Oh, Xiu Xiu.

512
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,760
My place

513
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,640
isn't safe.

514
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,200
The people from Xin Yue Restaurant
might come here anytime.

515
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,360
Where should they go then?

516
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,920
There's a very suitable place.

517
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,160
Huo family's place.

518
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,480
This is an old shop of ours.

519
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,600
An old shop with lots of precious items.

520
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,060
It is not often visited by people.

521
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,760
You're safe here.

522
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,480
Xiu Xiu,

523
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
I

524
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,000
only ate some mutton

525
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,880
and melon seeds today,

526
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,950
but I fought twice.

527
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,200
I'm starving now.

528
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,400
Is there any food?

529
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,640
You can have this one first.

530
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
I'll prepare food and
daily necessities now.

531
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,840
It's better than nothing.

532
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,320
Whatever.

533
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,680
Remember this.

534
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,240
Don't ever go outside.

535
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,760
Make it quick.

536
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,880
Your Uncle San

537
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,920
left the Yangshi Lei Archives for you.

538
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,040
And the buyer wanted to
meet you at Xin Yue Restaurant.

539
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,400
What a coincidence,
there was an auction today,

540
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,200
and you got the Ghost Seal back.

541
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,560
Isn't this fated?

542
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,840
Someone has arranged this for me.

543
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,400
<i>Have you ever thought that</i>

544
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,720
<i>he's making you continue the search</i>

545
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,040
<i>while driving your curiosity?</i>

546
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
<i>You mean</i>

547
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,800
<i>my actions are arranged by Mystic Nine?</i>

548
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,680
<i>No.</i>

549
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,520
<i>The Mystic Nine has chosen you.</i>

550
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,520
That's right.

551
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,880
You are the chosen one.

552
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,120
Tsk.

553
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,320
Wu Xie.

554
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
Since we have nothing to do,

555
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,520
take it out, come on.

556
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,840
Hurry.

557
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,360
Come on.

558
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,280
Who knows,
it may be out of our reach tomorrow.

559
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,040
One.

560
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,240
Two.

561
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,120
Three.

562
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,320
Four.

563
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,680
What is it?

564
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,720
It is defective.

565
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,000
One of the ghost heads is gone.

566
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,640
Not only one.

567
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,160
Give it here.

568
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,760
These are just some fractures.

569
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,000
They should be caused by rings.

570
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,880
The owner of this Ghost Seal

571
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,640
must have a habit of wearing three rings.

572
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,080
Look.

573
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,500
If I hold it like this,

574
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,600
the rings would be
at where it fractured.

575
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,360
Let me see.

576
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,360
It's true.

577
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,640
We've had a long day.

578
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,460
I'm going to freshen up.

579
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:49,444
