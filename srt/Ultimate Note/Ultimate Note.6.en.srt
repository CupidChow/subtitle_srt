1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,759
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,780
<i>Episode 6</i>

4
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,560
Everyone, don't touch those.

5
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,150
Those are human face fossils.

6
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,280
No way.

7
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,250
There are so many human faces here.

8
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,800
Could it be a mass grave?

9
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,390
It seems this Heavenly Queen Mother

10
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,770
was indeed a tyrant.

11
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,620
That's enough, Fatty. Stop digging.

12
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,960
This doesn't feel right.

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,480
Sorry, misters,
for disturbing you all.

14
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,600
We will leave right now.

15
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,920
It is not so scary.

16
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,890
This is not even human.

17
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,550
What is that?

18
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,530
Take a good look.

19
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,380
The edges of this rock.

20
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,870
Say,

21
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,800
why haven't we seen a turning point yet?

22
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,520
We don't know about that.

23
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,360
Look.

24
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,630
This is...

25
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,750
A human spine?

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,420
Human spines aren't so short.

27
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,670
It's a fish bone.

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,640
That's right.

29
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,430
This is a mythical creature

30
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,080
called fish-with-a-face.

31
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,030
Fish-with-a-face?

32
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,720
That has to be from at
least 10,000 years ago.

33
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,500
Judging by these unspoiled fossils

34
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,000
and this rock structure,

35
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,600
we can conclude that

36
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,120
this place is a paleochannel.

37
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,560
Do you guys remember that ancient ship?

38
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,220
That ship...

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,530
If that ship was

40
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,160
the funeral boat of Heavenly Queen
Mother's close relative,

41
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,970
it should have departed from Palace
of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

42
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,670
Therefore,

43
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,250
there must be a river.

44
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,500
That's right.

45
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:39,329
Enough, stop wasting time.

46
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,250
Let's go.

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,820
Don't go!

48
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,329
We can bring them back to local
cultural relic institutions to be studied.

49
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:50,370
Do you know why they had faces of humans?

50
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,810
Why?

51
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,500
It is because

52
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,300
they ate too many humans.

53
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,310
Great, know-it-all.

54
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,680
What is this sculpture about?

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,290
Some totems.

56
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,910
Or rather, what's left of it.

57
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,030
It has long been deformed
due to exposure to weather.

58
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,380
That said, we can give it a try.

59
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,529
What are you up to?

60
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,269
You go over there first.

61
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,630
Why should I?

62
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,340
Stop talking nonsense. Go quickly.

63
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,390
Are you sure this is the right time

64
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,860
to be creative?

65
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,230
Don't move.

66
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,830
I think

67
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,590
we had better separate into two teams

68
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,590
to inspect the surroundings.

69
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,000
In 15 minutes' time,

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,070
we will gather here.

71
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,590
No need.

72
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,310
If this place

73
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,950
was the ancient river which
the sunk ship once sailed,

74
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,130
the murals in that sunk ship

75
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,050
must have referred to this paleochannel.

76
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,060
Actually, I studied it on my way here.

77
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,230
Give me some time.

78
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,460
You wish to locate it
with your own memory?

79
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,020
Isn't that too difficult?

80
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,790
I remember the murals

81
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,620
recorded the burial process in detail,

82
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,070
including the changes of the sun.

83
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,780
We can rely on the river course

84
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,500
as well as the height
of the sun in the sky

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,880
to determine the exact
direction of the ancient river.

86
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,610
At this point,

87
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,380
we are about 30 degrees off
from the ancient river.

88
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,900
Pan Zi.

89
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,120
This is the right direction.

90
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's go.

91
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,950
Wait a moment.

92
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,500
You might not like the sound of it

93
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,870
but this map

94
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,760
does not necessarily lead to
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother.

95
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,000
It could be a grave

96
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,280
or cemetery

97
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,750
or even toilets.

98
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,790
This...

99
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,760
What is that in the distance?

100
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,530
You restored the totem?

101
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,390
Young man, you are quite talented.

102
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,010
Although it is weathered and eroded,

103
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,420
you can still tell by
the remaining outline.

104
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,290
Birdmans.

105
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,600
You have seen those before?

106
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,670
Have you heard of
Heavenly Palace on the Cloud?

107
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,140
Mount Changbai?

108
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,110
That's right.

109
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,760
There are such birds in
Heavenly Palace on the Cloud.

110
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,460
Heavenly Palace on the
Cloud is at Mount Changbai

111
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,920
but we are at Tamutuo.

112
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,400
The link between these two

113
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,670
is quite interesting.

114
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,690
Blue bird is one of the traditional totems
in Land of Heavenly Queen Mother

115
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,740
and Birdmans evolved
from it as an upgraded version.

116
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,450
However, if this creature is seen here,

117
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,550
perhaps

118
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,600
this is the core area of Land
of Heavenly Queen Mother.

119
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,690
We will know once we go inside.

120
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,390
Wait.

121
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,710
What is this?

122
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,590
Glasses.

123
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,320
I have been standing here for hours

124
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,390
since you told me to stand still, and all
I am in this drawing is a pair of glasses?

125
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,340
You were mainly there to add
proportion to this painting.

126
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,340
I drew you as a pair of glasses
out of respect.

127
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,320
All right, time is running out.
Let's find the route quickly.

128
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,610
This should be the right location.

129
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,250
Your drawing is inaccurate.

130
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,890
Which part is inaccurate?

131
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,020
Look.

132
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,970
The mouth of the
Birdman on top is shut,

133
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,080
whereas in your drawing,
its mouth is open.

134
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,040
Among these four birds-with-a-face,

135
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,880
three of them are in a soaring pose

136
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,980
and only one is standing.

137
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,190
All right.

138
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,390
Let's dig at this spot.

139
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,910
This is our equipment.

140
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,970
Our people should be nearby.

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,409
Not only that,

142
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,250
there is even a vehicle.

143
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,810
This seems to be it.

144
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,090
This place should be the entrance to
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother.

145
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,260
All right.

146
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's take a look down there.

147
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,470
Who would expect this vehicle
to be blown all the way here?

148
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,620
It must have ridden on a cloud

149
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,400
to be faster than us.

150
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,140
However, by the looks of it,

151
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,540
it has probably broken down.

152
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,070
I found some equipment,

153
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,280
supplies and medicine.

154
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,710
Distribute these among yourselves.

155
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,910
Zhang,

156
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,620
is something the matter?

157
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,770
Listen.

158
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,230
Is it me, or this mountain is moving?

159
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,910
-Corpse Bugs!
-Run!

160
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,120
Run!

161
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
Run quickly!

162
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,030
Run!

163
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,390
Run!

164
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,920
This basin is so huge.

165
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,550
It is almost like a meteorite crater.

166
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,240
Pan Zi, what should we do?

167
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,030
We can only go down there.
It seems to be bottomless from here.

168
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,090
I wonder if our safety
ropes are long enough.

169
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,600
What if the rope is too short

170
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,600
and we get stuck halfway,

171
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,270
we will be in trouble.

172
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,220
Let's go down first for now.

173
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,100
No.

174
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,250
The fog is very dense down there.

175
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,410
We don't know what might happen.

176
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,410
It is too dangerous to go down this way.

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,880
Either slide down from here,

178
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,040
or you can continue to
discuss the next steps.

179
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,500
The Corpse Bugs will be here any second.

180
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,110
You can ask their opinion.

181
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,310
Wu Xie,

182
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,560
down there is safer than being here.

183
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,540
Let's go.

184
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,990
Easy for you all to say.

185
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,170
What about me?

186
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,470
Reduce my baggage first.

187
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,740
Let's try our luck.

188
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,780
I'd rather die from falling than
be eaten by those insects.

189
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,920
This is heavy too.

190
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,500
Remember what I said just now?

191
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,370
That is the end of the rope.

192
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,870
Now, we are hanging in mid air.

193
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,990
What should we do?

194
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,210
Where are those three?

195
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,550
They didn't fall down, right?

196
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,720
They cut the cables themselves.

197
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,640
Seems like they found the way
to go to the bottom.

198
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,110
Who would expect this desert
to have a forest of this scale?

199
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm amazed.

200
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,630
It is a complex environment.

201
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,110
We have to be careful.

202
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,590
Don't even think about it.

203
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,130
There is no way this can
support human weight.

204
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,150
All of them went to the bottom.

205
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,260
I'm sure it's fine.

206
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,060
Not for me.

207
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,210
In that case, stay here

208
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,950
and go down when you are dried up.

209
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,710
Listen.

210
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,350
Seems like we found the right place.

211
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,270
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother
is right here in this forest.

212
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,510
Those insects are poisonous and ruthless,

213
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,480
yet after reaching here,

214
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,740
they don't even dare to come down.

215
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,510
It seems, at the bottom,

216
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,430
creatures scarier than
Corpse Bugs await us.

217
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,760
Thank you

218
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,630
for telling me such good news.

219
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,110
Hold this.

220
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,150
No.

221
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,130
I will never entrust my life

222
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,890
to these large Boston ivy.

223
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,190
I'm telling you to hold it for me.

224
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,220
Hurry up.

225
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,150
And?

226
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,310
And...

227
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Goodbye!

228
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,650
Wu Xie!

229
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,230
When we reach the bottom,

230
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,210
I have to talk some sense into you.

231
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,560
If something happened to me...

232
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,550
Fatty!

233
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,970
Wu Xie, are you all right?

234
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,510
I'm fine.

235
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,940
Luckily Zhang caught me.

236
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,830
It hurts.

237
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,640
Hey,

238
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,810
can any of you give me a hand here?

239
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,990
I'll do it.

240
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,600
Pan Zi, my brother.

241
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,710
Wait.

242
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:43,230
Wait?

243
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,370
What is it?

244
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,900
Don't touch those.

245
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,760
What is going on?

246
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,390
Seems like some creature's eggs.

247
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,570
Eggs?

248
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,380
What animal laid its eggs here?

249
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,800
-Should be snakes.
-Snakes?

250
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,410
Snakes? Where are they?

251
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,970
Where are the snakes?

252
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:24,710
Zhang,

253
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,940
how could you do this to me?

254
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,300
Why didn't you save me just now?

255
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,430
You are heavy.

256
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,390
Heavy?

257
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,390
Don't you observe social courtesy

258
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,210
when talking to me?

259
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,240
This Zhang Qi Ling.

260
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,950
Wu Xie,

261
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,390
you care about me the most.

262
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,430
Zhang!

263
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,920
His neck.

264
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,440
Wu Xie, I'll take a look at him.

265
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,780
How did his back get into this state?

266
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,130
Hurry up and clean it.

267
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,140
This object does not look like snake eggs.

268
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,330
It feels soft to the touch

269
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,680
like fungus.

270
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,350
Ah Ning,

271
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,690
what exactly are these?

272
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,950
Is Fatty all right?

273
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,240
Take off your shirt.

274
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,650
You weren't far from
these things just now.

275
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,230
Check whether it got on you.

276
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,270
Fatty!

277
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,390
Fatty!

278
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,530
Zhang hit him too hard.

279
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,109
Wake him up.

280
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,760
Who? Who hit me?

281
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,830
Who? Who hit me?

282
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,550
If we look at how this
room is decorated,

283
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,720
this should be the host's seat,

284
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,260
and these are for the guests.

285
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,760
Seems like it is a room
to entertain the guests.

286
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,480
Blue birds?

287
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,720
This place should be
Heavenly Queen Mother's territory.

288
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,960
This object is quite interesting.

289
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,040
Blue birds are Heavenly
Queen Mother's messengers.

290
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,620
I don't think anyone would dare use it

291
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,210
other than her.

292
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,690
Could this place be Palace
of Heavenly Queen Mother?

293
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,470
We couldn't have
found it so easily, right?

294
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,400
I don't know if this is a palace,

295
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,140
but I'm sure of one thing.

296
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,520
There are traps in here.

297
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,280
Pan Zi,

298
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,150
thanks for saving my life just now.

299
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:30,370
I'm taking this.

300
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,540
This fatty.

301
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,500
Ah Ning,

302
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,870
it must be too hot to wear
leather jacket now, right?

303
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,780
Mind your own business.

304
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,760
Wu Xie,

305
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,960
any new discovery?

306
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,840
Just a record of the environment.

307
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,090
We are at a low sea level

308
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,440
with plenty of tropical vegetation.

309
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,940
The miasma will be very serious.

310
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,720
I wonder if our gas masks can handle it.

311
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,680
As long as we are heading
in the right direction,

312
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,510
there is always a solution to a problem.

313
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,460
According to the notes,

314
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,020
this is the only entrance to
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother.

315
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,140
But where is the exact location?

316
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,770
Your aunt didn't tell you?

317
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,350
This map is quite creative.

318
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,720
There are neither reference
points nor directions,

319
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,080
and all are in question marks.

320
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,630
The best part is,

321
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,130
we don't even know where we're at.

322
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,310
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother is at
a swampland in the middle of rainforest.

323
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,640
If we keep walking towards the centre,

324
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,790
we should be able to find it.

325
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,060
This Chen Wen Jin is too much.

326
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,830
She told us something is ahead of us,

327
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,070
but she won't tell us what it is.

328
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,990
She might as well don't let us
know the existence of this map

329
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,670
and let us set out as if
we are mine-sweeping.

330
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,260
This Fatty.

331
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,110
Watch what you say about my teacher.

332
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,450
When has Chen Wen Jin become your teacher?

333
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,500
I'm Wu Xie's disciple,

334
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,090
so of course Wen Jin is my teacher.

335
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,110
Besides,

336
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,400
just now you were referring to
her as Wu Xie's aunt.

337
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,010
All right, fine.

338
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,550
I won't talk about
the Wu family tree, all right?

339
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,400
There are water, food,
illuminating projectile,

340
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,450
cold firework and
medicine in your bags.

341
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,070
I packed two persons' worth
of supplies in each bag.

342
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
Even if we lost our bag by accident,

343
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,330
the remaining people can
still guarantee supplies.

344
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,820
Let's eat something quickly

345
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,690
and cover more distance during daytime.

346
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,450
Zhang, catch!

347
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,190
Slow down, Fatty.

348
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,510
-Here, give me your hand.
-Come on, Fatty.

349
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,720
The environment here

350
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,630
should be about the same
as rainforests in Vietnam.

351
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,540
These swamplands in the humid
tropics are most dangerous.

352
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,470
Look,

353
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,270
above us are the broadleaf
crown of primordial rainforest.

354
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,080
Below us, almost no
sunlight permeates through.

355
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,990
This place

356
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,480
is breeding ground for mosquitoes,
leeches and other poisonous insects.

357
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,990
Wu Xie.

358
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,870
I just said this place has
lots of poisonous insects.

359
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,780
You need to tighten
your cuffs and trouser bottoms.

360
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,250
Or else, in less than an hour,

361
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,470
you will have mosquito bites all over.

362
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,760
We have mosquito repellent
in our bags that you can use.

363
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,150
Don't.

364
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,330
This environment

365
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,920
is unlike any other wild environment.

366
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,750
It is highly possible

367
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,120
once you chase away the mosquitoes,

368
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:10,330
its smell will attract other creatures.

369
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,860
So you shouldn't use mosquito repellent.

370
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,870
The supplies we brought
this time are limited.

371
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,870
Even if we come across a wild boar,

372
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,260
it will be enough trouble for us.

373
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,260
Rainforests are still okay,

374
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,570
since there are clean water resources.

375
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,830
Once we enter swamplands,

376
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,170
if we have a choice,
we must never set foot in water.

377
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,030
And mud is out of the question.

378
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,170
Not bad, Pan Zi.

379
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,470
You know quite a lot.

380
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,440
I once saw a man

381
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,010
whose foot got caught in a swamp.

382
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,380
Within less than a minute,

383
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,070
there were holes in his legs
when he finally pulled it out.

384
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,190
His flesh was gouged.

385
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,650
Who knows what bit him.

386
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,200
In this kind of environment,

387
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,760
coming across such things
are akin to dying.

388
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,440
In some instances,
it might be worse than dying.

389
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,170
Look, there is a mechanism here.

390
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,460
Sure.

391
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,990
As the saying goes, "Take people's
money and eliminate disasters."

392
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,500
Watch out!

393
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,690
They are coming at us!

394
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,180
Knock them down!

395
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,150
Boomerangs?

396
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,100
Usual boomerangs only circle once,

397
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,710
but these blue birds circled
in the air many times.

398
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,660
It seemed they won't stop
before they hit someone.

399
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,320
Aren't blue birds messengers?

400
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,850
This is how they do public relations?

401
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,970
When these doors first opened,

402
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,700
these two persons fell inwards.

403
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,650
Seems like someone purposely
propped them against the door.

404
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,490
Who else?

405
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,640
It must be Master San.

406
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,100
Look at this.

407
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,300
The Qian symbol?

408
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,990
I guess you were right.

409
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,740
In order to guard himself from
those around him,

410
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,310
Master San could only leave
traces behind secretly

411
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,870
when taking care of the dead bodies.

412
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,520
It seems the people
Master San hired this time

413
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,900
are untrustworthy

414
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,200
with average skills.

415
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,890
All it takes are boomerangs
to kill two of them.

416
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,540
Let's go.

417
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,920
We need to get Master San
to deal with this.

418
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,370
We have been walking for about two hours.

419
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,230
There is a stream here.

420
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,670
Should we take a break?

421
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,030
Are you all right?

422
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,270
I'm not used to the heat.

423
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,190
We had better take a rest.

424
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,630
Humans are more prone to
physical exertion in rainforests.

425
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,210
We have to replenish
water and energy in time.

426
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,540
You don't feel well?

427
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,180
You don't have a fever.

428
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,790
Here, I'll give you one of these
to fan yourself.

429
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,180
Pan Zi,

430
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,700
is this water drinkable?

431
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,920
It is better to be careful.

432
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,160
There might be snakes in the water.

433
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,180
I'm going to wash my face.

434
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,440
My body

435
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,720
is my capital to go on
a revolutionary mission.

436
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,100
Wu Xie may be slim,

437
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,710
but he can't take it
during critical times.

438
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,330
Zhang,

439
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,060
did Madam Wen Jin tell you

440
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,650
we have to wait for the rainy season

441
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,250
to enter Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother?

442
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,590
I see.

443
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,300
With abundant water in the rainy season,

444
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,740
streams of all sizes will be flowing.

445
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,290
So, all the water

446
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,760
will flow towards the same place.

447
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,820
What you mean is,

448
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,080
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother?

449
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,250
I was thinking

450
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,670
why Madam Wen Jin

451
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,760
had to choose the rainy season.

452
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,220
Now, it seems

453
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,690
this is the only reason.

454
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,790
From what you've said,

455
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,270
we will find the entrance

456
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,580
if we follow the direction
of water movement?

457
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,140
It is likely.

458
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,230
Not bad, Pan Zi.

459
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:35,670
Here is to you.

460
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,760
The only thing is, I wonder

461
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,820
how Master San is doing.

462
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,910
Don't worry.

463
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,310
Master San alone is smarter than

464
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,830
the few of us combined.

465
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,420
Rest assured.

466
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,720
Wu Xie told us he was
going to wash his face.

467
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,000
What's keeping him?

468
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,150
Wu Xie,

469
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,460
are you taking a shower?

470
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,940
Do you need someone to scrub your back?

471
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,900
I can help you with that.

472
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,390
Wu Xie!

473
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,490
Wu Xie!

474
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,650
Wu Xie!

475
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,190
Wu Xie!

476
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,750
Wu Xie!

477
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,040
Why is his stomach moving?

478
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,600
What is this?

479
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,360
Did he get bitten by insects?

480
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,360
Why is there a film over it?

481
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,620
Something is underneath the film.

482
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,370
Isn't this...

483
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,740
<i>Seems like some creature's eggs.</i>

484
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,510
Isn't this the stuff on my buttock
after I landed on those eggs?

485
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,170
The difference is, those were smaller.

486
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,230
Those on your body were discovered earlier

487
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,380
and cleaned in time.

488
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,330
It must have gotten on Wu Xie accidentally

489
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,600
and was not cleaned in time.

490
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,190
Now, it has spread.

491
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,500
I think I know

492
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,290
how it got on him.

493
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,110
Water!

494
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,070
-Wu Xie!
-Master Xiao San.

495
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,790
Be good

496
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,910
and stop struggling.

497
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,750
Or else, I have no choice
but to knock you out.

498
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,810
Tranquillizer.

499
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,430
Stop struggling.

500
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,220
Wu Xie's sickness

501
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,810
is caused by this film.

502
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,980
Let's see if we can slice it open.

503
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,430
This film is formed tightly with his skin.

504
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,990
We can't separate the two.

505
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,510
Could the object underneath this film

506
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,690
be those snake's egg-like fungus?

507
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:18,870
All this while, Wu Xie
is growing fungus?

508
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,530
What should we do?

509
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,330
Let's wait for the fungus
to grow bigger.

510
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,070
Wait for the fungus to grow bigger?

511
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,040
How can that be?

512
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,440
Wu Xie's blood will be sucked dry.

513
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,510
We mustn't cut it.

514
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,040
-You...
-That's enough.

515
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,080
We'll listen to Zhang.

516
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,380
There is no other way.

517
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,670
Let's depart first

518
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,510
and find some place we can camp tonight.

519
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,570
These thorns are placed here

520
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,010
as if waiting for people to hit them.

521
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,260
Don't worry.

522
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,720
I, Mr Black, will protect you.

523
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,220
I'll go and take a look.

524
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,660
The usual price,

525
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,040
RMB500.

526
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,510
Come and help me!

527
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:42,510
Wu Xie,

528
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,480
you have to hang in there.

529
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,410
Or else, I...

530
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,090
Or else I'll regret
for the rest of my life.

531
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:56,550
Stop!

532
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,710
What is it, Zhang?

533
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,950
Why don't we take a rest first?

534
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,190
This place will do.

535
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,469
Wait.

536
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,550
Come on.

537
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:11,949
I'll go take a look in front.

538
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,300
Wu Xie.

539
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,550
Wu Xie,

540
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,590
can you hear?

541
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:18,870
Can you hear me?

542
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,300
This... Why did it grow so big?

543
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,630
-It's hot.
-This is bad.

544
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,949
The mushroom grew into his flesh.

545
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,440
Wu Xie keeps complaining it is hot.

546
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,670
The fungus must be the cause.

547
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,830
Wu Xie, hang in there.

548
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,190
I'll... I'll think of a way.

549
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,120
Come on, let's find the food container.

550
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,940
-Food container.
-Thermometer.

551
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,110
Wu Xie.

552
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,350
Thirty-five degrees Celsius.

553
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,230
What?

554
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,800
It is lower than normal body temperature.

555
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,190
At this rate, he will be in trouble.

556
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,670
Zhang, we can't wait any longer.

557
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,390
Didn't you say to wait for the
mushroom to grow bigger?

558
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,030
It is big enough now, right?

559
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,000
Lighter.

560
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,350
Here you go.

561
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,540
Pan Zi, hold him in place.

562
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,830
Are you sure this will work?

563
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:28,850
He might get hurt!

564
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,540
Zhang will not harm him!

565
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,770
Don't let him bite his tongue.

566
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,080
The film on his stomach is too big.

567
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,620
Roasting it with fire might not work.

568
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,790
Let's use a dagger to cut it.

569
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,060
Wu Xie, be obedient.

570
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:46,970
-We are trying to cure your sickness.
-Master Xiao San,

571
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,410
I'm sorry you have to go through this.

572
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,110
This...

573
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,470
That's it?

574
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,470
Half an hour has passed

575
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:16,680
yet he has not regained consciousness.

576
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,220
Thirty-six point five.

577
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,070
Thank goodness, his body
temperature is back to normal.

578
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,940
Don't celebrate too early.

579
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:44,350
One time, in a wild environment,

580
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,150
I saw snails which were
infected by parasites.

581
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,530
Snails prefer cold and
wet environment,

582
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,390
but after infected by parasites,

583
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,990
they went in the sun

584
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,770
and ended up being roasted to death.

585
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,530
However, this is the first time

586
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,600
I have come across such fungus.

587
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,800
These fungus prefer low temperature

588
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,660
and can even disturb one's senses.

589
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,030
After it attached to Wu Xie,

590
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,150
his body temperature went haywire.
He felt hot

591
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,650
and wished to go to colder places.

592
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,340
Luckily you and Zhang
took care of it for me.

593
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,710
Or else, there will be one
more person lying here

594
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:19,890
to get delivered.

595
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,480
You came to help me.

596
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,810
Why are you also trapped?

597
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,300
These are magnetic rocks.
Take off your bag!

598
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,230
Help me, quick!

599
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,120
What did you pack in your bag?

600
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,990
Don't talk nonsense.

601
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,870
Hurry!

602
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,380
Come on.

603
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,140
What rock is this with
such strong magnetic field?

604
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,730
Wu Xie.

605
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,890
Wu Xie!

606
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,650
You are finally conscious.

607
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,190
Fatty!

608
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,190
You are awake?

609
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:32,150
What happened to me just now?

610
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,670
You hit us.

611
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,710
I hit you?

612
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,670
Who did I hit?

613
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:37,550
You hit all of us.

614
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,660
You were hitting us with your fists

615
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,040
and even kicked Pan Zi.

616
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:41,930
Pan Zi,

617
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,990
are you okay?

618
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,550
I'm fine.

619
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,510
You have a good rest.

620
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,870
This fellow.

621
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,110
You only asked whether he is fine.

622
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,120
What about me?

623
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,710
Yes, you do need rest.

624
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:54,180
You were infected by
parasitic fungus just now

625
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,540
and lost your senses.

626
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,530
Luckily Zhang cut it open

627
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,650
and extracted several mushroom eggs.

628
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,620
Parasitic fungus?

629
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,920
What's that?

630
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,630
Those snake's egg-like fungus

631
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,380
when we entered the forest.

632
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,130
It grew on my stomach?

633
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,680
Although you are fine now,

634
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,790
you gave birth to few large fungus.

635
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,670
You suffered a lot.

636
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,870
Now, you are the key protection subject.

637
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,440
Don't touch me.

638
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,030
No one is allowed to touch
my belly from now on.

639
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,240
How disgusting.

640
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,420
Since he is awake,

641
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,570
let's set out quickly.

642
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,510
No, Master Xiao San needs to rest.

643
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,400
We have wasted a lot of time.

644
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,750
Besides,

645
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,120
the roots of those fungus

646
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,970
left a scar on Wu Xie's belly.

647
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,700
This place is too humid.

648
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,560
If you don't want him to get infected,

649
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,180
set out quickly

650
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,790
and find a cleaner spot to camp.

651
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:40,950
I'm fine.

652
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,330
Let's go.

653
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,210
No, but...

654
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,650
Don't touch me.

655
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,310
I can carry that.

656
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,210
With the state you are in,

657
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,790
the team's advancing speed
will definitely be affected.

658
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,080
Don't be our burden.

659
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,120
Careful.

660
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,030
There is no path ahead.

661
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:26,950
What should we do?

662
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,820
With the state Wu Xie is in,

663
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,550
it is troublesome to climb over.

664
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,140
I'm fine.

665
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,590
Look at these rocks

666
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:39,500
with neatly-cut sections.

667
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,020
It is obviously carved by someone.

668
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,850
There must be a path behind it

669
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,550
which is blocked by this pile of rocks.

670
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:46,530
It is too dangerous to
climb over from here.

671
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,320
It is actually simple.

672
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,850
We can just blow it up.

673
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,480
An explosion might cause landslide.

674
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,950
Isn't that even more dangerous?

675
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,170
It is unlikely.

676
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,650
This type of mountain
is relatively stable.

677
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:58,310
