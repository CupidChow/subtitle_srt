1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,860
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,850
<i>Episode 8</i>

4
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,770
Pick a leaf as a cover.

5
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,180
Give me a hand, Fatty.

6
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,610
I'm having skin irritation.

7
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,210
Don't just stand there.

8
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,730
-Are you feeling itchy?
-I really am.

9
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,910
It's getting worse.

10
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,450
My backside is itchy, too.

11
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,730
Should I be taking a bath now?

12
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,750
Enough of scratching.

13
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,840
I feel myself
is getting itchy by your action.

14
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,280
But I can't help it.

15
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,570
Step aside.

16
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,300
Oh my.

17
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,490
Watch out.

18
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,060
We need to get rid of the bugs.

19
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,880
It could take at least two to
three hundreds of levels to reach the top.

20
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,650
If you lack stamina,

21
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,710
you can forget about coming here.

22
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,490
I need a break.

23
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,090
Eat some snacks.

24
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,210
It'll give you some energy.

25
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,210
Forget it.

26
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,600
You have to be careful about what you say.

27
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,329
Touch wood.

28
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,210
I'm not superstitious.

29
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,890
I only believe in myself.

30
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,770
You're an interesting person.

31
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,860
I don't owe you anything

32
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,170
for surviving until now.

33
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,850
You still deserve a treat from me

34
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,950
for being a competent guide.

35
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,820
You're giving me a treat?

36
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Forget it.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,120
Is it the best you can do?

38
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,260
Thanks,

39
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,450
but no thanks.

40
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,750
Fine.

41
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,310
When we get home,

42
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,270
I'll set up for you
a food production company

43
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,870
that specialises in portable food...

44
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,770
Don't ever talk about returning home now.

45
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,330
It usually means we're not far from death

46
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,130
if we say that.

47
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,060
Aren't you not superstitious?

48
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,090
Why,

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,279
you're scared now?

50
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,730
I'm much more experienced than you.

51
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,100
Nothing is taboo for me.

52
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,850
You're still wet behind the ears.

53
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,440
Be careful what you say.

54
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,300
We haven't come across any problems.

55
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,530
Something's not right.

56
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,440
Bad things could have easily happened

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,200
as we're only halfway up to the top,

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,440
knowing the tricky Heavenly Queen Mother.

59
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,080
The steps here aren't the same as before.

60
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,700
We'd better be careful.

61
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,070
That could mean

62
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,210
every next step may be dangerous.

63
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,710
Let it be.

64
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,420
We should take things as they come.

65
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,420
Let me go first.

66
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,550
That soon?

67
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,320
Run!

68
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,080
There aren't any bugs here.

69
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,180
The rain won't stop anytime soon.

70
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,510
We'll take cover here.

71
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,770
Earlier, that tree were gnawed
by the bugs.

72
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,010
It was pretty bad.

73
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,530
The bugs sure know
how to find their targets.

74
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,450
-Still feeling itchy?
-Yes.

75
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,680
Zhang.

76
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,340
Where to?

77
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,260
Looking for herbs.

78
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,380
Ah Ning.

79
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,200
Do you think

80
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,530
the bug is poisonous?

81
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,090
You.

82
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,130
Take off your pants.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,040
What do you want to do?

84
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,250
What do you want to do to him?

85
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,000
Wu Xie is still a kid.

86
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,680
The bug is a kind of tick.

87
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,350
You'll suffer if you get bitten by it.

88
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,720
Looks like you two

89
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,570
are in a worse state than me.

90
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,400
Now it's not the time to be shy.

91
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,870
Take off your pants now

92
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,310
if you don't want
to sleep on your stomach.

93
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,810
It'll be too late

94
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,570
if you let it get into your crotch.

95
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,580
I'll handle it myself.

96
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,420
Let us help each other.

97
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,090
Just keep running if you're a man.

98
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,530
Dare to compete with me?

99
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,690
-In what?
-A race to the top.

100
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,250
The loser...

101
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
What happens to the loser?

102
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,430
It doesn't matter.

103
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,610
We should go for a win-win situation.

104
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,130
Faster!

105
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,490
Help me.

106
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,730
The itchiness is making me crazy.

107
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,740
-What the hell!
-Not so loud.

108
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,070
It's unbelievable.
There're just so many of them.

109
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,760
I ripped my pants at the crotch

110
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,370
while on the journey.

111
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,090
It felt nice and airy at first.

112
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,410
I forgot all about it after.

113
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,890
Enough of talking.
Help me get rid of them.

114
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,370
There are more on my rear than my back.

115
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,930
The bugs will keep on sucking the blood.

116
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,850
They'll increase several time in size

117
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,650
after the blood sucking
for two or three days.

118
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,230
-I'll begin now.
-Wait.

119
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,350
You know the right way to do it?

120
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,490
I just dig them out, right?

121
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,010
No.

122
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,250
I could have ended up worse

123
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,690
if not for me asking you first.

124
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,770
Use this.

125
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,970
Heat up the dagger.

126
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,190
Then use it to burn the bugs.

127
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,250
Never pull them out forcefully.

128
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,210
If their heads are left inside the flesh,

129
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,490
I'll get infected.

130
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,430
Do it now.

131
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,570
Bear with me.

132
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,170
It's done, Fatty.

133
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,870
It's now my turn.

134
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,470
Wu Xie, you've changed.

135
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,690
You're no longer gentle with
me like you used to.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,930
I was helping you while
enduring my suffering.

137
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,140
Can't you just give me a break?

138
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,210
Fine. Lift up your clothes.

139
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,530
Take off you pants.

140
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,290
Wu Xie.

141
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,620
The bugs on your body

142
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,850
don't look good

143
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,850
and seem to be malnourished.

144
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,650
Let them feed on you for a little while.

145
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,330
Cut the crap, you silly...

146
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,410
Master Hua'er.

147
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,860
I owe you my life.

148
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,650
I shall give you a discount next time.

149
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,010
No need for that.

150
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,250
You saved me, too.

151
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,110
So stop with the nonsense.

152
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,980
It's too steep.

153
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,410
We can't get down from here.

154
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
We're trapped.

155
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,570
There must be another way out.

156
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,210
Perhaps we could restore these steps.

157
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,940
Otherwise, Wu San Xing couldn't have
gotten to that side.

158
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,080
You're right.

159
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,670
There must be a way.

160
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,530
Easy.

161
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,730
Easy.

162
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,450
Master Xiao San.

163
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,620
How did it go?

164
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,080
We're just fine.

165
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,860
We're still in one piece.

166
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,880
Yes.

167
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,900
What about you guys?

168
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,900
We're fine, too.

169
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,850
It could have been worse.

170
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,910
The ticks can distinguish
a person's blood type.

171
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,090
Looks like

172
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,330
they preferred you two.

173
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,170
I really envy Zhang.

174
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,460
He's invulnerable to bugs.

175
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,180
Even Corpse Bugs are afraid of him,

176
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,290
what more to say ticks.

177
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,550
Zhang may be well known
as the silent and boring one,

178
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,460
but he can be truly caring
during crucial moments.

179
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,820
We should be more alert.

180
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,380
Never underestimate the ticks.

181
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,490
I saw with my own eyes

182
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
that a giraffe was killed by the ticks

183
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,930
while I was working
on a project in Africa.

184
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,370
Its body was full of blood tumours.

185
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,530
It was horrible.

186
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,710
What scary creatures.

187
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:49,170
So the ticks actually come from Africa.

188
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,950
Then they must be faster
than the Birdman.

189
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,230
The rain has stopped.

190
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,000
Let's spend the night here.

191
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,230
Master Xiao San.

192
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,450
I wouldn’t imagine

193
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,530
there's such a big
rainforest in the desert

194
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,050
if not for me seeing with my own eyes.

195
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,620
The entire desert is a great basin.

196
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,880
Here's the lowest point of the basin.

197
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,610
Both the rain water

198
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,210
and underground water converge here,

199
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,480
nourishing the rainforest.

200
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,100
Therefore, many plants are able to grow

201
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,460
in the surrounding mountain belt.

202
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,400
This kind of sight

203
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,560
is what ancients said about stillness

204
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,290
by keeping the wind
and converging the waters.

205
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,250
This is commonly known
as having a good feng shui.

206
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,620
What a place with good feng shui.

207
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,520
The Heavenly Queen Mother
certainly knows a thing or two about this.

208
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,120
What's Wu San Xing up to?

209
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,730
He isn't giving us a clue
when we need it the most.

210
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,940
Just calm down.

211
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,250
Again,

212
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,490
we should take things as they come.

213
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,180
We've done everything we could for now.

214
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,090
Let's take a short break.

215
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,670
By the way,

216
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,010
it's quite a scenery

217
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,650
looking down from here.

218
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,620
Where's Zhang?

219
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,410
He's missing again?

220
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,560
No.

221
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,300
He's over there.

222
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,060
His habit of leaving
without telling anyone

223
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,960
tends to make us worried.

224
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,510
He's such a person.

225
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,860
He lives in his own world.

226
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,210
He doesn't find the
need to make things clear.

227
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,750
Continue your sleep.

228
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,010
I'll check on him.

229
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,170
Zhang.

230
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,820
What are you doing?

231
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,740
You discovered something?

232
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,050
What's this?

233
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:36,970
It really stinks.

234
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,130
Snake.

235
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,870
What a huge snake.

236
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,080
Dead a long time.

237
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,089
Watch out, ticks!

238
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,010
Wu Xie.

239
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,660
Thinking of something?

240
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,970
There are no alternative
paths within the entire palace.

241
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,090
We came here from the same single path.

242
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,730
It was a long but smooth path.

243
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,250
Moreover,

244
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,050
there's nothing else here,

245
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,410
except for numerous traps.

246
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,920
It's certainly abnormal.

247
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,930
People have yearned for

248
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,050
the Heavenly Queen Mother's elixir.

249
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,650
She won't just allow

250
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,700
anyone to come inside easily.

251
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,370
Have you ever caught a
sparrow when you were a kid?

252
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,610
You use a little stick to
prop up a woven basket

253
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,500
and put some rice as bait underneath it.

254
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,570
The sparrows will get trapped

255
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,050
if they take the bait.

256
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,970
This place is just like the woven basket

257
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,210
and we're the sparrows.

258
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,070
Exactly.

259
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,790
Everything is just smoke and mirrors here.

260
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,030
It's not the real palace.

261
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,380
It won't be easy to uncover

262
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,730
the secret of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

263
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,940
First, we need to get out of here.

264
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,080
This place is barren.

265
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,090
There's nothing here.

266
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,890
The Heavenly Queen Mother
wants us to die of starvation here.

267
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,490
Get up quick and find the way out of here.

268
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,620
It's not that I want to sit here.

269
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,270
I'm

270
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,450
actually sitting on something.

271
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,460
It could be a trap.

272
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

273
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,780
You were sleeping soundly.

274
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,020
I didn't want to wake you up.

275
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,700
Should I thank you for that?

276
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
You're welcome, Master Hua'er.

277
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,970
But I'm getting up as soon as

278
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,250
you're ready.

279
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,410
It's kerosene.

280
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,700
First, our bridges were burned.
Now we're seeing the oil dripping.

281
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,080
There should be fire next.

282
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,620
There's no cover for us.

283
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,950
We'll be dead if we jump down from here.

284
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,840
We'll go to the back.

285
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,410
Zhang.

286
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,830
Your blood is awesome.

287
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,010
It repels poison.

288
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,110
The ticks are all gone

289
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,190
in just a blink of eyes.

290
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,370
Wu Xie.

291
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,940
I think you were
frightened by these ticks.

292
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,940
I heard you screaming.

293
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,220
There's nothing here.

294
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,300
You missed the scene earlier.

295
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,590
A huge number of ticks
suddenly appeared from nowhere.

296
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,080
You would have screamed too.

297
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,400
Stop giving excuses.

298
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,550
It was too deliberate.

299
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,890
This thing certainly stinks.

300
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,960
It's a mixture of the smell
of a decomposed body

301
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,550
and the reek of the ticks.

302
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,630
Looks like

303
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:31,330
the ticks had totally sucked
the blood out of the snake.

304
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,770
You found this from the snake's womb?

305
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,510
It looks like

306
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,920
something from the 80's or 90's.

307
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,930
Fatty.

308
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,170
Who do you think would
use such big torch light?

309
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,830
Zhang.

310
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,020
Now I got it.

311
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,930
The ticks killed the snake.

312
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,660
And the snake ate a human.

313
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,810
This thing

314
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,690
is a woman's bone.

315
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,810
Tamutuo isn't a tourist spot.

316
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,930
Either the person was an archaeologist

317
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,020
or an explorer

318
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,460
for being well-equipped.

319
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,480
There's another possibility.

320
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,420
And the worst, too.

321
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,460
This person worked for Chen Wen Jin.

322
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,100
That's easy.

323
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,650
We'll know who the person is

324
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,250
if we dig out everything
from the snake's womb.

325
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,930
Master Xiao San.

326
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,240
It's just a snake.

327
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,620
You take a rest here.

328
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,100
I'll let you know if there's anything.

329
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,480
Be careful.

330
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,450
We'll be fine.

331
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,210
Run!

332
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,250
It's the end of the path.

333
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,390
Let's jump.

334
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,300
Are you crazy?

335
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,250
It's our only hope now.

336
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,550
Doesn't it look like
Ah Ning's company logo?

337
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,910
Impossible.

338
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,100
Nobody from my company

339
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,580
has ever been here before.

340
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,440
Haven't we agreed
to share information, Ah Ning?

341
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,750
What's there to hide from us?

342
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,550
My company starting making

343
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,970
these metal nameplates since 1997

344
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,350
in order for us to be identified

345
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,860
if anything untoward should happen.

346
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,260
No metal nameplate is found on this body.

347
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,330
I've checked through all the
company's project data prior to 1997.

348
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,530
Nobody has ever stepped foot on Tamutuo.

349
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,930
Then how do you explain this belt buckle?

350
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,290
You lied through your teeth.

351
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,980
-Are you up to something again?
-Fatty.

352
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,590
It's weird.

353
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,830
It's your body.

354
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:57,630
What?

355
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,000
<i>02200059</i>

356
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,280
Stop guessing.

357
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:18,370
These are Dangshi Copper Coins.

358
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,770
There're seven in total.

359
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,010
They are rare items.

360
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,920
You spent years of effort looking for
these. All you could find is just seven.

361
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,530
Who else possesses the ability and wealth

362
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,040
to be able to collect them?

363
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,530
The person even made a bracelet
that's exactly the same as yours.

364
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,890
This is simply impossible.

365
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,850
Wu Xie.

366
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,880
What happened?

367
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,890
I had a nightmare.

368
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,380
Where's Zhang?

369
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,450
He's still digging it?

370
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,330
He has something to show you.

371
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,780
Where's Ah Ning?

372
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,930
She's exhausted.

373
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,700
She's sleeping.

374
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,450
What are you staring at?

375
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:33,990
Nothing.

376
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,090
How is it going?

377
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,440
Any new discovery?

378
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,490
Why is there a grenade?

379
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,770
It's a military item.

380
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,930
It's impossible for those working for
Cox Hendry to have this no matter what.

381
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,450
Nobody mentioned this
person works for Cox Hendry.

382
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,210
Earlier I had a dream.

383
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,510
I dreamed this person worked
for Cox Hendry.

384
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,720
Anyway,

385
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,360
the grenade can kill.

386
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,900
It isn't needed in archaeology.

387
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,810
Who'd be able to get this stuff?

388
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,070
I heard

389
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,820
there were illegal activities around here

390
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,600
many years ago.

391
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,120
Most of the criminals

392
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,720
were gotten rid of eventually.

393
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,350
The remnants were lost in the desert.

394
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,990
If that's the case,

395
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,000
this could be the body of a criminal.

396
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:40,970
What's this?

397
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,400
This is good stuff.

398
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,510
It still works.

399
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,770
It's simply amazing.

400
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,690
It's still in good condition
after so long.

401
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,860
Let me see.

402
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,290
Master Hua'er.

403
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,410
Keep still.

404
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,160
Don't ever fall down and lose your life.

405
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,890
Look who's talking.

406
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,900
Awesome.

407
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Master Hua'er.

408
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,200
Help me.

409
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,460
You're on your own.

410
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,370
Where's your mercy?

411
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,290
You're way much worse that Wu Xie.

412
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,080
Get down here, quick.

413
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,680
You're a kind person.

414
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,250
You actually wanted to save me.

415
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,420
I was just afraid that
you might hit my foot.

416
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,330
The rainforest is stuffy and
we could easily get tired.

417
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,130
Take a break if you guys need it.

418
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,340
I'll keep watch.

419
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,950
You're the man.

420
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,490
Wu Xie.

421
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,400
I'll go with you.

422
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,410
Okay.

423
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,660
The gun is more valuable than men.

424
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,880
It still works after staying
in the snake’s womb

425
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,930
for so many years.

426
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,330
It's just simply amazing.

427
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,440
Pan Zi.

428
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,570
You should have experienced many battles

429
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,280
when you were a soldier before, right?

430
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,570
You should have seen
a lot back then, right?

431
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:22,100
That's a long time ago.

432
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,600
Nevertheless,

433
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,890
I was a war veteran

434
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,690
and I always survived.

435
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,670
Master Xiao San.

436
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,040
Don't worry.

437
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,240
I'm tough enough.

438
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,680
I'll keep you safe

439
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,090
so long as I'm with you.

440
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,530
Hold still.

441
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,810
Stay silent.

442
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,440
Stare at its eyes.

443
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
The snake is still on the tree.

444
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,210
It isn't safe.

445
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,160
Go get Fatty.

446
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,140
We must leave now.

447
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,990
Run for your lives!

448
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,040
Master Xiao San!

449
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,250
Watch out for it!

450
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,790
Watch out!

451
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:07,810
Get away from there!

452
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,210
Watch out!

453
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,890
Nice move.

454
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,010
Zhang!

455
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,600
-Zhang.
-Leave now.

456
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,960
It didn't come after us.

457
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,130
Wu Xie.

458
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,130
Are you all right?

459
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,159
I'm fine.

460
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,010
But Zhang lost his sword.

461
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,770
That Black Gold Sword of his is priceless.

462
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,409
It was the snake's fault.

463
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,600
I'll kill it and use it for soup

464
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,560
if I ever see it again.

465
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,120
Stop bragging.

466
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,770
We would have escaped in time
if not for your oversleeping.

467
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,110
He wouldn't have lost the knife.

468
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,570
Let's be clear.

469
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,389
Zhang lost his sword in order to save you.

470
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:44,810
Zhang.

471
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,040
I'll keep the sheath for you

472
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,480
since the sword is lost.

473
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,290
That belongs to him.

474
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,370
I'm just keeping it for him.

475
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:52,570
It may be valuable, too.

476
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,260
Greedy pig.

477
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,170
I'm going to slay you!

478
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,490
Don't risk it. Run!

479
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,090
You won't be so lucky next time!

480
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,240
There's nowhere else to run.

481
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,060
There's a cave.

482
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,050
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

483
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,450
Quick, Fatty.

484
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,940
I'm stuck.

485
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,980
Give me your hand.

486
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,790
Fatty.

487
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,420
Take a breath.

488
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,850
You're my hero.

489
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,310
You should lose some weight.

490
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,740
I think

491
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,650
we're safe for now.

492
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,390
Did the giant python leave?

493
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,430
Listen.

494
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,340
What's that?

495
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,240
It's a tiger keelback.

496
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,760
Zhang.

497
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,730
Is the snake following us?

498
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:49,670
We're safe.

499
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,130
We almost became one of the dead.

500
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,940
Didn't the Heavenly Queen Mother
prepare these skeletons as our cushions?

501
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,570
She would never have guessed
that these skeletons would be here.

502
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,130
Lady Luck is on our side this time.

503
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,530
You're right.

504
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,770
The area here is kind of wet.

505
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,500
There should be an oasis ahead
after going through this passage.

506
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,250
It's very likely.

507
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,980
Look at the snake patterns
on these stone pillars.

508
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,000
Legend has it that the snakes are
the Heavenly Queen Mother's best pals.

509
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,830
They like to hang around wet places.

510
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,060
We should find

511
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,910
the Palace of the Heavenly
Queen Mother beyond this passage.

512
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:36,170
The main hall where we came
from was just smoke and mirrors.

513
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,240
The people in the desert
live by water and grass.

514
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,090
I'll also build the palace

515
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,990
in an oasis if it were me.

516
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,320
Let us proceed ahead.

517
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,110
Keep an eye for any signs
Wu San Xing might have left.

518
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,880
Zhang.

519
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,930
The tiger keelback
won't be coming for us, right?

520
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,620
It won't.

521
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,570
It's the most poisonous among the snakes.

522
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,330
It has a high territorial awareness.

523
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,940
The giant python was scared away

524
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,140
by the tiger keelback

525
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,070
when it intruded into its territory.

526
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,150
The tiger keelback is terribly awesome.

527
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,960
Usually it won't attack humans.

528
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,610
It was alarmed

529
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:29,970
when you made too much movement.

530
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,560
Luckily it wasn't provoked.

531
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,720
or else we could be dead by now.

532
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,860
What you've said actually makes sense.

533
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,360
I would have yelled

534
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,490
if I knew the tiger keelback was there.

535
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,260
It scared away the giant python.

536
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,260
Since you said that,

537
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,090
you should actually thank me instead.

538
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:50,010
Hey, Fatty.

539
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,390
You should just lose some weight.

540
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,410
Your condition doesn't help in an escape.

541
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,810
I got it.

542
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:57,310
I'll get down to it once we're home.

543
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,520
The giant python fears the tiger keelback.

544
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,080
It shouldn't be coming for us.

545
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,410
It's safe here.

546
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,350
Let's find a place to rest.

547
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,090
Rainforest.

548
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,510
It's a rainforest in the desert

549
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,990
to be exact.

550
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,310
This place is more like a
snake den than an oasis.

551
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,690
That means we aren't far from Wu San Xing.

552
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,370
Let's go.

553
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:50,404
