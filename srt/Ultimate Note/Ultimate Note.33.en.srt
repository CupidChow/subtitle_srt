1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,950
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,580
<i>Episode 33</i>

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,640
Zhang.

5
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,079
Shall we take a break

6
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,579
and study the map?

7
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,140
Let's take a break here.

8
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,630
We'll leave after 30 minutes.

9
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,870
Stay away from the rock face.

10
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,960
Watch out for Mi Luo Tuo.

11
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,079
Okay.

12
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,190
This way.

13
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
I need to answer nature's call.

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Toilet?

15
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,170
Made by nature.

16
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,820
Help!

17
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,040
Mi Luo Tuo!

18
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,050
No!

19
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,930
You'll get killed.

20
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,670
There are some here.

21
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,060
Hurry! Spray alkali!

22
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,600
There are too many of them.

23
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,720
It won't work.

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Over there.

25
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,670
Let's go.

26
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,070
Hurry up.

27
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,730
The equipment.

28
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,540
Zhang!

29
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,160
Zhang!

30
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,450
Great partner!

31
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,320
Let's go.

32
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,260
It's finally knocked down.

33
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,530
We can go through now.

34
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,900
It's so narrow. How?

35
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,530
Crawl through it.

36
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,620
I can't dig anymore.

37
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,830
I'm exhausted.

38
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,710
I want to take a break.

39
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,130
You continue.

40
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,090
I'll give you three goats.

41
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,270
Five.

42
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,790
Four and not more than that.

43
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,000
I can fit inside anyway.

44
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,740
Okay, deal.

45
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,480
Hi, old friends.

46
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:46,900
Clay pots.

47
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,480
And hair.

48
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,570
The tunnel is quite long.

49
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,060
Search carefully.

50
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,390
There are bamboo slips in the pits.

51
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,470
This is a cultural corridor.

52
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,490
The ancient texts Jin Wan Tang translated

53
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,710
should be from here.

54
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,040
That means

55
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,170
there's nothing valuable here.

56
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,060
It's not valuable to them.

57
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,700
How did

58
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,880
the Mystic Nine get through?

59
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,520
Look.

60
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,950
I see no broken pots.

61
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,320
They couldn't have flown.

62
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,980
This is nothing but a piece of cake
to them.

63
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,850
Which of us goes first?

64
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,880
I'll go first.

65
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,790
I'll check out the situation for you.

66
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,760
You want no reward?

67
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,159
There are so many pots.

68
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,050
If I come back alive,

69
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,100
I'll owe you nothing.

70
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,610
But if I don't...

71
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,200
It's no use if I gave you
however many goats.

72
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,040
You won't be able to pay me back
what you owe me for now.

73
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,490
Besides,

74
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,380
look at your ugly face.

75
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,700
The King of Hell won't take you.

76
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,020
Right.

77
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,140
He'll definitely take

78
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,700
a delicate man like you.

79
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,840
So let me go first.

80
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
Just listen to Mr Black.

81
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,310
The pots here are very similar to Tamutuo.

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,090
There might be corpse bugs inside.

83
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,470
Let's do it together.

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
We can't perish together.

85
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,300
The tunnel is not that long.

86
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,350
You can come over easily.

87
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,620
Easy my foot.

88
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,130
Master Xiao San, offer me a price.

89
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,130
I'll pick you up.

90
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,120
Okay.

91
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,840
Xiao Hua said

92
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,330
the Xies and the Huos
will cover all the expenses.

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,720
You can ask him for money.

94
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,640
Wait. There's something here.

95
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,080
What is it?

96
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,790
You only talk if we pay?

97
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,490
Shades.

98
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Mr Black!

99
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,130
This is not funny, okay?

100
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,520
Mr Black!

101
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,770
Wu Xie, I'll go check it out.

102
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,230
It's the end of it.

103
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,880
Did you see him?

104
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,360
No.

105
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,520
Where is he?

106
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,740
Is there anything in there?

107
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,180
There is a thing here

108
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,560
which is made of iron.

109
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,180
I don't know how to describe it.

110
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,309
What do you mean by that?

111
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,520
Is it big or small?

112
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,169
Long? Short? Round? Thick?

113
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,480
It's a huge iron plate.

114
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,450
Like a cymbal.

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,350
It's spinning on its own.

116
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,860
Xiao Hua.

117
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320
Come out.

118
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,670
Take me in there.

119
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,480
Let's find Mr Black first.

120
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,550
Wait.

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,520
What's wrong?

122
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,310
Xiao Hua!

123
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,570
Xiao Hua!

124
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,530
Talk to me. Don't scare me, okay?

125
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,920
Xiao Hua!

126
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,740
Xiao Hua!

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,540
Why aren't you saying anything?

128
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,430
Don't scare me.

129
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,000
Something happened
to Mr Xie and Mr Black.

130
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,030
Get help!

131
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,070
Got it, Master Xiao San.

132
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,070
I'll do it now.

133
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,110
Go get help.

134
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,430
Fatty.

135
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,770
It's a dead end.

136
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,720
It's a wall.

137
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,190
Zhang.

138
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,320
Give me the map.

139
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:43,480
<i>Secondary Peak of Mount Yang Jiao</i>

140
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,170
Lao Gao,

141
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,310
is your map accurate?

142
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:48,910
You can count on it.

143
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,050
There is a passage opposite the cliff.

144
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,900
Maybe it's behind the wall.

145
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,710
Since you said so,

146
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,660
lead the way.

147
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,100
I...

148
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,510
Xiao Hua!

149
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,770
Xiao Hua!

150
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,150
He...

151
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,830
Hello.

152
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,750
Can you move?

153
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
Can you talk?

154
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,890
If you can't,

155
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,910
I... I'll go over first.

156
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,340
Let's have a deal.

157
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,030
No one will hurt anyone.

158
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:36,990
Period.

159
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,970
Didn't we have a deal?

160
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,840
Good for nothing!

161
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,410
Mr Fatty.

162
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
I've just discussed with them.

163
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,950
No one dares to go.

164
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,630
As expected.

165
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,970
How about this?

166
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,350
Each team sends one person.

167
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,580
It's fair and reasonable.

168
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,400
Xiu Xiu.

169
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,360
We're a family.

170
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,580
So we're a team.

171
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,350
Who was suspicious of us just now?

172
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,490
Yet, that person wants
to be part of our team now.

173
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,220
I can let you join us,

174
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,840
but on one condition.

175
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,840
Change your surname to Huo

176
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,810
and listen to me.

177
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,470
I, Fatty Huo,

178
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,950
am at your command.

179
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,610
Good. Then you represent our team.

180
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,640
Well...

181
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,520
I...

182
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,870
Mr Fatty.

183
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,270
Let's go.

184
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,270
If you don't do it,

185
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,810
we'll feel insecure.

186
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,860
Are your ropes strong enough?

187
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,860
You can count on it.

188
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,740
Look.

189
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,110
It's non-flammable.

190
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,650
Alright.

191
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,020
It'll be embarrassing if it catches fire.

192
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,190
Take it.

193
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,140
It's a waste of my talent.

194
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,580
Take it.

195
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,430
Give it back to me.

196
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,500
It's dangerous.

197
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,920
Zhang,

198
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,170
what do you recall?

199
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,130
Then what should I do?

200
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:18,310
You go.

201
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,790
Be careful.

202
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,580
Be safe.

203
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,140
Xiao Hua!

204
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,370
There's no exit.

205
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,150
Where are they?

206
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,670
This should be the iron plate
Xiao Hua mentioned.

207
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,600
Knock twice if it's you.

208
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,780
Xiao Hua!

209
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,510
Shades!

210
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,800
Xiao Hua!

211
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,230
Shades!

212
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,520
Is that you?

213
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,410
Watch out.

214
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,320
We're at the middle of the bridge.

215
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,700
Be careful.

216
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't get me killed

217
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,730
Okay, Mr Fatty.

218
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,650
It's so high up here.

219
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:56,390
What's the situation over there?

220
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,250
A stone gate?

221
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,300
There's a stone gate!

222
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,840
Xiao Hua.

223
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:46,750
Shades.

224
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,210
Are you guys down there?

225
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Xiao Hua.

226
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,700
Xiao Hua.

227
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,800
Shades.

228
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,520
Are you down there?

229
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,570
Xiao Hua.

230
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,990
Shades.

231
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,040
Xiao...

232
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,540
Xiao...

233
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,830
Xiao...

234
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,830
Come, bite it.

235
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,770
Xiao Hua?

236
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,110
We're going up.

237
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,980
It's alright.

238
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,330
Do you have nothing better to do?

239
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,010
Why do you want to touch it?

240
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,790
The knocker clearly screams,

241
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:40,910
"Trap!"

242
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,630
You'll get yourself killed if you lift it.

243
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,100
What's the uneven texture?

244
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,830
It's a relief.

245
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,400
But it's too badly damaged

246
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,940
to tell what it is about.

247
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,390
Run!

248
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,590
Oh no, there's a mechanism!

249
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,640
Mr Fatty.

250
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,820
There's nowhere to run.

251
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,280
We can't wait for death here.

252
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,540
I know!

253
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,000
Don't move!

254
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,750
Mi Luo Tuo?

255
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,350
Help, Mr Fatty!

256
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,520
Jack!

257
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,020
-Come over!
-Pull the rope!

258
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,070
Buckle it.

259
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,030
Jump!

260
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,670
Boss, Mi Luo Tuos are out.

261
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,110
The heat draws them here.

262
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,340
We can't let them come out.

263
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,160
Hurry, spray alkali.

264
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,300
Mr Fatty,

265
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,550
do something.

266
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,060
Hold on tightly to the rope.

267
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,750
It's on fire.

268
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,600
Didn't Lao Gao say we can count on it?

269
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,770
Nice leg.

270
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,750
Let go of me.

271
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,930
Are you... Are you sure?

272
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,490
It hurts.

273
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,630
I nearly died.

274
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,930
I told you

275
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,260
to be careful.

276
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,880
Zhang,

277
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,140
stop making sarcastic remarks.

278
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,980
You were unwilling to go just now.

279
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,340
So what should we do?

280
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,640
We're stuck here.

281
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,960
There's a cave over there.

282
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,720
Miss, there's not much alkali left.

283
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,910
Use sparingly.

284
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,170
Hold on a little longer.

285
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,560
Have you found a way out?

286
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,790
No, miss.

287
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,160
What about you?

288
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,180
No.

289
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,310
Why are you so badly hurt?

290
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,290
There's a tricky thing

291
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,470
under the iron plate.

292
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,620
I went in

293
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,440
and found that the lid was open.

294
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,250
So I went down to have a look.

295
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,400
<i>There is a hidden space
below the iron plate.</i>

296
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,820
<i>Shades is probably in there.</i>

297
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,390
So I went to find him.

298
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,910
Surprisingly,

299
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,950
I lost my voice

300
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,090
before I could tell you.

301
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,980
I could only go up

302
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,280
and close the lid.

303
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,550
So you mean Shades is trapped inside?

304
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,340
Don't worry, Wu Xie.

305
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,320
He is fine.

306
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,410
<i>Find me</i>

307
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,030
He asked us to find him.

308
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,070
The other side.

309
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,270
<i>Don't</i>

310
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,010
"Don't..."

311
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,800
"Don't find me."

312
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,810
Even so,

313
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,710
we still have to find him.

314
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,880
Wu Xie.

315
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,380
If I can handle the situation down there,

316
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,740
so can he.

317
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,720
But if he's in trouble,

318
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,770
we won't be of any help.

319
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,130
since we're in a bad shape ourselves.

320
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,480
Okay.

321
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,980
What about these things?

322
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,460
What is it?

323
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,200
Why were they stuck on you?

324
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,330
It's hyphae.

325
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,130
<i>I probably got them stuck on me</i>

326
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,150
<i>when I went over.</i>

327
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,030
These things are weird.

328
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,390
They get very active

329
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,550
around blood

330
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,560
and even wrapped my whole body up.

331
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,750
Then I found this iron suit

332
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,900
with Shades' name engraved on it.

333
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,750
I was thinking of

334
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,350
putting it on and going out.

335
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,150
Just then, you walked in.

336
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,440
Thanks to you.

337
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,560
You almost

338
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,280
scared me out of my wits looking like that.

339
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,430
You're blaming me?

340
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,490
I was so tired.

341
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,120
But you didn't understand any of my code.

342
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,330
I wasted so much of my blood.

343
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,430
Who knew it was you.

344
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,170
Didn't I give you the secret code?

345
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,760
Well, you could have knocked

346
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,320
the beat of "The Deep Night".

347
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,610
I'd know immediately.

348
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,150
By the way, Wu Xie,

349
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,840
the air blow the iron plate is hazardous.

350
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,000
One can't stay there for long.

351
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,010
We need to get the guys

352
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,590
to bring us a ventilator.

353
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,720
Zhang.

354
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,990
What now?

355
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,980
Climb over.

356
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,230
Fine, I'll do that.

357
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,290
Miss, they're coming out.

358
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,830
Look!

359
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,820
Over there.

360
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,910
Great.

361
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,940
They're still alive.

362
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,000
Hurry!

363
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,090
Go find them.

364
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,310
Miss, you guys go. I'll cover you.

365
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:39,870
Be careful.

366
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,190
Hurry.

367
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:57,930
Huo Qi!

368
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,830
Miss, quickly go!

369
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,670
Miss.

370
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,830
You'll get yourself killed.

371
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,300
That guy would've died for nothing.

372
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,990
Let's go. Hurry up.

373
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,139
Come on.

374
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,000
Fatty.

375
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,840
Zhang.

376
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,810
Let's go over.

377
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,580
You. Go check out the situation ahead.

378
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:47,530
Okay.

379
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:51,730
Mr Fatty.

380
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,070
Keep smiling.

381
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,500
You still have the nerve to smile!

382
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,050
What stupid map is that?

383
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,370
You almost got us killed.

384
00:34:59,090 --> 00:34:59,890
No.

385
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,720
We've been following the map.

386
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,720
Everything was fine.

387
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,820
Let me have a look.

388
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,250
It's correct.

389
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,250
You see.

390
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,040
There's a passage on the cliff.

391
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,640
Three dimensional.

392
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,620
The map is two dimensional.

393
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,550
But this place is not.

394
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,040
Lao Gao.

395
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,740
What lousy machine did you use?

396
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,290
The map only shows the cross section

397
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,290
of the mountain.

398
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,700
We don't know
the longitudinal section of it.

399
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,910
This place is not located behind the door

400
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,640
on the other side of the bridge.

401
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,950
It's right under it.

402
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,410
You said we can count on this and that.

403
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,210
If we had really listened to you,

404
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,010
we'd have died many times already.

405
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,160
Now count on what?

406
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,430
Mr Fatty,

407
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,070
have you found anything
on the other side of the bridge?

408
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,830
I saw the mark Zhang left.

409
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,060
Does it mean it's dangerous?

410
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,470
No, not at all.

411
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,430
Last time I saw it,

412
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,180
I almost died.

413
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,780
Zhang.

414
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,610
Do you remember this place?

415
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,160
Awesome.

416
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,510
Mr Fatty.

417
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,560
What's this?

418
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,170
I've never seen it before.

419
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,100
A square inside a circle.

420
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,550
That I've seen before.

421
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,930
It's an ancient copper coin.

422
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,680
But what is a circle inside a square?

423
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,620
A geometry problem?

424
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,730
We need to calculate the area?

425
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,620
Maybe it's a symbol.

426
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,940
The location specified on it
should be in three dimension.

427
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,960
Then the circle...

428
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,560
It's a spiral shape.

429
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,320
Where is my brother?

430
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,390
Your brother fell off.

431
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,170
You were tasked to take care of them.

432
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:02,370
Why didn't you save him?

433
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,910
What made you think I didn't?

434
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,910
If it wasn't for Zhang, I would've died.

435
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,400
And I told them to be careful.

436
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,280
Besides,

437
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,880
if you care about him so much,

438
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,470
why didn't you jump down back then?

439
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,610
-You...
-Huo San, it was an accident.

440
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,690
No one wanted it to happen.

441
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,100
Boss.

442
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,690
There's a spiral staircase ahead.

443
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:34,330
The circle really represents
a spiral thing.

444
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:35,470
Zhang,

445
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,740
you're impressive

446
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,990
We'll be able to find

447
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,770
the square down the stairs.

448
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,120
Maybe it's a chamber.

449
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,080
Let's go.

450
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,270
Let's go down and see.

451
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,010
Let's go.

452
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,380
Come.

453
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,770
I'll pick it out for you.

454
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,120
Look away.

455
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,270
I had mushrooms growing on me
in the rainforest.

456
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,630
Do you think I'm scared of this?

457
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,020
Wait.

458
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,770
Will it hurt?

459
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,830
Have you started?

460
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,220
-You'd better be...
-How much do you owe Xin Yue Restaurant?

461
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,220
I owe...

462
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,850
I finally know why Mrs Huo

463
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,370
asked me to bring you along.

464
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,960
Why?

465
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,650
Because your blood is special.

466
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,920
The hyphae on the pots

467
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,760
didn't take root

468
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,180
and grow inside you.

469
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,470
Instead, they're coming out.

470
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,750
They are scared of your blood.

471
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,660
Maybe it's because
I have eaten Dragon's Blood.

472
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,060
But Zhang's blood is really special.

473
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,350
Even the corpse bugs dare not
get near him.

474
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,170
Your blood has similar power.

475
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,900
Mrs Huo has made a sound decision.

476
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,490
Zhang is assigned to the big team,

477
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,380
while you're with us.

478
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,930
Any other wounds?

479
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,870
I'll treat them.

480
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,840
Again?

481
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,980
Hurry.

482
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,190
There are a few left.

483
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,010
Gently, please.

484
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,850
I fear pain.

485
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:05,520
Zhang, look.

486
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,430
There is water here.

487
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,990
Mr Fatty,

488
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,230
I told you my map is accurate.

489
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,300
Smarty-pants.

490
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,790
It's so cold here.

491
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,710
What's that?

492
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,590
Stay still.

493
00:40:59,794 --> 00:41:09,794
