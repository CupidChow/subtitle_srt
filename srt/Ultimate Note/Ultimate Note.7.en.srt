1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,840
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,620
<i>Episode 7</i>

4
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,600
What are these?

5
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,840
Give me a lighter.

6
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,759
A lighter?

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
Kids shouldn't play with fire.

8
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,440
Give me a lighter.

9
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,759
That's right.

10
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,320
Fire removes magnetism.

11
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,670
Give me a moment.

12
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
Here.

13
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,639
I have something even better.

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,840
It's the 20th century.
You're still using a torch?

15
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
You're so old-fashioned.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,120
This is conventional wisdom.

17
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,040
It will enlighten you.

18
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,320
Fatty's explosives.

19
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,120
Is it damp?

20
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,350
That looks very familiar.

21
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,140
Let's check it out.

22
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,900
Isn't that the Birdman?

23
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,640
That thing almost killed us back
in Cloud Top Palace.

24
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,160
Did it travel thousands of miles

25
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,839
all the way here from Mount Changbai?

26
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,240
It's haunting us.

27
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Birdman?

28
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Blue Bird?

29
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,290
They're both related to birds.

30
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,120
Is there a connection
between these two?

31
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,440
Are the Heavenly Queen Mother and the
ruler of Cloud Top Palace

32
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,520
connected somehow?

33
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,760
Besides the Heavenly Palace,

34
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,760
don't forget

35
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,120
Chen Wen Jin's notes.

36
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,320
She highlighted other
locations in her notes.

37
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,440
The other locations

38
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,840
are found on the Dragon Vein.

39
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,480
<i>Cloud Top Palace, Seven Star Palace,
Tian Guan Stupa</i>

40
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,330
Only Tamutuo is on its own.

41
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,560
<i>Qaidam Basin, Tamutuo</i>

42
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
Isn't everything highlighted
by Chen Wen Jin

43
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,960
related closely to

44
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,640
the Heavenly Queen Mother?

45
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,440
Birdman

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
is most likely a native here.

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,120
Every time the Heavenly Queen
Mother makes a new friend,

48
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,080
she'd give native products

49
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,680
as greeting gifts.

50
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,760
If that's the case,

51
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
we need to be careful.

52
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,160
This is a difficult opponent.

53
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Zhang.

54
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
What did you find?

55
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
There's an image.

56
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,130
Look.

57
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,310
This looks like the passageway.

58
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,400
The spots on both sides of the passageway

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,770
are probably the locations of the statues.

60
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,880
Yes.

61
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,130
Look. A human is carved on it.

62
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,280
This location

63
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,040
is where we are right now.

64
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,370
These people are trying
to cross the passageway.

65
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
Some are playing drums by the entrance.

66
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,320
It looks like the scene of a ritual.

67
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,290
Since the beginning of
Shang and Zhou dynasties,

68
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,160
ancients would cast words
on bronze instruments

69
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,360
to record messages.

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
A sculpture like this

71
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,280
probably has the same effect.

72
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,720
Statues of this form

73
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,140
can rarely be found now.

74
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,690
If the message is preserved,

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,110
it's very valuable.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
How much is it worth?

77
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,400
It is valuable,

78
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,810
but not in monetary terms.

79
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
There are no contraptions.

80
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,750
It's just a regular statue.

81
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,350
There's a hole on top, though.

82
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,080
I wonder what it's for.

83
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,830
The base, abdomen and both shoulders

84
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,920
of the statue

85
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,270
add up to four holes.

86
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,820
Pan Zi.

87
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,030
Do you think...

88
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,700
Pan Zi.

89
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,620
What are you thinking?

90
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,040
Are you

91
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,060
thinking about the holes?

92
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,980
I think

93
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,820
that the structure of
this statue is weird.

94
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,940
I can't seem to pinpoint.

95
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,500
We need to be extra careful.

96
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,860
Hey buddy,

97
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,659
since we're old friends,

98
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,100
do me a favour

99
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,500
and let us live.

100
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,140
It's too quiet.

101
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,100
Nothing's going on.

102
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,179
It is too quiet.

103
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,780
Think about it.

104
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
This is a rainforest.

105
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,190
There isn't even a chirp from a bird.

106
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
It's abnormal.

107
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,690
Well,

108
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,780
Wu Xie changed since
he became a mother.

109
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,060
He's extra sensitive.

110
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,410
Unfortunately,

111
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,800
your mushroom baby died.

112
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
How about this?

113
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,540
I'll scout ahead for Wu Xie.

114
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,660
If nothing happens, tag along.

115
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,750
I'll come with you.

116
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,360
This part is burnt.

117
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,610
Someone tried

118
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,700
the same method we did.

119
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,220
Forget the investigation.

120
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,260
It must be Master San.

121
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,220
These backpacks

122
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,980
belong to the unlucky crew mates.

123
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,220
I packed everything.

124
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
Let's go.

125
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
Watch out!

126
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,740
Boomerang!

127
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,360
You did it on purpose!

128
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,040
It's more important to
stay alive right now.

129
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,700
If light exists in this area,

130
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,060
it will refract on the zircon.

131
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,390
It would be too bright to open your eyes.

132
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,740
Do you need shades?

133
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,910
I'm a kind person.

134
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,880
I'll sell to you for 800 yuan.

135
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Forget it.

136
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,240
I knew you did it on purpose.

137
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,180
There are many ways to handle the stick.

138
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,580
This is called the Dog Beating Technique.

139
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,250
Putting this way,

140
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,860
it's offensive.

141
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,180
Dogs are great.

142
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,540
They are man's best friend.

143
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,700
You're experienced.

144
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,020
Figure a way to open the gate.

145
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
How is it going?

146
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,820
This

147
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
looks like a rat's femur.

148
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,480
Not bad, Pan Zi.

149
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,700
You even recognise this.

150
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,440
I have eaten them before.

151
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,420
You are great.

152
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,300
If you were stuck in that situation,

153
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,420
you'd have to eat it too.

154
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,020
Do you think there's a live Birdman

155
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,460
among the statues?

156
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,100
These bones

157
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,290
are their leftovers.

158
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,370
They are left by carnivores.

159
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,830
Don't worry.

160
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,390
If a beast shows up,

161
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,910
it would become our meal.

162
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,500
Let's call them over.

163
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,060
This place should be safe.

164
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Wu Xie!

165
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,980
Come on.

166
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
I'll handle it.

167
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,080
The carvings on this

168
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,120
are similar to the first statue.

169
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,860
It still shows a group of
people entering the passage.

170
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,700
If these carvings are meant
to record information,

171
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,910
it wouldn't be exactly the same.

172
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
This is weird.

173
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,590
This corpse is fresh.

174
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,270
Wild animals

175
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,720
will not kill its prey and
discard it without eating it.

176
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
I got it.

177
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,840
Think about it.

178
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,220
During the Queen Mother's time,

179
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,020
people couldn't raise livestock.

180
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,100
This location

181
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,660
is probably a hunting ground.

182
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,780
A place for the Heavenly Queen Mother
to hunt.

183
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,900
The Heavenly Queen Mother

184
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,020
probably acquired

185
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,980
a sophisticated hunting technology

186
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,460
that kills prey without damaging it.

187
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,500
For example, using sunlight,

188
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,380
air current,

189
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
vines,

190
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,860
or the statues.

191
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,620
My head hurts from
listening to your nonsense.

192
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,780
Headache is a common
postpartum symptom.

193
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Keep yourself warm.

194
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
It's dead.

195
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,250
It died just like that?

196
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,940
That's weird.

197
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,900
Look. I'd been telling you.

198
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,750
The Heavenly Queen Mother
can kill effortlessly.

199
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
I think

200
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,040
this place has a certain

201
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,360
influence on animals.

202
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,160
Animals are more sensitive.

203
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,370
Sometimes, humans may not
be able to perceive it,

204
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,340
but animals do.

205
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,980
Pan Zi.

206
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,040
Are you alright?

207
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,440
My head aches.

208
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,950
In the rainforest,

209
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,470
air pressure is already low.

210
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,970
The terrain is narrow.

211
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,220
After staying here for a long time,

212
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,460
men can't take it.

213
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,820
The rocks are falling down.

214
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,860
Fortunately,
the rocks on both sides are sturdy.

215
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,300
The entrance is sealed.

216
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,820
We need to get out of here.

217
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,520
Your hearing is pretty sharp.

218
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
You're almost as good as me.

219
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,930
Your eyesight is fine too.

220
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,790
The Heavenly Queen Mother was
no ordinary person.

221
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,660
Back there,

222
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,640
the room was filled with zircon.
It could have blinded us.

223
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,500
It looks mesmerising,

224
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,870
but it's deadly.

225
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,579
It's a work of art.

226
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,460
She didn't expect for

227
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,490
me, Mr Black to be ready.

228
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,740
I made no mistakes.

229
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,440
Are you alright?

230
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
Are you having a heatstroke?

231
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,060
Besides my headache,

232
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,610
I'm experiencing some heart discomfort.

233
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,320
Pan Zi, stay strong.

234
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,720
Zhang, Fatty.

235
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,750
Ignore the statues.
We need to leave now.

236
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,830
We can't go on.

237
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,560
Two people fell.

238
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,000
The rest of the group

239
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,380
arrived towards the centre.

240
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,780
This location

241
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,180
is exactly where we are now.

242
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,320
The poses of the drummers at the entrance

243
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,120
are different from the first statue.

244
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
Wu Xie.

245
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,300
These carvings are sequential.

246
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
That makes sense.

247
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,220
The differences in the first two carvings

248
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,340
are too subtle.

249
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
We couldn't tell.

250
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,940
However, this image

251
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,700
clearly shows the people
are a lot deeper in.

252
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Zhang is right.

253
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,120
We can't continue.

254
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,020
If not, like the people in the carvings,

255
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,160
we'd faint one by one.

256
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,640
We will not be able to escape alive.

257
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Here.

258
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,140
Look over here.

259
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,580
Doesn't this object

260
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,180
look like an altar?

261
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,260
An altar?

262
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,060
What are they sacrificing?

263
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,380
These people?

264
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,140
They are human sacrifices.

265
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,780
In ancient times,

266
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
this is very common.

267
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
If this is the case,

268
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,420
the path we're on right now

269
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
is a path of death.

270
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,020
I want to find out

271
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,470
how the people died.

272
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,300
Pan Zi was right.

273
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,880
There are certain things

274
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,740
animals respond more
intensely than humans.

275
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,770
Let's return and check on the dead bird.

276
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Okay.

277
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,220
There are two types of injury.

278
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,560
It's either internal
or external.

279
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,620
The bird died like a biological specimen.

280
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,780
It must be

281
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,940
an internal injury.

282
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,220
That's perplexing.

283
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,340
It's hard to say.

284
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,060
The best way is to

285
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,950
perform an autopsy.

286
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,380
-Me?
-Fine.

287
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,900
Let's play a game of Rock Paper Scissors.

288
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,460
The loser dissects the bird.

289
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,780
Rock, paper, scissors.

290
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,390
I think Wu San Xing's men

291
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,910
have passed through these traps.

292
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,560
We still need to be careful.

293
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,720
For palaces of this standard,

294
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,140
the booby traps can rearm.

295
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,420
It doesn't matter.

296
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,930
They are just arrows.

297
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,010
A piece of cake.

298
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,270
When did you pick that up?

299
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,420
Why do you have it?

300
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,790
It doesn't matter.

301
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,510
What matters is what we are using it for.

302
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,940
It comes in handy now.

303
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,320
Why didn't it activate the traps?

304
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,450
I can't believe

305
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,660
you call yourself an expert of the field

306
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
wanted by many.

307
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,100
Many wanted to hire you.

308
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Young man.

309
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,830
Are you underestimating me?

310
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,320
In that case,

311
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,900
let's make a bet.

312
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,640
The bird swallowed a bomb.

313
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,940
All its organs are scattered.

314
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,340
Zhang.

315
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,650
Zhang caught it too.

316
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,940
Let's help him rest elsewhere.

317
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
Come on.

318
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,420
Take a break.

319
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,700
Get some rest.

320
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,340
Wu Xie.

321
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Wu Xie.

322
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,100
Wu Xie.

323
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,160
You must hold on.

324
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
I can't handle the four of you alone.

325
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Hurry up and

326
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,530
find out what actually happened.

327
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,800
Right.

328
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,280
Think.

329
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,940
Let's think.

330
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,560
It might be the air.

331
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes, that is it.

332
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Wait, no.

333
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,360
Why am I alright?

334
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,720
Let me think about it.

335
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,440
Come on, think.

336
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Sound?

337
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Yes, it must be.

338
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
No.

339
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,800
I didn't hear anything.

340
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,200
What else?

341
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,280
It must be the light.

342
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,190
That isn't right.

343
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
Fatty.

344
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,290
Did you find anything abnormal

345
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,060
from the bird?

346
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
Well...

347
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,010
There weren't any external damages,

348
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,700
but its organs exploded.

349
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,070
Its organs exploded?

350
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,520
Under such extreme conditions,

351
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,920
besides deep waters

352
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,560
or outer space,

353
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,640
explosions of internal organs

354
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
are caused either by strong impact

355
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,710
or severe vibration.

356
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,390
However,

357
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,700
if anything

358
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,160
convulses so greatly,

359
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,120
it's impossible for us not to sense it.

360
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,550
Is there anything invisible, insensible

361
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,960
and undiscoverable,

362
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,240
but harmful to the human body?

363
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,670
Only sound waves.

364
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,590
Back when I was a soldier,

365
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,920
I heard of sonic weapons.

366
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,840
A type of sound

367
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,940
that is inaudible,

368
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,450
but it will cause disorientation
of internal organs.

369
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,330
Our condition right now,

370
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,670
headaches,

371
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
nausea,

372
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,130
are considered mild.

373
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,760
Eventually,

374
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,440
if visceral vibration occurs,

375
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,760
the person is dead meat.

376
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,200
Infrasound waves.

377
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,560
Infrasound waves.

378
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
What is it?

379
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,400
What could possibly
release infrasound waves?

380
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Is it this mountain?

381
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,870
This plant?

382
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,520
Only the statues were man-made.

383
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
The holes.

384
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,960
Are you referring

385
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,490
to the four holes on the statue?

386
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,910
I knew something was up with the holes.

387
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,000
The Birdman

388
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,920
needs an outlet to

389
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
release sonic sound waves.

390
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,640
I think

391
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,640
the holes are probably it.

392
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,320
Hurry up and seal the holes.

393
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,320
-Quickly.
-Yes.

394
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,120
Seal the holes.

395
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
Seal the holes.

396
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,720
I don't know if this would work.

397
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,380
It works!

398
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,120
Good job, Pan Zi.

399
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,430
Infrasound waves are
difficult to disperse.

400
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,880
Sealing the holes

401
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,320
can only impede the area

402
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,120
from producing new infrasound waves.

403
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,880
We still need to leave immediately.

404
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,860
Unlike the people from the carvings,

405
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,440
at least we will not die

406
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,760
from visceral damage unknowingly.

407
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,560
Look.

408
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,220
There are quite a number of reliefs.

409
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,040
There might be other traps.

410
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,780
Let's have a match.

411
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,580
Whoever figures out how to activate
the traps first

412
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,480
and finds the most wins.

413
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,100
Based on your habit,

414
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,840
how much must the loser pay?

415
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,440
Money talk is boring.

416
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,200
This is a competition
of expertise and pride.

417
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,800
If we're not betting with money,

418
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,080
the loser

419
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
has to remove his trousers.

420
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:10,150
Well, that would never be me anyway.

421
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,680
It wouldn't be me either.

422
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,280
You get one point for that.

423
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
Look.

424
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,960
At the end of the path,

425
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,800
it must be the altar.

426
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,430
On the way here,

427
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,670
there are many carcasses.

428
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,860
The impact of the infrasound
waves are greater in this area.

429
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,200
The living sacrifices on
the sequential carvings

430
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,440
are dead by the time

431
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,470
they arrive at the altar.

432
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,360
We almost became living sacrifices.

433
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
I guess.

434
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,360
How cruel.

435
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,230
This is a path of doom.

436
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Over here.

437
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Let's go.

438
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,720
Zhang.

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,240
Let's take a break.

440
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Be careful.

441
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
How is she?

442
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,960
She's not dead.

443
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,480
Like I said.

444
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,300
Ruthless people live forever.

445
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Pan Zi.

446
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,320
The Birdman is impressive.

447
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,120
How did it produce an

448
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,280
infrasound cannon?

449
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,730
Some things

450
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,770
are able to convert regular sound

451
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,570
into infrasound waves.

452
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,060
The greater the sound,

453
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,580
the stronger the infrasound waves.

454
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,750
No wonder the drums are shown

455
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,990
in the carvings.

456
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,200
Those statues

457
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,970
probably consist of certain materials

458
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,510
or a specific structure on the inside.

459
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,400
Anyhow,

460
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,600
it is able to convert the sound
of the drums to infrasound waves,

461
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,440
causing the living sacrifices

462
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,520
to die on the way.

463
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
It seems like the

464
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,720
sound that occurred from the explosion

465
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,250
was the source for these statues.

466
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,430
That's very likely.

467
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,040
If a thunderstorm occurs,

468
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,080
the statues may absorb the
sound and convert them.

469
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,280
The carcasses on the way

470
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,190
were products of that.

471
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,770
There's something I don't understand.

472
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Why is everyone affected

473
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,110
except for me?

474
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,880
You're right.

475
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,160
I guess it's because you're fat.

476
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,400
Nonsense.

477
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,140
Actually,

478
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,800
infrasound waves harm
living things principally

479
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,640
by visceral resonance.

480
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,190
The key lies at the heart.

481
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Hence,

482
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,160
the healthier one is,

483
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,720
the stronger the effects.

484
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
A healthy body?

485
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,440
All of you are healthy.

486
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,620
Are you guys alright now?

487
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,920
I'm brimming with energy.

488
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,800
Let's go.

489
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Come on.

490
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Let's go.

491
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,520
Let's make a move.

492
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,640
Come on.

493
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Hold on.

494
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Fatty and I

495
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,360
wanted to find you and Zhang.

496
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,920
However, our journey

497
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,290
was fraught with mishaps.

498
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,200
We haven't been in
contact with Master San.

499
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
We should hurry and meet up with him.

500
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,480
We don't want him to worry.

501
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,550
Wu Xie.

502
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,640
Admit it if you're concerned.

503
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,960
Both of you are family.

504
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,320
Stop acting tough.

505
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,200
This is distressed smoke
used during a shipwreck.

506
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,040
These are hard to come by.

507
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,960
Wu San Xing is pretty capable.

508
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,840
Why is the smoke yellow?

509
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,940
Does it mean anything?

510
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,780
Yellow means danger lies ahead.

511
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,860
Beware.

512
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,000
There are other colours.

513
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,480
Each represents a different meaning.

514
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,080
Who knows if he's going
to come to our aid?

515
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
Don't worry.

516
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,560
According to the schedule,

517
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Master San is near the rainforest by now.

518
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,520
This signal

519
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,320
will last for three to four hours.

520
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,200
We will definitely obtain
a reply from Master San.

521
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,080
What are you doing?

522
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320
I'm not buying it.

523
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,640
Are you blind?

524
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,040
Let's stop waiting around.

525
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,040
Let's go.

526
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,160
The rainforest climate is erratic.

527
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,160
We need to find a safe
place to set up camp.

528
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
Let's go.

529
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,200
Let's get a move on.

530
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,540
Let's meet up with Master San's crew.

531
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,600
I haven't gotten enough rest.

532
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,770
This woman

533
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,720
is insane.

534
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,710
Turn off your flashlights.

535
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,160
Why?

536
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,280
Just do it.

537
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,510
It's just a bet.

538
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Is this necessary?

539
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,760
Two to one.

540
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,960
You don't have to

541
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
remove your trousers.

542
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
No.

543
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,960
I'm a man of my word.

544
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,600
I lost, so I have to do it.

545
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
I'm going to remove my trousers.

546
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,320
It's more convenient.

547
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Go over there.

548
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,040
You will find snakes

549
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,150
at places like these.

550
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,190
It's good to alert the snakes.

551
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,469
Be careful.

552
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Wu Xie.

553
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,870
Do you remember that sentence

554
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,280
in Chen Wen Jin's notes?

555
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,690
The mire is infested with many
ravenous snakes.

556
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Hurry up.

557
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,010
We need to find a place to set up
camp before night falls.

558
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Let's go.

559
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Come here.

560
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,400
You're crazy.

561
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,600
Do you need an audience?

562
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,030
Hurry over here.

563
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Look.

564
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,520
An illustration will not
occur out of nowhere.

565
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,240
It must be

566
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,110
a door-opening mechanism.

567
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,740
After studying this,

568
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,520
only the pair of eyes

569
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,760
are worth trying out.

570
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,840
Use our hands?

571
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,560
Yes.

572
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,720
Your hands are the best tools.

573
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,640
You discovered it.

574
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,640
You should do it.

575
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,880
Are you disgusted?

576
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,840
Under extreme circumstances,

577
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,360
water is extremely precious.

578
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
If you don't mind, go ahead.

579
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Fine.

580
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,390
I'll show you

581
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,470
what it means to be professional.

582
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Hold this.

583
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
There we go.

584
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,040
Is this the inner sanctum
of the Queen Mother's Palace?

585
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,550
We will find out once we're inside.

586
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Here.

587
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
Finish it.

588
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,560
Look at you guys.

589
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,760
It has only been a while,

590
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,830
and you're all exhausted.

591
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,760
Let me demonstrate my talent.

592
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,810
I'll entertain you with a
song and dance routine.

593
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Hold it.

594
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,930
We have enough physical torment
for the day.

595
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,160
Mentally,

596
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
we can't take any more torture
by your horrible vocals.

597
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Nonsense.

598
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,710
You're lucky to be able to

599
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,080
watch my performance.

600
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
It's raining.

601
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
Yes.

602
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,720
The air pressure is getting lower.

603
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,360
It's going to rain heavily.

604
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,520
Let's find a shelter.

605
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,520
The Heavenly Queen Mother isn't
stingy about spending.

606
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,640
In order to build a palace,

607
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
the mountain is hollowed out.

608
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,590
Incidentally, due to the low temperature,

609
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,720
the lamp oil has not evaporated.

610
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,710
The lamp stamp heats up
and triggers the mechanism.

611
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,360
The Heavenly Queen Mother is pretty smart.

612
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,260
<i>Wash hands</i>

613
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,030
Wash hands?

614
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,390
Wash hands?

615
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,440
Wu San Xing

616
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,840
sure is considerate.

617
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,840
He's well-prepared.

618
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,360
He doesn't even leave clues now.

619
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,160
This is the only thing he left.

620
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,070
Master San does not kid around.

621
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,280
He activated the contraption

622
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,680
the same way we did.

623
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,920
He is more thorough than youngsters.

624
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
I'll go first.

625
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,610
Stop being petty when
you're on an exploration.

626
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,530
Look at this image.

627
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,940
It's a scene of a meeting between
a person and the Heavenly Queen Mother.

628
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
Interesting.

629
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,960
Look.

630
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,510
The guest and the Heavenly Queen
Mother are the same size,

631
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,860
but the rest of the people are downscaled.

632
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,080
The bigger the proportion,
the higher in status.

633
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,570
This person

634
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,600
is pretty important to
the Heavenly Queen Mother.

635
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,760
The person is crowned,

636
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
clothed in fancy garments.

637
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,800
They are garments from the
royal family of Western Zhou.

638
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
It's Emperor Mu of Zhou.

639
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,860
According to legend,

640
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,320
Emperor Mu of Zhou and
the Heavenly Queen Mother

641
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,040
were on a quest for the
Pill of Immortality.

642
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,320
A romantic conversation between
them was historically recorded.

643
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,240
<i>We are far apart.</i>

644
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,380
<i>Will you come again?</i>

645
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,000
<i>Once I've returned to the east</i>

646
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,360
<i>and built my empire,</i>

647
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,720
<i>I'll see you again.</i>

648
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,360
<i>Give me three years' time.</i>

649
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,640
Call it a myth

650
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,760
or a history.

651
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,970
Only Emperor Mu of Zhou

652
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,490
could win the Queen Mother's heart.

653
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
Throughout this journey, I have a feeling

654
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,920
that the Heavenly Queen Mother

655
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,520
is a ruthless woman.

656
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,520
She is very territorial as well.

657
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,230
Look at her palace.

658
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,220
If there is no guide,

659
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,800
it's very hard to
survive all the way here.

660
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,310
It clearly tells the guests

661
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,040
that if they do not heed her command,

662
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,960
they'd die on the spot.

663
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,320
Look at those lamps.

664
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,830
They are in the style of Western Zhou.

665
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
This shows that

666
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,130
besides befriending Emperor Mu of Zhou,

667
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,160
she also assimilated his culture.

668
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,160
Perhaps it's because

669
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,880
Emperor Mu of Zhou gave her some benefits.

670
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,280
Let's check it out.

671
00:41:41,204 --> 00:41:51,204
