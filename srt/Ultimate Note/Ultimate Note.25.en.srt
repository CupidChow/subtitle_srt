1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,640
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,740
<i>Episode 25</i>

4
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,670
During their expedition,

5
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,610
they must've discovered some clues.

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,970
The clues planted thoughts in them.

7
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,090
And when the thoughts grew,

8
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,630
"It" appeared.

9
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,060
That was when

10
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,460
the expedition started running
into roadblocks.

11
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,660
"It" again?

12
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,180
You mean

13
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,650
when someone is close
to the secret of longevity,

14
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,880
he would lose his grip,

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,180
and "It" would appear?

16
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,540
So everything that transpired here

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,650
was part of its plan.

18
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,650
That's only your speculation.

19
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,570
But I knew about this village
a long time ago.

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,080
And the unspeakable secret

21
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,370
hidden within it.

22
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,160
When Shades told me

23
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,930
Cox Hendry's team had arrived,

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,650
I came here with my men
as soon as I could.

25
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,820
Because I knew the place
they were looking for

26
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,100
was incredibly treacherous.

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
<i>Outpatient</i>

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,260
I'll have you know

29
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,130
that I've been to all kinds
of treacherous places.

30
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,460
The little jade servants
were nothing to me.

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,590
If I hadn't starved for days,

32
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,100
and was too tired to fight,

33
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,390
I wouldn't have lost.

34
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,370
I...

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,860
You're still injured.

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,140
Don't fidget.

37
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,900
Those jerks sure knew how to fight dirty.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,370
Zhang,

39
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,700
funny you should mention it.

40
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,260
You got me into this state.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,420
I've been bottling up.

42
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,650
You wanted to keep those stupid
metal ingots under the bed.

43
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,980
But Mi Luo Tuo cave was full of them.

44
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,130
They aren't worth anything.

45
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,130
So why did you treat them like treasure?

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,340
Now I get it.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,000
You wanted to remind yourself

48
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,390
that place was dangerous.

49
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,210
And you shouldn't have gone there.

50
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,010
-If you ask me...
-It's not entirely Zhang's fault.

51
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,130
He doesn't even remember his past.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,570
With you around,

53
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,210
how could I blame Zhang?

54
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,030
What I'm saying is,

55
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,360
since we know the entrance
is in the mountain,

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,829
we should strike while the iron is hot,

57
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,290
and excavate the mountains.

58
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,370
Come.

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,570
Help me get up.

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,900
I'll get myself discharged.

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,260
Stop talking nonsense.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,370
You haven't recovered.

63
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,900
What if there are complications
when you return to Banai?

64
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,670
Can you be more optimistic

65
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,920
and shut your foul mouth?

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,460
Besides, aren't you anxious
to get Zhang his memory back?

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,860
I know I am.

68
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,600
Look, I'm injured and I haven't been
back in days.

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,210
Yun Cai must be worried sick.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,380
Come on.

71
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,850
Wait.

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,500
Are you sure?

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,700
Relax.

74
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,440
I can do it.

75
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,600
Now you regret it.

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,490
Why did you come back
before you've convalesced?

77
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,210
I thought I was fine.

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,820
But then

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,890
the pain came up.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,100
Never mind.

81
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,020
I'm strong as an ox.

82
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,890
This little injury is no big deal.

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,170
It's only a minor infection.

84
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,670
If it were any worse,

85
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,050
the village doctor would not
be able to save you.

86
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,610
I missed you

87
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,370
and didn't want you to worry, that's all.

88
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,640
Alright. Just remember to stay put
this time, okay?

89
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,590
Promise me.

90
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,560
Okay.

91
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,540
I promise.

92
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Halt.

93
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,340
Don't move.

94
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,700
Where are your manners?

95
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,770
Coming uninvited.

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,020
You think this is your home?

97
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,980
Why are you guys still here?

98
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,510
My boss heard you're back.

99
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,630
He wants to see you.

100
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,620
I'm sincere

101
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,140
about a collaboration.

102
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,770
These silk texts

103
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,500
aren't genuine.

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,700
You're right.

105
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,770
They're reproductions that
I've paid top dollar to acquire.

106
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,270
You call these reproductions

107
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,320
"sincere?"

108
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,920
Do you understand the contents
of the silk texts?

109
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,150
Some of it.

110
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,350
They seem to point to this location.

111
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,430
That's right.

112
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,740
This is the place the silk texts refer to.

113
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,930
And what's the value in that?

114
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,440
Young man,

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,380
what's really valuable

116
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,150
is the source of the silk texts.

117
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,210
You've been pursuing the silk texts
all this while,

118
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,530
but have you wondered

119
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,790
where they came from?

120
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,160
You know that?

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,130
I'm not sure about the others,

122
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,830
but the one I have,

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,930
I heard, originated from one of
the Mystic Nine's elders.

124
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,230
Fairy Huo.

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,700
So Granny Huo

126
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,200
knew about the Yellow Silk long ago.

127
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,220
Long before any one of us did.

128
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,650
It's no surprise.

129
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,850
That's life.

130
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,540
The longer you've lived,

131
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,630
the more secrets you accumulate.

132
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,020
After all, she's the only remaining member

133
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,610
of the old Mystic Nine.

134
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,420
What do you say, Master Xiao San?

135
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,100
Am I sincere enough now?

136
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,100
Alright.

137
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,050
I'll collaborate with you.

138
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,370
But your subordinates

139
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,140
must listen to me.

140
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,820
So what's the next step?

141
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,340
Excavate the mountain.

142
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,420
You're saying the Old Pavilion
lies inside the mountain?

143
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,650
Just focus on the excavation.

144
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,170
We must find the entrance to
the Zhang family's Old Pavilion.

145
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,060
Master Xiao San,

146
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,040
rest assured.

147
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,700
I know that place isn't
so easily breached.

148
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,890
Hello, Xiao Hua.

149
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,890
<i>I have a tip-off for you.</i>

150
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,620
When Xiu Xiu told me

151
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,250
the Golmud Sanatorium tapes
were in Granny Huo's house,

152
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,240
I knew she had some insider information.

153
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,960
After all, it was her daughter that
disappeared in the Paracel Islands.

154
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,810
Cox Hendry was right about one thing.

155
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,740
Granny Huo has lived for far too long.

156
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,590
If she's involved,

157
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,320
<i>she'd know more than we do.</i>

158
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,760
You guys risked your lives

159
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,210
and went through all that hassle
to get this information.

160
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,810
While that old lady

161
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,010
has probably known it for 20 or 30 years.

162
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,620
<i>The older the ginger, the spicier.</i>

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,930
In that case,

164
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,740
we need Xiu Xiu's help.

165
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,030
<i>Maybe she could find out something
from her grandma.</i>

166
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,490
Sure.

167
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,900
Let's keep in touch.

168
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,530
Sure.

169
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,980
What about you?

170
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,420
Me?

171
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,010
Once I send you back to Beijing,

172
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,570
my work will be done.

173
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,440
If my services aren't needed,

174
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,400
I'll get back to my massage
business in Hangzhou.

175
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,860
Wu Xie,

176
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,890
is this going to work?

177
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,180
We've been digging all day.

178
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,500
And we haven't seen an inkling
of an entrance.

179
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,710
You think it's that easy to find

180
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,280
the entrance to the Old Pavilion?

181
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,980
Keep digging.

182
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,520
We might be getting close.

183
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,650
Guys, are you sure
you got your facts straight?

184
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,180
We've been tearing away
at the mountain for days.

185
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,980
Why didn't we find anything yet?

186
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,060
My boss has poured in so much
manpower and resources.

187
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,060
It'd be a shame

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,690
if you have nothing to show for it.

189
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,180
Mount Yang Jiao is so huge.

190
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,710
How are we supposed to find it easily

191
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,180
with just elbow grease?

192
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,740
Just mind your own business.

193
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,210
Stupid outsiders,
always making things worse.

194
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,420
Then I'll await the good news.

195
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,510
Guys, take a break first.

196
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,570
You may resume once you've recharged.

197
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,770
-Okay.
-Okay.

198
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,280
How much water is left?

199
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,330
Half of it.

200
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,700
Have a drink.

201
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,540
I've been here for so long,

202
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,690
and this is my first time seeing Banai
from this angle.

203
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,300
The hills and rivers

204
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,540
look more serene than Beijing.

205
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,320
I drew this up.

206
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,860
A map of the underwater village.

207
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,180
Look.

208
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,200
Compared side by side,

209
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,420
doesn't it look like the village
on the surface?

210
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,690
You're not kidding.

211
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,130
Look at the intersection
of the alleys,

212
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,770
and the arrangement of the
houses and fences.

213
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,330
They're identical.

214
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,470
Zhang,

215
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,640
you always have the answers.

216
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,230
Can you explain this?

217
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,570
How's this for an explanation?

218
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,280
What if the underwater village
was the original village?

219
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,980
But due to a natural disaster,

220
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,650
the lake overflowed and swallowed it.

221
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,620
So the forefathers

222
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,760
built an identical settlement
in a similar environment

223
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,450
using the same blueprint?

224
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,060
Such a high degree of similarity

225
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,680
was only possible if they had taken
precise measurements

226
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,980
prior to the flood.

227
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,570
Besides, they didn't have the technology.

228
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,030
No one could've achieved such a feat.

229
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,500
Don't be so sure.

230
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,010
What if there was genius?

231
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,420
Even so, it wouldn't make sense.

232
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,650
It's impossible.

233
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,760
The Yao tribe weren't exactly fussy
about town planning.

234
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,150
There doesn't seem to be any significance

235
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,690
in the village's layout.

236
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,450
Why would they construct
an identical village?

237
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,250
So you're saying

238
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,980
there were two identical villages
at first?

239
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,180
And one sunk to the bottom of the lake?

240
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,490
That doesn't sound right, either.

241
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,300
If there was an identical village

242
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,770
before the flood,

243
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,900
the locals would surely know.

244
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,670
Or at least have a folklore about it.

245
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,840
But in all the while we were here,

246
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,400
no one has mentioned it.

247
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,010
Isn't that strange?

248
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,300
Unless

249
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,690
a group of people, or a power,

250
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,510
is suppressing the information,

251
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,060
and deliberately covering up the truth.

252
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,450
Think about it.

253
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,760
We know the lake pretty well by now.

254
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,250
It is a closed lake.

255
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,250
The lake bed
surrounds the mountain.

256
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,120
It is likely that the original village

257
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,870
was built along the mountains.

258
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,950
But someone siphoned water into the lake,

259
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,150
causing it to engulf the village.

260
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,650
Fatty.

261
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,900
Do you remember

262
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,610
Panma's story about the demons?

263
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,910
<i>The dead cannot come back to life.</i>

264
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,200
<i>Are you sure they looked the same
as when they were alive?</i>

265
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,130
<i>The very same.</i>

266
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,470
The old expedition team was eliminated.

267
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,670
Then a new team came out of nowhere

268
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,590
and replaced them.

269
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,250
Put this way,

270
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,490
doesn't it remind you of the village

271
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,100
and its replica?

272
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,100
More and more, I get the feeling

273
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,180
what took place here

274
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,570
was a mirror conspiracy.

275
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,740
Mirror conspiracy?

276
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,470
What kind of conspiracy is that?

277
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,610
The main ingredient of a mirror conspiracy
is deception.

278
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,510
In other words,

279
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,980
Uncle Gui's village is fake.

280
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,980
To hide the fact that the village
had disappeared,

281
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,370
a replica was built.

282
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,910
There must be a motive

283
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,760
behind such an elaborate scheme.

284
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,180
The original inhabitants were gone.

285
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,390
But the people

286
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,770
who copied the village

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,940
impersonated the villagers

288
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,060
and took refuge there

289
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,300
as they carried out their plan.

290
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,550
So what is their endgame?

291
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,400
It's been so long.

292
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,140
No one alive

293
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,610
could testify to the truth of the matter.

294
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,580
Of course,

295
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,440
this is just my speculation.

296
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,450
Look at this map.

297
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,740
See anything familiar?

298
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,690
Why does this look like a Qilin?

299
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,350
And the Qilin

300
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,320
looks just like one in Zhang's tattoo.

301
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,530
-It's uncanny.
-Zhang,

302
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,180
take off your shirt

303
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,800
and let us see.

304
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,109
I'll make a sketch and compare.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,900
Done.

306
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,700
Come around.

307
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,069
Let's have a look.

308
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,430
The resemblance is uncanny.

309
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,890
See?

310
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,290
The underwater pavilion

311
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,170
corresponds to the stilt house
on Zhang's body.

312
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,620
And if you look at the tattoo,

313
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,610
that's where the Qilin's eyes are.

314
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,470
At least now, we know one thing for sure.

315
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,360
Zhang may not remember it,

316
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,300
but there must be a lot of history

317
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,370
behind his family's old pavilion.

318
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,940
Yun Cai.

319
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,940
Yun Cai.

320
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,970
Oh no.

321
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,170
Yun Cai's in trouble.

322
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:38,500
Wu Xie, don't tell Uncle Gui yet.

323
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,660
He might get in the way.

324
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,880
<i>I have Yun Cai now.</i>

325
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,410
"I have Yun Cai now."

326
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,880
<i>Come to Buffalo Trench
if you want to save her.</i>

327
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,660
"Come to Buffalo Trench
if you want to save her."

328
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,900
The sloped-shoulder man.

329
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,100
It has to be a trap.

330
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,530
A trap set by the sloped-shoulder man.

331
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,900
How despicable.

332
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,080
If he has a problem with me,
he should come at me.

333
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,570
Why take the girl?

334
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,040
Last time the sloped-shoulder
man intervened,

335
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,110
we were about to find a clue.

336
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,950
If he is indeed the kidnapper,

337
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,020
it means we're getting closer
to the truth.

338
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,760
We'll surely unearth something.

339
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,100
Even if this is a trap,

340
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,660
I'm still going to save her.

341
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,660
We'll go together.

342
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,080
Yun Cai!

343
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,140
-Yun Cai!
-Yun Cai!

344
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,980
-Yun Cai!
-Yun Cai!

345
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,410
Yun Cai!

346
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,490
Yun Cai!

347
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,050
-Yun Cai!
-Wait.

348
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,370
It's Yun Cai's.

349
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,260
I told you it's a trap.

350
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,140
This clearly doesn't smell
like human blood.

351
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,450
Using such a cheap trick,

352
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,810
who does he think he's fooling?

353
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,510
Come on.

354
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,860
-Yun Cai!
-Yun Cai!

355
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,980
Yun Cai!

356
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,430
This blood-stained shirt
belongs to Yun Cai.

357
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,520
It's presented so conspicuously.

358
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,100
He's obviously trying to bait us.

359
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,500
Buffalo Trench is right ahead.

360
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,660
The spiders should show up any minute now.

361
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,560
No matter what lies ahead,

362
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,100
I'm not afraid.

363
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,290
Did you forget about your wounds?

364
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,800
You want to get bitten again?

365
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,520
I brought some herbs.

366
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,770
Smear it on.

367
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,890
It repels spiders.

368
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,250
Let's go.

369
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,610
Let's go.

370
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,150
Wu Xie,

371
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,880
your herbs are something else.

372
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,410
The poisonous spiders practically
made way for me.

373
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,250
Help!

374
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,250
Yun Cai.

375
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,210
Help!

376
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,060
Help!

377
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,900
Help!

378
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,460
Fatty!

379
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,810
Fatty!

380
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,410
Fatty, save me!

381
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:10,860
Fatty!

382
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,020
Fatty!

383
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,470
Fatty, save me!

384
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,450
Fatty!

385
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,450
Fatty, save me!

386
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,530
-Yun Cai.
-Don't, it's dangerous.

387
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:35,500
Save me, Fatty!

388
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,860
Whether it's a mountain of knives
or a sea of fire,

389
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,040
I must save her.

390
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,070
I know you're worried.

391
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,660
But look.

392
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,360
The sloped-shoulder man has set traps

393
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,920
to take us out in one fell swoop.

394
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,100
If we rush in to save Yun Cai,

395
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,710
he could be lurking in the shadows
with a knife.

396
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:57,900
We'd better play safe.

397
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,290
Fatty, save me!

398
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,620
Wu Xie.

399
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,110
I'm serious.

400
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,250
If I'm going to die,

401
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,260
then so be it.

402
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,370
Fatty!

403
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:10,900
Watch out, Fatty.

404
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,270
You rat.

405
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,310
How dare you ambush me?

406
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,290
Are you okay?

407
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,930
Let's save her.

408
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,230
Fatty, save me!

409
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,210
Yun Cai.

410
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,500
Fatty, be careful.

411
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,980
Be careful.

412
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,170
Fatty.

413
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,060
I'm coming.

414
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,940
Yun Cai,

415
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,010
are you alright?

416
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,930
Fatty, let's go.

417
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,100
Come.

418
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,450
Yun Cai, what's wrong?

419
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,090
What's wrong?

420
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,060
Please bear with it.

421
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,170
Put this on. It's laced with herbs.

422
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,900
Fatty.

423
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,360
Fatty.

424
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,730
Are you alright?

425
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,780
Wu Xie,

426
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,310
protect Yun Cai for me.

427
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:48,700
Fatty.

428
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,680
Fatty!

429
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,930
Fatty.

430
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,340
According to Panma,

431
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,410
there should be some anti-poison
herbs around here.

432
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,140
Those should wake him up.

433
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,250
Yun Cai,

434
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,500
it's safe here.

435
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,480
Stay with Fatty.

436
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,460
I'll be right back.

437
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,290
You've just escaped Mi Luo Tong cave,

438
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,020
and you're still so strong, Zhang Qi Ling?

439
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,260
Who are you?

440
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,210
Why don't you take your time
and ponder over it?

441
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,890
Fatty,

442
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,240
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,860
I have no choice.

444
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,690
If you'd put that knife an inch closer,

445
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,460
you'd be dead.

446
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,020
I'm no better than the dead now.

447
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,620
I don't want to do this, either.

448
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,860
Who are you, really?

449
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,980
<i>Mr Wu Xie,</i>

450
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,160
<i>Fatty's calling you.</i>

451
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,300
<i>Stupid Fatty.</i>

452
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,920
<i>Giving me nicknames again.</i>

453
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,260
<i>You called, Fatty?</i>

454
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,580
<i>No.</i>

455
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,700
<i>But Yun Cai...</i>

456
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,260
<i>That girl isn't interested in you.</i>

457
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,860
<i>She only wants to chat with Zhang.</i>

458
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,680
<i>Looks like my dear Fatty
got rejected again.</i>

459
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,500
You tagged along with us

460
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,960
because the person who hired you

461
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,450
wanted to keep tabs on us.

462
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,250
You work for the sloped-shoulder man.

463
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,740
Isn't that right?

464
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:24,930
She, like Panma,

465
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,380
works for sloped-shoulder.

466
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,330
Fatty knew it was a trap,

467
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,410
yet he came to your rescue regardless.

468
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,700
Why did you do it?

469
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,050
I had no choice.

470
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,500
That man coerced me.

471
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,330
I was helpless against him.

472
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,810
Who else in your village

473
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,660
knows the sloped-shoulder man?

474
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,130
I don't know.

475
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,740
I was only following his order
to spy on you.

476
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,970
Looks like our suspicion was right.

477
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,330
Yun Cai has been following us for so long.

478
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,500
The sloped-shoulder man
knew our every move.

479
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,040
Yet he never struck,

480
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,800
until now.

481
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,570
It means he's afraid.

482
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,260
He's afraid of us finding
the Old Pavilion's entrance.

483
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,900
I'll give you a chance.

484
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,500
Tell us who that man is,

485
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,480
and I'll let you go.

486
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,660
Everything you've done

487
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,410
will be forgiven.

488
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,700
I won't tell Fatty what you did.

489
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,990
You can come to Beijing with us,

490
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,830
and live an ordinary life,

491
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,930
as long as you're willing.

492
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,410
I only know his name.

493
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,260
It's Zhang Qi Ling.

494
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,600
Zhang Qi Ling?

495
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,740
Why does he have
the same name as you?

496
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,780
I don't know.

497
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,900
Yun Cai.

498
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,930
What's going on?

499
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:28,050
She's been poisoned.

500
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,570
It's spreading too fast.

501
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,250
She can't be saved.

502
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,880
What about the antidote?

503
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,880
Would it work?

504
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,500
It's too late now.

505
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,120
Yun Cai.

506
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,550
Yun Cai.

507
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,390
Yun Cai.

508
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,390
Please tell Fatty

509
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,360
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,550
Yun Cai.

511
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,880
Yun Cai.

512
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,030
Wu...

513
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,200
Wu Xie.

514
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,800
Wu Xie.

515
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,970
Fatty.

516
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,700
Fatty, how are you feeling?

517
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:29,230
Wu Xie.

518
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:30,770
Where...

519
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,630
Where's Yun Cai?

520
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,620
Well?

521
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:00,710
Yun Cai.

522
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,760
Yun Cai.

523
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:12,510
What?

524
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,400
Yun Cai!

525
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,440
What the hell happened?

526
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,930
Didn't I tell you to protect her well?

527
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,620
After you blacked out...

528
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,970
Sorry.

529
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,930
We were incapable.

530
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,930
Incapable of saving Yun Cai.

531
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,260
I couldn't protect you.

532
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,810
It was my fault.

533
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,650
I couldn't protect you.

534
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,560
I...

535
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,540
I...

536
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,670
Don't.

537
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,460
Fatty is more miserable than either of us.

538
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,930
Let him have some quiet.

539
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,340
That man has the exact same name as me.

540
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,070
I started this.

541
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,560
Zhang.

542
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,480
Don't be too hard on yourself.

543
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,130
The mystery behind your identity
runs so deep

544
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,550
that not even you can solve it.

545
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,140
It's not your fault.

546
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,830
The only thing we can do now

547
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,940
is to help the police collect evidence.

548
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,410
We must find out the
Old Pavilion's secret.

549
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,210
Only then, will our sacrifice

550
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,890
and Fatty's

551
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,610
be worthwhile.

552
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,880
The sloped-shoulder man
is called Zhang Qi Ling, too.

553
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,260
Could it be a mere coincidence?

554
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,450
The village in Banai replaced
the underwater village.

555
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,650
<i>Compared side by side,</i>

556
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,540
<i>doesn't it look like the village
on the surface?</i>

557
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,260
The Paracel Islands expedition team

558
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,060
also replaced the expedition team here.

559
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,730
<i>They couldn't have come back to life.</i>

560
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,610
<i>They must've been demons.</i>

561
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,880
<i>Demons from the lake.</i>

562
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,060
What if you're Zhang Qi Ling's
replacement?

563
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,670
Think about it.

564
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,930
Both of you have the same name

565
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,130
and the same freakishly long fingers.

566
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,160
And, just like him,

567
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,890
you've stayed here for many years.

568
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:29,620
The only difference

569
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,680
is your tattoo is a Qilin,

570
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,550
and his is a Qiongqi.

571
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,850
Is it possible that

572
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,020
combining the Qiongqi and Qilin tattoos

573
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,270
would give us a map?

574
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,440
Or

575
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,470
does your family have any other
mystical beast tattoos?

576
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,450
And if we put all of them together,

577
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,720
we'll find the Old Pavilion?

578
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,040
Never mind.

579
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,780
You can't recall anything.

580
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,570
The only thing we can do now

581
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,410
is to help Fatty get over it.

582
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,450
Fatty.

583
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,580
Fatty.

584
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,930
-Zhang.
-What's up?

585
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,350
Fatty's missing.

586
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:41,890
He's not in his room or anywhere.

587
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,570
I fear he's gone to confront
the sloped-shoulder man himself.

588
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,980
Buffalo Trench.

589
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,820
Sloped-shoulder man.

590
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,700
I'll burn you down, you brute.

591
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,460
I'll burn you down.

592
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,090
I'll burn all of you down.

593
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,100
Are you nuts?

594
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,410
If you light this up,

595
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,610
half the mountain will be gone.

596
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,740
Half the mountain?

597
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,920
I'm going to burn down the entire mountain
and all the spiders.

598
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,870
Calm down.

599
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,260
I can't calm down!

600
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,220
The sloped-shoulder man
took Yun Cai's life,

601
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,820
so I'm going to take his!

602
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,070
Then we should hand him
over to the police.

603
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,410
Not start fires.

604
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,780
When I'm through,
there'll be nothing left of him!

605
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,330
Give me the lighter.

606
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,780
Give it to me!

607
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,100
Fatty.

608
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,720
Don't stop me.

609
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,830
Don't any of you stop me.

610
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,220
Give me the lighter.

611
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,810
Fatty, look at me.

612
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,020
Where's your head at?

613
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,060
Tell me!

614
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,790
Even if you burn down all the spiders,

615
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,250
sloped-shoulder will never appear.

616
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,460
Sloped-shoulder.

617
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,780
You don't want me to investigate, do you?

618
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,820
Even if I have to move
this mountain myself,

619
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,890
I'll find

620
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,980
the Zhang family's Old Pavilion!

621
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,020
So the Zhang family's Old Pavilion
is inside a mountain?

622
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,200
Wu Xie and team are still excavating
the mountain in Banai

623
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,930
in search of the Old Pavilion's entrance.

624
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,120
Xiao Hua,

625
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,950
you came back to Beijing

626
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,300
instead of digging with them.

627
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,930
You must've made a breakthrough.

628
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,580
Cox Hendry possesses a piece
of the Yellow Silk.

629
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,400
That piece originated

630
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,570
from your grandma.

631
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,850
Her again?

632
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,890
You know how cranky she gets.

633
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,330
What information do you think
I can get out of her?

634
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,300
Don't you worry about that.

635
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,060
I have my ways.

636
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,300
<i>The mountain is pretty.</i>

637
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,980
<i>The river is pretty.</i>

638
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,750
<i>But the girl is the prettiest.</i>

639
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,520
<i>Us mountain folk may be poor,</i>

640
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,410
<i>but we can still buy honey here.</i>

641
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,330
<i>How can it compare to freshly
harvested honey?</i>

642
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,570
<i>They lack a key flavour.</i>

643
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,600
<i>What flavour?</i>

644
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,610
<i>Flavour of love.</i>

645
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,610
<i>I'm not much older than you.</i>

646
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,090
<i>Call me "brother."</i>

647
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,020
<i>Brother, time to dress your wounds.</i>

648
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,890
<i>Brother, you're so brave.</i>

649
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,710
<i>Brother, you heal so quickly.</i>

650
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:40,330
<i>Thanks to your tender loving care.</i>

651
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,540
<i>Shouldn't a sister cook for her brother?</i>

652
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,740
<i>Smells good, doesn't it?</i>

653
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,930
<i>Smells delicious.</i>

654
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,650
<i>Awesome.</i>

655
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,410
<i>Yun Cai, how dare you tease
your brother?</i>

656
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,650
<i>I love Luosifen.</i>

657
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,440
<i>The funk is part of the charm</i>

658
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,580
<i>and makes it appetising.</i>

659
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,460
<i>Right, Yun Cai?</i>

660
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,090
<i>Uncle Gui, please rest assured.</i>

661
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,100
<i>I guarantee</i>

662
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,170
<i>when you're back,</i>

663
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,610
<i>Yun Cai will still be in one piece.</i>

664
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,020
Fatty, where are you going?

665
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,300
-Excavating.
-Excavating?

666
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,450
You...

667
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,580
You're alright now?

668
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,580
I'm alright.

669
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,220
I'm a man of my word.

670
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,500
I will find that old pavilion.
