This flight of stairs

00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,759

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,160
I'm Wu Xie.

I'm currently at Golmud Sanatorium.

14
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,860

<i>The greedy and talkative Fatty Wang,</i>

<i>and my two friends, I embark
on all kinds of adventure.</i>

23
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,200
<i>We've visited the Seven Star Palace
of the Emperor of Lu</i>

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,960
<i>where we were chased by
Shibie insects,</i>

<i>bewitched by the Green-Eyed Fox,</i>

26
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>and caught by countless traps.</i>

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,880
<i>We nearly died.</i>

28
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,000
<i>But we pulled through thanks to
Zhang Qi Ling's help.</i>

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
<i>I thought</i>

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,320
<i>my life would be back to normal.</i>

<i>My search for my deadbeat third uncle</i>

<i>took me beneath the waters of

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,880
<i>It led me down a rabbit hole</i>

<i>involving immortality and the Ultimate.</i>

44

<i>Wu San Xing is trying to get me.</i>

<i>Then the clues from the three fishes</i>

50
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,480
<i>led me to Mount Changbai</i>

51
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,079
<i>and the Cloud Top Palace</i>

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,880
<i>buried under the pure white show.</i>

53
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,680
<i>With Wang Zang Hai's help, we located
the Nine Dragon Casket,</i>

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
<i>saw the 12-armed King of Slaves,</i>

55

<i>and the mighty Birdman.</i>

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,800
<i>Finally,</i>

57
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,120
<i>we found the Bronze Gate.</i>

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
<i>That was Zhang Qi Ling's destination.</i>

59
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,440
<i>There he was required
to guard some secrets.</i>

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,480
<i>As I watched him
enter the Bronze Gate,</i>

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,800
<i>I wondered what laid ahead.</i>

62
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
<i>Zhang Qi Ling!</i>

You wily old fox.

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,600
Leaving behind so much trouble.

69
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,760
Don't you run away!

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,280
Wu San Xing!

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,480
You wily old fox.

72
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,720
Stop right there!

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,020
<i>Wu San Xing</i>

74
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,640
You wily old fox.

75
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,440
How long have you been awakened?

76
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
Only just.

77
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,930
<i>Archaeological Team,
Paracel Islands, 1985</i>

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
Looks familiar?

79
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,560
This was taken by your
archaeological team 19 years ago

80
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,280
before travelling to
the Paracel Islands.

81
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,080
Xie Lian Huan died
during that expedition.

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
We saw a message written in blood

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
at the Paracel Islands.

84
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,159
It said on the boulder,

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,600
<i>Wu San Xing is trying to get me.</i>

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
"Wu San Xing is trying to get me."

87
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,040
Do you know who wrote that?

88
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,640
It was Xie Lian Huan!

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,600
Tell me whether you did it or not.

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,800
I'm feeling dizzy.

91
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
It hurts!

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,600
What hit my head?

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,200
Wu Xie's package.

94
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Who sent it?

95
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,560
Zhang

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,560
Qi

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Ling.

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
Zhang Qi Ling?

99
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,130
<i>Zhang Qi Ling, Express Delivery</i>

100
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,280
Isn't he amazing?

101
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,080
He could actually send something
to you from the Bronze Gate.

102
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
A videotape?

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,840
My nephew.

104
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,600
You're not being honest here.

105
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,320
Why wasn't I told

106
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,040
you've been in touch with Zhang Qi Ling?

107
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,240
How could I tell you?

108
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,840
Didn't you just wake up?

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,159
I'm feeling dizzy again.

110
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,440
It's getting worse now.

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
Stupid Zhang.

112
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,320
This is the first time

113
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
we've heard from him
after so long.

114
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
Isn't he stingy?

115
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,680
He could have sent us
some local specialities

116
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,840
instead of this stupid videotape.

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,080
It's a piece of antique.

118
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,120
And where are we going
to find a video recorder?

119
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,480
I'll take care of it.

120
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,440
Forget it.

121
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,920
It has nothing to do with you.

122
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,560
Can't we share the information?

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,400
We're family after all.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,040
You'll find out about Zhang Qi Ling

125
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,480
while I do my own investigation.

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
Wang Wu.

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,320
Go to the flea market

128
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,320
and get a couple of video recorders
so we can play them.

129
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,280
Yes, Master San.

130
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,080
You want to watch it?

131
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,300
Sure.

132
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,520
But you need to tell me
what happened at the Paracel Islands.

133
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,159
Do you really think

134
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,560
I'm a person who would kill for anything?

135
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,960
Cut the nonsense.

136
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,560
Now you're the suspicious one.

137
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,640
The Paracel Islands.

138
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,760
Much had happened then.

139
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,840
One thing I don't understand.

140
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,880
It's been years.

141
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,160
And I've been tracking down
the archaeological team.

142
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,200
Wen Jin.

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,480
Huo Ling.

144
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,040
They were so young.

145
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,960
And they are still missing.

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,000
Too much had happened. Just forget it.

147
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,720
Why?

148
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,960
Why do you do this every time?

149
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,120
I'm doing this

150
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,240
-for your own good.
-It's for my own good.

151
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,559
You say that every time.

152
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,400
I'm your uncle.

153
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,480
It's only natural

154
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,039
that I care for you.

155
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,040
This was sent from Golmud, Qinghai.

156
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,060
The Bronze Gate is at Mount Changbai.

157
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,460
But Golmud is in the western region.

158
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,360
This trick of his

159
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,160
was certainly amazing.

160
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
Seriously, what's Zhang doing

161
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,040
way out there?

162
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,720
We'll scour every inch of Qinghai

163
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,600
to find him.

164
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,960
You'd better come clean.

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
Didn't I come clean?

166
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,320
That's enough.

167
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,440
Let's watch the videotape.

168
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,930
<i>In-patient</i>

169
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,800
We've spent 20 minutes watching it.

170
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,240
Still nothing yet.

171
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,560
No.

172
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,760
Don't miss any clues.

173
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
Listen.

174
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,760
If the whole thing is blank,

175
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm going to lose it.

176
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,160
What are you doing now?

177
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,960
There could be words hidden
in the static.

178
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,080
A password maybe.

179
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,000
Or a secret code.

180
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,320
It's possible.

181
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,700
It's her.

182
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,200
It's Huo Ling.

183
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,400
This is Huo Ling from the
archaeological team 19 years ago?

184
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,720
Something was wrong

185
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,680
with her.

186
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,000
Give me the old picture.

<i>Archaeological Team,
Paracel Islands, 1985</i>

188

We were there in 1985.

189
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,160
It's 1997 in the videotape.

190
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,080
12 years have passed.

191
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,400
She hasn't grown older one bit.

192
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,880
Let us analyse this.

193
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Zhang Qi Ling

194
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,280
sent us two videotapes.

195
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,400
One is blank.

196
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,520
The other one

197
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,400
has Huo Ling combing her hair.

198
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,360
Wu Xie.

199
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
Stop the investigation now.

200
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,760
Treat this videotape as a hoax.

201
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,720
Stop watching it.

202
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,800
I've started my investigation.

203
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
And now you want me to stop.

204
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,800
Do you want to be the one
missing next?

205
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,320
I'm stopping you

206
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,080
-for your own good.
-For my own good.

207
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,080
Granny once set up a blind date for you

208
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
for "your own good."

209
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,520
But did you listen?

210
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,680
This is different.

211
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
Think about it.

212
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
The videotapes were sent to you

213
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,640
to bait you.

214
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,760
Aren't you playing into his hands

215
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,880
-if you investigate further?
-Could Zhang Qi Ling be ill-intentioned?

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
If I stop investigating I won't know
how much you're hiding from me.

217
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,440
-Did I keep any secrets from you?
-Hold on.

218

<i>I have a videotape with me.</i>

219

<i>It has something to do with you.</i>

220
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,200
If you're interested,

221
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,560
come to Hangzhou.

<i>Cox Hendry 02200059</i>

223

Didn't I tell you I have no money?

224
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Don't call me again.

225
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
I'm ending the call.

-Who was that?
-A property agent.

227
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
He's been bugging me.

228
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,320
Property agent?

229
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,440
You're not getting younger.

230
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,640
It's time to get a bigger house.

231
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,920
Then you can start dating.

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,880
I just want to be like you.

233
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
A bachelor.

234
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,800
My dear nephew.

235
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,280
You should be grateful you're still alive

236
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,560
after all that poking around.

237
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,720
It's all thanks

238
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,580
to your friends who protected you.

239
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm getting discharged tomorrow.

240
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,920
You should go back to Hangzhou

241
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,400
and stay put in Wushanju.

242

-Where are you going?
-The washroom.

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,320
Why are you taking them?

244
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,840
Zhang Qi Ling sent me these.

245
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,920
I'm the recipient.

246
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,640
Fine. If that's how you want to play,

247
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,720
I'll buy them from you.

248
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,910
There's a price for everything.

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,480
-Sure.
-How are you going to pay?

250
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,040
-Name your price.
-I want your

Double-Headed Tiger Jar.

252
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,320
Done.

253
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,280
The Dragon-Phoenix Guard.

254
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
-It's yours.
-And a pair

255
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,640
of Golden Dragon Cups.

256
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,560
Only one of those exist.

257
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,760
Trust me,

258
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,240
a pair exists.

259
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
You're truly my nephew.

260
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,520
You can have them.

261
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,640
It's a deal then.

262
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,880
Not only is my head hurt,

263
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,760
my whole body, too.

264
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,280
My heart is painful.

265
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Truly painful.

266
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,240
Fatty.

267
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
We got the money now.

268
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,120
I'll buy you a meal
back in Hangzhou.

269
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,240
Let's go.

270

<i>Wushanju</i>

271
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,400
You liar.

272
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,920
You bought me instant noodles instead.

273
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,440
This is Wushanju's speciality.

274
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,360
Enjoy your meal.

275
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,640

With whom?

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Ah Ning.

278
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,400
She also has some videotapes.

279
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,360
So I...

280
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,040
You had a phone
conversation with her yesterday.

281
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
You found a new target,

282
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,120
so you agreed to drop that investigation.

283
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,480
You know my uncle.

284
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,160
If I try to reason with him,

285
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,280
he won't listen to me.

286
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,800
And forget about outsmarting him.

287
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
We'll try to find some clues

288
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,280
from Ah Ning's videotapes.

289
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,160
I think Ah Ning...

290
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,280
She's alright.

291
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,080
Just too much of a mercenary.

292
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,680
As the saying goes,

293
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,960

yet you gave the tapes
to your uncle.

299

Not bad, kid.

300
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,720
A bait and switch.

301
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,680
No matter how wily the fox is,
it could never beat a good hunter.

302
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,360
I knew it.

303
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,440
A persistent guy like you

304
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,560

they're worth a fortune.

You're not wearing
your leather pants today.

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,280
This video is over ten years old.

341
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,640
I was young then.

342
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,240
Are there any other clues besides this?

343
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,760
The only clue is Wu Xie's face.

344
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,000
It seems you have
no knowledge of this.

<i>Jolly Good Time Blind Massage,

346
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,160
We can negotiate on the price.

347
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,680
Money is nothing to me.

348
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,520
But enough about money.

349
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,880
I'll arrive in Beijing tonight.

351
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,000
You're leaving just like that?

352
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,120
I just had a scare.

353
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,520
You're timid.

354
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,360
Just treat it as a horror movie.

355

Besides,

00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,800
you have Wang Meng.

Sure.

360
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,560
One more thing.

361
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,040
Zhang Qi Ling has sent a videotape...

362
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,040
There are two.

363
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,440
Including the blank one.

364
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,920
Like Ah Ning said,

365
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,120
the sender used
Zhang Qi Ling's name

366
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,400
to ensure I'd get them.

367
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,080
Maybe Zhang Qi Ling

368
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
didn't send them after all.

369
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,200
Yes.

370
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
I know.

371
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,000
You're trying to find out

00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,680
what the videotapes are all about.

373
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,000
And also,

374
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,520
inform me if you have news

-Sure.
-So long.

377
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,320
He even sent a blank videotape.

378
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,120
Zhang Qi Ling sure is a weirdo.

379
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,040
Wang Meng.

380
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,120
Give me the screwdriver.

381
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,800
It's in the drawer next to you, boss.

382
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,040
Get it yourself.

383
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,120
No salary for you this month.

384
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Alright, I'll go get it for you.

385

This is the blank one.

386
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,680
In other words,

387
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,320
the content is not the purpose.

388
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,040
The sender wanted me

389
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,360
to have the videotape itself.

390
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,320
There's only a reason

391
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,000
for sending this.

392
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,240
Something only the receiver

393
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,640

Furthermore,
even if it's seized by someone,

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,760
for instance, my third uncle,

403
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,000
the person will only be

00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,480
I have a habit of waking up corpses.

509
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,840
So I'll leave you alone,

510
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,000
and you'll leave me alone.

511
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,600
Sleep tight, okay?

512
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,960
It's strange.

513
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,440
There's another room.

514
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,840
Since I'm here,

515
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,720
I might as well risk it.

516
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,320
If I were to send someone

517
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,960
a videotape from the 90s

518
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,480
to lure him here

519
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
into this cellar,

520
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,240
I'd either

521
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,360
want him to find me,

522
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,800
or

523
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,560
find something I've left behind.

524
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,680
If he wanted me to find it,
why lock it?

525
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,160
Bravo!

526
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,110
<i>Xie Yu Chen</i>

527
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,480
Did your granny teach you

528
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,800
how to sleep on a rope?

529
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,760
I can't do that yet.

530
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,760
I can't fall asleep.

531
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,000
<i>Heavenly Music</i>

532
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,720
Did you have a good sleep?

533
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,920
I haven't lost my touch, have I?

534
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,560
I didn't hear

535
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
or see any flaws.

536
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,640
<i>I'm not sure</i>

537
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,800

00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,640

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,640

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,440
<i>you must be already involved.</i>

542
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,310
<i>The notebook has all the records</i>

<i>of our hard work and experience

550

552
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,840
<i>But once you read it,</i>

553
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,180
<i>anything can happen.</i>

554
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:02,410
<i>anything can happen.</i>

555
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,120
<i>The videotapes were our</i>

556
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
<i>final insurance.</i>

557
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
<i>Once the tapes are sent,</i>

558
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,180
<i>it means the owner is longer able</i>

559
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,620
<i>to reach me.</i>

560
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,140
<i>Either</i>

561
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,720
<i>I'm dead,</i>

562
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,220
<i>or</i>

563
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,900
<i>"it" has found me,</i>

564
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,480
<i>and I'm no longer in the city.</i>

565
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,860
What does it mean by "it?"

566
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,080
The videotape was sent to three people.

567
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,320
Me.

568
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,480
Ah Ning.

569
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,320
And who else?

570
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,800
Master San.

571
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,320
All the ancestors of the
Mystic Nine were involved.

572
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,420
Everyone died tragically.

573
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,840
The elders of the Xie family.

574
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,240
Master Wu Lao Gou.

575
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,560
My master, Er Yue Hong.

576
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,400
And the man called

577
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,520
"Master Buddha."

578
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,540
What have you elders been doing?

579
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,780
I...

580
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,140
I'm not old.

581
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,120
You have to ask Huo Xiu Xiu's granny
about the older generation's affairs.

582
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,580
My granny?

583
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,920
You can forget it.

584
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,600
We can't even mention the
disappearance of my aunt, Huo Ling,

585
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,600
in front of her.

586
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,920
<i>Chen Wen Jin</i>

587
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,880
Chen Wen Jin.

588
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,880
When your archaeological team
went to the Paracel Islands,

589
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,820
my aunt, Chen Wen Jin, and Xie Lian Huan

590
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
all went missing.

591
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,780
You're the only one who made it back.

592
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,120
You must know something.

593
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,220
My generation has done
everything necessary

594
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,100
to tie up the loose ends.

595
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,120
We hope the younger generation

596
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,540
will stay out of it.

597
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,820
You're the only one left.

598
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,700
Look at this pattern.

599
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,960
Tell me what it is.

600
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,120
So Chen Wen Jin

601
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,860
asked someone to send me videotapes

602
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,140
in Zhang Qi Ling's name.

603
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,300
Not just me, but two other people, too.

604
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,440
Mount Changbai,

605
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Cloud Top Palace,

606
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,640
Gua Zi Temple, Seven Star Palace,

607
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,740
Reclining Buddha Ridge,

608
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,860
Tian Guan Stupa,

609
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,880
Shatou Reef,

610
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,800
Shipwreck Tomb.

611
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,900
I've been to all these places.

612
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,880
<i>Mount Changbai, Cloud Top Palace,
Gua Zi Temple,</i>

613
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,220
<i>Reclining Buddha Ridge,
Tian Guan Stupa</i>

614
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,240
I get it now.

615
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,160
This is the dragon vein where

616
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,560
Emperor Mu of Zhou pursued immortality.

617
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,320
These lines connect to form a dragon.

618
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,040
I get that people were
superstitious back then.

619
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,400
But do people still believe in
such things nowadays?

620
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,440
Tamutuo.

621
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,200
Why is this the only spot

622
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,600
that's outside the Dragon's Gate?

623
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,160
The Bronze Gate.

624
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,440
Chen Wen Jin has been to the Bronze Gate.

625
00:44:09,464 --> 00:44:19,464
