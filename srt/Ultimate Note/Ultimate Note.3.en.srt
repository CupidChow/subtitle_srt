1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,890
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,780
<i>Episode 3</i>

4
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Zhang.

5
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,080
I was late.

6
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,560
Where's Xiao Hua?

7
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,840
He's at the rear.

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,510
There's no one.

9
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,240
Look down.

10
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,000
Xiao Hua.

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,320
Zhang.

12
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,580
Let me down.

13
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,780
I can walk.

14
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,560
He has a fever.

15
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,670
Thirty-five degrees

16
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,660
north of north-west.

17
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,730
Let's return first.

18
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,150
We're missing Lao Gao,

19
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,280
Ah K, King

20
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,300
and Century Egg.

21
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,940
The journey just started
and we already lost so many of them.

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,180
What happens next?

23
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,820
We searched everywhere we could.

24
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,840
Let's wait it out.

25
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,050
Lao Gao has a compass.

26
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,470
He will find this place.

27
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,100
Brat.

28
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,980
Brat.

29
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,050
I heard

30
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,000
that whoever lives near the desert

31
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,670
knows the laws of the sandstorm.

32
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,500
Did you lure us here intentionally?

33
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,670
What do you mean?

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,110
Are you accusing my grandma of lying?

35
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,360
Putting that aside,

36
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,620
I just want a clarification.

37
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,000
The route to search Tamutuo

38
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,380
was formulated by your grandma.

39
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,790
Why can't we go around

40
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,950
but the desert route is employed instead?

41
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,210
This is the only way to
arrive at the next stop.

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,190
If it wasn't for the sandstorm,

43
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,380
we would've arrived.

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,750
This used to be a river.

45
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,810
It wasn't a desert.

46
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,670
Deserts, lakes and salt marshes

47
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,630
devour each other in intersecting points.

48
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,860
The terrain changes every day.

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,440
We can't control the will of the heavens.

50
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,079
I've travelled by rivers' courses.

51
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,220
But I'd never travelled by
an unsustainable river.

52
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,360
My vehicle got stuck
and I couldn't get it out.

53
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,560
The river course you took
were dried up for a long time.

54
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,960
The river course we took
dried up less than six months ago.

55
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,670
How would you know that?

56
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,700
What happens then?

57
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,580
Are we going to die?

58
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,690
What are you doing?

59
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,710
-What are you doing?
-Tashi.

60
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,490
That's enough.

61
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,370
Stop fighting.

62
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,950
This was a river course.

63
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,440
We are indeed

64
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,920
travelling upstream towards the river.

65
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,800
If the river did not change its course,

66
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,050
there will be remains of the ancient city.

67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,490
We will find out as we explore tomorrow.

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,800
Wu Lao Si.

69
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,130
Hurry up and apologise.

70
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,210
Sorry, old lady.

71
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,170
That's right.

72
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,500
Another 20km by foot,

73
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,960
there's Devil City.

74
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,960
Devil City?

75
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,480
What is that?

76
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,560
<i>It's a land of mounds.</i>

77
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,710
<i>Apparently,
it used to be a castle of stones.</i>

78
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,040
<i>How is it related to the devil?</i>

79
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,280
<i>Legend says, a long time ago,</i>

80
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,900
<i>it used to be a city.</i>

81
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,240
<i>The citizens were diligent and brave.</i>

82
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,310
<i>They lived a wealthy life.</i>

83
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,850
<i>Eventually,</i>

84
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,770
<i>the inhabitants changed.</i>

85
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,130
<i>They indulged in pleasures,</i>

86
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,410
<i>alcoholism,</i>

87
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,760
<i>and plotted against each other.</i>

88
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,950
<i>In order to evoke the conscience
in men, the deity</i>

89
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,790
<i>arrived at the city,
reincarnated as a beggar</i>

90
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,790
<i>hoping to save them.</i>

91
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,810
<i>But the citizens</i>

92
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,060
<i>mistreated the beggar</i>

93
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,180
<i>and insulted him.</i>

94
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,190
<i>Enraged, the deity set
the city on flames.</i>

95
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,970
<i>Everyone was buried under the ruins.</i>

96
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,760
<i>Thus, every night,</i>

97
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,130
<i>the cries of the city can be heard.</i>

98
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,940
<i>Can such sounds really be heard?</i>

99
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:32,990
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,530
<i>Those are groans and cries</i>

101
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,930
the people made when they were burning.

102
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,390
It's such an eerie place.
Why are you taking us there?

103
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,500
We will find the way once
we arrive at Devil City.

104
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,040
We're setting up camp nearby.

105
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,550
We're not going in there.
What's with the attitude?

106
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,490
Night is falling.

107
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,280
You're in charge of the prep
for the journey tomorrow.

108
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,980
Contact me if you discover something.

109
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,640
Alright, where are you going?

110
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,640
We're running out of power
for the handheld radios.

111
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,320
I'm going to look for a vehicle.

112
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll try to contact Lao Gao
through the car's radio.

113
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,980
I'll come with you.

114
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,860
You're not the same Ah Ning I remembered.

115
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,560
What's the matter?

116
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,440
I'm surprised you'd go out of
your way to find your comrades.

117
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,900
The past you

118
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,740
would use comrades as a
shield from contraptions.

119
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,600
Well, there are no contraptions yet.

120
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,940
You're right.

121
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,860
I shouldn't have tagged along.

122
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,960
Since you did, let's get to work.

123
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,650
I'm Wu Xie.

124
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,740
Does anyone hear me?

125
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,210
Does anyone copy?

126
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,290
Master Hua'er.

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,360
Master Hua'er.

128
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,700
Your eyes have been shut a long time.

129
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,210
Are you dead?

130
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,409
It's better if you are.

131
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,650
In a while,

132
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,170
I'll bury you in the sand.

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,760
It's all natural and pollution-free.

134
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,310
You will be preserved for a long time.

135
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,260
-A long time.
-Get your filthy hands off me.

136
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,370
I'll not die before you do.

137
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,410
There's no reply.

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,050
I'm Wu Xie.

139
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,050
Does anyone copy?

140
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,820
It's so noisy. Turn it off.

141
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,240
We can't find them this way.

142
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,010
At least we tried.

143
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,600
You're trying to find them too.

144
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,830
We're not the same.

145
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,190
Whether we find them or not,

146
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,310
my stance remains

147
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,610
to avoid evoking panic.

148
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,280
You're still the Ah Ning I know.

149
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,520
Have some water.

150
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,080
It's dark out and you're
still wearing shades.

151
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,570
Can you see anything?

152
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,200
The darker it gets,
the clearer my vision.

153
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,240
Thanks.

154
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,710
<i>Green Pepper and Pork Rice</i>

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
Would you like some bell
pepper and pork rice?

156
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,680
I don't like bell peppers.

157
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,560
Thanks.

158
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,110
Compressed cookies?

159
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,430
They are too dry.

160
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,420
Listen to me.

161
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,460
Compressed cookies

162
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,500
are considered gourmet food

163
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,910
in a desert.

164
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,890
If that's the case,

165
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,710
that cookie must be expensive.

166
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,600
RMB500.

167
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,790
You're a miser.

168
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,510
Even if I give you my credit card,

169
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:54,790
you can't use it anyway.

170
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,030
There's no signal.

171
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,930
I'll put it on your tab.

172
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,680
I don't like to be in debt.

173
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,580
We drove all the vehicles we found here.

174
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,360
Attention, team.

175
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,910
Pack your bags.

176
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,590
We depart to Devil City in five minutes.

177
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,960
This will shelter us from the wind.

178
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,140
Spread out and set up camp.

179
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,640
Master Hua'er.

180
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,860
You just recovered.

181
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,790
Do you need help setting up camp?

182
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,680
How much does it cost?

183
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,660
RMB200.

184
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,110
RMB50.

185
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,590
RMB100.

186
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,360
Zhang.

187
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,240
Is this spot alright?

188
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,550
The hand is still warm.

189
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,740
Help!

190
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,660
Someone is in here.

191
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Hurry up.

192
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,350
It's a distance of over 20km.

193
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,680
It's going to take more
than half a day by foot.

194
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,140
This man walked so
far against the wind.

195
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,540
Tashi.

196
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,320
Is there a shortcut nearby?

197
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,820
It's impossible.

198
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,030
How did you end up here?

199
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,150
In order to avoid the sandstorm,

200
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,390
I walked all the way.

201
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
I somehow

202
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,290
ended up here after a while.

203
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,720
Have you seen Lao Gao and the rest?

204
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,070
They went deeper inside.

205
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,970
They did not turn back despite my calls.

206
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,850
Help him over there.

207
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,350
Here.

208
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,280
Zhang.

209
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,430
Shades.

210
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,440
Wu Lao Si.

211
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,780
Search the area nearby.

212
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,400
Keep in contact via the walkie-talkie.

213
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,350
Tashi, Lao Jia.

214
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,830
Ah Hu, Dao Zai.

215
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,860
Come with me.

216
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,200
-We will look for them in Devil City.
-Okay.

217
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,570
I'm not going in there.

218
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,520
Listen to that.

219
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,750
Don't worry.

220
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,930
This is a typical characteristic
of Yadan's landform.

221
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,880
Such mounds are caused
by the erosion of wind.

222
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,260
The mounds are scattered and uneven.

223
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,980
The sounds are formed
by the howling of wind.

224
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,440
Just like when we play the flute.

225
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,830
Qinghai and Xinjiang have such
similar landforms like Yadan.

226
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,010
It's a natural phenomenon.

227
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,070
No.

228
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,300
I'm not going in there.

229
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,480
No one was able to leave Devil City.

230
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,360
All right.

231
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,490
Let's get to work.

232
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,610
Wu Lao Si.

233
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,980
I'm leaving this place to you.

234
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,470
Sure. Don't worry, ma'am.

235
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,010
Come with me.

236
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,510
Why?

237
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,340
Zhang will ignore everyone

238
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
but you.

239
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,500
We will search on the outside.

240
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,720
We will not venture deep.

241
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,180
Hold it right there.

242
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,780
Stop forcing me.

243
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,340
You can't go inside.

244
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,420
You will die.

245
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,400
You must believe in natural science.

246
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,940
What do you know?

247
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,420
In the year of 1997,

248
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,630
an geological expedition
team entered the Devil City.

249
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,140
The whole team went missing.

250
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,190
For two whole years,

251
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,930
they found two air-dried corpses.

252
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,170
They couldn't find anyone else.

253
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,220
To explore, you can't fear death.

254
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,190
We have a satellite compass.

255
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:04,760
There's nothing to worry about.

256
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,060
We can return the sooner we find them.

257
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,829
You're a filial boy.

258
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,230
You don't want to worry your grandma.

259
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,849
I've a request.

260
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,010
Say it.

261
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,579
At every junction,

262
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,730
I'll place a pile of stones.

263
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,100
If we roam

264
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,120
and encounter the pile,

265
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,760
that means we are walking in circles.

266
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,150
We need to return immediately.

267
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,660
Sure.

268
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,800
Do the pile of stones

269
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,490
mean anything?

270
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,520
It doesn't matter.

271
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,470
That brat's life is in my hands.

272
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,780
Century Egg!

273
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,210
King!

274
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,270
Lao Gao!

275
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,260
Lao Gao!

276
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,270
-Lao Gao!
-Century Egg!

277
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,400
King!

278
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,420
-Lao Gao!
-Century Egg!

279
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,580
-Century Egg!
-Century Egg!

280
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,460
Stop yelling!

281
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,750
What are you doing?

282
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,840
You're causing a disruption.

283
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,310
Lao Gao.

284
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,750
Reply if you receive this.

285
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,060
He made over 20 piles of stones

286
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,100
and we haven't seen the end.

287
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,760
How huge is this place?

288
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,420
I hear something.

289
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,980
They must be near.

290
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,870
Lao Gao has to press the intercom

291
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,300
for us to receive the message.

292
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,860
They are still alive.

293
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,460
Retrieve your walkie-talkies.

294
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,260
Find the source of the signal.

295
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,260
I'm begging you.

296
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,540
This sound is creepy.

297
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,660
We've been in here for a long time.

298
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,980
Take us back.

299
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,460
The walkie-talkies are receiving signals.

300
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,840
That means they are nearby.

301
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,280
Continue to search.

302
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,740
This is bad.

303
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,560
We searched for a long time.

304
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,170
Perhaps, they are right in front.

305
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,460
Let's check it out.

306
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,580
Come on.

307
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,660
Let's go.

308
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,740
It's getting dark.

309
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,020
I'll search with you.

310
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,260
<i>Hello, Zhang.</i>

311
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,180
<i>Do you copy?</i>

312
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,360
<i>We received signals in Devil City.</i>

313
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,460
<i>We're still searching.</i>

314
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,500
<i>Tashi is here. Don't worry.</i>

315
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,150
<i>Hello.</i>

316
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,540
<i>Do you copy?</i>

317
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,580
Yes, we copy.

318
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,900
Mute Zhang doesn't speak.

319
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,900
You know that.

320
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,800
They haven't returned?

321
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,380
No.

322
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,540
They received a signal.

323
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,420
They are still looking.

324
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,140
Devil City is huge.

325
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,240
They should have
packed some supplies.

326
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,460
It's not a big deal.

327
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,460
They just need to send a flare.

328
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,770
We can find their location.

329
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,600
Who wants this?

330
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,800
Give me one of those.

331
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,100
You shouldn't.

332
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,590
You hate green peppers.

333
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,940
There are footprints.

334
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Heavens protect me.

335
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,900
The devil's child.

336
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,100
It's the devil's child.

337
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,520
A ship.

338
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,040
-A ship.
-What?

339
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,920
Tashi.

340
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,440
It's just an ancient ship.

341
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,500
No.

342
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,500
The devil's child.

343
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,580
The devil's child is in the ship.

344
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
The legend is true.

345
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,020
We cannot go forward.

346
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
If we do, we can never return.

347
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,380
Don't be afraid. It's just a ship.

348
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,260
Ah Ning.

349
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,820
The devil's child is in the ship.

350
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,180
For 3000 years, the devil's child

351
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,770
takes lives in a blink of an eye.

352
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,060
Ah Ning.

353
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,100
He's gotten quite a scare.

354
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,980
Lao Jia.

355
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,860
What is he talking about?

356
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,120
A devil's child?

357
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,850
Wait for us here.

358
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,670
If you run away,

359
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,270
I'll kill you.

360
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,330
Let's check it out.

361
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,980
They might be on the ship.

362
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,310
Have you confirmed the
location with Zhang?

363
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:17,780
Yes.

364
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,700
Why did you click three more times then?

365
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:24,880
There's a change in plans.

366
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,520
We are not joining Ah Ning's team.

367
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,790
Master San is changing
routes tomorrow morning.

368
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,950
He left a mark on his way.

369
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,240
We need to retrieve Zhang
and Master Xiao San

370
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,420
before meeting with Master San.

371
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,540
Who?

372
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,540
Wu Xie?

373
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,740
What's wrong?

374
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,800
If Wu Xie finds out that
I'm working with Master San

375
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,920
behind his back,

376
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,660
he'd slice my meat off.

377
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,900
We all know you love money.

378
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,860
-Nothing to be ashamed about.
-Am I doing this for money?

379
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:47,520
If Master San had a relevant permit
for exploration and asked me to do it,

380
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,080
I'll have no choice but to say yes.

381
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,530
Lao Jia, wait down there.

382
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,710
Watch over Tashi.

383
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,110
We will meet up later.

384
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,710
All right.

385
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,730
This ship is badly damaged.

386
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,340
There's a hole here.

387
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,660
Be careful.

388
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,380
There's something underneath the hole.

389
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,520
This floor must be the deck.

390
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,190
I'll check it out.

391
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,420
<i>Green Pepper and Pork Rice</i>

392
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,560
This was Master San's plan.

393
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,010
Are you in it as well?

394
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,950
A talent like me

395
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,320
is wanted everywhere.

396
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,270
Master San came to me first.

397
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,570
Then, Ah Ning came.

398
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,000
Master San

399
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,690
wants me to join Ah Ning's team.

400
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,030
I get twice the wage too.

401
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,480
Both requests aren't in conflict anyway.

402
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,310
Was the one who sent the flare

403
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,940
Pan Zi

404
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,090
or Fatty?

405
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,590
Up ahead.

406
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,590
The sound may be from below.

407
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,860
There's another level below.

408
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,850
Let's go.

409
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,150
We're on the same team.

410
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,780
Have something to eat.

411
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,730
<i>Green Pepper and Pork Rice</i>

412
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:21,990
Give it to him.

413
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,020
He doesn't eat green pepper.

414
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,810
Wu San Xing is a sly old fox.

415
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,690
Wu San Xing recruited

416
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:36,770
quite a number of people this time.

417
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,490
I'm not one of them.

418
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,420
That sly fox is here.

419
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,410
He told me he had no idea what's going on.

420
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,920
It seems like I've to ask him myself.

421
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,470
Yes, you should.

422
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,730
Do you know how to contact him?

423
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,300
If you show me the money,

424
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,630
I'll show you the way.

425
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,470
Tell me where he is.

426
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,590
You came to the right person.

427
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,710
Master San and I have a
special way of communication.

428
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,550
Hold on.

429
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,940
Prepare your compass.

430
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,060
I'll confirm the location with you.

431
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,600
This place is covered with sand.

432
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,320
Where did the sound come from?

433
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:25,560
This place collapses easily
with the accumulation of sand.

434
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,930
Be careful.

435
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,810
Okay.

436
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,950
What is that?

437
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,160
It's Lao Gao.

438
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,510
He's still alive. Rescue him.

439
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,870
Someone's there.

440
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,640
Must be King and Century Egg.

441
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,670
I'll take a look.

442
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,630
Save him first.

443
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,510
Okay.

444
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,100
They drowned in quicksand.

445
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,570
How did the walkie-talkie
receive signals then?

446
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,380
Perhaps his fingers
scratched against the intercom

447
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,000
or it was from the quicksand.

448
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,590
Whatever it is,

449
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,740
let's get them out of there.

450
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,510
Over there.

451
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,150
Let's go.

452
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:36,990
Right now?

453
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,500
It costs extra for a night shift.

454
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,470
It doesn't matter if
it's day or night to you.

455
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,650
Swipe your card.

456
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,190
They fell! Prioritise
those who are alive first.

457
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,650
I can't move.

458
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:10,780
I'm stuck.

459
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,860
He's being squashed by a clay chest.

460
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,280
We will drag you out.

461
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,600
Come and give me a hand.

462
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,920
It hurts.

463
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,160
I can't breathe.

464
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,710
Let's destroy this chest.

465
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,600
We can't do that.

466
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,190
If you smash the chest,

467
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,700
the force will be exerted on Ah Hu.

468
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,020
His internal organs will
not be able to take it.

469
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,450
Let's remove its lid first.

470
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,930
Reduce its weight before moving it.

471
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,450
Hold on.

472
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,210
This is not a regular chest.

473
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,510
This is a coffin.

474
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,670
This isn't a shipwreck.

475
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,230
This is a ship burial.

476
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,210
The patterns on the chest are coherent.

477
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,110
Does it not have a lid?

478
00:30:58,170 --> 00:30:59,480
Because the patterns are coherent,

479
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,260
you'd assume the lid doesn't exist.

480
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,660
The inventor is hiding the lid on purpose.

481
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,020
Have you heard of mortar
tombs of the Han Dynasty?

482
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,020
They place the corpse inside.

483
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,620
Then, the coffin is sealed with mortar.

484
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,540
Then, patterns will be
carved on it before it dries.

485
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,690
However, this coffin

486
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,340
wasn't sealed by mortar.

487
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,910
It's more of

488
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,990
a mixture of three different components.

489
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,950
This coffin is much
earlier than Han Dynasty.

490
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,140
Since it's a coffin,

491
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,690
there must be a way to open it.

492
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,690
I've an idea.

493
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,560
Pour water on it.

494
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,610
I found the lid.

495
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,440
Leave once we rescue them.

496
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,360
Why did Wu San Xing sent you here?

497
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,700
Do you really want to know?

498
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,760
Will you pay?

499
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,000
Firstly, I don't want to know anymore.

500
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,020
Secondly, are you dumb?

501
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,140
There is no signal here.

502
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,660
Life is hard.

503
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,230
I need to make a living.

504
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,420
We've been walking for a long time.

505
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,810
Are you sure we're on the right path?

506
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,080
I'm sure of it.

507
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,810
If you don't believe me,

508
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,960
I'll signal a flare.

509
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,060
Alright, let's wait.

510
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,700
This doesn't seem right.

511
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,580
Give it to me.

512
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,350
Let's go.

513
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,540
The corpse.

514
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,740
The corpse is changing.

515
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:14,909
It's blackening through oxidisation.

516
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,409
It's a normal phenomenon after
opening a mortar sealed coffin.

517
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,900
Lift the coffin with me.

518
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,610
Ah Ning, drag him out.

519
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:21,489
Okay.

520
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,940
Be patient. It's almost done.

521
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,159
How are you?

522
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,620
It's the Sanqing Bird.

523
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,040
Sanqing Bird is the messenger
of Queen Mother of West.

524
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,300
After so long,

525
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,670
we finally found a clue.

526
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,400
<i>Sanqing Bird is the
predecessor of the phoenix.</i>

527
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,340
<i>It's a symbol of luck
with divine abilities.</i>

528
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,230
<i>Legend says, besides being the
messenger of the Queen Mother of West,</i>

529
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,340
<i>Sanqing Bird
is like the dragon of China.</i>

530
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,060
<i>Only royalty has access to it.</i>

531
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,740
<i>The identity of the tomb's owner</i>

532
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,160
<i>is extraordinary.</i>

533
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,640
Something isn't right.

534
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,890
The garments are oversized.

535
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,620
Based on the skeleton,

536
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,020
this is a child.

537
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,490
Why would a child be
buried in adult's garments?

538
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,800
Something is wrong with this corpse.

539
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,810
We'd been walking for quite some time.

540
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,740
The campsite is clean.

541
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,250
They weren't in danger.

542
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,180
They probably detoured at the last minute.

543
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,620
That sly fox, Wu San Xing

544
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,320
left right on time.

545
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,770
If Master San goes anywhere,

546
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,260
he'd leave a mark.

547
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,660
You're unfamiliar with the mark

548
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,810
of Wu San Xing.

549
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,560
Master Hua'er,

550
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,640
the burnt marks are interesting.

551
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,770
Lend me your shoulders.

552
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,010
Are you going to get on it?

553
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,700
Sure.

554
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,290
Young man.

555
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,070
Be gentle towards old people like me.

556
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,400
Don't move. Stand straight.

557
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,410
Are you done?

558
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,670
What did you see?

559
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,580
Let's go.

560
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,910
Wait. Are we heading north?

561
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,350
Did he write the word north

562
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,590
or did he leave an arrow?

563
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,830
Or did he write it in English?

564
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:09,420
RMB500.

565
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,570
I'm a kind person.

566
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,650
Don't demand money from me.

567
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,820
RMB500.

568
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,630
Five bucks.

569
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,810
I can't give you any more.

570
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,270
I'm asking for 500 bucks.

571
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,220
Fine, 500 bucks it is.

572
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,780
-Tell me.
-Hexagram Kun.

573
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,330
Kun represents north.

574
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,420
I made a huge loss.

575
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,980
He stood on my shoulders
and I lost RMB500.

576
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,140
This should be it.

577
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,510
What do you think?

578
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,500
Pick a vehicle.

579
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,660
I like this one.

580
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,780
You can transport goods and drag a person.

581
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,660
It's practical.

582
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,150
That's true,

583
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,500
but

584
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,820
I prefer that one.

585
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,260
It has great horsepower.

586
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,140
It's cool.

587
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,270
It suits my style.

588
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,190
Fine. Here.

589
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,600
We'll decide by Rock-Paper-Scissors.

590
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,720
I'm not afraid.

591
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,500
Rock, paper, scissors.

592
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,940
I'm very lucky today.

593
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,550
Get in the car.

594
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,140
We will head straight to Ah Ning's campsite

595
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,820
and show her who's boss.

596
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,750
Mr Zhang.

597
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,380
What are you doing?

598
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,900
The boss, Ah Ning said

599
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,390
you're not allowed to leave.

600
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,980
Mr Zhang.

601
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,300
Mr Zhang.

602
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,380
Zhang.

603
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,100
I'm a civilised person.

604
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,030
I just wanted to talk.

605
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,860
You insist on violence.

606
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,560
My apologies then.

607
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,610
Zhang.

608
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,320
It's been a while.

609
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,970
Isn't this our car?

610
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,350
The three of you

611
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,640
are ignoring me.

612
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,140
Mr Pan.

613
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,210
Clear the road for Zhang.

614
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,180
Brothers, attack!

615
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,740
Zhang.

616
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,920
Master San found the way.

617
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,480
He sent Pan Zi and I to pick you guys up.

618
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,630
Go to hell.

619
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,700
Zhang, where's Wu Xie?

620
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,090
He's at Devil City.

621
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,990
What is he doing there?

622
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,760
Carabiners are useful.

623
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,660
This flashlight is pretty good too.

624
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:57,550
Pan Zi.

625
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,740
This is for you.

626
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,690
We're done here.

627
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,870
Let's go, Pan Zi.

628
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,140
Let's look for Master Xiao San.

629
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,920
Master Xiao San isn't here?

630
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,180
You should have told me earlier.

631
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,060
Let's go and look for Master Xiao San.

632
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,940
You can't leave!

633
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,710
Get up, brothers.

634
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,210
You don't know how to shut up.

635
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,780
What are you doing?

636
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,170
This is a gift from me to you.

637
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,870
What are you doing?

638
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,860
Don't go! Curse you, fatty!

639
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,900
Quickly! Put out the fire!

640
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,290
We need to put the fire out!

641
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,420
Hurry up!

642
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,330
There are words engraved on the side.

643
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,250
What does it say?

644
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,550
The life description of the tomb's owner.

645
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,920
There's more.

646
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:54,780
Something about a pill.

647
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,700
A pill?

648
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,100
What else?

649
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,170
It's oxidised.

650
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,290
I can't read it.

651
00:42:03,504 --> 00:42:13,504
