1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,940
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,820
<i>Episode 19</i>

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,370
Fatty.

5
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,660
Is Uncle Panma not back yet?

6
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,910
No.

7
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:46,250
Let's go find out.

8
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,400
Not yet.

9
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,610
I just came from Panma's house.

10
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,820
I mean,

11
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,310
I went there specifically

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,720
to ask on your behalf.

13
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,650
Sure.

14
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,600
Like I said,

15
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,330
whenever we want to see someone,

16
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,790
the meeting never goes as planned.

17
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,470
Mr Fatty,

18
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,720
I won't call this not going as planned.

19
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,550
As city dwellers, you might not know.

20
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,940
It's totally normal

21
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,430
for hunters to spend a few days
in the mountains.

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
So you guys should be more patient.

23
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,690
Take it easy.

24
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,950
Mr Fatty.

25
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,390
Take the time to recuperate.

26
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,050
I'll prepare some game
to help strengthen you.

27
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,450
That's great.

28
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,329
Uncle Gui.

29
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,380
You mountain dwellers
may not know this then.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,280
A guy who poked a hornet's nest
doesn't need supplements for the body.

31
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,110
He needs to strengthen the brain.

32
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,320
Wu Xie, you've become a bully.

33
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,930
You're making fun of me.

34
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,490
Alright.

35
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,090
Sirs, I've spoken to Panma's son.

36
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,910
When his old man returns,
he'll come notify you.

37
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,870
Okay.

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,030
I'll be off.

39
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,829
Alright.

40
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:51,970
Let's just wait.

41
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,240
I've gotten the sulphuric acid.

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,210
Get Zhang.

43
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,090
We'll try it out.

44
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,960
This is a close friend of mine,

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,070
Rag.

46
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,450
Take a seat.

47
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,630
Let me introduce you.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,750
These two are the distinguished
Master Hua and Ms Huo.

49
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,450
The reason for bringing you here today

50
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,370
is to ask how you normally
get in touch with Master San.

51
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,810
Master San isn't someone
I can simply contact.

52
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,750
Usually, he's the one
getting in touch with me.

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,720
I have something to do.

54
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,610
Excuse me.

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,770
Wait a minute. I'm not done.

56
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,530
We'll chat another time.

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Wu Xie, you should do it.

58
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,050
Doing this with one eye is tricky.

59
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,100
If it leaked, then it'd be ruined.

60
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,490
-Do I pour it?
-Yes.

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
Pour it.

62
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,430
Here.

63
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,270
Chicken.

64
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,830
The blade is melted.

65
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,930
But the metal slab had no reaction.

66
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,420
This metal slab is really odd.

67
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,640
Mr Fatty, it's time to change
your dressing.

68
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,630
Does it hurt?

69
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,840
No.

70
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,420
Fatty, I,

71
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,320
has been through much worse

72
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,760
during my adventures across the world.

73
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,630
This little bit of injury is nothing.

74
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,610
A walk in the park.

75
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,860
I was stung by a bee
when I was younger.

76
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,330
It was excruciating
while getting treatment.

77
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,550
Mr Fatty.

78
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
You're so brave.

79
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,860
It hurts just watching.

80
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,070
Yun Cai, no need to coddle Fatty.

81
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,950
We're here.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,260
You can get back to your work.

83
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,670
Thank you, Yun Cai.

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,320
Thanks.

85
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,570
Yell if you're in pain.

86
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,950
I think I'm about to pass out.

87
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,760
Sorry, buddy.

88
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,350
I owe my life to these two.

89
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,390
They're good people.

90
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
They won't harm you.

91
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,750
Why were you acting suspicious?

92
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,740
Who did?

93
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,380
Then why did you bolt out of there?

94
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,970
You were trying to hurt me!

95
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,320
Let's be civil.

96
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Why tie me up?

97
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,230
Don't worry.

98
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
We just have a few questions.

99
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,620
Answer them and you may go.

100
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,620
We won't make it difficult.

101
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,090
How did you communicate with Master San?

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,070
It was one-way contact.

103
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,530
When Master San needs to hire,

104
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,160
he'd ask to meet at Chu Yun Tea House's
Chun Teng Pavilion.

105
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,020
Xiu Xiu, watch him.

106
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,960
I'll check it out.

107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,870
Master Hua'er,

108
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,270
I know Chu Yun Tea House.

109
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,530
I'll take you.

110
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,350
Let's go.

111
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,230
Come.

112
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,280
Mr Fatty.

113
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,390
You're the boss.

114
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,760
You shouldn't be cooking.

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,640
Let me do it.

116
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,720
What boss?

117
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,500
I told you.

118
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,750
I'm your brother.

119
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,040
It's only right for the older brother
to cook for the younger sister.

120
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,570
Moreover, I'm a great cook.

121
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,180
I didn't get this healthy physique
out of nowhere.

122
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,030
-I'll assist you then.
-Sure.

123
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,320
Pass me the chicken.

124
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,270
Mr Fatty,

125
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,750
you recovered swiftly.

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,500
Thanks to your attentive care.

127
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,060
You changed my dressing daily.

128
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,400
By the way,

129
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,810
seems like Uncle Panma is not back yet.

130
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,670
Do the villagers always stay so long
in the mountain?

131
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,380
Most of the time, they spend
two or three days inside.

132
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,260
There are those who take
one or two weeks.

133
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,070
That long?

134
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,010
They need time to locate prey.

135
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,780
Then, they have to set up traps.

136
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,280
That's why it takes a while.

137
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,549
Smell it. Smells good?

138
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,390
You can trust in my cooking skills.

139
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,510
Mr Gui! Something's happened!

140
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,030
Something's happened to Panma!

141
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,370
Careful.

142
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,520
Where are you going?

143
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm going to look for my dad.

144
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,670
Calm down.

145
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,450
I'll get the villagers
to conduct a search.

146
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,790
Besides, when your father gets back,

147
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,050
someone has to look after him.

148
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,530
You two.

149
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,230
Quick, take him back inside.

150
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,690
Go on.

151
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,060
Uncle Gui.

152
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,140
Why won't you let him go?

153
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,580
You didn't know.

154
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,200
The bloody shirt he was holding

155
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,910
was found at Buffalo Trench.

156
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,790
That's a dangerous place.

157
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,300
You saw him.

158
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,990
In his current state,

159
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,420
how could I let him go?

160
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,630
Uncle Panma!

161
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,230
Uncle Panma!

162
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,490
Uncle Panma!

163
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,390
-Uncle Panma!
-Uncle Panma!

164
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,290
Uncle Panma!

165
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
Uncle Panma!

166
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,450
Zhang.

167
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,360
What is it?

168
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,560
Blood.

169
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,150
There's blood.

170
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,910
Over here.

171
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,900
And here.

172
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,960
Up ahead is Buffalo Trench, right?

173
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,200
Yes.

174
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,110
Let's go then.

175
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,590
-Let's go.
-No.

176
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,470
Sir.

177
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,580
You must not go.

178
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,570
Listen to me.

179
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,670
You must not go there.

180
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,080
Uncle Panma is probably right there.

181
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,150
We have to help him.

182
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,580
If he was really there,

183
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,970
it would be no use helping.

184
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,060
Buffalo Trench is forbidden territory.

185
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,850
Legend says there are man-eating monsters.

186
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,610
Anyone who goes in

187
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,400
won't be able to leave.

188
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,480
Uncle Gui.

189
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,400
I guess you don't know us well enough.

190
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,070
We've been to countless places
that are supposedly one-way only.

191
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,100
Sir.

192
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,630
This isn't something to joke about.

193
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,670
Don't worry, Uncle Gui.

194
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,990
We'll find Uncle Panma.

195
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,310
Sirs!

196
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,740
Be careful!

197
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,640
<i>Chu Yun Tea House</i>

198
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,910
Is Chun Teng Pavilion available?

199
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,410
You'd like to have tea
at Chun Teng Pavilion?

200
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,450
Yes.

201
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,720
This way please.

202
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,080
Master Hua'er, please.

203
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,330
Sir,

204
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,960
someone wishes to use Chun Teng Pavilion.

205
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,430
Kill him, kill him.

206
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,130
Sirs, this is the drinks menu.
Have a look.

207
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,530
I'll come back with snacks.

208
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,660
Okay, go on.

209
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,210
Master Hua'er.

210
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,490
The menu.

211
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,160
<i>Zi Wei Pavilion</i>

212
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,300
"Zi Wei Pavilion"?

213
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,840
Shouldn't it be Chun Teng Pavilion?

214
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,700
Master Hua'er.

215
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,040
What's wrong?

216
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,470
Come here.

217
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,310
Run!

218
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,550
Ms Huo.

219
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,400
My glucose is low.

220
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,800
I have some sweets in my pocket.

221
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,910
Can you get it for me?

222
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,580
Thank you.

223
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,570
Sorry,

224
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,800
for asking you to do this.

225
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,290
Which pocket?

226
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,290
The left side.

227
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,260
Go!

228
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,200
Okay. You go ahead.
I'll call the police.

229
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,440
They attacked us first.

230
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,330
Uncle Panma!

231
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,530
Uncle Panma!

232
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,970
This is too much blood, no?

233
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,650
It's probably painted on.

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,620
I think it was purposely hung there too.

235
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,200
I think Uncle Panma

236
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,560
purposely left it for us.

237
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,780
Blood is headed deep.

238
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,180
We have a shirt and traces of blood.

239
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,020
He must really want us to find him

240
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,440
by leaving these landmarks.

241
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,480
Looks like Gui is right.

242
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,230
Panma has something up his sleeve.

243
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,870
Let's go then.

244
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,160
Let's see what kind of traps

245
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,890
that old hunter has set up for us.

246
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,870
Master Hua'er.

247
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,730
We almost got stabbed in the back
by the rascal.

248
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,270
He wants to backstab us

249
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,630
with his laughable skills?

250
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,320
In his dreams.

251
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,680
I'll repeat myself.

252
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,620
Answer my question

253
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,770
and I won't harm you.

254
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,190
Master Xiao Jiu.

255
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,590
Ask away.

256
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,060
I'll answer.

257
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,230
Why backstab us?

258
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,090
I didn't know.

259
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,170
Master Xiao Jiu.

260
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,830
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

261
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,270
I really knew nothing.

262
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,830
Our boss gave the order.

263
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,910
If anyone tried to find out
about Master San,

264
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,910
we'd get them to go to
Chun Teng Pavilion at Chu Yun Tea House.

265
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,750
When they hear the phrase
"Chun Teng Pavilion,"

266
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,090
they will...

267
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,600
They'll take care of then.

268
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,320
Who is your boss?

269
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,990
Our boss is

270
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,170
the one and only

271
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,850
Liu Li Sun.

272
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,200
Liu Li Sun?

273
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,970
I'll remember it.

274
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,450
Zhang.

275
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,380
Are we going the right way?

276
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,890
There are spiderwebs everywhere.

277
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,420
Looks like Panma is trying to lure us
into Silken Web Cave.

278
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,140
How lucky of us.

279
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,430
In the Silken Web Cave,

280
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,400
there are seven gorgeous
spider spirits.

281
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,130
The spider spirits
were seducing Monk Tang.

282
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,300
Who are you to compare?

283
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,330
You don't have any resemblance
to Monk Tang at all.

284
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,910
Who said I wish to be Monk Tang?

285
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,349
I rather be Zhu Ba Jie.

286
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,349
The spiderwebs aren't normal.

287
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,240
The webs must have super glue on them.

288
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,650
They're so sticky.

289
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,960
Zhang.

290
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,220
Do you have any ideas?

291
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,510
The spiders here are peculiar.

292
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,510
Suck sticky webs.

293
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,680
Never mind insects,

294
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,270
even Godzilla would be stuck.

295
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,930
I think so too.

296
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,440
It would be able
to catch prey like wild boar

297
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,630
or lynx.

298
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,430
Not to forget humans.

299
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,820
Don't forget.

300
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,010
Gui said

301
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,370
Buffalo Trench is a place of no return.

302
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,170
We have to be careful.

303
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,390
We haven't seen any spiders,
only webs, since entering.

304
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,130
That means they're in hiding,

305
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,430
waiting for us to get stuck
and immobilized

306
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,590
before they start feasting.

307
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,490
Okay.

308
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,840
There were Shibie, snakes, scorpions.

309
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,720
Now,

310
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,140
we have spiders.

311
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,100
Wherever we go,

312
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,630
we are bound to come across
these wretched things.

313
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,610
That's because we never take
the common path.

314
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,360
Let's go.

315
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,020
Stay alert.

316
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,290
Clams and tofu soup.

317
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,820
Helps alleviate heat.

318
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,220
Master Hua'er,

319
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm embarrassed.

320
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,520
I was of no help

321
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,100
and even caused trouble for you.

322
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,340
It's fine.

323
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,490
We had a good limbering up

324
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,650
and combat practice.

325
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,070
Master Hua'er.

326
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,980
Out with it already.

327
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,810
Is Master San really...

328
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,760
He's not.

329
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,680
I think so too.

330
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,400
Master San is invincible.

331
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,400
There's no way.

332
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,710
I'm still waiting for him
to come and help me get rich.

333
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,990
Get rich?

334
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,320
Yes.

335
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,260
Master San said this before.

336
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,200
If the trip to Tamutuo
didn't yield any good results,

337
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,500
he'd take me to...

338
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,530
Take me to...

339
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,100
Something Xiang, something Gu,
something Water.

340
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,030
He said that place would
definitely be a jackpot.

341
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,580
Xiangxi Guzhang Yi Waterway?

342
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,630
Yes!

343
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:29,820
That's the place.

344
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,010
Can we still proceed?

345
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,150
There's no more path.

346
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,480
If we continue, we'll really be stuck
in super glue.

347
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,920
How did Uncle Panma pass through?

348
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,030
Watch out!

349
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,450
It must be eating well.

350
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,310
Check out its big size.

351
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,760
Looks like this is the trap
Uncle Panma had set up.

352
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,720
I told you that old man
was suspicious.

353
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,180
He must be hiding something.

354
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,260
Do you think Zhang's stilt house

355
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,780
was burned down by him?

356
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,540
It's possible.

357
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,230
What's that sound?

358
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,920
So many!

359
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,200
I think the spiders are poisonous.

360
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,480
Are you alright?

361
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,730
I'm okay.

362
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,910
Run!

363
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,950
Fatty!

364
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,440
Leave me! You two run!

365
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,550
Are you okay, Fatty?

366
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,960
I'm fine. Let's go!

367
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,210
Go!

368
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,680
Wait.

369
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,480
We've been here.

370
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,460
Fatty.

371
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,280
Isn't this the web your hand got stuck in?

372
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,530
Yes, this is the spot.

373
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,180
Why are we back here?

374
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,230
We've been had.

375
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,450
This way.

376
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:20,610
Looks like Gui was right.

377
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,790
This is a place of no return.

378
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,800
Come on.

379
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
We'll fight them head-on.

380
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,980
Stop cutting.

381
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,940
You won't have enough blood
to splatter.

382
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,230
They're only a handful.

383
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,640
We can handle them.

384
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,280
Come at me, dearies.

385
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,870
Are you okay?

386
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,760
I'm good.

387
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,180
Wu Xie.

388
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,180
I can't move.

389
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,200
You're not dead.

390
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Antidote for the spider poison.

391
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,560
There is no antidote.

392
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,260
If you're bitten by this spider,

393
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,750
you will die.

394
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,320
No antidote?

395
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,470
When I was a boy,
the village worshipped a kind of spider.

396
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,530
The elderly called it the Sacred Spider.

397
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,980
The particular spider's web
is very pliable and sticky.

398
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,320
Animals that get caught in it
will not be able to escape.

399
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,020
If they don't get caught in the web?

400
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,650
They still can't escape.

401
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:10,430
The web emits a kind of poison gas.

402
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,740
Undetectable.

403
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,280
It causes humans to be disoriented,

404
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,360
walking in circles.

405
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,750
If you get bitten,

406
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,310
the poison is lethal.

407
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,420
Although I've heard

408
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,220
that some people with special blood

409
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,780
are unaffected even when bitten,

410
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,610
but I have yet to come across one.

411
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,350
No wonder we couldn't find the way.

412
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,880
This spider poison has an easy fix.

413
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,350
Turn the web into ash.

414
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,350
Mix it with broad bean root

415
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,790
and curcuma powder.

416
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,250
He'll be fine after consuming.

417
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,860
You are the guide for the expedition
back then.

418
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,530
Panma.

419
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,040
You lured us here

420
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,740
to kill us.

421
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,510
Am I right?

422
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,750
I only wanted to scare you guys a little

423
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,020
so you'd know to back off.

424
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,960
I didn't think you'd be so stubborn

425
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,280
and insisted on coming.

426
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,680
I know what it is you wish to ask.

427
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,390
But are you sure

428
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,680
you really want to know?

429
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,640
Even when this matter
would drag us into hell?

430
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,660
Yes.

431
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:58,680
He'll be fine after sleeping.

432
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,930
Now, can you tell us

433
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,860
what had happened back then?

434
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,550
Come with me.

435
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,760
He stays.

436
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,190
I can tell you what happened.

437
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,830
I can tell him.

438
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,010
But not

439
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,270
to this man.

440
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,830
Why can't you tell him?

441
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,400
It's for your own good.

442
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,690
Your two being together

443
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,120
will bring about one of your demise
sooner or later.

444
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,260
Uncle Panma.

445
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,360
I think you're the one

446
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,010
that will cause our demise.

447
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,440
You know me?

448
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,150
Come with me if you want to know.

449
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,070
If not, forget it.

450
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,780
Father.

451
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,080
How are you? Are you alright?

452
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,570
Step outside for a bit.

453
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,540
I have a guest coming.

454
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,550
What did you mean just now?

455
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,710
Why did you say

456
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,300
that my friend and I

457
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,090
will cause one of our demise?

458
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,010
You have no idea

459
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,040
what kind of a person your friend is.

460
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,280
Being with him

461
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,140
will not end well for you.

462
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,800
You know him?

463
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,070
I don't know his face,

464
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,270
but I recognise the smell on him.

465
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,210
What smell?

466
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,860
The smell of the dead.

467
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,560
Are you saying

468
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,050
my friend has killed someone?

469
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,780
I mean he himself

470
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,900
smells of the dead.

471
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,750
You mean my friend is dead?

472
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,110
My friend and I went through
a lot together

473
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,330
and had been to many places.

474
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,150
What kind of a person he is,

475
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,710
I know it well.

476
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,230
I've said everything I could.

477
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,220
It's up to you to believe it or not.

478
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,510
Okay.

479
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,490
I won't force it upon you.

480
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,750
Thanks for the warning.

481
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,200
Can you tell me what happened back then?

482
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,920
You are asking about
the expedition, right?

483
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,190
I knew it.

484
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,150
Someone would come asking me
about it sooner or later.

485
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,350
How many years has it been?

486
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,280
My memory is fuzzy.

487
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,420
I was a young man then.

488
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,110
An archaeological team
came to the village.

489
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,040
They were looking for a lake
on Yang Jiao Mountain.

490
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,710
I knew the mountain inside and out.

491
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,780
So the villagers asked me
to be their guide.

492
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,800
Panma.

493
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,750
Ms Chen.

494
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,250
This is Panma who I told you about.

495
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:50,760
He's the best hunter in the village.

496
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,660
No one knows the mountain paths
better than him.

497
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,670
You won't go wrong asking him
for directions.

498
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,530
Hello, Mr Panma.

499
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,460
I'm Chen Wen Jin.

500
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,130
I'm the leader of the Guangxi Shangsi
Archaeological Team.

501
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,960
Don't be rude to the archaeologist.

502
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,410
It's okay.

503
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,170
Mr Panma.

504
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,070
We are heading for the Northwest
of Yang Jiao Mountain,

505
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,710
to a barrier lake for research.

506
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,470
But the village chief said

507
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,950
that area is quite perilous.

508
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,310
Nobody else but you
dares to venture there.

509
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,200
So we'd like you to be our guide

510
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,920
and help us find the lake.

511
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,870
Don't worry. We'll pay you
for your service.

512
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,830
In addition, we'll supplement you
with five catty of rice grain.

513
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,470
Five catty of rice, Panma.

514
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:46,060
You should thank her.

515
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,520
<i>We travelled for two days
in the mountains</i>

516
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,890
<i>before finally locating the lake.</i>

517
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,320
Here.

518
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,000
<i>It is a backwater lake.</i>

519
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,800
-I think it's up ahead.
-Yes, it is.

520
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,540
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go.

521
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,250
This is the place?

522
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,810
<i>There was no river or stream nearby.</i>

523
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,130
<i>No idea how the lake came about.</i>

524
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,150
This is it.

525
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,690
Look.

526
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,870
<i>After we found it,</i>

527
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,590
<i>they pitched their tents
and erected the campsite.</i>

528
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,120
What were they doing there?

529
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,260
I was only the guide.

530
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,550
I don't know about the rest.

531
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,160
Uncle Panma.

532
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,370
Since you started the story,

533
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,630
don't keep me hanging.

534
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,590
We managed to find you

535
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,330
because we learned of
some details beforehand.

536
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,680
Such as the things that came out
of the mountain,

537
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,670
I've heard of it too.

538
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,120
Since you already know,

539
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,730
I guess I have no reason to hide anything.

540
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,210
<i>They stayed at the lake for two months.</i>

541
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,190
<i>I didn't know what exactly
they were doing.</i>

542
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,970
<i>I didn't dare ask.</i>

543
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,880
<i>At the time,</i>

544
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,400
<i>you shouldn't try to be nosey
when they didn't tell you things.</i>

545
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,280
What are you looking at?

546
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,320
Nothing.

547
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,830
There's nothing to see here.

548
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,190
Hand me the things.

549
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,150
You may go.

550
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,929
<i>One day, I was there
to deliver food supplies.</i>

551
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,920
<i>I saw them transporting</i>

552
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,230
<i>a lot of boxes.</i>

553
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,150
<i>I reckoned</i>

554
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,949
<i>they must have found treasures.</i>

555
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,260
<i>I got curious</i>

556
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,070
<i>and tried to get a closer look.</i>

557
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,210
The things here are dangerous.

558
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,280
You should not touch them.

559
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,620
You said

560
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,450
a weird smell wafted from the box?

561
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,150
It was pungent.

562
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,550
And smelled horrible.

563
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,620
Horrible?

564
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,790
Did it stink?

565
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,330
No.

566
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,810
It was a kind of...

567
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,890
A kind of what?

568
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:27,770
I'm done.

569
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,310
-Hey.
-That's all I know.

570
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:31,070
-You haven't finished the story.
-I'm finished.

571
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,590
-No, you're not.
-That's all I know.

572
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,960
-Uncle Panma.
-You should go.

573
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,220
I need to rest.

574
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,030
Wu Xie.

575
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,000
Sloped-shoulder was here for Panma.

576
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,210
He sneaked around by the window and left.

577
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,650
No wonder Panma suddenly chased me off
halfway through the story.

578
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:20,930
Seems like the one who got Panma
to lure us to Buffalo Trench

579
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,400
was Sloped-shoulder too.

580
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,480
Must be.

581
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,030
What?

582
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,380
When did you wake up?

583
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:34,610
I was already awake on the way back.

584
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,450
You two seemed to enjoy carrying me.

585
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,790
Do you know how heavy you are?

586
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,470
My back almost broke.

587
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,090
Zhang carried me longer than you did.

588
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,310
You don't see him complaining.

589
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,770
You need the training.

590
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,390
Zhang.

591
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,550
Did you hear what Panma said just now?

592
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,890
If that's the case,

593
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,870
the things that Chen Wen Jin
brought out from the mountain

594
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:02,570
were most likely the same metal slabs
found at your house.

595
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,040
Panma also said it.

596
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,780
He said you smell of the dead.

597
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,000
Which I presume

598
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,370
is the smell of the metal slab.

599
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,470
But this slab doesn't smell of the dead.

600
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,430
Zhang doesn't smell of the dead either.

601
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,300
It's been so long.

602
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,200
Even if it did smell,
it would've long dissipated.

603
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,710
Hey.

604
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,050
That Panma.

605
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,550
He strung together

606
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,170
the metal slab,

607
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:40,240
smell of the dead

608
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,020
and danger together.

609
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,450
That means he must have experienced
something else.

610
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,170
But because of Sloped-shoulder's
sudden appearance,

611
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,400
he cut his story short.

612
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,440
Not bad, kiddo.

613
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,240
Your logical thinking is pretty good.

614
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,910
I told you to kill them.

615
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,470
It's fine you failed to do so,

616
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,460
but then you were going to tell them
what happened?

617
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,120
I...

618
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,910
I've had nightmares for 30 over years.

619
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,310
I don't want any more nightmares.

620
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:45,910
Nightmares?

621
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,050
But you committed
those nightmares yourself, no?

622
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,690
If I hadn't shown up at that moment,

623
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,950
I'm afraid

624
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,590
you wouldn't told them

625
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,560
everything that had happened back then.

626
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,340
Yes.

627
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,560
I really do want to tell someone about it.

628
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,470
It's been too long.

629
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,300
I've had enough of keeping it to myself.

630
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,410
Since you no longer wish to live,

631
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,270
then don't.

632
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,430
You brought them here?

633
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,120
Kid,

634
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,570
let's see where you'll run.

635
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,160
These darn spiders again.

636
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,160
Hurry over here.

637
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,530
I scattered deterrent here.

638
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,990
The spiders won't come.

639
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,840
-Hurry!
-Let's go.

640
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,390
He's like you guys,

641
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:22,250
unafraid of the Sacred Spider.

642
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,890
You lured us here this time

643
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,460
so that we could help you
get rid of him, right?

644
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,060
Unfortunately, you guys failed to do so.

645
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,110
Nor can you stay here forever.

646
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,600
I'm old.

647
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,240
I don't care if I die.

648
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,780
But can you guarantee that my son

649
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,280
and grandson will not be implicated
by this matter?

650
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,420
First, are you willing
to tell us the truth

651
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,080
and turn yourself in?

652
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,030
Alright then.

653
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,560
You have my word.

654
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:13,664
