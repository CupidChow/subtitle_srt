1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,940
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,670
<i>Episode 18</i>

5
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,070
I've watched these tapes

6
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,640
more than a dozen times.

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,280
I'm almost blind from it.

8
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,390
There's nothing but static.

9
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,289
However,

10
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,280
there were 30 seconds of content
in one of them.

11
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,550
What was it?

12
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,020
A woman.

13
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,340
Crawling on the ground.

14
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,020
Stop eating!

15
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,270
Have you watched "The Ring"?

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,600
It was similar to that.

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,160
Do you know who that woman was?

18
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,380
My aunt, Huo Ling.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,640
Hey!

20
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,710
Don't you think that is scary?

21
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,980
Why would it be scary?

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,440
The location of the background

23
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,450
was in a sanatorium in Golmud.

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,400
The people from the Paracel Islands
expedition team...

25
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,200
They have been there
ever since they returned.

26
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,570
Did you know

27
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,770
someone else crawled on that floor

28
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,180
besides your aunt?

29
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,160
Who was it?

30
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,280
Wu Xie.

31
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,140
Wu Xie?

32
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,490
Just someone resembling Wu Xie.

33
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,130
So the person you saw

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
might be someone who resembled your aunt.

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,840
What about my own aunt?

36
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,079
Where did she go?

37
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,020
I'm not sure.

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,600
But I know

39
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,610
your aunt will be fine.

40
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,970
By the way,

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,700
did you open up the tapes?

42
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,060
I know.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,960
Wu Xie found a key and a note

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,680
from the recording tapes.

45
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,870
But I opened up every tape there is.

46
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,790
I even looked at them with
my magnifying glass.

47
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,180
But I didn't find a carving

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,700
or a symbol at all.

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,520
I suspect that these people
sent these recording tapes

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,400
to agitate my grandmother.

51
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,730
I worked so hard to

52
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,860
get these tapes from Yin Nan Feng.

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,320
What a waste of my energy!

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,960
Do you think that Yin Nan Feng
would give you the tapes

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,760
if your grandmother didn't approve of it?

56
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,100
No way.

57
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,840
Do you mean

58
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,510
my grandmother wanted to show
me those tapes?

59
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,500
Even if there were clues in the tapes,

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,480
she would've erased them.

61
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,610
But why did she do this?

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,079
For you to lose faith.

63
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,840
Then she underestimated my curiosity.

64
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,680
Xiao Hua.

65
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,579
Now that this was a dead end,

66
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,180
where should we investigate next?

67
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,250
Changsha.

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,760
Zhang.

69
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,880
I finally know your identity.

70
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,710
You were a farmer.

71
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,310
And a very poor one too.

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,270
Bald-headed Chu didn't lie to me.

73
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,610
There's a picture here.

74
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,220
Don't move!

75
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,920
Zhang.

76
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,870
Did you remember something?

77
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,230
Is there a trapdoor here?

78
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,500
Zhang.

79
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,160
Did you set up booby traps at home?

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,210
It's wrong.

81
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
What's wrong?

82
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
The room.

83
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,380
Zhang!

84
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,330
You don't have to wreck your house, right?

85
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,480
What is it?

86
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,670
Why is it so heavy?

87
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,230
Someone took it!

88
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,360
After him!

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,920
Hang on.

90
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,940
Zhang is too fast.

91
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,030
Save your breath.

92
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,030
Let's go after them.

93
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Wait!

94
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,090
Zhang!

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Are you okay?

96
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,060
Zhang.

97
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,720
He has the same tattoo as you.

98
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,430
Is this guy a leech?
How can he run so fast?

99
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,480
Stop talking and go after him!

100
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,170
Wu Xie!

101
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,830
Go.

102
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,900
I'm fine.

103
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,530
-Where is he? Why did you stop?
-He's gone.

104
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,200
-You didn't get him?
-I lost him.

105
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,050
Why did you stop?

106
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,150
We lost him.

107
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,700
So there was someone Zhang couldn't catch.

108
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,100
Who was that guy?

109
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,200
Now that we lost him,

110
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,270
let's take a break here.

111
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
Look after your metal case.

112
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,440
Refreshing.

113
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,430
Refreshing.

114
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,790
You sprayed at me?

115
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,860
-How dare you?
-Stop it!

116
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,950
-How dare you?
-Stop it!

117
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,180
You sprayed at me first!

118
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,390
Alright, that's it!

119
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,640
It's no use to have fun on our own.

120
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,100
Why don't we take a bath

121
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,040
and help restore Zhang's memories?

122
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,310
Zhang.

123
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,900
We'll help you restore your memories.

124
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,810
Zhang.

125
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,980
Your underwear...

126
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,460
I chose it.

127
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,720
Unique, right?

128
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,320
Only I, Mr Fatty, has such
distinguishing eyes

129
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,460
to discover Zhang's childish side

130
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,640
under his cold expression.

131
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,310
It's time for a bath!

132
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,120
This is Master San's house?

133
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,830
It's Xie Lian Huan's house.

134
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,520
His whereabouts and condition are unknown

135
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,870
after leaving Heavenly
Queen Mother's Palace.

136
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,500
But I believe

137
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,100
he would not be dead so easily.

138
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,970
He had deep connections with everything.

139
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,770
So I guess there might be some
clues at his house.

140
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,430
Let's go, you'll open the door.

141
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,120
Why me again?

142
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,430
I told you I wasn't wrong last night.

143
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,590
It was the man with sloped shoulders.

144
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,340
But you insisted that I was drunk.

145
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,270
If I didn't see it myself,

146
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,760
I wouldn't believe how anyone

147
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,240
could have such sloped shoulders.

148
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
That's not right.

149
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,970
I saw the photo.

150
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,520
It was way earlier than when
Chen Wen Jin was in Golmud.

151
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,210
How old would he be?

152
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,900
Logically, he would be an old fogey.

153
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,820
At least 60 years old.

154
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,050
That's weird.

155
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,610
How would he be such a fighter

156
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,340
if he was that age?

157
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,230
Zhang couldn't catch him at all.

158
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,530
I know!

159
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,780
He is the same as Chen Wen Jin.

160
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,170
Do you mean

161
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,630
he mutated as well?

162
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,530
Think about it.

163
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,520
Huo Ling gained immortality
and became a witch.

164
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,040
He is immortal with a sloped shoulders.

165
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,460
Besides, when I was fighting him,

166
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,400
he felt like...

167
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,720
It was like punching mud

168
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,350
when I hit him.

169
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,090
That's right.

170
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,960
He must've mutated as well.

171
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,030
It's not that mystical, right?

172
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,170
Why did we encounter

173
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,400
mutants every time?

174
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,320
Zhang.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,680
Why did he snatch that metal box?

176
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,600
What's the use of it?

177
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,220
There must be treasures in it.

178
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,640
Don't move.

179
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,730
What's inside?

180
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,290
It doesn't feel good.

181
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,840
We should stay away from something

182
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,940
that Zhang says doesn't feel right.

183
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,590
Watch out!

184
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,620
What is this thing?

185
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,850
Zhang.

186
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,970
This doesn't look dangerous.

187
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,400
What is it?

188
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,710
It looks like some sort of a bomb.

189
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,920
Could it be a grenade from the past?

190
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
Do you think Zhang was mad?

191
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,120
Would he keep a grenade under his bed?

192
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,110
What if it went off

193
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,040
when he was sleeping?

194
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,630
He'll live in his dreams forever.

195
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,510
It depends on the dream he had.

196
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,230
What if it was...

197
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,860
Right?

198
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,120
It's not a waste.

199
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,560
Can you be more sensible?

200
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,570
You...

201
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,160
Zhang.

202
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,240
Do you know what it is?

203
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,890
It's only covered in metal.

204
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,190
How do you know?

205
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,480
It's too light.

206
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,660
There's nothing wrong.

207
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,330
How did you figure it out?

208
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,360
You won't understand.

209
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,110
How can we compare to Zhang

210
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
with our amateur skills?

211
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,210
You're the amateur.

212
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,510
I'm more than an amateur.

213
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,960
Besides, why should I compare to Zhang?

214
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,890
We should learn to be humble sometimes.

215
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,120
We would know if
we had an electric scale.

216
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,520
Say,

217
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,830
was something needed

218
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,560
to be preserved in a metal case?

219
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,160
I don't remember.

220
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,390
Could this metal piece

221
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,040
be the first expedition team's target?

222
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,010
Zhang must have hid it away back then

223
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,920
to protect it from something.

224
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,110
And this thing

225
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,440
might not be a simple metal back then.

226
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,360
Look!

227
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
This sloped-shoulder must be a stalker.

228
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,880
We wanted to talk to him,

229
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,850
but he ran.

230
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,380
It's not us.

231
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,820
It's this.

232
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,610
Do you mean

233
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,920
he came for the metal piece?

234
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,450
He came

235
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,020
for the people looking for it.

236
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,010
He must've known

237
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,140
the metal piece was in the stilt house.

238
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,650
He could've taken it if he wanted it.

239
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
Why should he wait till today?

240
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,620
According to you,

241
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,030
we should get ready to meet him.

242
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:07,569
We should be careful.

243
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,819
Let's go back for the photo.

244
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,109
A fire!

245
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,040
The stilt house!

246
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,069
The photo!

247
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,599
Hurry! Save the people first!

248
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,960
Hurry up!

249
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,360
-Uncle Gui!
-Save them!

250
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,700
-Zhang! Zhang!
-It's too hot!

251
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,670
-We can't get close!
-Save them!

252
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,670
Zhang!

253
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,550
Get out from there! It's collapsing!

254
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,520
That way!

255
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,410
Catch!

256
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,830
No way! It's collapsing!

257
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,950
That way!

258
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,750
-Hurry!
-No, we can't wait.

259
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,370
Wu Xie!

260
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,570
He has no protective gear.

261
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,730
He will be burned in such a huge fire!

262
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,410
No way!

263
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,590
Keep it up, everyone!

264
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,090
-Hurry up!
-Zhang!

265
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,340
Zhang!

266
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,980
Hurry!

267
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,230
Zhang!

268
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,720
Xiao Hua.

269
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,550
There's nothing in here.

270
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,210
That cabinet is empty.

271
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,690
It's empty behind the screen.

272
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,940
Even the one under the Buddha
sculpture is empty.

273
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,930
I think this house has been empty

274
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,450
since you went to Tamutuo.

275
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,680
But this flower pot has been watered.

276
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,720
It must be the cleaning maid.

277
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,560
Look.

278
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,080
If the cleaning maid was here,

279
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,440
this room must've been cleaned.

280
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,910
Do you mean Master San...

281
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,460
Xie...

282
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,960
He was here?

283
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,950
My family owned this flower pot.

284
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,570
It's because of this poem?

285
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:20,950
"Send loneliness away from the mind."

286
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,920
<i>Send loneliness away from the mind</i>

287
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,110
"Never ending battle of the
black and white."

288
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,120
The other half of the flower pot
is in my house.

289
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,760
I guess after all these years,

290
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,240
Xie Lian Huan still misses you.

291
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,620
This flower pot was my grandfather's.

292
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,760
He missed Master Jiu.

293
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,030
Not me.

294
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,820
Let's have a look at the study.

295
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,720
Xiao Hua, look.

296
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,380
It's rare to see such an old desktop

297
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,230
even at a junkyard.

298
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,860
Xie Lian Huan is so nostalgic.

299
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,790
<i>Windows Microsoft Internet Explorer</i>

300
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,680
<i>My Computer, Control Panel, Printers</i>

301
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,200
<i>0 Folders (Inlcuding 33 hidden files)</i>

302
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,420
Why would Xie Lian Huan place

303
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,300
an empty computer at home?

304
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,920
As a decoration?

305
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
It's not empty.

306
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
It was deleted.

307
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,790
<i>Search, Hidden Files, Yes</i>

308
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,120
Look, Xiu Xiu.

309
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,680
When a hard disk is formatted,

310
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,520
a hidden file will be created.

311
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,570
And the creation date of this hidden file

312
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,050
is the time of formatting.

313
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,270
<i>Recycle bin, Recycled</i>

314
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,320
<i>General, Recycle bin, Folders

315
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,560
Three hours ago?

316
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,050
Someone was here three hours ago

317
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,570
and deleted all the files?

318
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,600
Seems like we're late.

319
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,790
Could it be Xie Lian Huan himself?

320
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,380
It's possible.

321
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,320
He merely disappeared at the Palace
of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

322
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,160
No one knows where he went.

323
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,860
It might be others as well.

324
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,190
But this person

325
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,030
knows Xie Lian Huan's plot

326
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,430
to pretend as Wu San Xing.

327
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,230
So the lead is another dead end?

328
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,100
That's not for sure.

329
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,650
Perhaps we would be serious about

330
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,500
what was not serious for them.

331
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,440
What are you doing?

332
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,840
Well, can you continue on your own?

333
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,650
I'm finding a place to rest.

334
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,880
Isn't there a chair there?

335
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:07,550
I need my own bed.

336
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,550
Come here, Xiu Xiu.

337
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,480
Someone touched here.

338
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,440
How did you know?

339
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,920
Look at the obvious lines.

340
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,100
The exterior is old,

341
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,030
but it's covered in new
paint on the inside.

342
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,340
There were many books here.

343
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,770
Perhaps we can find something.

344
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,490
Hurry and give them to me!

345
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,200
How could a little girl like you

346
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,830
carry such heavy thermal flasks?

347
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,970
Thank you, Mr Fatty.

348
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,420
Don't call me Mr Fatty.

349
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,380
That's so distant.

350
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,850
I'm not that old from you.

351
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
You can call me Fatty.

352
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,970
How is that quiet mister?

353
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,390
You mean Zhang?

354
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,310
He's fine.

355
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,450
Don't judge him.

356
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,570
He's tough.

357
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,480
Such injuries are minor to him.

358
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,380
Your ointment was useful too.

359
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:34,690
It helped ease the pain.

360
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,870
That is our traditional concoction.

361
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,280
We would always have

362
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,240
mosquito bites and wildfire in the summer.

363
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,600
Every family has one with them.

364
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,080
Yun Cai.

365
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,400
I need to ask you something.

366
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,460
Have you ever seen someone with
a sloped shoulders here?

367
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,640
Like this.

368
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,240
No.

369
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,780
Was someone living in the vicinity of
the burnt stilt house?

370
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,400
It's a wasteland.

371
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,520
No one goes there anymore.

372
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,120
It's getting late.

373
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,000
Hurry to bed.

374
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,110
Good night.

375
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,130
Let's go.

376
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,540
Sleep early.

377
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,750
These days

378
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,940
are relaxing.

379
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,320
It's not that coincidental.

380
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,360
We found the stilt house

381
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,070
and it burnt down right away.

382
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
That's right.

383
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,840
I smelled kerosene when
I arrived at the scene.

384
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,240
It must be the sloped-shoulder's doing.

385
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,190
It's not him.

386
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,650
Not himself, I think.

387
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,260
The house was far away from the river.

388
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,870
He couldn't get there fast enough.

389
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,950
So the arsonist

390
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,120
was his accomplice?

391
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,240
Zhang, the water's ready.
Come and soak you feet.

392
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,470
Don't disturb him on his
trail of thoughts.

393
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,600
Fine.

394
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,600
I'll pour some more.

395
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,330
I'd take the photo out if we had known.

396
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,450
Now what.

397
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:19,950
A fire

398
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,180
burnt everything down to nothing.

399
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,280
Zhang.

400
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,130
You got it from the fire?

401
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,350
Zhang.

402
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,680
Well done!

403
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,460
It's just half of it.

404
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,370
It's better than nothing.

405
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,270
This woman is Chen Wen Jin.

406
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:46,810
Who is this guy?

407
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,140
I guess this was Uncle Panma?

408
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,300
This photo is an old one.

409
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,900
Uncle Panma was the best
hunter in our village.

410
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,130
That's right.

411
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,270
He was the guide I told you about.

412
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,440
He looked like he was 30
years old in this photo.

413
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,200
I was still young back then.

414
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,540
I can't remember anything.

415
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,270
Is this Uncle Panma

416
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,790
dead?

417
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,920
He is

418
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,330
still healthy.

419
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,870
This way, misters.

420
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,790
This is Uncle Panma's house.

421
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,420
Their house

422
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,000
can be considered as a guesthouse.

423
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,770
Where's your father?

424
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,250
My father went into the mountains.

425
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,210
Into the mountains?

426
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,720
Mr Fatty.

427
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,750
He'll only come out after sunset.

428
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,710
Never mind, I knew what would happen.

429
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,760
We never get what we need

430
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,170
whenever we ask for help.

431
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,940
Mr Gui.

432
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,970
These people are?

433
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,380
These are big bosses from town.

434
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,650
They came here specially

435
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,540
to invest and develop
tourism projects here.

436
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,020
Exactly.

437
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,980
Look here, sir.

438
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,960
Uncle Panma hunted these game

439
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,920
from the mountains himself.

440
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,040
These meat

441
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,190
must be scorched with fire first.

442
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,380
Then we'll use

443
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,190
the salt from our old salt well

444
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,530
to cover them up.

445
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,530
We can eat it after it is hung
for three years.

446
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,110
Is Uncle Panma here?

447
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,540
You're here.

448
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,160
This way please.

449
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,240
The thing is,

450
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,030
you came at the wrong time.

451
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
My father hasn't returned.

452
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,600
It's crowded here today.

453
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,730
Everyone's here for Uncle Panma.

454
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,960
Don't you think

455
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,470
her outfit looks familiar?

456
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,270
Looking at her style,

457
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,530
were you reminded of Ah Ning?

458
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,690
Have some water.

459
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,780
-Here.
-He went to the mountains?

460
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,080
What's with your father?

461
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,430
He'll always leave when I'm here.

462
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,650
You know.

463
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,420
My father would always enter the
mountains these days.

464
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,000
Why don't you wait for a while?

465
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,280
He might return soon.

466
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,640
I'm reminding you.

467
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,860
You've taken the deposit.

468
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,780
Don't worry.

469
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,080
I'll give you the thing as I promised.

470
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,550
It's useless for your father.

471
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,640
It's better to sell it.

472
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,990
Take the money and enjoy life.

473
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,180
That's right.

474
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,550
I told him the same thing.

475
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,050
Okay, put more effort into it.

476
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,360
You'll get the benefit if it's done.

477
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,690
I'll contact you when my father returns.

478
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,840
They're here as well.

479
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,740
You mean the tourists?

480
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,990
Tourists?

481
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,120
I don't think so.

482
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,340
Keep an eye on them.

483
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,310
Yes.

484
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:56,810
Young man.

485
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,160
You have a treasure at home?

486
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,110
I'm not harbouring any thoughts.

487
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,290
I just want to give you a reminder.

488
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,540
Don't sell your treasure too quickly.

489
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,930
You have to know the value well.

490
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,500
Look.

491
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,590
It's an affinity for us to meet today.

492
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,900
How about this?

493
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,030
Let us have a look at your treasure.

494
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:16,990
That's right.

495
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,640
It's okay to let him have a look.

496
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,780
He's a professional.

497
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,900
He would know the value.

498
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,940
You won't be fooled.

499
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,450
-Right?
-Yes.

500
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,420
Come.

501
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,860
What kind of treasure does
your father own?

502
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,480
Ceramics?

503
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,590
Bronze?

504
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,140
That's worth some money.

505
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,150
You're all kind souls.

506
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,410
I'll be honest with you.

507
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,360
My father does own something valuable.

508
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,920
He cherishes it well like a treasure.

509
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,190
He said he found it in the mountains.

510
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,720
But I've asked someone

511
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,360
to take a look at that thing.

512
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,310
They said it was a useless metal piece.

513
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,690
Metal piece?

514
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,670
There are various kinds of metal pieces.

515
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,150
Some are worthless,

516
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,190
but some are of high value.

517
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,860
Perhaps the one you asked for
help are not professionals.

518
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,780
Right?

519
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,490
I overheard that you took their deposit.

520
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,490
Are you that anxious?

521
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,460
How about this?

522
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,570
Let me have a look at it.

523
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,720
Shouldn't I be anxious? My son needs
the money for school.

524
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,360
But my father stowed it away
when I said I'm selling it.

525
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,680
I can't find it anywhere.

526
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,340
I wonder what's on that old fogey's mind.

527
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,270
You've read for a whole night?

528
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,580
You're incredible.

529
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,040
Did you find anything?

530
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,860
Nothing valuable.

531
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:19,490
But I found this book

532
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,770
with a torn page in the middle.

533
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,240
Can you see what is it?

534
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,650
This indentation

535
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,410
can't be identified with raw eyes.

536
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,500
We have to use electrostatic equipment.

537
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:39,830
Do you mean we're stuck again?

538
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,110
I mean I have a vast social network.

539
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,360
I have professional friends in
Changsha who can help.

540
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,810
I guess this metal piece

541
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,100
was thrown into the mountains
by Uncle Panma.

542
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,760
The old man was worried about it,

543
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,080
so he went into the mountains
to look for it.

544
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,410
We don't have to care where he hid it.

545
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,690
Sooner or later, it'll end
up in my pocket.

546
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,710
Wu Xie.

547
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,910
I'm not boasting.

548
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,470
You can ask Panjiayuan.

549
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,160
No one can compare to me

550
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,290
when it comes to treasure hunting.

551
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,730
But I don't understand.

552
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,780
What is in this metal piece anyway?

553
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,250
It's such a tough nut to crack.

554
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,600
This saw blade failed as well.

555
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:49,610
Here, here.

556
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,370
I don't know what else I can do.

557
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,110
Saw blades in the whole village

558
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,070
are all broken.

559
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,020
How about this?

560
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,620
I'll get some sulphuric acid in town.

561
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,770
Sulphur can melt metal.

562
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,700
Wait for it.

563
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,480
I don't believe I can't open it.

564
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,199
It was just a flash yesterday.

565
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,929
Zhang.

566
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,719
Can you remember
the sloped-shoulder's tattoo?

567
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,920
Yes.

568
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,870
It's like the one you have.

569
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,030
It's not the same.

570
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,200
Fatty is out for such a long time.

571
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,890
Why hasn't he returned?

572
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,380
Did something happen?

573
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,120
Yun Cai.

574
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,310
Slow down.

575
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,980
I have only one working eye.

576
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,840
I can't catch up to you.

577
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,050
The villagers would run away
from a hornet's nest.

578
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,090
You were so brave to poke it.

579
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,920
I just wanted

580
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,520
to get you some fresh honeycomb.

581
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,550
We're poor,

582
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,690
but we can afford fresh honey.

583
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,630
Can it be the same from
store bought honey?

584
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:46,010
It lacks the vital flavour.

585
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,910
What flavour?

586
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,150
The flavour of love.

587
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,790
Yun Cai!

588
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,970
Wait for me!

589
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,050
Wait!

590
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,870
I really can't see!

591
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,140
What you've drawn

592
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,260
is definitely not the same as your Qilin.

593
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,470
The fierce beast, Qiongqi.

594
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,560
You got it?

595
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,620
It appeared.

596
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,480
If you're not wrong,

597
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,630
the drawing method and style

598
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,080
of the Qiongqi

599
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,950
and Zhang's Qilin tattoo

600
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,560
must be from the same series.

601
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,210
They must be drawn by the same person.

602
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,270
Do you think Zhang and sloped-shoulder
are relatives?

603
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,680
You're overthinking.

604
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,550
This...

605
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,020
I'm making a reasonable hypothesis.

606
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,140
Think about Zhang's unique tattoo.

607
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,940
If he was not related to Zhang,

608
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,250
why do they similar tattoos

609
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,500
in the same spot?

610
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,160
Zhang.

611
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,160
Don't you remember anything?

612
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
It could be

613
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,440
their family emblem.

614
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,480
Look.

615
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,150
Qilin,

616
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,160
Qiongqi,

617
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,120
Taotie,

618
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,430
and Taowu. They are all mystical beasts.

619
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,290
One type per generation.

620
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,120
Pretty good idea.

621
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,650
Their family members won't have to speak

622
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,770
when they meet.

623
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,640
They can remove their clothes

624
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,840
and see who's the eldest and the youngest.

625
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,940
Zhang, who is the elder

626
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,460
between you and him?

627
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,720
You're the youngest.

628
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
I'm fine with that.

629
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,960
I want to become relatives with Zhang.

630
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,250
With his skilled martial arts

631
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,200
and his precious bloodline,

632
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,430
I'm willing to be his grandson.

633
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,870
Right, Grandpa?

634
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,280
No.

635
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,240
Fine.

636
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,320
Zhang is an honest man.

637
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,280
He didn't take advantage of me.

638
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,790
But coming back to the topic,

639
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,250
I think I made a reasonable guess.

640
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,720
Wu Xie.

641
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,400
You're from the Mystic Nine.

642
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,620
Didn't you hear about this Qiongqi tattoo?

643
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,010
Zhang knows more about Mystic Nine
than me.

644
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,800
If only he was here.

645
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,970
I could ask him.

646
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,080
Who?

647
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,730
Your Uncle San?

648
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,960
Would an old fox like him

649
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,360
tell you the truth?

650
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,890
Someone might know about this.

651
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,790
What did Wu Xie send me?

652
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,240
Let me see.

653
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,090
<i>CMCC, Messages, Music</i>

654
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,570
Qiongqi?

655
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,720
Qiongqi?

656
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,600
Wu Xie.

657
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,560
Xiao Hua.

658
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,160
I sent you a picture.

659
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,780
I saw it, it's Qiongqi.

660
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
This is a tattoo.

661
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,220
Do you know anyone with this tattoo?

662
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,360
<i>No.</i>

663
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,420
But I can investigate.

664
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:38,820
Okay.

665
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,140
This word is "Yi."

666
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,270
And these two words...

667
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:48,450
Looks more like Xiangxi to me.

668
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,710
Xiangxi?

669
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,020
Xiangxi is a large place.

670
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,530
Look at the two strokes and the cross.

671
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,480
Can you see what it is?

672
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:02,050
Is this friend of yours reliable?

673
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,240
It's originally hard to
restore indentation.

674
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,590
We should be thankful to

675
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,620
obtain this clue.

676
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,330
But this is too vague.

677
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,460
Besides Xie Lian Huan,

678
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,290
who could tell what this means?

679
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,430
We'll ask him then.

680
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,880
Are you joking?

681
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,140
Why should we make such effort

682
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,780
and take the long route

683
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,340
if we could find him?

684
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,880
We can't find him.

685
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,480
But we can ask his affiliates.

686
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,030
Someone would know his whereabouts.

687
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,230
Do you know who contacted him recently?

688
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,280
Mop.

689
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,560
Mop?

690
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,720
Master Hua'er.

691
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,440
We're friends for life and death.

692
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,060
That's not right.

693
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,040
We should skip this.

694
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,910
It's in the wine.

695
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,850
A toast to you.

696
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,180
You're so rich.

697
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,780
Why did you risk yourself for

698
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:00,950
for Wu San Xing to Tamutuo?

699
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,310
Master Hua'er.

700
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,950
This is my side job.

701
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,160
A low-cost business

702
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
with no earnings.

703
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,300
My place is a bit small,

704
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,280
but the food tastes good.

705
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,800
Please have a taste.

706
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,900
Master Hua'er.

707
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,220
From now on,

708
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,520
this is your kitchen.

709
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,810
If you come to Changsha again,

710
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,110
don't eat outside.

711
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,420
Feel free to eat here.

712
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,590
Mop.

713
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,100
I'm not here to eat and drink here.

714
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,790
Master Hua'er, tell me what you want.

715
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,790
Count everything on me.

716
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,520
When Wu San Xing was
recruiting at Tamutuo,

717
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,460
how did he find you?

718
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,220
One of my friends introduced me.

719
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,390
Are you looking for him?

720
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,670
I'll get him.

721
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:47,744
