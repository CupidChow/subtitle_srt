1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,840
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,759
<i>Episode 24</i>

4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,240
Mr Xie, come out.

5
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,240
Our boss has spoken.

6
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,220
We won't make it difficult for you.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,720
I'm sure the Mystic Nine

8
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,880
aren't lowly burglars, right?

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,160
Boss, we've searched everywhere.

10
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,160
No one's here.

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,040
What about the stuff?

12
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,000
We've checked them as well.

13
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,880
All of them are here.

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,520
Something's wrong with that blind guy.

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,960
Wu Xie, here's a dagger.

16
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,390
You can keep it.

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,410
I'll use this.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
Zhang.

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,320
Wu Xie.

20
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,960
Look at this.

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,320
How many mezzanines are there?

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,240
At first, it was one by one.

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,760
But now, it's a team fight!

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,079
Come on!

25
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
This is killing me!

26
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,610
I didn't had my fill in the first place.

27
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,900
I don't have enough stamina.

28
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,480
How could these
monsters recognise us?

29
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,280
I think this is strange as well.

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,800
Their attacks are too accurate.

31
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:27,880
It's nothing strange.

32
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
It's another snake?

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,160
Darn it.

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,520
No wonder it looked so familiar.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,240
So, they're the upgrades of
Heavenly Queen Mother's jade soldiers.

36
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,240
Mr Hendry,

37
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,040
what kind of technology is this?

38
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
Let me show you.

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,880
Wait.

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Mr Hendry,

41
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,920
what do you mean?

42
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,430
This is high-tech indeed.

43
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,519
Take a seat.

44
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,760
I said take a seat, please.

45
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,320
You and Xiao Jiu
don't need to be like this.

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,550
Like what I've said.

47
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,470
You know that only Wu Xie
and Zhang Qi Ling

48
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,120
can find the Old Pavilion.

49
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,240
Others will die down there.

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,040
I hope you could think about
what I've said.

51
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
That's what I told Xiao Hua.

52
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,560
But he doesn't know the amount
of effort you've put in.

53
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
You can stop pretending now.

54
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,520
You two liars.

55
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,440
I...

56
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,160
Boss, they're coming.

57
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,880
Your friends are very prudent.

58
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
Yeah.

59
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Kung fu.

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Chinese Kung fu.

61
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
It's great.

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,159
Boss,

63
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
do we take him?

64
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,280
Your call, Mr Black.

65
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:46,610
Of course.

66
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
Why not?

67
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Let's take him.

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,950
Scoundrel,

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
you betrayed me again.

70
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,080
I really didn't betray you this time.

71
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Look.

72
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,870
I'm speaking the truth.

73
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,880
These aren't ordinary snakes.

74
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,240
They can sense heat.

75
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,200
The cave was too cold.

76
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,720
That's why they've been hibernating.

77
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,880
According to you,

78
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,360
they're awake because
they sensed the heat in our torches?

79
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,720
They will wake up sooner or later.

80
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,480
Zhang is right.

81
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
Even if we don't light our torches,

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,680
they can sense our body heat.

83
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,240
If we starve for a few more days,

84
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
and we deplete all our energy,

85
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,040
we will have no chance against them.

86
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,640
They're here again?

87
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,600
Wu Xie, did you bring some explosives?

88
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,280
I'm going to blow them up!

89
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,280
I only have diving equipment.

90
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,760
Where do I get explosives for you?

91
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,600
Wu Xie, why do I feel that

92
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
they're getting faster and faster?

93
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,840
When we fight, our body temperature
will increase.

94
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,320
And they'll become faster as well.

95
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
Who designed this stupid puzzle?

96
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,480
I'll greet his ancestors for him!

97
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
Anyone except for you, Zhang.

98
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,810
But, aren't your ancestors too cruel?

99
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,020
This can't do!

100
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,060
If we continue this,

101
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,760
we'll be exhausted
before we finish the fight!

102
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,160
We mustn't think like the Zhang family.

103
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,440
We must do the opposite!

104
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,680
Go to the mezzanine!

105
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,190
That means we're crashing their base!

106
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,880
That's better than
being attacked from all sides!

107
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,000
If there's an exit there,

108
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,200
we'll be saved!

109
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,360
This torch can't last for long.

110
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,120
There aren't many jade soldiers left.

111
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go.

112
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,000
When you live under one's roof,

113
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,799
you need to bow down.

114
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,360
Xiao Hua, forget it.

115
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,080
The Mystic Nine is quite a team.
You always think about

116
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,280
saving Wu Xie's life, huh?

117
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,000
I know you may not

118
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
be able to enter the Old Pavilion,

119
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,600
but don't worry.

120
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
We won't be in the way when you must go.

121
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,840
In fact,

122
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm going to force you to go
when necessary,

123
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,160
even if you don't want to.

124
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,280
But, now is not the right time.

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,840
But Wu Xie has vanished
for most of the day.

126
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,560
I believe he's still alive.

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
I left him

128
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,960
a flare launcher before

129
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,200
he got into the water.

130
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,020
Even if he fires and misses,

131
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,430
we can see it from here.
I'm sure he will fire it

132
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:19,150
if he's actually in danger.

133
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,630
What if Wu Xie's dead?

134
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,000
Even if he's dead,

135
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,840
we won't lose his GPS signal.

136
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,200
No, he must've gone into somewhere

137
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,680
that we can't track.

138
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,440
Wu Xie.

139
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,800
Stay cautious.

140
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,440
Let's go.

141
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,350
<i>Where the signal cannot be tracked,</i>

142
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,600
that's the place

143
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
you're looking for, right?

144
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,810
That's right.

145
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,240
So we can't let you stop them.

146
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,040
You sure are patient.

147
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,920
When you live to my age, you will be.

148
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,720
Boss.

149
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,600
Mr Black,

150
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,480
you're running a good business.

151
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,280
Another boss of yours is coming.

152
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
You're my boss!

153
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,200
And you.

154
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,380
Okay.

155
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
You can stop now.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,440
The other boss is already here.

157
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,640
Really?

158
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm really sorry.

159
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,460
So, why don't you invite him here?

160
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,080
So I can treat him

161
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,400
to a cup of tea.

162
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,760
Zhang!

163
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,120
You can't just dash off by yourself.

164
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,160
We can't do anything to help you.

165
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,250
Yeah.

166
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,760
Stay close.

167
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,680
A dead end.

168
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,400
We fought the entire day, you know?

169
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,080
And now, we're in a maze?

170
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,680
The Zhang family
must be out of their mind!

171
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,000
How do they get out
if they seal the exit?

172
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,640
You're right.

173
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
As long as it's a maze,

174
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,680
it'll have an exit.

175
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,680
When the Zhang family designed
the jade soldiers,

176
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,510
they must've put them in
starting from the inner part

177
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,680
before they left.

178
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,760
If not,

179
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,320
they would be trapped themselves.

180
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,360
You got a point.

181
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,860
Let's return then.

182
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,600
Let's go.

183
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,360
So many mezzanines.

184
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,600
Are we going to try them one by one?

185
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,920
We'll be dead before we find the exit.

186
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,880
-Zhang!
-Zhang!

187
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,350
This way.

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,360
Did you remember something?

189
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,680
It's a hunch.

190
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,960
Is your hunch accurate?

191
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,360
Now, we can only believe in Zhang.

192
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,590
Zhang had the same hunch

193
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,640
when he was in the stilt house.

194
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,010
That's how he found the steel piece.

195
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,720
Fine.

196
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,720
Since Zhang belongs
to the Zhang family as well.

197
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,760
This is your territory.

198
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,720
You make the call.

199
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,880
Let's go!

200
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,480
Zhang,

201
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,440
there are two paths here.

202
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,640
Which path should we take?

203
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,400
Zhang,

204
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,400
you're not reliable as a
human navigator at all!

205
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,240
Why do I feel like

206
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,360
their numbers are increasing?

207
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,480
Maybe our fire torch was extinguished.

208
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,760
That's why they're coming again.

209
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,960
Zhang!

210
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,600

Since the Zhang family designed this maze,

221

I'm sure they'll leave some clues
for their future generations.

00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,950
Cooperation?

343
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
We need to make a balanced deal for that.

344
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,580
What do you have?

345
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,130
Your goal is to find the Old Pavilion.

346
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,480
My goal is to find my nephew,

347
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,000
Wu Xie.

348
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,480
We have different goals.

349
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,800
My equipment and manpower

350
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,000
outpower yours.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,800
And,

352
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I'm sure the Wu family

353
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,160
has more information than you.

354
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,560
So,

355
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,080
you don't have the right
to request a cooperation.

356
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,360
If,

357
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,360
you don't create trouble for me,

358
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,840
naturally, I won't do anything to you.

359
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
But, if you do create trouble for me,

360
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,960
I'll sink your entire team into the river.

361
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,720
I'll grant you guys immortality.

362
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,000
All that just to save your nephew?

363
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,600
Why did you hire Mr Black then?

364
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,640
Who gave you the right to speak?

365
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
I'm speaking on behalf of my boss!

366
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,960
If you speak another word,

367
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,520
I'll sew your lips together.

368
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,280
It's been a long time since
I've sewn someone's lips together.

369
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,520
Fatty,

370
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,200
I'll bring Zhang out first.

371
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,080
I'll come for you once I'm done.

372
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
Believe me.

373
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,920
I'll bring you back alive.

374
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,880
I will bring you back.

375
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
Alive.

376
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,000
Let's go.

377
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,880
Just hold on a little longer.

378
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,240
We'll be there soon.

379
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,680
Wu Xie.

380
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,200
Luckily

381
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,320
I didn't cause your demise.

382
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
I will bring you home.

383
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,280
Mr Wu,

384
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,110
you're the descendent of Mr Gou Wu.

385
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
And he was kind to us.

386
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,160
So, you deserve the same courtesy.

387
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,070
Enjoy

388
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,840
the Junshan Yinzhen.

389
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,960
Boss, someone fired a flare
in the mountains.

390
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,250
Wu Xie.

391
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,280
Wu Xie.

392
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,270
Wu Xie.

393
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,560
We've patched up
Zhang's and Fatty's injuries.

394
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,880
Master Er had called for
a medical team to Changsha.

395
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,880
We'll go to Changsha immediately.

396
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,080
And meet up with them.

397
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,520
We should go now.

398
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,680
Wait.

399
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,960
I need to meet Cox Hendry.

400
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,520
Master Xiao San,

401
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,120
our cooperation went
pretty smoothly, right?

402
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,000
I want to ask you this.

403
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,440
What makes you think that
I could enter the Old Pavilion?

404
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,240
I'm not sure,

405
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,440
but I think you're the one.

406
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,680
We know that

407
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,600
only people of the Zhang family
could enter the Old Pavilion.

408
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
And the places where
Zhang Qi Ling had been before,

409
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,400
you,

410
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,760
were there with him.

411
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Don't you think the Mystic Nine

412
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,200
is trying to train you on purpose?

413
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,460
Even if the Mystic Nine
were to train me on purpose,

414
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,760
does that mean I could enter the place?

415
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,400
I can't answer that question.

416
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,160
You need to ask the Mystic Nine.

417
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,760
Besides, you got out safely.

418
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,600
Doesn't that mean you can enter
the place without any problem?

419
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,680
I never entered the Old Pavilion.

420
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,560
And I'm not the person you're looking for.

421
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,560
Underwater,

422
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
I did see an old pavilion.

423
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,880
But it was protected by a bell formation.

424
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,000
The people you've sent down there

425
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,000
must've met their demise
outside the place.

426
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,400
If I hadn't destroyed the illusion,

427
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,160
I would've died as well!

428
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,120
Did you learn nothing at all?

429
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,880
According to what you said,

430
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,080
after you went underwater,

431
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,000
you saw the top of the Old Pavilion.

432
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
But you couldn't enter it from the top.

433
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,320
After that, the siphon passage
took you to the underwater cave.

434
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,240
And you managed to escape
through the mountain hole.

435
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,440
Wu Xie,

436
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,080
you said

437
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,600
some jade soldiers attacked you guys.

438
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,480
Are they the same type
from the Heavenly Queen Mother's palace?

439
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,680
They're very similar.

440
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,240
But they're different.

441
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,030
These jade soldiers
look green on the outside.

442
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
And it feels like they're made out
of amber.

443
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,960
And the snakes within their bodies
that can operate their mechanism

444
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,640
can detect a human's body heat.

445
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,520
The mechanism you're talking about

446
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,800
should be the Mi Luo Tuo.

447
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,960
Mi Luo Tuo?

448
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,760
Uncle Er,

449
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,000
you heard of this before?

450
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,440
I heard about this from your grandfather.

451
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,600
The snake hiding inside their bodies,

452
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,440
they're called Black-Haired Snakes.

453
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,480
Under low temperature,

454
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,520
these snakes will hibernate.

455
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,480
But once the temperature rises,

456
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,280
they will wake up.

457
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
When your grandfather told me about them,

458
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,920
I thought he was lying to me.

459
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,040
But, I didn't expect that

460
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,160
the Black-Haired Snakes do exist.

461
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,200
If we didn't light the torches,

462
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,080
I guess they wouldn't have woken up.

463
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,240
Weal and woe come in a package.

464
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,830
If you didn't wake them up

465
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,720
and open the passage,

466
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,910
I'm afraid you guys

467
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,120
wouldn't be able to escape.

468
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,960
I'm sure the Zhang family
designed these traps

469
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,680
in order to deter any invaders.

470
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,760
If you enter the underwater village,
the bell formation will be triggered.

471
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,960
And you'll be caught in an illusion.

472
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,310
But, if the siphon passage catches you,

473
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,640
you'll be attacked by Mi Luo Tuo.

474
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,360
The problem now is that both paths

475
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,410
will be wrong no matter what.

476
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,520
If not,

477
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Zhang, who belongs to the Zhang family,

478
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,720
should be able to find the entrance

479
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,280
since he has been there for several days.

480
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,810
If there are Mi Luo Tuo inside and outside
the Old Pavilion,

481
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,640
does that mean no one can enter the place?

482
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Not necessarily.

483
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,850
What is this?

484
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,200
When we went into the mountains,

485
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,640
we found some shards of Mi Luo Tuo
on your bodies.

486
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,160
What is inside the pot?

487
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,160
Some strong acid?

488
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
Sodium hydroxide.

489
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,920
It's a strong base.

490
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,240
This thing melts when
it touches a strong base.

491
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,160
That means

492
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,280
the Mi Luo Tuo
aren't that powerful at all.

493
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,360
That may be the case,

494
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,200
but it's useless if you only
have a strong base.

495
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Think about it.

496
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,290
You guys were underwater for so long,

497
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,400
yet you couldn't find
the Old Pavilion's entrance at all.

498
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,440
You said that

499
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,560
you guys followed the tattoo
on Zhang's body

500
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,760
and managed to escape.

501
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,160
Zhang is the living map!

502
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,280
I know.

503
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,990
But he lost his memories, right?

504
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,400
I'm talking about this!

505
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,380
Look at this.

506
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,060
It resembles the jade cave
we were in just now.

507
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,800
Yes.

508
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,120
Even the tattoo

509
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,680
can only lead you out of

510
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,440
the cave filled with Mi Luo Tuo.

511
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,640
It didn't help you guys
to find the Old Pavilion.

512
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,680
Seems like your second uncle was right.

513
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,000
That is

514
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,360
only a defence mechanism.

515
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,800
That isn't the entrance.

516
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,000
Come in.

517
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,520
Uncle Er,

518
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,080
can you tell me the truth?

519
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,470
Did you know that

520
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,620
the entrance to the Old Pavilion

521
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,800
wasn't there at all?

522
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,280
You guys should stop overthinking.

523
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,560
How would I know?

524
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,600
I just thought of it when you guys

525
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,120
were analysing the situation.

526
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,750
This is strange.

527
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,320
Why didn't they write down

528
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,719
such important information?

529
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,560
Master Er,

530
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,080
where did you get them?

531
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,199
I was wondering why
Master San's valuable information

532
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,120
was gone.

533
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,400
So, you had them.

534
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,120
What do you mean by that?

535
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,600
Do you guys think that
you're the only one

536
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,889
who's trying to steal information?

537
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,639
I'm just hiding them beforehand.

538
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,719
Besides, this is my territory.

539
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,000
So what if I touch my brother's item?

540
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,040
Uncle Er,

541
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,240
where exactly did you put

542
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,560
Uncle San's data?

543
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,800
I just changed the spot.

544
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,960
They're all here.

545
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,000
All of them are here.

546
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,680
You're hiding them in plain sight.

547
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,640
Master Er is wise indeed.

548
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,120
The information isn't on the book rack,

549
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,280
but it's still at home.

550
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,720
The Old Pavilion isn't in the water,

551
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,840
but in the mountains.

552
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,060
<i>When I was underwater,</i>

553
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,080
<i>I saw the top of the Old Pavilion.</i>

554
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,560
<i>That means</i>

555
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,320
<i>the main body of the Old Pavilion</i>

556
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,640
<i>should be underwater.</i>

557
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,200
And it is connected to the mountains.

558
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,510
<i>In the mountains, there were many paths</i>

559
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,120
<i>that acted like mazes.</i>

560
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,440
So, if all of them

561
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,120
were defence mechanism
designed by the Zhang family,

562
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,640
I'm sure they were
trying to protect something.

563
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,800
The most possible explanation

564
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,380
is that they're trying to
protect the Old Pavilion!

565
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,310
You kids,

566
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,840
I guess I can't hide this any longer.

567
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,750
Master Er,

568
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,720
why did you stop us
from investigating this?

569
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
There's nothing to investigate.

570
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,360
My grandfather and my father

571
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,120
were trying to discover this secret.

572
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,080
My grandfather died in Biao Zi Ridge.

573
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,030
Although my father
didn't die a violent death,

574
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,280
but before he died,
he instructed us to bury him

575
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,110
in an iron coffin.

576
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,760
It's precisely because
he's afraid of stirring up troubles.

577
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,240
But now, my third brother
had gone missing.

578
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,350
Do you know why your grandfather

579
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,720
called you Wu Xie?

580
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,960
You're the purest child

581
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
the Wu family have had in so many years.

582
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,240
But now, you're the
most involved in this case

583
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,000
I went to Cox Hendry's camp to find you.

584
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
That is a violation of my principle.

585
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,920
I can ignore the Mystic Nine.

586
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,200
But you,

587
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,440
I can't ignore you.

588
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,070
Boss,

589
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,070
why did you hire me

590
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,480
to protect Master Hua then?

591
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,730
I think he was the one behind this.

592
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:06,850
Yes.

593
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,800
He cares about you the most.

594
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
I know.

595
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,840
He even stole my flower pot.

596
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,120
"Send loneliness away from the mind"?

597
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,080
<i>Send loneliness away from the mind</i>

598
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,400
Never ending battle of
the black and white.

599
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,600
The flower pot with the other line
is in my house.

600
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,080
Actually, even after so many years,

601
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
Xie Lian Huan still cares about you.

602
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,640
<i>Send loneliness away from the mind</i>

603
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,680
Uncle Er,

604
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,640
can you tell me

605
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,230
what's inside the photo

606
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,080
we saw in the stilt house?

607
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,000
What stilt house?

608
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,640
Stop pretending.

609
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,380
If you can hire Mr Black
to protect Xiao Hua,

610
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,800
and save us from Cox Hendry,

611
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,560
that means you know our tracks
very well.

612
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,760
During our investigation,

613
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,800
the biggest clue we had

614
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,160
was in the stilt house.

615
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,280
<i>I always thought Sloped-shoulder</i>

616
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,880
<i>had burned the photo.</i>

617
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,120
<i>But he has been protecting
Banai for so many years.</i>

618
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,160
<i>He could've burned it a long time ago
if he wanted to.</i>

619
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,240
<i>As for Cox Hendry,</i>

620
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,360
<i>he wants to enter
the Old Pavilion as well.</i>

621
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,480
<i>So, he has no reason</i>

622
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,230
<i>to burn those photos.</i>

623
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,320
So, most likely,

624
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,640
you were the one behind this.

625
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,180
Although San hopes that
you guys can continue the investigation,

626
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,110
it's different for me.

627
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,480
I'm afraid you guys will repeat
our past mistakes.

628
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,760
Fine.

629
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,640
I won't force you then.

630
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,670
You can tell me

631
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,040
when you feel like it

632
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,240
or when you think I need it.

633
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,000
Okay.

634
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,920
How about this?

635
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,440
Seems like I can't

636
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,120
stop you guys.

637
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,080
But I have one condition.

638
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,840
No matter when,

639
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,720
you guys must report to me

640
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,760
when you're in danger.

641
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,920
Master Er,

642
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,960
what's exactly in the Old Pavilion?

643
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,560
Why is the Mystic Nine,

644
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,720
Cox Hendry,

645
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,430
and their archaeological team

646
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,280
trying to enter the place so badly?

647
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,840
I thought you guys found a clue?

648
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,200
We only know that

649
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,440
the secret hidden within the Old Pavilion

650
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,480
is related to immortality.

651
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,760
Yes.

652
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,680
Since ancient times, emperors

653
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,280
have been trying to search
for a way to obtain immortality.

654
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,000
<i>They believe that</i>

655
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,280
<i>the secret to immortality</i>

656
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,160
<i>is hidden in the graves of the ancients.</i>

657
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,440
<i>Thus,</i>

658
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,320
<i>they've sent many people
to investigate such places.</i>

659
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
<i>During the process,</i>

660
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,260
<i>I'm sure they had found some clues.</i>

661
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,680
<i>And these clues would form new ideas.</i>

662
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,920
<i>When these ideas were born,</i>

663
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,320
<i>at the same time,</i>

664
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,360
<i>obstacles were born as well.</i>

665
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,080
<i>And, it appeared.</i>

666
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
No one wants an outsider

667
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,210
to know all these secrets.

668
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,510
Especially

669
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,840
it.

670
00:40:16,054 --> 00:40:26,054
