1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,880
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 20</i>

4
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,979
Back then,

5
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,060
we were impoverished.

6
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,570
You kids nowadays

7
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,930
have no idea.

8
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,320
Boys and girls

9
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,180
running everywhere barefooted.

10
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,290
Never having enough to eat.

11
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,010
One big family

12
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,730
could not even get one jin
of rice a month.

13
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,980
At that time,

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,370
the ration brought by the expedition team

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,370
was too big

16
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,930
of a temptation

17
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,090
for all of us.

18
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,740
<i>Rice</i>

19
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
Found it.

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,600
What a haul.

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,829
This can sustain my family for a year.

22
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,910
Load them up, quickly.

23
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,829
Come on.

24
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,910
Hurry.

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,360
Listen,

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,570
only two bowls of rice per bag.

27
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,150
Any more than that,
they'll notice it. Got it?

28
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,030
Sure.

29
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,230
Cai Wang,

30
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,360
do you see that pot?

31
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,640
That's real lard.

32
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Go get it.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,720
-Okay.
-Go.

34
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,570
Faster.

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,760
You took too much.

36
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,720
The bottom.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,920
Scoop from the bottom.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The bottom.

39
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,880
Don't scoop too much.

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,650
What are you doing?

41
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,450
Panma?

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,400
You're the guide,

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,320
yet you're stealing
the expedition's property?

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
We're just so hungry.

45
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,320
Please let us go.

46
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,840
-It won't happen again...
-Enough excuses!

47
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,640
-I'm taking you to the captain.
-No.

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,410
No, I won't!

49
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,600
Is...

50
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,170
Is he dead?

51
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,150
Xiao Ma, I killed him.

52
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,040
What do I do?

53
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,709
I killed him. What do I do?

54
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,790
I killed him.

55
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,600
Calm down.

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,899
Your screams will only attract the others.

57
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,360
Then none of us will escape.

58
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,420
We'll all face the firing squad,
you hear me?

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Okay.

60
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,670
Panma,

61
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,860
now what do we do?

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,230
Carry him

63
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,310
and follow me.

64
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes.

65
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,230
Hurry.

66
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Move it!

67
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Come on.

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
You guys...

69
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
You guys...

70
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,630
You guys...

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,890
Now what?

72
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
We're done for.

73
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,650
Panma,

74
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,730
let's run for it.

75
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,150
We've killed two men.

76
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,420
Where can we run to?

77
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,180
This is getting out of hand.

78
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,430
Are we going to hide
in the mountains forever?

79
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,740
Then what can we do?

80
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,860
Since we offed two of them,

81
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,370
we may as well off the rest.

82
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,810
Why don't we get them

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,420
while they're still asleep?

84
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,210
If Panma doesn't say anything,

85
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,760
the outsiders will think

86
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,180
the enemy did it.

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,070
Panma,

88
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,170
just say the word.

89
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,930
We'll do it.

90
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,270
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

91
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,350
Say the word.

92
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,880
Panma, cool down.

93
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,110
Stop sinking further into sin.

94
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,300
Get a grip on yourself.

95
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,330
Pretty much the entire expedition
was done away with.

96
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,980
All of us

97
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,810
were consumed by bloodlust.

98
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,650
We were like wild beasts,

99
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,740
unable to control ourselves.

100
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,370
Together, we threw the bodies

101
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,530
into the lake.

102
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,150
But...

103
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,490
But then,

104
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,860
the most terrifying incident

105
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,850
I've ever seen in my life happened.

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Move it here.

107
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Okay.

108
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,030
Easy there.

109
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,350
Be careful with that.

110
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,550
-It's kind of heavy.
-Here.

111
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,000
-Sure.
-Here.

112
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:59,909
Let's go.

113
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,670
Watch your step.

114
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,710
Sure.

115
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,920
Be careful when you carry that.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Alright.

117
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,190
Who goes there?

118
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,200
Panma, cool down.

119
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,090
Stop sinking further into sin.

120
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,930
Why are you staring at us like that?

121
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,440
What's the matter?

122
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Are you alright?

123
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,650
Aren't you supposed to deliver
the supplies today?

124
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,140
What are you doing here?

125
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,409
I'm

126
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,870
hunting.

127
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,950
Hunting?

128
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,340
Here?

129
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,640
Didn't I tell you?

130
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,100
Don't come here unless
you're delivering supplies.

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Beat it.

132
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Sure.

133
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,560
The dead cannot come back to life.

134
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,410
Surely they were demons.

135
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,730
Demons from the lake.

136
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,490
Are you sure

137
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,340
they were the same as when
they were alive?

138
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,140
The very same.

139
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,750
What?

140
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,370
You don't believe me?

141
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,270
I do.

142
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,220
But with one difference.

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,660
There was a strange odour on their bodies.

144
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,170
You mean

145
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,730
the stench of death?

146
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,700
That's why you think

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,780
Zhang is dangerous?

148
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,140
Zhang has that smell, too.

149
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,730
So you think

150
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,490
he's an undead?

151
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,150
But that doesn't mean

152
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,410
he'd harm us.

153
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,170
Why were you so scared?

154
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,360
Did something happen afterward?

155
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,220
All my companions

156
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,580
<i>came to the lake eventually,</i>

157
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,020
<i>and encountered the demons there.</i>

158
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,100
<i>Soon after they went home,</i>

159
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,760
<i>they died.</i>

160
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,850
They died?

161
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,460
Er Fu and Cai Wang

162
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,700
were found dead hanging from
their respective gates.

163
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:37,290
Ding Fu died from drinking pesticide.

164
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,100
You mean

165
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,140
they committed suicide?

166
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,930
That's what all the villagers said.

167
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,410
But I knew they wouldn't commit suicide.

168
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,700
They were killed by the demons
from the lake.

169
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,410
I was absolutely horrified.

170
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,180
I hid in the mountains for three years
before I dared to come back.

171
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
Zhang,

172
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,220
no wonder he doesn't know you.

173
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,810
He happened to be hiding
in the mountains

174
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,970
while you were staying here.

175
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,630
What were

176
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,750
the metal ingots?

177
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,700
I have no idea.

178
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,700
Even after three years of hiding,
I was still afraid.

179
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,930
So I went back to the lake.

180
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,900
There, I found an old shirt.

181
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,410
And in that shirt were the ingots.

182
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,220
This metal ingot

183
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,960
has the same stench.

184
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,390
It used to be strong.

185
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,860
But over time,

186
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,170
the smell dissipated.

187
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,780
Who was the slope-shouldered man?

188
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,540
Why did he ask you to kill us?

189
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,970
I don't know who he was either.

190
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,850
But he knew all about my deeds.

191
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,610
He told me specifically,

192
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,610
if anyone comes to investigate
the disappearance of the expedition team,

193
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,260
I must lure them

194
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,700
to Buffalo Trench.

195
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,810
Looks like the slope-shouldered man

196
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,260
is the keeper of the secret.

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,490
Stupid Fatty, what are you doing?

198
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,760
I'm checking if Zhang

199
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,610
is a demon or a human.

200
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Demon.

201
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,760
I think so, too.

202
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,490
Let's see what manner of demon you are.

203
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,470
It's the 21st century.

204
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,700
Cut the superstition,

205
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,970
and trust in science.

206
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,320
Most of Panma's ramblings
came from his own imagination.

207
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,390
I don't think the dead
can come back to life.

208
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,220
And I don't think there are
any demons in the lake.

209
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,770
But how do you explain

210
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,910
the undead expedition team?

211
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,100
The team that entered the mountains

212
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,900
wasn't the same team that came out of it.

213
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,050
You mean...

214
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,260
Nobody came back to life?

215
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,490
The latter group were completely
different people?

216
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,630
That's right.

217
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,100
The second party disguised themselves

218
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,810
and fooled Panma.

219
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,350
I have a feeling

220
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,900
it was a conspiracy long in the making.

221
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,730
It was originally planned

222
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,420
that the first expedition team
would be replaced.

223
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,850
But Panma accidentally killed them.

224
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,260
So the second batch played along

225
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,780
and took over their identities.

226
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,060
The demons in the lake

227
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,910
were most likely Chen Wen Jin, Huo Ling,
and the gang.

228
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,970
They happened to be exploring
the lake that night,

229
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,080
and dodged the massacre.

230
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,460
Panma's three companions saw them,

231
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,850
and mistook them for demons.

232
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,340
But the second expedition team
didn't know.

233
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,760
They were worried

234
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,910
that the man who did their bidding
would spill the beans.

235
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,990
So,

236
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,290
to cover up the truth,

237
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,720
they drove Panma and his companions

238
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,260
to insanity.

239
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,850
Wait a minute.

240
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,110
How come nothing

241
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,910
happened to Panma on the following day?

242
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,830
If they murdered Panma,

243
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,580
it would arouse suspicion.

244
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,870
That expedition team

245
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,100
travelled to the Paracel Islands
soon after.

246
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,540
The second team's motive was to

247
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,360
piggyback on the expedition
to the Paracel islands.

248
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,550
In other words,

249
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,340
to stop the first team
from going there.

250
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,490
But that was decades ago.

251
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,970
Was plastic surgery so advanced back then?

252
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,180
I saw my own lookalike in the tapes.

253
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,670
And in the Paracel Islands,

254
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,010
I saw another person who looked
just like me.

255
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,660
At the end of the day,
you're only speculating.

256
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,590
There's no proof.

257
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,960
The proof is under the lake.

258
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,760
Panma said they threw the bodies
in there. We could check it out.

259
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,200
If the bodies are really there,

260
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,110
it'll prove that

261
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,170
Panma had indeed killed the first team.

262
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,450
It'll also prove that

263
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,020
there were two expedition teams here.

264
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,840
It'll also prove that
we should call the cops.

265
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,860
But it's been so many years.

266
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,220
The bodies would have broken down.

267
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,660
The flesh would,

268
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,020
but not the bones.

269
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,100
Master Hua'er, we should reach
Emperor of Yi's Waterway by noon.

270
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,330
Hello, Wu Xie.

271
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,320
Any updates

272
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,490
on Qiongqi's tattoo?

273
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,870
I asked them both.

274
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,260
Neither of them knew.

275
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,970
Why don't you let Xiu Xiu ask her grandma?

276
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,110
Mrs Huo doesn't use cellphones.

277
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,620
I can't send her the image.

278
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,050
<i>Don't worry.</i>

279
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,630
Xiu Xiu has had her people
ask around Xin Yue Restaurant.

280
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,020
We're waiting for her reply.

281
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Alright, then.

282
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,720
Let me know if there are any updates.

283
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,940
Got you.

284
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,070
You think my grandma is so outdated

285
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,850
that she can't even use a cellphone?

286
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,880
It was only an excuse.

287
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,720
If anyone were to know about
Qiongqi's tattoo,

288
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,700
it'd be Grandma.

289
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,150
Why didn't you ask her

290
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,050
instead of having me ask Yin Nan Feng
of Xin Yue Restaurant?

291
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,230
I don't want the older generation
of the Mystic Nine

292
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,340
to know we're prying into their history.

293
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,680
Yin Nan Feng may not be a member
of the Mystic Nine,

294
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,580
but she knows more about its secrets

295
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,370
than we do.

296
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,540
Let's eat!

297
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,340
Let's eat!

298
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Dinner time.

299
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,750
Here's dinner.

300
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,569
-Slowly.
-Dinner's ready.

301
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,520
One for Zhang.

302
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,599
Here.

303
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,210
One for Wu Xie.

304
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,450
And one for me.

305
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,599
-Here's your chopsticks.
-Thanks.

306
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,490
I say, Uncle Gui,

307
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,540
can we have something else tomorrow?

308
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,760
If I keep eating Luosifen,

309
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,420
I might start to stink.

310
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,900
Don't listen to him.

311
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,780
I love Luosifen.

312
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,520
I like the funk.

313
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,940
It's appetising.

314
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,490
Right, Yun Cai?

315
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:38,260
Let's not bother ourselves
with plebeians like him.

316
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:41,670
By the way, Uncle Gui,

317
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,420
do you know of a lake north-west
of Yang Jiao Mountain?

318
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,850
I've heard of it from the elders,

319
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,330
but I've never been there.

320
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,670
We'd like to go there tomorrow.

321
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,710
It's too dangerous to go.

322
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,560
It's okay. We have Zhang.

323
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,230
He's unbelievable.

324
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,920
Not even the infamous Buffalo Trench

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,150
could stop him.

326
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,450
Yeah. Relax. We'll be fine.

327
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,310
If it's not too much trouble,

328
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,350
we'd like a pair of machetes
to clear our path with.

329
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,940
Preferably sharpened.

330
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,490
And a few coils of hemp rope.

331
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,690
And do you have tents?

332
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,950
I have two sets of old tents.

333
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,360
If you're okay with it...

334
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,110
Old or new doesn't matter,
so long as it works.

335
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,570
And one last thing.

336
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,190
Could you get us two guides

337
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,020
who are familiar with the area?

338
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,260
No problem.

339
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
You can count on me.

340
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,350
Great. Thanks a lot.

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,140
This Luosifen is incredible.

342
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,140
-Eat it while it's hot.
-Smells delicious.

343
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,030
Authentic Luosifen.

344
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,180
Try some.

345
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,800
Master Hua'er.

346
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Wipe your hands.

347
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,730
Seriously, Master Hua'er,

348
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,690
why do the dirty chores yourself?

349
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,970
Next time, just ask me to do it.

350
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,900
Found anything in the waterway?

351
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,130
The worker who accompanied me inside said

352
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,850
someone has been there before.

353
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,060
Probably many years ago.

354
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,590
Many years ago?

355
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,960
Judging by the marks,

356
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,540
at least a few decades.

357
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,560
So we came here for nothing?

358
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,640
Not exactly.

359
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,960
Inside,

360
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,650
I saw something strange.

361
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,210
The casket was open.

362
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,840
A casket? In the waterway?

363
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,850
-We should go to the police station.
-Yes.

364
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,480
But there were no signs of chisels

365
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,020
or explosive damage.

366
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,520
The person who opened the casket

367
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
must've gone through all three layers
of mechanisms.

368
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,140
Could it be someone from the Mystic Nine?

369
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,020
Look, I took this.

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,260
The casket was soldered shut.

371
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,910
Shaozi Casket.

372
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,350
As far as I know,

373
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,120
the only thing that could

374
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,450
open a Shaozi Casket without breaking it

375
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,370
is the Zhang family's
Two Finger Technique.

376
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,840
Uncle Gui.

377
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,610
We're all ready.

378
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,840
Sure. I'll call Yun Cai.

379
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,070
I thought we're getting guides?

380
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,090
How come it's you and Yun Cai instead?

381
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,990
I'll have you know

382
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,820
I went through the entire village.

383
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,570
The few hunters there

384
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,190
still haven't come back

385
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,790
from the mountain.

386
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,880
Don't worry.

387
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,280
I know my way around the mountain.

388
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
I'll guide you.

389
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,850
Uncle Gui.

390
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,040
Could it be that you want

391
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,900
the guide money for yourself?

392
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,720
It doesn't matter who makes the money,
am I right?

393
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
But seeing as we're such good friends,

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,260
why not let me take you there?

395
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:57,210
Besides, I guarantee I'll take you
to your destination safely.

396
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,670
Wait,

397
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,970
what about Yun Cai?

398
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,950
Like you said,

399
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,950
it's dangerous.

400
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,170
She's a dainty girl.

401
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,920
What if something dangerous happens?

402
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,590
Don't you worry about Yun Cai.

403
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,680
She's been trekking with her grandpa
since she was five.

404
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,560
She knows her way around

405
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,680
better than me.

406
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,940
I don't care.

407
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,710
If something bad happens,

408
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,190
wouldn't you, as her father, be sorry?

409
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,300
-I know I will.
-Sirs.

410
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,660
Looking down on me, are you?

411
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,160
No, of course not.

412
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,830
Yun Cai, don't take it the wrong way.

413
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,280
I'm just worried about you.

414
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,230
In my eyes,

415
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,660
you're the perfect girl for the job.

416
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,730
Changed your tune so quickly?

417
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,330
Looks like the old cow
wants some tender grass.

418
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,300
Who are you calling an old cow?

419
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,490
I'm in my prime.

420
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,940
Even if I were a cow, I'd be a strong cow.

421
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,830
That's enough.

422
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,590
You can chat on the way.

423
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,880
We should set off

424
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,260
before the day gets hot.

425
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,030
You got it.

426
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,520
Let's go.

427
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,900
Yun Cai,

428
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,040
try some potato chips.

429
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
They're delicious.

430
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,180
I wouldn't share these with them
even if they wanted.

431
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,630
Really?

432
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,510
Then I should take more.

433
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,110
Sure, help yourself to it.

434
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,940
I can mail some to you, too.

435
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,060
Are you trying to turn Yun Cai
into a fatso like you?

436
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,920
What's it to you?

437
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,230
We're having a conversation here.

438
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,730
Don't be a third wheel.

439
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,030
Fatty,

440
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,260
what do you guys do for a living?

441
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
I could tell from these past few days,

442
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,330
you're not tour guides.

443
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,370
What tour guide would come
to a place like this?

444
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,970
At this point,

445
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,780
I should come clean with you.

446
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,780
The truth is,

447
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,570
we're important people
on a secret mission.

448
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,820
But

449
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,660
if you give me a kiss,

450
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,570
I'll tell you our secret.

451
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,130
Close your eyes, then.

452
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,210
You're really going to kiss me?

453
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,090
Hurry.

454
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,970
Yun Cai!

455
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,730
How dare you tease me?

456
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,910
Here we are.

457
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,390
Well I'll be.

458
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,380
We're finally here.

459
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,540
<i>Xin Yue Restaurant</i>

460
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,560
Who's investigating it?

461
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,180
Xie Yu Chen and Huo Xiu Xiu.

462
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,280
They even asked about

463
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,020
Master Buddha's journey to Xiangxi.

464
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
I don't know.

465
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,540
Sure. I'll ask them
to drop the investigation.

466
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,690
Just tell them we don't know.

467
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,080
Xiao Hua,

468
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,040
is this a photograph or a painting?

469
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,810
It's a black and white photograph

470
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,030
that was coloured afterward.

471
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,300
These people must be Master Buddha

472
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,570
and Young Lady Yin.

473
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,280
Sorry, guys.

474
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,920
Ms Yin.

475
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,720
Someone of your status

476
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,450
should address me as "boss."

477
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,880
<i>Xin Yue Restaurant</i>

478
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,400
They don't know?

479
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,640
After two days, that's what they told us?

480
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,300
If they won't tell us
about the Qiongqi picture, fine.

481
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,800
But how could he not know about
Master Buddha?

482
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
If they don't know, who does?

483
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,990
If they don't know,

484
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,280
<i>Xin Yue Restaurant</i>

485
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,430
what was Mr Yue Shan doing
at Xin Yue Restaurant?

486
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,360
Enough.

487
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,440
Stop grouching.

488
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,970
The truth is, they don't want us to know.

489
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,830
If they won't tell us, fine.

490
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,340
It's not as if Zhang Ri Shan

491
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,310
is the only one who knows
the Mystic Nine's secrets.

492
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,630
Brilliant.

493
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,490
Absolutely brilliant.

494
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,490
He is undoubtedly Concubine Mi.

495
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,450
Please accept my bow.

496
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,140
Mr He, after you.

497
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,190
Have a seat.

498
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,280
Master Xiao Jiu,

499
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,090
performing with you today

500
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,090
really took me back.

501
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,950
For a moment back there,

502
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,120
I thought I was performing with Master Er.

503
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,420
Mr He, you flatter me.

504
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,420
Only by performing with you

505
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,950
will I remember

506
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,330
the finer points of opera that
my master taught me.

507
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,830
Mr He,

508
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,940
have some tea.

509
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,300
Ms Huo,

510
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,230
you're becoming more and more

511
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,730
like your grandmother when she was young.

512
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,310
Mr He,

513
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,590
listen to you.

514
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,350
I'm my grandma's flesh and blood.

515
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,940
I ought to resemble her.

516
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,490
Master Xiao Jiu,

517
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,350
you didn't invite me today

518
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,990
just to sing opera with you, did you?

519
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,090
Mr He, you know me well.

520
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,500
I've invited you here today

521
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,630
not just for a duet,

522
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,100
but to ask you something.

523
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,420
Do you know of the Yi City Waterway
in Xiangxi?

524
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:07,780
I do.

525
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,330
What would you like to know?

526
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,370
Have Master Er and Master Buddha

527
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,780
been there?

528
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,190
They have.

529
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,470
Did they retrieve

530
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,450
from that place?

531
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,820
Did they retrieve anything?

532
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,330
I don't know.

533
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,690
Usually,

534
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,370
where did Master Buddha

535
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,900
keep his collections?

536
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,330
Most of Master Buddha's valuables

537
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,730
have been handed over to the government.

538
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,780
As for the less valuable items

539
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,640
and his personal items,

540
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,610
most of them were kept
in Xin Yue Restaurant.

541
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,820
Xin Yue Restaurant again?

542
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,370
Master Buddha must've really
loved his wife.

543
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,090
However, Master Buddha would not leave

544
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,210
ominous items with Ms Yin.

545
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,970
I heard he had a secret room.

546
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,310
That must be where
the other objects were kept.

547
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,480
I've checked the manifest

548
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,780
of items given by Master Buddha
to the government.

549
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,370
But the manifest

550
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,380
did not contain artifacts collected
from the Yi City Waterway.

551
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,450
If Master Buddha had indeed retrieved
something from that place,

552
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,210
it may very well be in that secret room.

553
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:21,910
Maybe.

554
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,300
But Mr He,

555
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:31,450
Master Buddha's mansion
was torn down long ago.

556
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,760
Since the mansion's gone,

557
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,280
the secret room

558
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,640
should be gone as well, right?

559
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,850
Master Buddha's mansion may be gone,

560
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,020
but given his meticulous nature,

561
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,680
if he wanted to build a secret room

562
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,780
to safeguard his personal items,

563
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,140
it would not be so easily destroyed.

564
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,690
Not a single trace.

565
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,180
It's okay.

566
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,190
It's been so long.

567
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,490
Any clue would've been

568
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,450
washed away by the rain into the lake.

569
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,430
Fret not.

570
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,880
We'll search around the lake tomorrow.

571
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,420
We might just find something.

572
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,180
We've already come this far.

573
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,820
No matter how deeply your past is buried,

574
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,900
we'll help you find it.

575
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,350
One day, a man

576
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,640
walks into a hotpot shop

577
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,940
and orders a clear soup pot.

578
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,430
But as he dug in,
his tongue became numb.

579
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,310
Appalled,

580
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,310
he asked for the owner.

581
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:01,110
He said, "Owner, why is the clear
soup so numbingly spicy?"

582
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,490
The owner took a look and said,

583
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,060
"The hotpot is not plugged in."

584
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,260
Isn't it funny?

585
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,300
Wu Xie, sir.

586
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,580
Fatty's calling you.

587
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:22,830
Stupid Fatty.

588
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,450
Making up nicknames for me again.

589
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,610
Stupid Fatty, you called?

590
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,030
No.

591
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,350
I was having a nice chat
with Yun Cai.

592
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,240
Why would I call you?

593
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
But Yun Cai...

594
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,610
What did Yun Cai do?

595
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,900
Looks like the girl isn't
interested in you,

596
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,780
but Zhang.

597
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,520
Looks like my dear Fatty

598
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,900
is getting the blues again.

599
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,260
Take it easy, alright?

600
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,660
Oh please.

601
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,090
What's that sound?

602
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Zhang,

603
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,890
what's that sound?

604
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,900
The tide.

605
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
The tide?

606
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:18,370
Even such a small lake has tides?

607
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,370
The mud is still moist.

608
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,610
The tide is still going out.

609
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,970
Must be the siphon effect.

610
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,940
What on earth is "siphon?"

611
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,570
You mean Erguotou liquor?

612
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,570
It's similar to the principle
behind flush toilets.

613
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,540
Looks like this is no closed lake.

614
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,660
There might be underground waterways

615
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,660
connected to another bigger lake.

616
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,570
When the moon's gravity comes into effect,

617
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,770
the water in this lake
will be siphoned off.

618
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,830
Oh no.

619
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,140
In that case,

620
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,280
the things we're trying to find

621
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,820
have probably been sucked
to the depths of the lake.

622
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,970
You're right.

623
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,690
We don't know how deep this lake is.

624
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,920
If the things we're trying to find

625
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,310
are in the middle of the lake,

626
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,140
then we'd need scuba diving equipment.

627
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,020
Scuba diving equipment?

628
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,570
Yun Cai,

629
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,950
I don't suppose Gui Village Tour Company

630
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,400
offers scuba diving?

631
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,490
Scuba diving?

632
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,470
Why would we have that in the mountains?

633
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,780
The most we do is catch fish
in the creeks.

634
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,450
Master Xiao San,

635
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,400
looks like you have to take a trip back

636
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,010
and rustle up some gear.

637
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,680
What about you, Fatty?

638
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,350
Well, I...

639
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,570
I...

640
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,120
I'll keep watch here.

641
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,970
This is Master Buddha's tattoo.

642
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,260
Why would Master Buddha
bear the mark of Qiongqi?

643
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,260
Isn't Qiongqi the fierce beast?

644
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,330
You whippersnappers don't know.

645
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,760
The tattoo of the leader of the
Mystic Nine, Master Buddha Zhang,

646
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,090
was that of the Qiongqi.

647
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,940
<i>Master Buddha belonged
to the Zhang family</i>

648
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,660
<i>which was split into two lines.</i>

649
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,820
<i>One of them was the Northeastern Zhang,</i>

650
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,780
<i>the true Zhangs.</i>

651
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,889
<i>It's said that members of the family
wore tattoos of the Qilin.</i>

652
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,100
The Master Buddha

653
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,730
belonged to the other line
of the Zhang family.

654
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,280
That line

655
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,489
wore tattoos of the Qiongqi.

656
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,820
Ri Shan served as Master Buddha's
personal guard.

657
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,790
He should recognise this tattoo.

658
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,860
To think he had the cheek
to say he didn't know.

659
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,350
What were Mr Zhang's exact words?

660
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:33,949
Yin Nan Feng said

661
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,830
Ri Shan wasn't willing to tell us,

662
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,730
so he said, "I don't know."

663
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,960
Hold on.

664
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
Come again?

665
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,690
"I don't know." That's all he said.

666
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,409
That's the message.

667
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,590
The message Mr Zhang meant to

668
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,250
convey to you is,

669
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,340
I, don't, know.

670
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,990
If "I don't know" was the message,

671
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,270
then what was it that Ri Shan

672
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,410
did not know?

673
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,910
He must've meant

674
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,730
the location of the secret room.

675
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:13,970
The room's precise location
must've been recorded.

676
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,250
But after so many years,

677
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,790
its location must be gone forever.

678
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,670
So?

679
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,320
So we must find the "boss'" map.

680
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,490
I'm sure the map contains some locations

681
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,300
that are not found in our map.

682
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,380
One of those locations

683
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,190
must be Master Buddha's secret room.

684
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,060
-Respirator?
-No.

685
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,580
-Insect protection mask?
-Try again.

686
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,060
Take a good look.

687
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,020
Zhang,

688
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,500
you went into the lake again?

689
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,170
Did you find anything new?

690
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,240
If you won't tell me, fine.

691
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,530
I'll ask the other two gentlemen.

692
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,830
Yun Cai,

693
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,160
take another guess.

694
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,380
Take another guess and I'll tell you.

695
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,350
-Yun Cai.
-Mr Wu,

696
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,820
could you tell me what this is?

697
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,060
Come on, Fatty.

698
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,790
Stop teasing the girl.

699
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,310
Zhang fished it from the lake just now.

700
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,890
Boring.

701
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,390
Here.

702
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,060
Judging by the materials and make,

703
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,930
this must be one of those
old-style diving goggles.

704
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,070
That's right.

705
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,270
The quality is top-notch.

706
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,110
I tested it just now.
It's in perfect condition.

707
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,860
This belonged to the expedition team.

708
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,690
Mr Wu, shall we go?

709
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
Uncle Gui,

710
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,310
when you're back at the village,
try and see

711
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,150
if you have an inflatable raft,

712
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,370
and bring it over.

713
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,080
With this pair of goggles,

714
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,690
we could use the raft

715
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,300
to search the deeper parts of the lake.

716
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,030
Sure.

717
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,110
So...

718
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,750
We'll go back and see what we can find.

719
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,630
Okay.

720
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,640
Please be careful.

721
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,820
Don't worry.

722
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,750
I'm an excellent swimmer.

723
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,020
They call me the Flying Fish.

724
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,190
Sure, Fatty.

725
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:29,430
Flying Fish?

726
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,010
More like Flying Bear.

727
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,610
Have you guys seen a whale?

728
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,830
They can hardly turn themselves
over on land,

729
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,680
but in the water,
they're as quick as lightning.

730
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,680
Just you wait.

731
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,410
I'll show you what I'm made of.

732
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,790
Stop giggling.

733
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,200
Go and pack your stuff.

734
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,210
We'll go back with Mr Wu.

735
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,490
No thanks.

736
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,580
I'd rather stay here and guide the rest.

737
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,390
Didn't we agree?

738
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,440
We'll take the gentlemen to the lake,

739
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,380
and once they get down to business,

740
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,630
we'll go home.

741
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,070
Are you trying to be a busybody?

742
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,690
I know these parts better
than them, after all.

743
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,550
I can be of help if I stay back.

744
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,030
That's right.

745
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:14,260
We can't do without Yun Cai's help.

746
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,650
Uncle Gui, you can rest assured.

747
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,160
With me and Zhang around,

748
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,990
no harm will come to Yun Cai.

749
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,840
You guys go back in peace

750
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,300
while we set up camp here.

751
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,420
I guarantee that

752
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,480
when you're back,

753
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,840
Yun Cai would still be in one piece.

754
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,300
Yeah, Uncle Gui.

755
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,210
Since the Flying Fish gave you his word,

756
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,960
he'll take good care of Yun Cai.

757
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Shut up.

758
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,140
Alright, then.

759
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,010
Please be safe.

760
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,510
Mr Wu,

761
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,590
let's go.

762
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,200
Let's go.

763
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,100
-Let's go.
-Bye-bye.

764
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,680
-Okay.
-See you, Fatty.

765
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,010
Be wary of the Flying Bear at night.

766
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,380
What are you looking at?

767
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,820
What are you talking about?

768
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
Yun Cai.

769
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,100
Where are you going?

770
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,920
Now that my dad's gone, I'll get changed
and take a dip in the lake.

771
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,010
You can't do that.

772
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,440
Don't worry, I'm a good swimmer.

773
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,920
I just promised your dad
I'd look after you.

774
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,070
And now you want to swim?

775
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,490
Do you know how dangerous it is?

776
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,260
Why don't you wait here like a good girl

777
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,310
while I, the Flying Fish,
go in for a dive.

778
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,550
I'll fish out

779
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,060
anything you want.

780
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,690
Just you wait.

781
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,300
This is the Master Buddha's mansion.

782
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,650
And this is his private residence.

783
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,210
Looks like Zhang Ri Shan was right.

784
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,780
He didn't know.

785
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,190
Besides, the map doesn't indicate

786
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,210
Master Buddha's properties.

787
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,260
They are all hidden.

788
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,290
Xiu Xiu, look.

789
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,330
Doesn't this look like a Dragon Vein?

790
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,050
It does look like one.

791
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,820
I heard Master Buddha was into
feng shui and divination.

792
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,240
His mansion was built

793
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,650
on the Dragon's Eye.

794
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,920
Could this Dragon Vein be the clue?

795
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,570
No.

796
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,110
It may seem like a Dragon Vein,

797
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,590
but it's actually not.

798
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,290
I came across

799
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,470
an extremely uncommon feng shui formation

800
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,870
called the Fuxi Vein.

801
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,690
<i>It's similar to the Dragon Vein,</i>

802
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,490
<i>but not identical.</i>

803
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,310
<i>Fuxi was</i>

804
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,100
<i>the eighth son of the Dragon Emperor.</i>

805
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,300
<i>Legend has it that he wasn't adept
at hiding his tail</i>

806
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,210
<i>which was his most important body part.</i>

807
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,790
If the dragon's head is the mansion,

808
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,170
then the tail may very well
be the secret room.

809
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,680
You're right.

810
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,490
The secret room may very well
be at the dragon's tail.

811
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:59,620
But it's such a big area.

812
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,280
Where should we search?

813
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,620
Besides, it's a secret room.

814
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,060
What?

815
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,620
Scuba diving equipment?

816
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,170
What do you think?

817
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,070
Why would we have scuba diving equipment
here in the mountains?

818
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,660
Hello, Fatty.

819
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,970
<i>I can't find scuba diving gear
in the town.</i>

820
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,100
You're so funny.

821
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,720
You expect to find scuba diving gear

822
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,490
in a landlocked town?

823
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,580
You need to go to the big city.

824
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,140
Yes.

825
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,640
Listen,

826
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,480
Ah Gui found a bamboo raft.

827
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,640
But he couldn't get it uphill.

828
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
I'm going to help him in a while.

829
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,680
<i>I've been searching all day.
I haven't even eaten.</i>

830
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,880
Alright, quit whining.

831
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,700
<i>Just pack up and come.</i>

832
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,640
-No, wait...
-<i>Yun Cai,</i>

833
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,960
<i>stir-fryâ€™s almost ready.</i>

834
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,120
<i>Get ready to eat.</i>

835
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,280
I have to go now.

836
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,160
Bye.

837
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,260
I'm not finished yet, Fatty.

838
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,220
Fatty?

839
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,820
Fatty?

840
00:42:05,704 --> 00:42:15,704
