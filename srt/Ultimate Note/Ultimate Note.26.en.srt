1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,840
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,810
<i>Episode 26</i>

4
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,280
We've worked the whole morning.

5
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Let's take a break.

6
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,680
Have a drink.

7
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,450
The entrance is not here.

8
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,329
Try another spot.

9
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,520
Why can't you search the mountain
properly? Stop taking photos!

10
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,660
Are you on vacation?

11
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,610
This mountain is too massive.

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,360
My boss came up with a new method.

13
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,690
Searching by reconnaissance.

14
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,960
I'm taking photos of the landscape here.

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,090
I'll send them to the headquarter
in order to get some equipment here.

16
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,960
I look like that
Sloped-shoulder in the photo.

17
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,670
Let me see.

18
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,760
<i>Someone's been following us</i>

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,880
<i>since we arrived in Banai.</i>

20
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,280
<i>We found Zhang's bamboo house.</i>

21
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,930
<i>As soon as we found the tin box,</i>

22
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,740
<i>Sloped-shoulder came
and grabbed it immediately.</i>

23
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,560
<i>Why is it so heavy?</i>

24
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,080
<i>Someone snatched it!</i>

25
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,079
<i>Let's chase him!</i>

26
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,280
That's inaccurate.

27
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,880
Sloped-shoulder has been
guarding Banai's secret.

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,020
Whatever we want to do,

29
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,800
he will surely cause us troubles.

30
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,600
As for Bald-headed Chu's younger brother,

31
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,720
how did he manage to obtain the photos
so easily?

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Yes.

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,720
Those photos we grabbed...

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,200
Zhang was in all of them.

35
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,010
By right, Zhang's photos

36
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,110
should be more valuable than
the photos of Sloped-shoulder.

37
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,340
So there's nothing
significant about these photos.

38
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,220
It's a diversion.

39
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,800
There's something wrong
with Bald-headed Chu.

40
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,640
When will your boss ship his equipment?

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,000
It will be shipped from overseas.

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
It will take several days at least.

43
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,630
You all go ahead, I need to take photos.

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,600
How about this.

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,320
Let's go find Bald-headed Chu again.

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,840
Uncle San met Bald-headed Chu
before he went to Tamutuo.

47
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,480
Maybe he will contact him again.

48
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Consequently,

49
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,589
we could get in touch
with Uncle San as well.

50
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,230
Okay.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,240
You all proceed to look
for Bald-headed Chu.

52
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,280
I stay back and search the mountain.

53
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,280
Zhang.

54
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,159
I'm a little worried about
Fatty's current state of mind.

55
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,350
I'm afraid he will still
look for Sloped-shoulder.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,560
Why don't you stay with him?

57
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,520
Fatty.

58
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,420
Zhang's memory hasn't recovered yet.

59
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,320
Please take good care of him.

60
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,159
Don't worry.

61
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
"Recently, I dreamt
of that incident again."

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,760
<i>Recently, I dreamt
of that incident again.</i>

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,240
"After many years,"

64
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,200
<i>After many years,</i>

65
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,480
"this nightmare still lingers."

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>this nightmare still lingers.</i>

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,040
"I wonder if you are well?"

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,440
"As age advances, half my feet..."

69
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,640
"are already in the coffin."

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
"Hope to meet you all."

71
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,560
"There's one thing I've yet to reveal."

72
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,800
"Come to think of it,"

73
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,350
"it could be the key."

74
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,400
"Hope to meet up and tell you in person."

75
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,040
"Just like catching up
with an old friend."

76
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,190
Xiao Hua.

77
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,159
Is your method viable?

78
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,280
You don't mention about the topic...

79
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,640
for this catch-up with an old friend.

80
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
Don't worry.

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,520
The person who knows this secret

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,520
will surely know what
we are talking about.

83
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,560
We'll use your grandma's name

84
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,280
to send all these letters.

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,400
What's next?

86
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,760
Just wait.

87
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
That photo taken in Banai?

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,640
It was indeed Master San who
asked me to give it to you.

89
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,070
Since the photo was given
to you by Uncle San,

90
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
can you reach him?

91
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,250
We are talking about Master San.

92
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,510
He is all-powerful.

93
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,430
How can I locate him?

94
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,680
If we were in the past,

95
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,720
there was still a chance.

96
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,350
But for these months,

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,280
Master San has completely disappeared.

98
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,560
Master San.

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,280
He really is amazing.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
He told me earlier

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,800
that you will definitely
come and look for him.

102
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
He is like a superhuman.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,320
No one knows what is in his mind.

104
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,560
Master San also said,

105
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,440
after you've met me for the first time,

106
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,920
you will meet me for the second time.

107
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,880
What do you mean?

108
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,750
Master San has told me,

109
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,950
if you come and meet me again,

110
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,040
to give you one more thing.

111
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,160
<i>Reimbursement for Guangxi
Province Banai Expedition Team</i>

112
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,710
"1976 Expedition Team Subsidy List."

113
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
Hello, Wang Meng.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,120
Come to Changsha now.

115
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,120
Boss.

116
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,990
You've been reading it for so long.

117
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
You must be hungry.

118
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,770
Have a bowl of noodles.

119
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Eat it, boss.

120
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,360
Boss.

121
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,559
This is the train ticket from
Hangzhou to Changsha...

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
Uncle San usually leaves behind

123
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,400
encrypted verses, "Nine dots,
chicken eyes, yellow sand,"

124
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,080
"dragon's back, come quick," and what not.

125
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,870
I would get it right away.

126
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
But this time,

127
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,760
what does he mean by
leaving behind this list?

128
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Does your uncle care
about priorities at all?

129
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
No.

130
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,720
Is there any level of confidentiality?

131
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,120
As for confidentiality,

132
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,640
he left this sentence before, "The land
of Black Turtle refuses corpses."

133
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,550
No one knows what it means.

134
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,360
What does that mean then?

135
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,430
Go along the river
and canal to the bottom.

136
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,160
"The land of Black Turtle
refuses corpses"?

137
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Isn't this a Hangzhou dialect?

138
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,750
Boss.

139
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,960
Over here, boss.

140
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,760
Have a drink, boss.

141
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,510
In 1976,

142
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,960
it should be the economy planning period.

143
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,960
At that time, no matter
shopping or issuing wages,

144
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,920
all were recorded.

145
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,160
Yes.

146
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,510
My grandma still keeps

147
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,200
the ledgers of that era

148
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,120
and food stamps too.

149
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,920
If this allowance bill

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
is the subsidy record of the
Banai expedition team in 1976,

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,760
maybe Uncle San is trying to tell me,

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,160
the member profiles
of this expedition still exist.

153
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
Data.

154
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,800
The members of the first
expedition team are dead.

155
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,840
But the members of the second expedition,

156
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,640
are still alive with their own identity.

157
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,840
If i can find the list of
members of the first expedition,

158
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,800
then I can find those

159
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
who live for the dead.

160
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,960
Hang on.

161
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
What is all these dead,
living and the living dead?

162
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,640
Good that you don't understand.

163
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,960
-Why not you explain it...
-Stop asking.

164
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,000
It's for your own good.

165
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,290
For my own good?

166
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,190
Then...

167
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,600
Why are you in such
a hurry to get me here?

168

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,560
If the security guard catches us,

342
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,920
the only excuse we have is

343
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,010
we are here to apply
the job as security guard.

354
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,120
Boss, we should stop searching.

355
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,760
Look, all these are mouldy.

356
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,000
The mildew stains have formed together.

357
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,400
No one has been here for a long time.

358
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,760
Changsha is always cold and humid.

359
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,600
This is a stand-alone building.

360
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,080

Boss.

362
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,230
That painting is not mouldy though.

363
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,640
It seems no one has
ever moved this painting.

364
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,300
Look, there're so many spider webs.

365
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,000
This spider silk is glued on the back.

366
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,240
Such a small detail was noticed as well.

367
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,160
It was placed here deliberately.

509
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,830
Lei style architecture?

510
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
Isn't this architecture meant for imperial
palace

511
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,110
and the Old Summer Palace?

512
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,760
What does it have to do with
the Banai expedition team?

513
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,480
Although this Lei style architecture
looks like a private house,

514
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,720
but it’s just the partial drawing.

515
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,950
If you can find the complete drawing,

516
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,400
we may have a clue.

517
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,000
Handle with care.

518
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,150
Thank you.

519
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,540
Take a look at calligraphy and painting.

520
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,530
As far as I know,

521
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,080
the silk manuscript owned by Cox Hendry

522
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,400
also came from Liulichang.

523
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,040
Then we are in the right place.

524
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,570
<i>The Hall of Vulgar Person</i>

525
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,630
This three-hole jade dagger is good.

526
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,200
Not bad.

527
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,120
Expert.

528
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,720
I thought a young person like you

529
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
wouldn't know anything at all.

530
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,080
What is your price?

531
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,560
Brother.

532
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,480
You have found a treasure.

533
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,360
It's true.

534
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,160
A fine dagger like such

535
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,680
is very rare on the market.

536
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,120
Don't be surprised.

537
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,810
The dagger is worth this price.

538
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,870
By the way, I'm here to
ask you some old stories.

539
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,630
Old stories?

540
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,610
"Let bygones be bygones."

541
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,000
Since you said so, why
are we still talking about it?

542
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,120
About that,

543
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,160
did you really not mention it again?

544
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,550
What do you mean?

545
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,000
Trying to scam me?

546
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,490
I won't sell the dagger any more.

547
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,520
Please leave.

548
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,760
Trying to be nasty?

549
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,840
If you wish to be nasty,
you should first find out

550
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
my status in the industry.

551
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,350
If you offended me,

552
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,239
you will be hanged and beaten.

553
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,080
I had no idea you were
Master Xiao Jiu from the Xie family.

554
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,719
I'm born with eyes but ignorant.

555
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,570
Immortal Maiden said it was over.

556
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,000
Why are you here again?

557
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,960
Hendry Cox is having tea with my grandma.

558
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,560
Granny asked if you're keen to join them.

559
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,320
Don't let her misunderstand.

560
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,239
I sell silk manuscript to make some money.

561
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,520
I mention nothing about the mountain.

562
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,520
So it was you who sold the
copy of the manuscript?

563
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,520
You two have no idea at all about this?

564
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,920
I just got busted.

565
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,969
Jin Wan Tang.

566
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,120
Tell me.

567
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,760
Where did you get the silk manuscript?

568
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,360
Don't bring up the bygones!

569
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,150
Don't bring it up again!

570
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,650
If you refuse to bring up,

571
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,500
I'll talk about it.

572
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,120
My wrist is breaking!

573
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,240
I will tell you all about it!

574
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,320
No more threatening words from me.

575
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,640
Remember this, she is
a member of the Huo family.

576
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,750
I am the head of the Xie family.

577
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,270
If you have any trouble in the future,

578
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,280
I will safeguard you.

579
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,560
That's good.

580
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,530
Can you release me
so I can speak properly?

581
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,640
Release him.

582
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,530
It all started from

583
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,920
when I first met Fairy Huo.

584
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,440
Back then I was young,
but she was even younger.

585
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,280
We were both young, you see.

586
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,290
<i>At the time,</i>

587
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,080
<i>in the circle of multidisciplinary
studies in Beijing,</i>

588
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,640
<i>I was quite famous for being
sharp-eyed and know-all.</i>

589
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,240
<i>From Hatamen cigarette
case to a woman's bodice,</i>

590
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,000
<i>I mastered everything.</i>

591
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,710
<i>Appreciation of calligraphy,
painting and jade,</i>

592
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,720
<i>various techniques of the eight major
products from patina, wood and porcelain,</i>

593
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,600
<i>I knew them all.</i>

594
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,840
<i>I spent my entire life</i>

595
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,480
<i>to mingle with antiques</i>

596
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,520
<i>until I accomplished the supreme status.</i>

597
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,840
However,

598
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,440
"Thin clouds delicate in creation,
falling stars carry profound sorrows."

599
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,600
<i>Among all the shops in Liulichang,</i>

600
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,920
<i>Fairy, she walked into mine.</i>

601
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,760
Mr Jin.

602
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,040
For our operation this time,

603
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,640
we would like to invite
you to be our evaluator.

604
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,680
The pay

605
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,760
is quite good this time.

606
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,320
I assume you agree to it?

607
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,420
Fairy.

608
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,340
Are you going?

609
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,720
I'll go if you decide to go.

610
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,400
Back then, she had
bright eyes and white teeth.

611
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,680
Just like the lotus

612
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,680
who just emerged from water.

613
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,280
My little heart fluttered,

614
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,280
and trembled in rhythm.

615
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,160
Moreover, the pay was lucrative.

616
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
I accepted it instantly.

617
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,880
The leader of that operation
was Fairy Huo?

618
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,640
To be specific, nine people.

619
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,910
The Mystic Nine?

620
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,880
Be quiet.

621
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,080
The scale and complexity
of that operation

622
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,960
were far beyond your imagination.

623
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,480
<i>That was in early 1963.</i>

624
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,040
<i>Our team marched on mightily</i>

625
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,960
<i>into Mount Four Ladies in Sichuan.</i>

626
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,640
Fairy.

627
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,370
Fairy!

628
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,600
Take a break.

629
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,760
Come.

630
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,600
Let me handle this kind of dirty work.

631
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Come.

632
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,520
Have a drink.

633
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,960
Okay.

634
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,770
We have walked all day long.

635
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,600
I'm really exhausted.

636
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,800
Let's go.

637
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,960
Fairy.

638
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,080
<i>According to my observation,</i>

639
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,700
<i>the entire team had more
than two hundred people.</i>

640
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,310
<i>If we include all data gatherers and</i>

641
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,810
<i>equipment buyers, there
were thousands of them.</i>

642
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,960
<i>Especially the equipment.</i>

643
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,360
<i>They were shipped from the Soviet Union.</i>

644
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,800
<i>The people involved
were extremely complicated.</i>

645
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,510
<i>After campsite was set up,</i>

646
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,760
<i>their operation began.</i>

647
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,920
<i>But I had no idea what they were doing.</i>

648
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,400
<i>My task was simple.</i>

649
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,920
<i>Just stay in the camp</i>

650
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,880
<i>and evaluate their findings.</i>

651
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,610
<i>Only ancient manuscript
and books were sent to me,</i>

652
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,040
<i>but the content was very rich.</i>

653
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,190
<i>There were letters,</i>

654
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,200
<i>classics,</i>

655
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,960
<i>and writing on silk.</i>

656
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,610
<i>The quantity was enormous.</i>

657
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,120
<i>I guessed there could be a huge ruin</i>

658
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,560
<i>in the mountain.</i>

659
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,240
<i>I was the only one in the team</i>

660
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,000
<i>who worked on
classification and evaluation.</i>

661
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,800
<i>I guessed what they were looking for</i>

662
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,310
<i>could be found in those ancient books.</i>

663
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,880
Hurry up!

664
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,760
Come over!

665
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,200
-Come over.
-Help them.

666
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,350
-Quick!
-He's injured.

667
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,400
Be careful, hurry.

668
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,280
Doctor, over here.

669

<i>The team members kept decreasing.</i>

671
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,020
