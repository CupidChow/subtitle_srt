1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,039
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 13</i>

4
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,250
Mop!

5
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,729
It's tiger keelback.

6
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,370
Snake! Snake! Snake!

7
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,610
Snake! Snake! Snake!

8
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,890
The tiger keelback can
imitate human sounds.

9
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,890
We were deceived by it once.

10
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,290
In...

11
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,270
In that case,

12
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,090
it... it's become a
supernatural creature, hasn't it?

13
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,170
Come on.

14
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,610
Parrots can copy human speech too.

15
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,690
The tiger keelback

16
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,250
must be using the frequency
of its crown's vibration

17
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,250
to make the sounds it recently hears.

18
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,460
This is its hunting instinct

19
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,690
to catch its prey.

20
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,370
This place is unsafe.

21
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,410
Get all your equipment

22
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,290
and leave at once.

23
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,650
Master Xiao San.

24
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,010
Master Xiao San,

25
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,030
why did the tiger keelback
call only our names

26
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,190
instead of others'?

27
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,210
Could it have targeted us?

28
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:09,850
You're imagining things.

29
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,490
Master Xiao San.

30
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,730
Can you do this?

31
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,730
Yes, I can.

32
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,450
The floors and walls
are covered with moss.

33
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,570
I'll carry Fatty carefully.

34
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,000
The floor is indeed slippery.

35
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,250
And Fatty is on your back.

36
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Watch your step.

37
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,570
Yes, Master Xiao San.

38
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,000
Be careful, everybody.

39
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,640
-Okay. Let's go.
-Okay.

40
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,530
Okay.

41
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,730
There's light.

42
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,970
We've reached the ground.

43
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
It shouldn't be long before
we're out of this passageway.

44
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,409
No wonder it's soft.

45
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,480
What's this?

46
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,440
A plastic canopy?

47
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,840
This is a snake skin.

48
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,360
Snake... snake skin?

49
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,290
It isn't possible that
such a huge snake exists.

50
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,170
Everything is possible here.

51
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,850
<i>This should be the
thing I thought it was.</i>

52
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:06,730
<i>The Snake Mother.</i>

53
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,440
That snake actually exists.

54
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
Back at the temple,

55
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,690
I saw the sculpture of a huge snake.

56
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,000
I thought it was just a legendary totem.

57
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,170
But this should be

58
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,490
that snake.

59
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,330
What an eye-opening day

60
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,330
for me.

61
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,450
A snake this size means monster.

62
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,490
I wonder if it's still in the passageway.

63
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,760
Then,

64
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,400
if it wants us,

65
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,800
do... does that mean
we're as good as dead?

66
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,290
The rest of us may not die.

67
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,810
But you

68
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,409
and Master Xiao San...

69
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,540
Who knows.

70
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,010
The snake

71
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,570
has targetted you both, after all.

72
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,880
Calm down.

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,120
The skin doesn't look fresh.

74
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
It's obviously been here for some time.

75
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,640
This place is clean.

76
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,600
Maybe other snakes stay away from it

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,480
out of fear.

78
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,560
Yes, which is good news to us.

79
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,080
We've had a long day.

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,920
-Let's rest here.
-What?

81
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,690
Here, inside the snake skin?

82
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,800
Yeah, this is the safest place.

83
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,680
Master San.

84
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,560
I'd like it better to
rest at the cave before.

85
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm scared.

86
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,360
Be on guard, guys.

87
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,960
Later, I'll ask Shades

88
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,120
and you to find a path.

89
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:42,960
Leave with him.

90
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,520
Meet Zhang at the temple,

91
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,000
and get out of here.

92
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,920
Try to look natural when you're leaving.

93
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Don't let them suspect anything.

94
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm not leaving.

95
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
You have to.

96
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,600
The things here aren't your business.

97
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,820
They sure are.

98
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,640
The videotapes that
brought everybody here...

99
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,640
I have one of them.

100
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,920
In Ah Ning's videotape,

101
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,560
I even saw someone
that looks exactly like me.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,880
Madam Wen Jin's diary

103
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,040
was found in Golmud Sanatorium.

104
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
I've been to all the
places stated in the diary.

105
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,040
Do you still think this
is not my business?

106
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Wen Jin's diary?

107
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
Where is it? Give it to me.

108
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,200
Answer my questions first.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Fine.

110
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Go ahead and ask.

111
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,520
The diary

112
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,000
mentioned three videotapes.

113
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,350
One was given to me.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,960
Another to Ah Ning.

115
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,320
There is one more...

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Is it with you?

117
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,960
Yes.

118
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,280
Did Madam Dolma send you a message too?

119
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Yes.

120
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,040
It was on the night you and Ah Ning

121
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
camped outside of the Devil City.

122
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,280
<i>Wen Jin handed the three videotapes</i>

123
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,920
<i>to your grandma</i>

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,320
<i>since nineteen years ago?</i>

125
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,520
<i>Yes.</i>

126
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,100
<i>Then, has your grandma ever seen her</i>

127
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,480
<i>over the past decade?</i>

128
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,240
<i>Did you meet with her?</i>

129
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,280
<i>No.</i>

130
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,080
<i>No.</i>

131
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,039
<i>When did you send the tapes out?</i>

132
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,080
<i>Well,</i>

133
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,200
<i>three months ago,</i>

134
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,630
<i>Chen Wen Jin contacted my grandma</i>

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,510
<i>and asked her to mail the tapes.</i>

136
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,200
<i>Did they meet in person?</i>

137
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,520
<i>Did you meet her in person?</i>

138
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,800
<i>No.</i>

139
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,480
<i>No.</i>

140
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,640
<i>How can she be certain</i>

141
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,720
<i>that the message was
sent by Chen Wen Jin?</i>

142
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,200
<i>How did you know that it was Chen
Wen Jin who sent the message?</i>

143
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,770
<i>There's a secret sign.</i>

144
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,440
<i>This is enough.</i>

145
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,520
<i>There's a secret sign.</i>

146
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,960
<i>I hope that</i>

147
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,880
<i>you aren't hiding anything from me.</i>

148
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
With just a secret sign,

149
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,440
you can confirm that she's Madam Wen Jin?

150
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,640
No, of course.

151
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,320
Madam Dolma must have
met Chen Wen Jin in person.

152
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,750
I exposed her on the spot.

153
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,520
But it must be Wen Jin
that made this arrangement.

154
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,840
She's the only one who'd look for me.

155
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,810
Through this method,

156
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,710
Wen Jin is involving everyone in this,
step by step.

157
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,910
Then,

158
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,710
Madam Dolma said Wen Jin
was waiting for me up ahead.

159
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,150
She showed me another path

160
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,870
that'd lead me to the forest faster.

161
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,040
I noticed that

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,320
this might be my last
chance to meet Wen Jin.

163
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,200
So, you believed that
Madam Wen Jin is still alive?

164
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,680
If she's no longer around,

165
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,320
the tapes must have long being mailed.

166
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,850
She is alive.

167
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,960
But why were the videotapes
sent to the three of us?

168
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,380
You.

169
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,340
Me.

170
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,420
And Ah Ning.

171
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,300
Is there a connection among us?

172
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,700
It was you,

173
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,640
me,

174
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,580
and Zhang.

175
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm sure that Ah Ning

176
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,210
would be interested in this.

177
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,160
And I need the supplies
she's got and her men

178
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,360
to lead the way.

179
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
That's why I asked Zhang

180
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,360
to see Ah Ning with the tape.

181
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,830
You dragged Ah Ning into this.

182
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,360
I only provided the information.

183
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,460
She made the call.

184
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,300
Ah Ning is dead.

185
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,150
Ever heard of free solo climbing?

186
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,600
What's that?

187
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,400
Climbing all kinds of

188
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,020
steep cliffs without any protection.

189
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,480
The whole process

190
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,860
is extremely dangerous
and there's no turning back.

191
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,980
But people are constantly doing that.

192
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,490
Some say

193
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,200
that in free soloing,

194
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,340
there are more dead
legends than those who are alive.

195
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,440
What we're doing is very similar.

196
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,460
Death is expected.

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,160
We just don't know if it's today

198
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,500
or tomorrow.

199
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,600
I think

200
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,010
Ah Ning understands that well.

201
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,100
<i>Since I've made my choice,</i>

202
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,140
<i>I'll disregard other possibilities.</i>

203
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,260
<i>It's pointless.</i>

204
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,100
<i>Like you who would</i>

205
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,100
<i>sacrifice anything for Zhang,</i>

206
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,260
<i>I can give up everything</i>

207
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,740
<i>for the choice I made.</i>

208
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,060
You and Zhang

209
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,220
were both part of that archaeological team.

210
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,300
But what about me?

211
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,140
Why did she choose me?

212
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,300
You'll have to ask Wen Jin.

213
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,160
Do you know about It?

214
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,660
You mean, "him"?

215
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,040
"It", as in a lifeless thing.

216
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,470
<i>With the tapes sent out,</i>

217
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,040
<i>this means the tape keeper</i>

218
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
<i>can no longer keep in touch with me.</i>

219
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,440
<i>I am either dead,</i>

220
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,360
<i>or have left the city</i>

221
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,370
<i>as It has found me.</i>

222
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,520
In her diary,

223
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,210
Madam Wen Jin mentioned It.

224
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,690
Some sort of idea.

225
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,050
She informed us about another path

226
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,170
to separate you from Ah Ning's team.

227
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,530
Maybe it was out of her fear for It.

228
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,920
Show it to me, quick.

229
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,130
Uncle San.

230
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,810
I can show it to you.

231
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,080
But you have to trade with something.

232
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,120
You can watch my videotape.

233
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,720
The content of the tape doesn't matter.

234
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,160
This isn't something.

235
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
My tape is different.

236
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,520
Do you want it or not?

237
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,480
I do.

238
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,360
Of course I do.

239
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,600
<i>Where's this?</i>

240
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,010
<i>Are we out yet?</i>

241
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,530
<i>Anymore cigarette?</i>

242
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:08,930
<i>Watch out.</i>

243
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,720
<i>Where are we heading, by the way?</i>

244
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,330
<i>Listen, there's a sound.</i>

245
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:16,930
<i>Those things are back!</i>

246
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,450
<i>Quiet.</i>

247
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
Sound of a horn?

248
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,970
In front of the Bronze Gate,

249
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,160
I've heard the same horn sound.

250
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,770
Was the video taken at Cloud Top Palace?

251
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,360
Did they enter the Bronze Gate too?

252
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,600
What's going on?

253
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,560
-I don't know.
-You don't?

254
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,560
You say that every time,

255
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,480
but you always knew.

256
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,960
This is a big unsolved mystery.

257
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,920
How would I know about it?

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,850
You...

259
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,730
Wu Xie.

260
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,320
I've told you everything I know.

261
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,870
There's nothing more.

262
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,370
So, where's Wen Jin's diary?

263
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,880
It's time to show me.

264
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,450
You may read it,

265
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,990
but not now.

266
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,760
I left it at the campsite.

267
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,440
Maybe you can read it after I got out.

268
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,640
You fooled me?

269
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Uncle San,

270
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,800
this is for your own good.

271
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,520
Fine.

272
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Some tricks you learned from me, huh?

273
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,080
Mop.

274
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,520
Settle it out there.

275
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,600
Snake!

276
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,060
Gosh, I thought you're brave.

277
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,160
Yet you're scared stiff by this baby?

278
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,130
Master Hua'er.

279
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,370
Mr Black.

280
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,480
I'm just someone's henchman.

281
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't want to die.

282
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,070
I... I'm really scared.

283
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,530
Please, let me go.

284
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,450
I... I want to go home.

285
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,490
We do want to let you go.

286
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,320
But you won't make it, Mop.

287
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,800
Someone like you...

288
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,400
If you ever cross path
with a tiger keelback,

289
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,690
there's only one word.

290
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,050
Death.

291
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,370
Ten thousand

292
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,970
on him not walking
further than 1 km alive.

293
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,410
20 thousand.

294
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,320
500 m.

295
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,250
You're right.

296
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,320
This the man the tiger keelback wants

297
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,360
we're talking about.

298
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,240
Make a good showing.

299
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,370
Stay alive for 1 km.

300
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,490
Let me win this one.

301
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,450
Mr Black,

302
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm not leaving.

303
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,010
I'll pay respect at your grave
next Tomb Sweeping Day.

304
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,080
-Go now.
-The tiger keelback wants me.

305
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,880
I... I don't want to die.

306
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,170
So you're staying?

307
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:01,680
Master Hua'er.

308
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
I... I'm staying.

309
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,089
You're no fun.

310
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:06,970
The fun ends here.

311
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,480
I still have to carry Fatty.

312
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,400
It seems that we're heading down again.

313
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,740
This might be the end of the snake skin.

314
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,880
We finally reached the end.

315
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,060
What a long snake.

316
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,580
I'll go first. Follow me.

317
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,170
It's a dead end.

318
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:28,930
Maybe it's collapsed

319
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,080
due to an earthquake in the past.

320
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,110
Sandy soil.

321
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,470
It's hollow.

322
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,520
Let's water it.

323
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,430
No.

324
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,800
Water is precious.

325
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,920
Get a rope.

326
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,330
Shades and I will take a look down there.

327
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,770
-What do you want?
-I'll go with you.

328
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,690
Do you even know how to find a path?

329
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,370
Just wait here.

330
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,810
Fine, I can't go?

331
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,040
Then let's all stay here.

332
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,970
Master San.

333
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,850
Your nephew doesn't trust you.

334
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,090
He's worried that you'd run away.

335
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,400
You can't take the lead.

336
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,010
Stay behind us if you want to go down.

337
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,890
Okay.

338
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,930
But the three of us must
be tied with the same rope.

339
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,170
Don't touch it.

340
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,930
It's a dead person in there.

341
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,080
A... All these mud cocoons

342
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,470
are dead people?

343
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,930
Large scale constructions in the past

344
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,150
always caused heavy casualties.

345
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,010
The workers died here.

346
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,890
And their bodies were buried
by covering them in mud.

347
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,090
Places like this exist near all

348
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,440
large scale construction sites in history.

349
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:41,970
Come here, guys.

350
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,600
<i>Ssae ge</i>

351
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,570
Look.

352
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,210
This is Zhang's mark.

353
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,810
I've seen it at the Cloud Top Palace.

354
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,180
Are you sure?

355
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,170
Yes.

356
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,200
But isn't Zhang looking after Pan Zi?

357
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,340
Why is he here?

358
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,410
This is an old mark.

359
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:12,730
It's not newly carved.

360
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,290
An old mark?

361
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,880
Zhang was here before?

362
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,810
He didn't tell you?

363
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,530
Maybe it was before he lost his memory.

364
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,250
But maybe it was like you said.

365
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,160
He kept it from me.

366
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,650
That mysterious Mute...

367
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,690
Zhang has his own reason

368
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,850
for everything he does.

369
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,730
And they're all linked to his past.

370
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,360
Well, seeing a mark

371
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,490
means we're on the right path.

372
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,090
I think,

373
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,480
this passageway

374
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,120
should be below the previous one.

375
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,210
The layer of sandy soil was shaken loose.

376
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,370
We just took a shortcut.

377
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,290
Tell those above

378
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,580
to come down.

379
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,130
Slowly.

380
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,290
Fatty.

381
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,560
You finally came to.

382
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,130
Wu Xie.

383
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,600
Water.

384
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,480
Water?

385
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,400
You're asking for water already?

386
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,010
Here you go.

387
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,050
Don't rush it.

388
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,330
Fatty.

389
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,490
Can you walk?

390
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,850
Master San.

391
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,240
Why is Master San here?

392
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,450
What happened?

393
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,660
I'm seeing two images of each of you.

394
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,880
You were bitten by a snake.

395
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,920
And it dragged you

396
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,240
to its den to hatch baby snakes.

397
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,570
Then both of us were washed underground.

398
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,210
Luckily, Uncle San and
the others were nearby.

399
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,370
They saved us.

400
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,120
It turned out I'm highly favoured by fate.

401
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,480
Yeah?

402
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,520
It's your BMI that's high.

403
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,410
Running for lives with you on
my back almost got me killed,

404
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,330
you know that?

405
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:18,820
Just you wait.

406
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,980
Lose some weight when we get back

407
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,060
or I won't save you anymore.

408
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,500
Well, you have no idea.

409
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,680
This is reserved grain.

410
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,480
Thanks, Master San.

411
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Be careful.

412
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,880
This is a dead end.

413
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,640
Maybe it's blocked by the twigs and vines.

414
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,510
Hurry.

415
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,480
Clear all the things up.

416
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,930
Yes.

417
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,850
Watch out, guys.

418
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,640
Don't damage the
relics or hit any triggers.

419
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,890
Snake!

420
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,770
Snake!

421
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,490
Everyone, be careful!

422
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,650
Wu Xie, hurry up and leave with Fatty!

423
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,530
Uncle San!

424
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,640
Wu Xie, find the exit and run!

425
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,770
This way.

426
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:02,920
Uncle San!

427
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,840
So... sorry.

428
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,810
Don't be angry at me.

429
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,490
I'm just taking shelter
in this precious place.

430
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,810
I mean no harm.

431
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,490
I'm really sorry.

432
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,170
Come out.

433
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,530
Zhang?

434
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,170
Follow me.

435
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,090
Are you Chen Wen Jin?

436
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,110
Wu Xie.

437
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,190
Clean your face.

438
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
Don't worry.

439
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,650
I'm not running away.

440
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,850
Feeling better?

441
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,410
Help me up.

442
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,930
We should go and find Wu Xie.

443
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,090
Master San.

444
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,630
Take a break.

445
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,660
I'll look for him.

446
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,710
Relax.

447
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,330
I'll bring Wu Xie back.

448
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,000
So, we were right.

449
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,850
It was you.

450
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,030
But, Madam Wen Jin,

451
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,060
you don't seem to have aged at all,

452
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,920
looking exactly the same as in the photo.

453
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,970
Aren't you around Uncle San's age?

454
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,850
Being ageless

455
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,490
isn't a good thing to me.

456
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,440
You've grown a lot.

457
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,480
Twenty years ago,

458
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,810
I even helped changed your diapers.

459
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,630
Time flies.

460
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,330
Madam Wen Jin,

461
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,700
frankly speaking,

462
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,570
you appearing out of the blue...

463
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,610
I don't know how to react.

464
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,560
Who says we haven't
seen each other in a while?

465
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,690
You are Madam Dolma's daughter-in-law?

466
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:19,840
<i>Then,</i>

467
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:22,360
<i>the mud man that kept
showing up around us...</i>

468
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,330
<i>Madam Wen Jin!</i>

469
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:25,810
<i>Is it you?</i>

470
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,160
You've been following us?

471
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,410
Hang on.

472
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,810
How did you and Zhang
end up being together?

473
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
We've always been like-minded people.

474
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,280
Hold on.

475
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,810
I was separated from Uncle San's group.

476
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,370
They entered another crack.

477
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,650
Let's look for them first,

478
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,520
okay?

479
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,750
It's too dangerous to go out now.

480
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,850
The cracks here are interconnected.

481
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,250
You might miss each other

482
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,210
if you both are out searching.

483
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:58,930
Take a rest here first

484
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,120
and go out later.

485
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,250
-But...
-Don't worry.

486
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,070
The passageways

487
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,840
will lead you to the reservoir.

488
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,650
All waters flow towards there.

489
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,150
We and Wu San Xing
have the same destination.

490
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,640
As long as nothing happens to him,

491
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,130
we'll be able to meet.

492
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,880
Same destination?

493
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,840
Back when we were at the temple,

494
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,880
you deliberately stole from us

495
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:24,840
so that we'd follow you?

496
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,960
And that's to lure us to the passageway?

497
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
You're right.

498
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,120
I know you have a lot of questions.

499
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,470
You may ask me now.

500
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,700
All right.

501
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,800
Why did you pretend

502
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,030
to be Madam Dolma's daughter-in-law?

503
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,090
Just to be cautious.

504
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,350
Even you kept it from me.

505
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,470
I hinted you.

506
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,350
Nonsense.

507
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,920
When did that ever happen?

508
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,810
My eyes.

509
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,410
What eyes?

510
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,890
<i>My grandma said that</i>

511
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,690
<i>Chen Wen Jin wanted
me to pass you a message.</i>

512
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,840
Seriously?

513
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,040
That look?

514
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,090
Who would get that?

515
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,970
Zhang Qi Ling's not to blame for this.

516
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,180
Someone in the team is with It.

517
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,820
We don't know who that is.

518
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,560
If the secret is leaked,

519
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,210
we'd all be in trouble.

520
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,690
Fine.

521
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,170
Can you tell me about the videotapes?

522
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:23,890
It's a plan.

523
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,370
A long story.

524
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,010
Since that's the case,

525
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,040
I'll ask according to priority.

526
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:31,960
Why didn't you grow old?

527
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,120
Take a look at this first.

528
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,890
This was when the archaeological team

529
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,250
went to Paracel Islands 19 years ago.

530
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,480
But I can only recognize
the few members in the photo

531
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,640
who are related to this matter.

532
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,730
It's okay.

533
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,120
Name only those you know.

534
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,550
This is Zhang.

535
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,370
Yes.

536
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,880
This is you.

537
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,640
This is Uncle San.

538
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,920
Why do you think that's your uncle?

539
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,600
This is Uncle San.

540
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,720
I've seen how he looked
like as a young man.

541
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,700
This is exactly it.

542
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,890
In this world,

543
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,850
there isn't only similar photos.

544
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,960
Two people related by blood

545
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,080
may look alike too.

546
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,970
What...

547
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,400
What do you mean?

548
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:32,450
Do you mean that

549
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,350
he's not Uncle San?

550
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,160
He is not.

551
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,730
He's Xie Lian Huan.

552
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,370
No, that's not possible.

553
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,880
I know how Xie Lian Huan looked like...

554
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,280
How could this man be Xie Lian Huan?

555
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,600
Your uncle was indeed with us.

556
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,840
But he's not in the photo.

557
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,000
That's because he was the
photographer who took this photo.

558
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,520
The man you called Uncle San

559
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,650
is not Wu San Xing.

560
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,840
This is the reason why

561
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,970
he won't tell you the truth.

562
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,920
Everything's been a
mistake since the beginning.

563
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,560
Xie Lian Huan's taken his place
in the water at Paracel Islands.

564
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,970
This isn't right.

565
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,040
You're lying.

566
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,880
Madam Wen Jin,

567
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,840
you're lying, aren't you?

568
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,930
Tell me that you're lying.

569
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,210
Wu Xie.

570
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,550
After living with him for years,

571
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,240
you wouldn't believe this,
and I know that.

572
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,000
It once crossed my mind
to keep quiet about it.

573
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,120
But you're too obsessed with the mystery.

574
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
Even if I don't tell you,

575
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,970
I don't think he'll be able to
hide it for too long.

576
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,640
At this point,

577
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,040
there are too many flaws.

578
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,360
He can no longer get away with his lies

579
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,160
unless to cover it with more lies.

580
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,520
It'll be too late

581
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,680
to stop trusting him now.

582
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,400
The words written in blood at the seabed

583
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,730
of Paracel Islands clearly wrote,

584
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,390
"I cannot die in peace
because of Wu San Xing".

585
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,120
That was Xie Lian Huan's signature.

586
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,240
You read

587
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,800
those words wrong.

588
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,830
They were clearly written.

589
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:27,040
Why would I get it wrong?

590
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,040
Write them down the way you saw them.

591
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,800
<i>Xie Lian Huan left me no choice.
Wu San Xing</i>

592
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,590
<i>He drove me to a wrongful death.</i>

593
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,850
<i>Heaven and Earth bear witness.</i>

594
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,970
<i>Wu San Xing</i>

595
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,120
The order was wrong.

596
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,530
Exactly.

597
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,409
Normally,

598
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,000
everything on a rubbing
is presented in opposite.

599
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,600
Vertical contents

600
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,920
should be read from right to left.

601
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,270
When read the other way round,

602
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,449
the meaning is completely different.

603
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:23,210
Why?

604
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,969
How is this possible?

605
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,130
How is this even possible?

606
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,690
After that, we passed out
due to someone's doing.

607
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,040
<i>When we woke up,</i>

608
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,989
<i>we encountered</i>

609
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,800
<i>things that are beyond my
understanding, even until today.</i>

610
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,480
<i>Huo Ling.</i>

611
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,840
Golmud Sanatorium.

612
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,410
Some of us went missing.

613
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,720
Zhang Qi Ling was gone too.

614
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,930
And the watch showed

615
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,440
that it was already one week

616
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,570
since we fainted.

617
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,990
We also noticed that

618
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,190
the team was being watched.

619
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,730
By whom?

620
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:22,610
It.

621
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,680
"It"?

622
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,020
I can't put it to words.

623
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,560
We found this out

624
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,050
when we were studying the matter.

625
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,790
It might be a force.

626
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,420
A force?

627
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,480
<i>Having survived,</i>

628
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,960
<i>we went through</i>

629
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,660
<i>all that had happened</i>

630
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,160
<i>from the beginning at the sanatorium.</i>

631
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,870
And we realized that

632
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,980
links are missing for many of the events.

633
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,250
This means that for this to have happened,

634
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,080
it would need more than us.

635
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,200
There seemed to be an invisible man

636
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,040
who had been filling the missing part.

637
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,880
<i>But up until now,</i>

638
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,980
<i>the person never appears.</i>

639
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,920
<i>It only exists logically.</i>

640
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,980
<i>So, we called it, "It".</i>

641
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,480
It's a force other than Cox Hendry,

642
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,980
Xie Lian Huan and us.

643
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,100
The force has never appeared.

644
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,690
Many years have gone by,

645
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,510
but none of us grow old.

646
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,780
Someone must have done something

647
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,780
to our bodies

648
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,150
<i>when we were in coma.</i>

649
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,520
And you've gained longevity.

650
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,100
Do you remember

651
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,600
the thing you saw at Golmud's basement?

652
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,660
Was that really Huo Ling?

653
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,420
After the 90s,

654
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,480
we were no longer being watched.

655
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,200
We started to investigate again.

656
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,750
But ever since we came back from Tamutuo,

657
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,080
Huo Ling had changed.

658
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,000
Smell this.

659
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,800
A familiar scent.

660
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,880
It's the scent on Huo
Ling's body, isn't it?

661
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,320
The scent means that in the near future,

662
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,190
I, too, will transform.

663
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,890
My body will skip the step of dying,

664
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,650
and turn from a living person

665
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,800
straight into a monster.

666
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,520
I planned to keep this hidden.

667
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,880
But a few months ago,

668
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,060
I noticed that my body

669
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,300
gives off this scent.

670
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,510
We will all end up like Huo Ling.

671
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,040
I know that my ultimate fate is here.

672
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,820
Time is ticking for me.

673
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,420
Wu Xie.

674
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,780
Wu Xie!

675
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,420
Fatty, I'm here.

676
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,300
Wu Xie.

677
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,020
I finally found you.

678
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,340
Uncle San is injured.

679
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,020
Come. Hurry.

680
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,700
Don't worry.

681
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,150
I'm the Master San of Wu family.

682
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,660
I won't die.

683
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,280
Wen Jin.

684
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,680
You...

685
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,360
Wu Xie has learnt everything.

686
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,680
You no longer have to hide it.

687
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,560
You knew everything?

688
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,360
Uncle San rushed to the front

689
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,400
to bomb the snakes,

690
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,040
and got severely hurt.

691
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,590
Didn't you dress his wound?

692
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,650
Why is it still bleeding?

693
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,790
Where's the first aid kit?

694
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,840
Wu Xie, calm down.

695
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,670
We've lost the kit,

696
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,150
but we've given him all
the medicine available.

697
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,360
Wu Xie.

698
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,800
I'm sorry.

699
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,460
Uncle San.

700
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,280
Wen Jin.

701
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,220
Don't worry, Wu San Xing is alive.

702
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,440
I got it.

703
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:29,930
Lian Huan.

704
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,640
This is not your fault.

705
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,010
You've now returned.

706
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,090
What did you just call him?

707
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,590
Xiao Hua.

708
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,130
We haven't found the path
to Queen Mother's Palace.

709
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,930
Be it Uncle San,

710
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:02,810
your uncle,

711
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,490
or Madam Wen Jin,

712
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
isn't this what generations
of people in Mystic Nine

713
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,030
have been seeking?

714
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,040
We'll look for it.

715
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,480
But first, I need to deal
with Xie family's affair.

716
00:42:21,474 --> 00:42:31,474
