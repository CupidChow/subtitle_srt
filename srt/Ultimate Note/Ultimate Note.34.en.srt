1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,960
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,840
<i>Episode 34</i>

4
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,160
What is that?

5
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,280
Stay put.

6
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,080
You guys are being dramatic.

7
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,979
All this fuss over nothing.

8
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
It's just animal skins.

9
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:57,940
Why...

10
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,940
Why are those animal
skins being hung up?

11
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,110
Why...

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Zhang,

13
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,020
why?

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,840
It's freezing in here.

15
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,380
We didn't bring any warm clothes with us.

16
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,500
If we can't find the exit,

17
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,290
we'll have to go back the way we came.

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,630
Why don't

19
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,400
we burn these bamboo slips for warmth?

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,790
No.

21
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,710
Then we'll waste these
valuable stuff, won't we?

22
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,770
Besides,

23
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,890
it's good that it's cold here.

24
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,760
The cold temperature
keeps the Mi Luo Tuo away.

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Let's take photos.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,520
Xiu Xiu,

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,840
take a photo and send it
to the Mount Four Ladies.

28
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,180
Zhang,

29
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,600
I think

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,800
I'm getting close to the door
of your family's house.

31
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Blood.

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,120
Why would there be blood?

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,720
This is a blood groove.

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,520
It's empty.

35
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
There must be a mechanism underneath.

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,960
Could it be that we have to
use blood to open the door?

37
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,930
Zhang,

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,040
your family sure was cruel.

39
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,490
That explains the animal skins.

40
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,220
But

41
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,790
we didn't bring anything.

42
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,460
Whose blood can we use?

43
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,070
I say,

44
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,280
aren't you being too harsh to me?

45
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,700
When Fatty removed the ticks from my body,

46
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,640
he was more gentle than you.

47
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,210
I'm sorry,

48
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,130
I've cut your vein by accident.

49
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,380
Say that again.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,960
I said

51
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,980
I've cut your vein by accident.

52
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,710
I'm joking.

53
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,030
Joking?

54
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,100
Yes.

55
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,320
You have no sense of humour.

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,680
Mr Black is funnier than you.

57
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,530
I have no sense of humour?

58
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,780
Mr Xie.

59
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,410
The road was rough. Sorry I'm late.

60
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,420
Where is Mr Black?

61
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,580
You don't have to worry about him.

62
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,020
Any news from Banai?

63
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,070
No news for now.

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
I'll let you know if I hear anything.

65
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,030
Okay.

66
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,350
Get me a few emergency lights.

67
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,710
And an extractor fan.

68
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,100
Okay.

69
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,020
Zhang, do you think these
bamboo slips are valuable?

70
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,860
Fatty, in all fairness,

71
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,490
we're going to draw straws now
to decide whose blood to use.

72
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,240
There are 11 sticks here.

73
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,120
Whoever picks the long stick,

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
he will have to contribute his blood.

75
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,580
Who came up with such a bad idea?

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,140
This could get someone killed.

77
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,060
Zhang and I are not participating.

78
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,320
Me too.

79
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,700
Asking a girl to give blood?
Are you guys crazy?

80
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,220
Ms Huo, I'll draw the stick
on your behalf.

81
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,530
If you pick the long one,
I'll do it for you.

82
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Short.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,920
They all picked the short ones.

84
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,340
Your turn.

85
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,470
Short.

86
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
Short.

87
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
Short.

88
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,190
Short as well.

89
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,990
Mine's short, too.

90
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,700
We all picked the short ones.

91
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,940
Fatty, your turn.

92
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,140
There's no way I would draw straws.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
Since you two are
unwilling to cooperate,

94
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,690
you left me with no choice.

95
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,930
We'll let the team decide.

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,320
Fatty, you must have more blood than us.

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,280
Just give us some blood.
Maybe it's not lethal.

98
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,540
The rest are long ones.

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,160
You cheated.

100
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,580
Huo San, what are you trying to do?

101
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,540
Ms Huo, we are unwilling to harm anyone.

102
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,310
But we can't keep getting
stuck here, can we?

103
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,200
Zhang is the key for
us to make it to the end.

104
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,040
Fatty, you are our only choice
to get some blood.

105
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,960
That's enough.

106
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,080
Stop acting as a gangster.

107
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,400
You just need some dense fluid, right?

108
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,280
Is blood really necessary?

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,159
I have just the right person for the job.

110
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,840
Have we got the photos from Banai?

111
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,380
Look at this, Wu Xie.

112
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,480
How come this pattern
resembles the metal plate inside?

113
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:12,570
No.

114
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,770
It's exactly the same.

115
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
There's a pattern on the metal plate

116
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,740
that's not in the cave.

117
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Look at this photo.

118
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,450
This must be Hou.

119
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,050
It is said to be Qilin's ancestor.

120
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,340
It feeds on dragons.

121
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,090
It is at the top of the food chain.

122
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,179
But this Hou here

123
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,039
seems to be tied up with something.

124
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,330
This one looks like a few people
are running from something,

125
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,360
and they have no right hands.

126
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,360
Let's look at the next one.

127
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,090
I'm a little confused by this one.

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,760
These people are clearly not Han Chinese

129
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,400
with those long swords.

130
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,450
I've never seen the
crowns on their head before.

131
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,860
They look as if

132
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,560
they are ambushing something.

133
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,450
This one is so simple.

134
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,900
There are only three holes.

135
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,400
So do you have any idea, Wu Xie?

136
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,350
This group looks like they are bait.

137
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,650
While another group looks like

138
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,520
they are hunting this Hou.

139
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,040
Connecting these reliefs together,
that's all I can interpret.

140
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,190
But if we look at them separately,

141
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,690
the interpretation could
be completely different.

142
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,010
Should we go?

143
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,030
It's about time.

144
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,420
Put on the suits, let's go inside.

145
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,170
Everyone ready?

146
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,430
We're ready.

147
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,540
Zhang,

148
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,280
are you ready?

149
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,890
Zhang is ready!

150
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,450
It has been chasing after us before.

151
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,920
Now I'm going to use it as our key.

152
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,250
Brothers,

153
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,800
smash it!

154
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,950
Step aside.

155
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,800
It's here! Spray it!

156
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,240
How dare you chase me?
Spray it with the alkali!

157
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,760
Let's go.

158
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,280
Let's go down.

159
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,220
The pattern is indeed the same.

160
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,820
But I can't tell which one is Hou,

161
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,320
which one is people.

162
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,000
Wu Xie,

163
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,320
let's turn this metal plate clockwise

164
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,610
according to its direction of rotation.

165
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
Ready? One, two, three.

166
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,040
It won't move.

167
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Let's try counterclockwise.

168
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,640
Come on.

169
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,280
One, two, three.

170
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,720
Try harder.

171
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,990
It won't move.

172
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,350
We need to find a way

173
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,400
to make this metal plate turn.

174
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,250
Your face is dirty.

175
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,900
Wipe yourself off.

176
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,060
Paints are peeling off this stupid thing.

177
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
Xiao Hua,

178
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,590
it's blood.

179
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Blood?

180
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,920
How can there be blood?

181
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,880
Bloods were poured
on it, layer after layer.

182
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,590
God knows much blood it took
form such a thick layer.

183
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,720
Look at the pattern of the groove,

184
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,190
it's blood groove.

185
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,960
This is no ordinary metal plate.

186
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,410
This is a sacrificial plate.

187
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,910
So this is how it was used.

188
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,360
Do we really need to get so
much blood to pour on it too?

189
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,640
Can't we use water instead?

190
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,260
Look.

191
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,610
Nothing will happen

192
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,850
if we pour water on it.

193
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,960
Because the density
of water is insufficient.

194
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,530
It's unable to trigger the
mechanism underneath.

195
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,900
Then we need a lot of blood.

196
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,120
How about this?

197
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,940
Let's ask your men
outside to buy two sheep.

198
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,020
And get us some blood.

199
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,640
It must be sealed well.

200
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,950
This is great.

201
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,150
It's all rocks.

202
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,680
Finally, no more weird
things crawling out from inside.

203
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,430
Keep walking.

204
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,310
Zhang,

205
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,250
let's give everyone a break.

206
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,160
Let's take a breather.

207
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,190
Oh my god.

208
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,020
These look like reliefs.

209
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,280
But something just feels off.

210
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,829
This entire wall

211
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,950
should have been a complete relief,

212
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,070
but the relief on the surface
was knocked down,

213
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,440
all that remains is
the relief that sunk inside.

214
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,570
By rights,

215
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,770
if we trigger the mechanism,

216
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,340
the relief that sunk
inside will be pushed out

217
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,780
to form a complete picture.

218
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,810
Like a puzzle.

219
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
Though

220
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,180
we can't see the full picture now.

221
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,360
Maybe the clues are in the
rest of the picture.

222
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,520
Let's take a closer look.

223
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,590
Xiao Hua, pass me the photo.

224
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,830
Here you go.

225
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,690
You see,

226
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,150
Is the little hand on this relief

227
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,690
the same as the one in the photo?

228
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,440
It is.

229
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,150
This is the eye of Hou.

230
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,320
Let me see.

231
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,600
Wu Xie, look.

232
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,060
That means that

233
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,240
this wall is the relief
of the hidden troop.

234
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,040
If I turn my back to the cave now,

235
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,820
then on my left

236
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,520
is Hou.

237
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,090
Based on what you said,

238
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,950
then this wall is the relief

239
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,210
of those men without right hands.

240
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,300
On the right is the relief
of the tribesmen.

241
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,450
The photo with the three holes

242
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,550
corresponds to the wall behind you.

243
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,070
Everything matches.

244
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,350
So that means

245
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,300
there really is a connection between
Banai and the Mount Four Ladies.

246
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,240
Thousand-Li Lock.

247
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,120
Fatty,

248
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,760
there is still enough drinking water,

249
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,290
but there is not much left to eat.

250
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,810
How many bottles of water are here?

251
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,050
11.

252
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,840
11 bottles for ten members?

253
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,870
Are you trying to keep the
extra bottle for yourself?

254
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,510
Listen, drinking too
much water could be bad.

255
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,420
But

256
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,160
we have 11 members.

257
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,980
Did you take your math
lessons from a gym teacher?

258
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,720
How can there be eleven people?

259
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,220
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

260
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,270
Eleven...

261
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,960
Did I take my math lessons
from a gym teacher?

262
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,540
The five of you,

263
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,360
the eight men from the Huo family,

264
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,040
me, Zhang and Xiu Xiu.

265
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,600
Altogether there are 16 people.

266
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,830
When we first came in, two
men from the Huo family died.

267
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,850
One died when he went to relieve himself.

268
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,560
Two were killed by Mi Luo Tuo.

269
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,970
That's right. 11 are left.

270
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,110
There was also Huo Da.

271
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,920
Huo Da hasn't been seen

272
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,200
since he fell off the bridge.

273
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,900
Just now...

274
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,670
There were also eleven people
when we drew straws just now.

275
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,050
<i>There are 11 sticks here.</i>

276
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,760
<i>Whoever picks the long stick,</i>

277
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,820
<i>he will have to contribute his blood.</i>

278
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,720
Go.

279
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,670
Identify your men one by one.

280
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,510
I'll talk to Zhang.

281
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,710
Okay.

282
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,910
Let's go.

283
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,040
Okay.

284
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,960
Zhang,

285
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,470
quiz time.

286
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,630
I'm going to ask you a question that
only we both know the answer to.

287
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,400
The guy who died in Seven Star Palace,

288
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,610
what was his name?

289
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,200
How can I forget this?

290
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,290
You've lost your memory.

291
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,370
Let me ask you another one.

292
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,470
The precious thing
that I gave you as a gift,

293
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,380
what is the picture on it?

294
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,270
Chicken.

295
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
Good.

296
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,270
Keep an eye on them.
I'm going to catch a mole.

297
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,840
Xiu Xiu.

298
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,830
What is it, Fatty?

299
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,400
Nothing.

300
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,190
I'm just thinking about our past.

301
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,320
Where did we first meet?

302
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,560
In Ta...

303
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,560
Tamutuo.

304
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,080
That's right.

305
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,290
I took good care

306
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,610
-of you and Xiao Hua back then.
-Yes, yes.

307
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,390
And I haven't got the opportunity
to repay your kindness.

308
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,760
The hell with repaying kindness.

309
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,120
-Don't bully Ms Huo.
-I've never seen you in Tamutuo.

310
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,240
Tell me.

311
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,800
Who are you?

312
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,320
Where is the real Huo Xiu Xiu?

313
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,560
I should've sent you abroad with
Huo You Xue and the others.

314
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,350
Grandma,

315
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,680
you may be able

316
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,150
to stop me from going today.

317
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,490
But tomorrow or the day after that,

318
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,400
there will be a time
when you can't stop me.

319
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,280
The Huo family lived not only
for their own obsessions.

320
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,040
Everyone has their own quest to fulfill.

321
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,010
Going to Zhang family's Old Pavilion

322
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,240
is my quest.

323
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,780
Not yours.

324
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,340
Then what am I?

325
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,520
Haven't you figured it out yet?

326
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,720
Just keep sitting here, then.

327
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,840
Grandma.

328
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,880
Grandma.

329
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,590
Who are you?

330
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,000
Huo Xiao Yao?

331
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,420
What are you doing here?

332
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,660
Fatty, I'm not a bad person.

333
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,080
Mrs Huo asked me to
come down for Ms Huo.

334
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,840
I didn't mean any harm.

335
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,890
Doesn't matter whether she's real or fake,

336
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,080
this fake Xiu Xiu has been
with us this whole time.

337
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,040
She is not the extra person.

338
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,540
My friend,

339
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,860
I don't think I've ever seen you before.

340
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,190
She's the mole.

341
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,600
Who are you calling a mole?

342
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,770
Watch your mouth.

343
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,570
Don't think we can't beat you
because there are more of you.

344
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,650
-Yeah.
-You think you can outnumber us?

345
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,330
When things get real, then you'll see.

346
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,600
What? You want to fight?

347
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,120
-It was you who challenged me first.
-Do you want to fight?

348
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,110
-I'm not afraid of you.
-Come on.

349
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,560
Where did he go?

350
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,250
Did they walk through a wall?

351
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,940
A hole.

352
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,390
Where did he go?

353
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,310
He ran away.

354
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,240
It's that sloped-shoulder again, isn't it?

355
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,920
I tried to touch his shoulder.

356
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,120
But it's empty underneath his shirt.

357
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,600
He's sneaky.

358
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,080
Having sloped shoulders
served him right.

359
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,590
Have you caught him?

360
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,150
Fake Xiu Xiu,

361
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,160
come here.

362
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,030
Fatty.

363
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,150
Why do you Mystic Nine people

364
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,150
like to disguise as Huo Xiu Xiu?

365
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,270
What?

366
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,080
Is this a Huo Xiu Xiu
impression contest?

367
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,860
No.

368
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,980
But your disguise is much better

369
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,420
than Master Hua'er.

370
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
You won.

371
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,390
Even I failed to see through you.

372
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,230
Well.

373
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,310
I've been exercising

374
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,440
to maintain a figure like Ms Huo's.

375
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,480
Don't be smug.

376
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,680
I'll have a bone to pick with Mrs Huo
when I get out.

377
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,680
Take your men and lead the way.

378
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,680
Let's go.

379
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,400
It isn't difficult to solve
this Thousand-Li Lock.

380
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,090
To put it simply,

381
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,040
it means that we can
solve the mystery in Banai

382
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,330
with our information here.

383
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,170
But Zhang family's Thousand-Li Lock

384
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
is not that simple to solve.

385
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,400
There are three holes in
the metal plate in the photo.

386
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,380
Putting two and two together,

387
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,520
these three walls,

388
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,000
if I'm not mistaken,

389
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:00,890
should have three locks.

390
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:02,330
We'll need to figure out how to open it.

391
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,200
There are two ways.

392
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,000
The first way is to turn this metal plate

393
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,560
to the same direction as the one in Banai.

394
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,640
Head to head and tail to tail.

395
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:15,150
Then the answer will come out.

396
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,110
This doesn't make sense.

397
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,740
Back then, we couldn't get photos

398
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,060
whenever we wanted.

399
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,610
Besides, in the worst-case scenario,

400
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,770
we could make a full turn,

401
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,500
and eventually get the angle right.

402
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,770
This way is not safe.

403
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,500
You got a point.

404
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,750
Zhang,

405
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,270
this seems to be a door.

406
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,040
But this door of your house seems sloppy.

407
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,350
What is this?

408
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,760
Horse dung.

409
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,880
Your family isn't very neat.

410
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
Looking at this horse dung,

411
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,180
recall anything?

412
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,190
What can you tell from this?

413
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,630
Faker,

414
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,000
come here.

415
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:31,110
What is it?

416
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,440
Ask your men to scrape
off this horse dung.

417
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
Horse dung?

418
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,000
Zhang,

419
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,750
so this is the gate of
your family's house.

420
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,690
There seems to be a give here.

421
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,640
Don't touch it.

422
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,880
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

423
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,400
Fake Xiu Xiu,

424
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,840
take a photo and send it
to the Mount Four Ladies.

425
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,480
We'll see what Wu Xie
has to say about this.

426
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,430
Look.

427
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,560
That Fatty.

428
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,650
This is the first lock in Banai.

429
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,040
This seems to match the one on the relief.

430
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,680
Let me see, Wu Xie.

431
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,280
<i>The relief can be pushed.
It's up to you to figure out how.</i>

432
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,650
"The relief can be pushed."

433
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,290
"It's up to you to figure out how."

434
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,520
Looks like if we
turn this metal plate correctly,

435
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,500
this wall will change,

436
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,600
and the change on
the relief will be our answer.

437
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,540
Speaking of which,

438
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,580
you just said there is a second way.

439
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,900
What is it?

440
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,650
Solve it from the inside.

441
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,300
Yes.

442
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,000
Get inside this machinery.

443
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,080
I would really like to see

444
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,560
how this mechanism works.

445
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,640
Someone, bring us the water.

446
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,150
There isn't any news from Wu Xie yet.

447
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,960
Hey,

448
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
why should I do all the dirty work

449
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,920
while you just stay there and wait?

450
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,400
It's too dirty for me.

451
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,880
But it isn't too dirty for me?

452
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,440
I don't owe you anything.

453
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,780
Are you sure about that, Wu Xie?

454
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,980
Alright, it's done.

455
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,400
Wu Xie,

456
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,800
there is a dark figure underneath.

457
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,330
Although I have no idea what it is,

458
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,510
it's very dangerous.

459
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,550
Also,

460
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,430
here,

461
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,350
tuck it into your chest and back.

462
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,040
It can save your life.

463
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,720
After you put it on, we'll
start to turn the metal plate.

464
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Alright.

465
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:59,870
My friends,

466
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,670
let's count off again.

467
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,880
One.

468
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,860
Two.

469
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,330
Three.

470
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,760
Four.

471
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,210
Five.

472
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,389
Six.

473
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Seven.

474
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,080
Eight.

475
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Nine.

476
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,469
Ten.

477
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,840
Corresponding to the
three holes on the plate,

478
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,290
there are three trap walls.

479
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,560
And the chains here happen
to be divided into three groups,

480
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,160
which led into three tunnels.

481
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
This structure proves

482
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,320
that there are three
different mechanisms.

483
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,720
Each of the holes corresponds to a wall,

484
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,590
which means if we pull these chains,

485
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,270
the position of the relief would change.

486
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,760
The chain connecting to
the tunnel behind us is the lowest.

487
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,720
So it should be the first mechanism.

488
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,480
Look,

489
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,000
there are water wheels here.

490
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,720
Looks like these water wheels

491
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,820
provide the power to drive
the metal plate.

492
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,060
Let's find Shades first.

493
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,670
Let's solve this puzzle first.

494
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,530
What are you waiting for?

495
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,140
Wu Xie,

496
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,360
we have to fend for ourselves now,

497
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,480
we can't rely on Shades.

498
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,520
Let's go.

499
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,790
These pots here are the same

500
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,640
as the ones in the
sunken ship in Devil City.

501
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,710
They must be filled with

502
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,000
something bad.

503
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,660
The rocks above must weigh
at least a few thousand pounds.

504
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,130
If it drops,

505
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,390
it's going to smash us into pieces.

506
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,240
If those things inside come out,

507
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,650
we're still going to die.

508
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,570
Can't do. It's too thin.
I can't step on it.

509
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,600
Let me try to move it.

510
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,400
No.

511
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,850
It's stuck to the floor. It's not movable.

512
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,140
The Zhang family really didn't
welcome outsiders.

513
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,110
If only Zhang were here.

514
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,540
A difficult guy and a difficult puzzle.

515
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
The perfect match.

516
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,030
You

517
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,160
have been pampered by those around you.

518
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,780
You rely on others to solve your problem.

519
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,010
I was born lucky.

520
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,380
Fortunately, these are manually made.

521
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,500
There should still be a way.

522
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,960
Here, take this.

523
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,450
Tie it to a place.

524
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,970
You can use it to cross over.

525
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,250
I'll try to cross it with my back on it.

526
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:43,980
Are you crazy?

527
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,520
It's so brittle, you could break it
easily. Are you sure about this?

528
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,100
If I say I'm not, do you want to do it?

529
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,670
I'd rather stay here and pray for you.

530
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,550
You can do it.

531
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,640
Once I lie down on it,

532
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm going to need the
blessing from my ancestors.

533
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,160
Be careful.

534
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,820
Bless you.

535
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:52,090
Xiao Hua,

536
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,120
slow down. No one is competing with you.

537
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,680
Take a break if you're tired.

538
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,630
How can I take a break in such a place?

539
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,940
If the thing above falls down,

540
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,990
I'll be minced meat.

541
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,250
Then Shades

542
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:09,350
could make dumplings out of me.

543
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,850
There's nothing I can do to help you now.

544
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,940
You wouldn't want me to chant
prayers for you, would you?

545
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,000
How about this?

546
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,030
Let me sing you a song.

547
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,240
Sure.

548
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,880
"Farewell My Concubine"
or "Drunken Beauty?"

549
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,360
♫ Two little tigers, two little tigers ♫

550
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,060
♫ Running fast, running fast ♫

551
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,780
♫ One of them has no eyes,
one of them has no... ♫

552
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,180
That's enough. Stop singing.

553
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,120
I'm going to lose all my
strength if you keep singing.

554
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,120
Just keep moving. Don't stop, okay?

555
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,520
Xiao Hua,

556
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,170
you've only been moving for a while,

557
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,570
why are you panting like that?

558
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,800
Panting?

559
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,360
I'm not panting.

560
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,680
I thought it was you?

561
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,480
Stop kidding with me.

562
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,720
I'm not doing anything.
Why would I be panting?

563
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,550
Wu Xie, what's going on?

564
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,090
Why did you stop talking?

565
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,560
I'm fine.

566
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,190
Keep moving.

567
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,800
Be careful.

568
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,520
Come here, come.

569
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,680
Come to me.

570
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,860
Come on.

571
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,880
Wu Xie, are you sure you're alright?

572
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,720
Wu Xie?

573
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,950
Wu Xie!

574
00:42:09,114 --> 00:42:19,114
