00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,950
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,900
<i>Episode 35</i>

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,479
Wu Xie, are you really okay?

5
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,039
Don't think that you can go near Xiao Hua!

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,039
Just ignore me. Go there now!

7
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,110
My friends.

8
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,250
-Three.
-Three.

9
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,060
Four.

10
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,740
Five.

11
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,230
Six.

12
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,510
Seven.

13
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,600
Eight.

14
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,740
Nine.

15
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,800
Ten.

16
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,920
Xiao Hua.

17
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,090
You are awake.

18
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,120
You are quite lucky.

19
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,720
Fortunately the fang
didn't cut through your finger.

20
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,840
Not much venom went into your body.

21
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,040
That's why you are still alive.

22
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,360
How long did I stay unconscious?

23
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,080
I guess about two hours.

24
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,620
You are quite good at fighting.

25
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,210
I thought you were doomed.

26
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,820
It has been said.

27
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,089
I am lucky.

28
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,079
Enough, stop boasting.

29
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,810
You have even written down
your last words.

30
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,300
What did I write?

31
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,570
Think about it.

32
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,610
What would you write
when you're about to die?

33
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll tell you it is dangerous.

34
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,940
That is not right.

35
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,280
Tell Zhang and Fatty to seek revenge for me.

36
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,600
No, that is not right either.

37
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,940
The password to my bank account.

38
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,510
It is quite close to the right answer.

39
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,490
Stop fooling around.

40
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,159
What did I write?

41
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,780
Look.

42
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,840
<i>189652802200059</i>

43
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,150
"One, eight, nine."

44
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,250
"Six, five, two, eight."

45
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,440
"Zero, two, two, zero, zero, zero,
five, nine."

46
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,260
I saw these numbers before.

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,280
I have a piece of Yellow Silk
which I have yet to crack.

48
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
The only thing that I could find
was these numbers.

49
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
But I have no idea what it means.

50
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,410
Same numbers as what I wrote?

51
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,830
Exactly the same.

52
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,040
That is strange.

53
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,930
Not only that,

54
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,220
these numbers

55
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,220
are also the registration number
of Cox Hendry's company.

56
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,170
It seems that you remember

57
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,810
much more than I thought.

58
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,250
I don't even know

59
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,659
what is playing on my mind.

60
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,230
It is as if there is another person
in my body.

61
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,470
Memorise it.

62
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,950
Perhaps we can crack it in the future.

63
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,450
Can you walk?

64
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,210
Wire walking or zip-lining? Choose one.

65
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,760
Let's go.

66
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,840
Watch out.

67
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,420
It seems that this is the control room
of the trap on the upper level.

68
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,800
A crypto module made of bronze?

69
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,820
As expected, only bronze can remain
complete and stable for such a long time.

70
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,130
When I was at Qinling,

71
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,050
I saw a bronze tree which has existed
for thousands of years.

72
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,600
Until today, it can still be used
to complete the ritual.

73
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,300
I was wondering
why it looked so strange.

74
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,740
Lei style architecture
is ingrained in my mind.

75
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,400
However, this item

76
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,380
was not designed
in Lei style architecture.

77
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,720
It is designed by the Zhang Family.

78
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,810
That is right.

79
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,720
That's why Zhang family's Old Pavilion
remains safe

80
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,370
after moving for so many times.

81
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,120
Regardless the dynasty and era,

82
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,570
regardless the contractors,

83
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,000
regardless the venue,

84
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,750
as long as the module
is possessed by the Zhang Family,

85
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,130
it can remain safe.

86
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,300
That is right.

87
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,610
It is just like moving for a few times

88
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,650
but never changing the lock.

89
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,860
As long as you have the key,

90
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,050
you can always go home.

91
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,650
Therefore, Zhang family's
Old Pavilion in Banai

92
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,850
is the last place they moved to.

93
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,460
Surprisingly after getting bitten
by the snake,

94
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,780
you can think faster.

95
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,730
Is that a compliment?

96
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,810
You...

97
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,200
You should make up the lack of
physical strength with your cleverness.

98
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,300
Break the code.

99
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,000
We can't simply break it.

100
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,860
We need to figure how it works
before we do anything.

101
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,450
Wu Xie.

102
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,170
There are many thin chains over here.

103
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,640
Are they complicated?

104
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,780
No, they are not.

105
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,440
They are quite simple.

106
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,980
For a trap like this,

107
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,380
there are only two choices.

108
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,840
It is either we get rewarded
by the mechanism

109
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,660
when we make the right step

110
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,950
or we get punished by the mechanism

111
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,140
when we make the wrong step.

112
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,060
Isn't that how an ATM works?

113
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,230
Insert card.

114
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,310
Enter the correct password.

115
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,710
If the password is correct, the machine
will give us the money.

116
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,080
If the password is wrong,
the card will be swallowed.

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,150
Do you mean that?

118
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,820
These five chains

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
represent a password with five figures.

120
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,480
The permutation of one to five

121
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,900
is 120 types of password in total.

122
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,330
Among them, 119 are wrong passwords.

123
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,400
They will trigger punishment.

124
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,539
Only one password is correct.

125
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,630
Number the thin chains
according to their sequence.

126
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,840
Then, separate the thin chains

127
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,020
from the mechanism behind the wall.

128
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,460
Mark both ends of the broken chains.

129
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,410
We have to keep trying

130
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,780
and record the sequence of
all the thin chains when they are moving.

131
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,970
We will eventually find
the correct password.

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,800
I have broken all the thin chains.

133
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,070
Are you done?

134
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,560
I have numbered the chains too.

135
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,600
What are you waiting for?

136
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,520
Let's start now.

137
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,490
Sure.

138
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,180
I'll start with the thick chain.

139
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
One, two, three, four, five.

140
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,400
It is so heavy.

141
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,380
One.

142
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,260
Two.

143
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,070
Three.

144
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,280
Four.

145
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:46,820
Five.

146
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,080
Thin chains.

147
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,640
Four, five, eight, twelve, twenty-one.

148
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,620
Wu Xie, change the sequence.

149
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,070
Thick chain, one, two,

150
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,960
three,

151
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,920
five,

152
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,040
four.

153
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,680
Wu Xie.

154
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,930
The sequence of the thin chains is still
four, five, eight, twelve and twenty-one.

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,340
Are you sure that is the sequence?

156
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,160
It seems that only when the thin chains
don't follow the sequence

157
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,520
will this ATM give us the money.

158
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,100
That is the right password.

159
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,240
Fine.

160
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,040
Three, five, one, two, four.

161
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,780
-Keep going.
-Three, five, one, four, two.

162
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,720
<i>A B</i>

163
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,240
Again.

164
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,760
Three, five, two, one, four.

165
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,550
Try again.

166
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,160
Now, the sequence should be
three, five, four, two, one.

167
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,430
It is a success.

168
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,760
The thin chains have changed.

169
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,120
The sequence of the thin chains
is two, three, eight, nine and eleven.

170
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,570
Three, five, four, two, one.

171
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,060
This is the correct password.

172
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,660
Wu Xie, I will connect
the thin chains with carabiners.

173
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,350
You repeat the sequence.

174
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,360
Sure.

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,000
Go!

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
Three.

177
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Five.

178
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,190
Four.

179
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,620
Two.

180
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,640
One.

181
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,450
Nice.

182
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,490
I think we have succeeded.

183
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,690
The relief sculptures
will undergo changes for sure.

184
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,600
Let's go.

185
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,520
The new reliefs have appeared.

186
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,970
They are different from
the previous sculptures.

187
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,260
It is corresponding to the sculptures
shown in the photos.

188
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,330
Some of the new reliefs are protruded.

189
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,930
Based on our photo,

190
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,190
if we press those that are protruded,

191
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,560
we'll trigger the mechanism.

192
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,120
It's time to pass the baton.

193
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,950
In that era,

194
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,710
cameras and the Internet did not exist.

195
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,850
They could only
copy the pattern from the wall

196
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,880
and manually transport the drawing.

197
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,350
It would at least take a year.

198
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,130
The Zhang Family was too much.

199
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,990
It was such a simple thing

200
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,190
yet they complicated it.

201
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,220
I guess they didn't have a choice.

202
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,180
They had to guard against
robbers and thieves,

203
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,200
people from the other clans

204
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,870
or even their own family members.

205
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,550
I always remember what my grandpa said.

206
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,100
What is more scary than ghost and god

207
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,890
is human heart.

208
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,390
Goodness.

209
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,980
It corresponds to the photo.

210
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,550
It is exactly the same.

211
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,780
Zhang.

212
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,220
The design done by your family
is quite interesting.

213
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
It is destiny.

214
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,470
We just have to press the bulges
according to the photo

215
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,530
and we will succeed?

216
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,960
But honestly,

217
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,470
your ancestors made it so complicated.

218
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,310
They made things difficult
for their grandchild.

219
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,220
Are you sure?

220
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,440
What do you mean?

221
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,210
Those who are not part
of the Zhang Family

222
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,650
can't go in Zhang family's
Old Pavilion alive.

223
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,880
Zhang.

224
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,640
Don't fool around.

225
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,550
It's not the right time to joke around.

226
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,600
I have pressed the bulge.

227
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,380
Press it.

228
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,840
You won't die as I am here.

229
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,960
Zhang.

230
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,240
When the prank comes from
a decent person like you,

231
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,770
it is even scarier than
when it is done by real bad guys.

232
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,560
Fake Xiu Xiu,

233
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,190
take a photo for us

234
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,230
and send it to Wu Xie.

235
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,760
By the way,

236
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,190
include a message too.

237
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,720
I will complain about Zhang
to Wu Xie later.

238
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,390
Let's go.

239
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,910
Why is it so quiet?

240
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,120
Is it a normal corridor?

241
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,950
What else do you wish to see?

242
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,680
Look over there.

243
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,180
Let's go.

244
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,210
Isn't that Hou found on the sculpture?

245
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,400
Why did your family place it here
as watchdogs?

246
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,040
Stop.

247
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Zhang.

248
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Let's go together.

249
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,200
You watch the left

250
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,830
while I watch the right.

251
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Wait here.

252
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,170
Don't move around.

253
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,680
Zhang, your watchdog

254
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,800
bit me for no reason.

255
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,800
Zhang, there is a trap behind every tile.

256
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,840
You better be careful.

257
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,060
Are you okay?

258
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,650
We won't trigger the trap
if only we use the right way.

259
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,870
However, if we try each tile,

260
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,520
you will be roasted to death.

261
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,280
The first tile is correct.

262
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,620
Zhang.

263
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,360
This place is owned by your family.

264
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,840
Did anyone in your family tell you

265
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,360
any formation or pithy formula?

266
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
It does exist.

267
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,280
So the formula lies in his kung fu.

268
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,240
It turns out the claw is guiding us.

269
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,430
It is guiding people with
good kung fu like Zhang.

270
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,390
Lao Gao.

271
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,380
Why don't you give it a try?

272
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,250
You might get riddled with the weapons.

273
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,530
No, I am not going.

274
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,410
Why do I have a feeling that the trap
designed by the Zhang Family

275
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,640
is just to let the family members
look cool?

276
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,900
Yes, it makes sense.

277
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,570
I am the real

278
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,250
Zhang Qi Ling.

279
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
So cool.

280
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,590
Wu Xie?

281
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,250
Wu Xie!

282
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,910
Wu Xie!

283
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,520
Get up.

284
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,350
Look, we received another mission.

285
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,240
It's another stone door.

286
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,060
Why did he remove his clothes?

287
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,680
It seems that the pathway
leading to the second trap

288
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,200
is exactly the same with the previous one.

289
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,230
Let me go first.

290
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,160
Even the mechanism of the trap
is exactly the same.

291
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,920
Let's reapply the method we used
to solve the first trap.

292
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,200
Wu Xie gave us the password quite fast.

293
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,320
It's complete.

294
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,360
It is so cold.

295
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,810
Yes.

296
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,490
What is that?

297
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,680
Listen.

298
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,530
Since we are just waiting,

299
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,320
why don't we explore the last pathway?

300
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,370
Don't mess up the situation.
Just wait for the photo patiently.

301
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,250
No.

302
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,660
There are three passwords in total.

303
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,860
Since we have to get all the passwords.

304
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,300
why don't we get the password
before hand

305
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,190
and send it to them?

306
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,630
Isn't that more time effective?

307
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,040
Wu Xie, we are in an adventure.

308
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,180
This is not a game.

309
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,740
We must ensure that
each action is precise.

310
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,720
Are we going to wait here for nothing?

311
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,280
How about this?

312
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,680
Let's meet with Mr Black.

313
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,610
Didn't he tell us not to find him?

314
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,710
He has made the arrangement.

315
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,360
We are from the Mystic Nine.

316
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,690
It's normal to be deeply involved in this.

317
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,400
I wonder what Mr Black did.

318
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,000
He has been struggling together with us
all this while.

319
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,130
Perhaps he has been involved in it
since the beginning.

320
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,860
Perhaps he knows more than us.

321
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,310
No matter how much he knows,

322
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,010
it is still all about clues and steps.

323
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,960
-The final answer...
-Wu Xie.

324
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,570
I know some clues that none of you know.

325
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,570
Do you want to know?

326
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,820
Of course.

327
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,260
I found a Yellow Silk.

328
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,010
It is completely different from the rest.

329
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,210
There is no map on it.

330
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,010
In contrast,

331
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,470
it is the prologue of a story.

332
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,390
How strange.

333
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,590
There is no sculpture on it.

334
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,200
Zhang.

335
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,080
There is no pathway.

336
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,220
This place is as cold as a freezer.

337
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,840
We need to find a way as soon as possible.

338
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,270
Otherwise, all of us will freeze soon.

339
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,010
It's ice jade.

340
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,800
It can slow down decomposition.

341
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,140
What?

342
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,920
So this is a morgue?

343
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,240
Don't just wait idly.

344
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,410
Look around.

345
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,170
Find if there is any trap or exit.

346
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,350
We don't have the courage
to touch anything.

347
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,710
What if we found something bad?

348
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,640
Cinnabar powder.

349
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,620
Isn't this

350
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,530
the totem of Qilin
stepping on the ghosts?

351
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,840
Wu Xie and I did
some research on it before.

352
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,540
This is the floor plan of Ghost Seal.

353
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,880
There are gaps.

354
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:52,770
Yes.

355
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,760
Three of the ghosts have no head.

356
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,950
According to Wu Xie,

357
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,600
they are after the ring worn by
the person who has the Ghost Seal.

358
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,240
It's not here.

359
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:05,970
Now I see.

360
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,520
Come here, everyone.

361
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,850
On the Ghost Seal, three of
the ghosts have no head.

362
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,280
However, on this diagram,
their heads are there.

363
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,080
Find those three.

364
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,880
The Heavenly Queen Mother,

365
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,900
King Mu of Zhou

366
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:32,990
and King Shang of Lu

367
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,680
pursued immortality.

368
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,280
Rumour has it that only
the Heavenly Queen Mother did it.

369
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,200
<i>As such, King Mu of Zhou
went to see her.</i>

370
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,720
<i>Both of them fell in love
with each other.</i>

371
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,710
<i>They agreed to stay immortal together.</i>

372
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,520
<i>The Heavenly Queen Mother
stayed immortal</i>

373
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,360
<i>by swallowing the pill</i>

374
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,880
<i>and stayed alive for 3000 years
in the jade meteorite.</i>

375
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,880
Based on what you just said,

376
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,520
the Heavenly Queen Mother
and the King Mu of Zhou..

377
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,790
live happily forever after
in the jade meteorite?

378
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,950
No.

379
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:07,370
King Mu of Zhou deceived
the Heavenly Queen Mother.

380
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,500
What?

381
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,800
The Heavenly Queen Mother has gone into
the jade meteorite, hasn't she?

382
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,230
No doubt she has gone inside,

383
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,720
but King Mu of Zhou didn't.

384
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,010
<i>He upgraded the law of longevity</i>

385
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,230
<i>invested by the Heavenly Queen Mother.</i>

386
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,930
<i>He used another way to avoid from
going into the jade meteorite.</i>

387
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,960
<i>He built two figurines
with jade meteorite.</i>

388
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,680
<i>One figurine to contain himself</i>

389
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,760
<i>while another to contain a baby.</i>

390
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,020
<i>After taking the pill, he planned</i>

391
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,350
<i>to break the figurine in a few years</i>

392
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,470
<i>under certain conditions.</i>

393
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,200
<i>He would be reborn as a baby</i>

394
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,690
<i>and attain longevity.</i>

395
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,730
That is ridiculous.

396
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,320
The temptation of Western Zhou.

397
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,720
He was terrible.

398
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,070
Not only he was terrible,

399
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,360
he was despicable too.

400
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,820
In order to ensure that
the figurine that he was in

401
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,470
would be found and broken on time,

402
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,660
he spread rumours about longevity

403
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,730
so that people could find the figurines.

404
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
Now I get it.

405
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,490
The Mystic Nine
is skilful in this aspect.

406
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,140
That's why they have been
threatened and used

407
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
by those people.

408
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,400
They became the tool to pursue longevity.

409
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,490
That is right.

410
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,700
Even if the Mystic Nine turned them down,

411
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,110
they would set up traps

412
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:14,250
by either tempting or threatening

413
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,400
to ensure every generation of
the Mystic Nine would be entwined in it.

414
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,400
In that case,

415
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,430
these people are pathetic.

416
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,910
The King Mu of Zhou

417
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,360
failed in the experiment.

418
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,600
I went to Emperor Lu's Seven Star Palace
before.

419
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:29,390
King Shang of Lu tried to
snatch King Mu of Zhou's figurine.

420
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,680
He wanted to keep it for himself.

421
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:33,230
However, Tie Mian Sheng crossed him.

422
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,120
Who is Tie Mian Sheng?

423
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,790
He can be considered as
the oriole behind the mantis

424
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
which is stalking the cicada.

425
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,700
What happened to him?

426
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,840
He didn't succeed either.

427
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,320
In short,

428
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,760
the law of longevity

429
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,090
is just their wishful thinking.

430
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,480
It is complete.

431
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,150
I have found all the gaps.

432
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,340
There is a gap on the thumb.

433
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,680
There is a gap on the index finger.

434
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,190
There is a gap on the middle finger.

435
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,590
Back off.

436
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,130
Goodness.

437
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,630
Amazing.

438
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
It is so unbelievable.

439
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
Amazing.

440
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,810
Just by inserting two fingers,
we found a place to sleep.

441
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,610
The Zhang Family
knows what they are doing.

442
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,040
Amazing.

443
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,480
Is that the only word you know?

444
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,680
Listen.

445
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,770
Isn't that a dumb-waiter in restaurant?

446
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,960
It will take less than ten seconds

447
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,940
to deliver food from kitchen
to the dining table.

448
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,640
What can the Zhang Family deliver with it?

449
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,330
Dead body.

450
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,680
<i>Beef stew</i>

451
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,000
What are you doing?

452
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,500
That is my lunch.

453
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,640
Amazing.

454
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,980
There is only one way.

455
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,850
What's worse? It is not for the living.

456
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,890
Someone has to go down.

457
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,100
Who volunteers to go down?

458
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,350
Look at you.

459
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
All of you are greedy for money
but fear death.

460
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,050
Fatty, what about you?

461
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,450
I am greedy for money
but I do not fear death.

462
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,820
I can't fit in the bed.

463
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,600
The canned food is gone.

464
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,880
We will find the answer
if someone goes down.

465
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,080
I am going.

466
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,080
No way.

467
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,400
We don't know what is going on down there.
It's too dangerous.

468
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,160
The scabbard is a present for you.

469
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,040
Zhang!

470
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,400
Don't go!

471
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,840
Zhang!

472
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,260
Zhang!

473
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,320
Buddha, please bless him.

474
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
Hallelujah.

475
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,890
Guan Yu, please bless him.

476
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,570
Zhang, please stay safe.

477
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,780
No way.

478
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:08,830
If he is stuck inside,

479
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,040
he would die from suffocation.

480
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,210
Take it.

481
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,960
Open the door.

482
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Open the door.

483
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,110
Your fingers are not long enough.

484
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,230
We are doomed.

485
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,300
If something bad happens to Zhang,

486
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,150
how do I explain to Wu Xie.

487
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,830
Zhang!

488
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,390
Save him!

489
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,590
What are you waiting?

490
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,590
Hurry up!

491
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,120
Zhang!

492
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,520
Zhang!

493
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,550
Zhang!

494
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:05,930
Zhang!

495
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,360
What are you waiting for?
Come and help me out!

496
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,360
Break it!

497
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,719
Don't break the top!

498
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,719
It is too hard.

499
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,000
We can't break it.

500
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,460
There must be a way.

501
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,830
Do we have an electrical saw?

502
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,909
-Electrical saw!
-We don't have it.

503
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,389
Fatty, we don't have it.

504
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,310
I knew it.

505
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,350
You must have had left a way to escape.

506
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,220
He came back to life.

507
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,320
He came back to life.

508
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,410
You almost scared me to death.

509
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,400
You almost scared me to death.

510
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,550
Hurry up.

511
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,420
Take a photo of Mount Four Ladies.

512
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,010
Also, inform Wu Xie.

513
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,230
Be quick.

514
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,720
Both of us are freezing.

515
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,630
Look, it's a sculpture.

516
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,160
<i>Be quick!</i>

517
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,250
"Be quick"?

518
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,040
Something bad might have happened to them.

519
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,370
Zhang has always been a quiet person

520
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,360
but Fatty didn't say anything extra too.

521
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,070
The tile is loose.

522
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,660
Being out of repair

523
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,050
doesn't make sense.

524
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,620
I think something is not right.

525
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,770
You know ancient building better.

526
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,810
What do you think?

527
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,320
Everyone who knows architecture
share the same common idea.

528
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,620
We agree that ancient building in China
are of great quality.

529
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Even after a few thousand years,

530
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,710
they still remain firm
despite wind and rain.

531
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,650
There was a unique system used in the
construction industry in ancient China.

532
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,050
It is known as Work Accountability.

533
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,440
The makers were required to inscribe
their name on their work.

534
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,620
When something went wrong,

535
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,420
the officer would arrest the maker.

536
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,860
Furthermore, the punishment was heavy.

537
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,040
Therefore, a loose tile like this

538
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:14,990
is not normal.

539
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,980
It could be a trap.

540
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,120
However, in the passage,

541
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,430
we didn't encounter any danger.

542
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,500
Don't jinx it.

543
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,260
You better watch your mouth.

544
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,780
Let's break the code first.

545
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,310
Hold on.

546
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,070
No, it's a trap. Run!

547
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,480
If the passage collapses,
we won't be able to get the password.

548
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,720
I need to go back there.

549
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,670
-Wu Xie! Come back!
-Xiao Hua.

550
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:01,650
Just go first.

551
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,960
I need to get the third password.

552
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,100
Zhang is still waiting for me.

553
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,370
It's King Shibie. Come with me!

554
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,200
Xiao Hua.

555
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,740
We must get the password.

556
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,180
King Shibie has just been released.

557
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
It doesn't react as quickly.

558
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,400
Seize the chance.

559
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,390
Let's go.

560
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,690
Let's go.

561
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,240
Wu Xie.

562
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,510
It is quite creepy.

563
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,540
Yes.

564
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
Something is not quite right.

565
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,960
The clay pots are fine.

566
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,600
The stripped stones are still hanging.

567
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,880
The rope is gone.

568
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,240
Have we gone into the wrong passage?

569
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,710
No, that is impossible.

570
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,220
There are only three passages in total.

571
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,130
We left this passage not long ago.

572
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,350
We should make haste.

573
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,310
Be careful.

574
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,440
That is not right.

575
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,680
We have never been here before.

576
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,970
The chains have gone back
to their original position.

577
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,360
However, we didn't put them
back to the original position.

578
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,680
Yes.

579
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,780
We don't have the capability.

580
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,700
We were only able to connect them
with carabiner.

581
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,170
How did the chains go back
to their original position?

582
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,970
It could be another trap.

583
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Let's go down.

584
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,250
Chances are

585
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,440
this is a brand new passage.

586
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,740
There is something.

587
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,590
I am such a kind person.

588
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,110
How could you call me a thing?

589
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,930
Mr Black?

590
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,250
Are you okay? Where did you go?

591
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,520
Don't mention it.

592
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,310
I almost lost my way.

593
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,840
There are more than three passages here

594
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,260
Of course.

595
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,750
There are three entrances.

596
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,960
Each entrance has three passages.

597
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,730
Only one of the passages is the right one.

598
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,040
The rest are fake.

599
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,600
The passage and the connection point
of the entrance are separated?

600
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,650
Yes.

601
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,310
It is just like

602
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,840
a revolver.

603
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,150
How did we get into the wrong passage?

604
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,710
It has something to do with time.

605
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,370
Under normal circumstances,

606
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,580
by turning the metal plate thrice,

607
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:26,810
and breaking the code thrice,

608
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,430
it won't take up so much of time.

609
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:29,770
We have exceeded the time limit.

610
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,140
What should we do now?

611
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,730
God knows if the chamber of stone is real?

612
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,460
We still have half the chance if we try.

613
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,680
Should we take the risk?

614
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
Of course.

615
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,650
If worse come to worst, we will
have to fight a few more King Shibie.

616
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,370
It seems that you had experienced
an awful battle.

617
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,010
It's not a big deal.

618
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,160
I was really gentle

619
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,000
when I came across those animals.

620
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,630
Stop talking rubbish.

621
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,860
Let's start.

622
00:40:58,864 --> 00:41:08,864
