1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

<i>Ultimate Note</i>

00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,750
<i>Episode 12</i>

4
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,750
Relief sculpture?

5
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,350
We will go and take a look.

6
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,480
Stay here and help guard our equipment.

7
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,980
Wu Xie,

8
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,630
these are your speciality.

9
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,050
Look over here.

10
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,070
The ancient civilisation here

11
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,710
used to worship snakes
with rooster crowns.

12
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,670
Those should be tiger keelbacks.

13
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,720
This picture is about pouring
the creatures into a pagoda

14
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,650
and people are kneeling all around it.

15
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,829
A priest is even hosting the ceremony.

16
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,170
What is there to worship

17
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,700
in this forsaken place?

18
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,370
Making snakes into totem isn't rare.

19
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,120
Many people also worshipped snakes.

20
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,080
Look at this.

21
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,660
This picture is much clearer.

22
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,420
It should be a depiction of war.

23
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,990
Judging by how these
ancient humans dressed,

24
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,500
they should be citizens from Land
of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

25
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,990
However, judging by the battle situation,

26
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,300
Heavenly Queen Mother was losing.

27
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,260
Can you tell who was Heavenly
Queen Mother fighting against?

28
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,590
No,

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,440
but they should be a
powerful civilization.

30
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,720
Look at this picture.

31
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,030
Heavenly Queen Mother
was pouring something

32
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,150
into the pagoda earlier

33
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,030
and those snakes climbed out

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,690
to fight the enemies.

35
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,630
So, these tiger keelbacks were warriors.

36
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,030
Not only that,

37
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,760
look at the structure of
the city in this relief.

38
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,930
The entire city is connected underground.

39
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,960
And these snakes can move
about in the tunnels.

40
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,220
They were reared by humans.

41
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,930
In times of danger,

42
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,200
they would be lured out with a
sort of bait to fight the enemies.

43
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,200
That was their defence method.

44
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,850
These snakes are poisonous and fast.

45
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,130
They are unstoppable.

46
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,620
Let's go take a look at Zhang's side.

47
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,560
What about this?

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,480
This picture seems more peaceful.

49
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,800
This person should be
someone of superior position,

50
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,180
sitting on a carriage
pulled by eight horses

51
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,880
arriving at Land of the
Heavenly Queen Mother.

52
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,510
I know.

53
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,270
This chariot is a classical
system of Western Zhou.

54
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,470
Certain legends mentioned

55
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,710
King Mu of Zhou came to Land of Heavenly
Queen Mother with his imperial army

56
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,659
for a banquet with her

57
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,230
to seek the Law of Longevity.

58
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,190
Not bad, Wu Xie.

59
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,670
You know what you are doing.

60
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,330
Since I'm in the stone rubbing business,

61
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,230
I know quite a lot of these history.

62
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,770
The way I see it, there were more snakes

63
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,730
than the human population.

64
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,620
The creature carved on here

65
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,640
should be those Great Pythons.

66
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,050
It was fighting with the
tiger keelbacks here.

67
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,590
So, during Heavenly Queen Mother's time,

68
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,080
these two types of snakes
already existed here.

69
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,370
So, these Great Pythons

70
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,610
should be the tiger keelbacks' predator.

71
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,270
They were mating.

72
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,950
Mating?

73
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,690
How exciting.

74
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,650
Cross-breed mating?

75
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,670
These two are completely
different types of snakes.

76
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,200
Besides, their difference in size is huge.

77
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:40,990
I know.

78
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,390
Fatty,

79
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,800
do you know what Procuress is?

80
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,900
I know.

81
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,310
The procuress you are talking about,

82
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,230
-is that thing in olden times...
-They are a type of bird.

83
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,659
In ancient times,

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,920
people assumed this type of bird

85
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,830
only had females and no males.

86
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,640
But in fact, that was not the case.

87
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,670
It is because the males were several
times bigger than the females

88
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,730
so they were mistaken for
a different type of bird.

89
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,040
Spring is here.

90
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,140
Everything comes to life again.

91
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,860
It is again the breeding
season for animals.

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,200
No.

93
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,100
Wait.

94
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,970
This creature is not a snake.

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,320
What is this?

96
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,970
Is it a dragon?

97
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,650
It grew into such a huge size.

98
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,170
Could it still be a snake?

99
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,790
Look.

100
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,100
These little snakes

101
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,450
did not wrap their bodies around
the Great Python.

102
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,130
Instead, they were helping it.

103
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,110
Therefore, the ones which were mating

104
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,750
were this Great Python and this

105
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,750
huge snake the size of a tree trunk.

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,860
These snakes are social animals indeed.

107
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,370
This creature should be,
as I guessed before,

108
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,580
the Snake Mother.

109
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,350
This relief has to be more
than 3000 years old.

110
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,230
If what you said is true,
this Snake Mother

111
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,100
should have fossilized a long time ago.

112
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,940
Someone help!

113
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,990
Aunt Wen Jin!

114
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,430
Is that you?

115
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,950
Wu Xie, don't mind me.

116
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,670
Chase after the mud man, quick!

117
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,890
Let's go!

118
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,310
Ma'am!

119
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,950
Stop running, we are honest people.

120
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,430
We are not bad guys!

121
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,590
Wu Xie, don't come over!

122
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,740
Wu Xie.

123
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,150
Wu Xie,

124
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,260
are you all right?

125
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,710
What do you think?

126
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,789
You can't blame me.

127
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,470
If I caught you just now,

128
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,370
the two of us will be lying here.

129
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,049
Where is the mud man?

130
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,870
She disappeared when I fell down here.

131
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,900
Let's look for her in
the surrounding area.

132
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,720
Fatty.

133
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,700
Look, is someone there?

134
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,830
Yes.

135
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,670
Let's go and have a look.

136
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,040
Him?

137
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:20,970
Do you know him?

138
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,620
He works for your uncle.

139
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,260
It looks like

140
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,730
something did happen to them.

141
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,110
See if we can find any clue on him.

142
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,870
It is broken.

143
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Don't throw it away.

144
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,440
Let's bring it back to the
camp and try repairing later.

145
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,480
Wu Xie, look.

146
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,490
There is someone over there too.

147
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,080
Zhang,

148
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,040
Master Xiao San went to
chase after the mud person.

149
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,870
Will they be alright?

150
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,590
They will be fine.

151
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Wu Xie,

152
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,100
that man is dressed just liked Master San.

153
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,950
You have to flip the body
over sooner or later.

154
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,660
Now, I can understand your feeling

155
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,520
whereby you wish to see but don't dare to.

156
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,690
What about this? Come on,

157
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,550
I'll help you.

158
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,430
I'll do it.

159
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,710
Thank goodness.

160
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,190
Look what I told you.

161
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,670
Master San is a fortunate person.

162
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,430
He won't die so easily.

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,160
Hold on to it.

164
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,590
It might be useful at some point.

165
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
It is better than nothing.

166
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,990
Let me tell you,

167
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,550
last time, when Zhang
and I flipped you over,

168
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,530
good grief,

169
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,250
a King Shibie flew out at us.

170
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,660
This time, we are really lucky.

171
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,730
You can't be serious.

172
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,750
-When have I...
-Stop talking!

173
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,950
Keep your mouth shut!

174
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,150
Take the knife, quick!

175
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,260
Careful not to cut me.

176
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,990
Screw you!

177
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,720
Screw you!

178
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,320
That almost scared me to death.

179
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,490
I told you,

180
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,830
we can't flip dead bodies anyhow.

181
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,470
Nothing good comes from it.

182
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,030
Let's leave this place quickly.

183
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,600
Something doesn't feel right.

184
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,260
Of course not.

185
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,000
A tiger keelback flung itself right at me.

186
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,250
How can that be right?

187
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,730
This person's carotid artery was bitten.

188
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,590
That's the only wound on his entire body.

189
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,340
With no sign of being involved in a fight

190
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,970
and his clothes are intact.

191
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,270
I think he was bitten when
he had his guards down.

192
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,380
You mean when he was asleep?

193
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,670
But this place is some distance away

194
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,830
from your uncle's campsite.

195
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,220
The body was brought here
instead of buried on the spot.

196
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,150
Why?

197
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,580
Does this place have better feng shui?

198
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,830
Ah Ning.

199
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,120
Ah Ning is in the same situation as them.

200
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,490
Nut why were they brought to this place?

201
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,050
This place is dark and cold.

202
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,330
I know.

203
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,050
This is the perfect
place for food storage.

204
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,400
Perhaps this is a huge storage for food.

205
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,240
Wu Xie!

206
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,010
Wu Xie, I'm talking
to you, you hear me?

207
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,860
Ah Ning.

208
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,200
It really is her.

209
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,960
She should not have died here.

210
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,070
It seems the silhouette we saw on the tree

211
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,570
was indeed Ah Ning.

212
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
I always thought

213
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,650
people like Ah Ning wouldn't die.

214
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,910
At least not by a snakebite.

215
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,590
These snakes transported her body

216
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,070
all the way here from so far away.

217
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,120
It seems this is really a
storage for food.

218
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,300
So, when it is their meal time,

219
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,640
we will be their food.

220
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,050
You can't be serious.

221
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,590
It is still moving after
being chopped in half

222
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,980
and even followed us here.

223
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,180
This is bad. It is calling its companions.

224
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,270
You are half dead,
yet you are still calling?

225
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,870
Who told you to call your companions?

226
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,010
-Who told you to?
-Fatty!

227
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,170
Can you stop talking?

228
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,510
I'm almost as unlucky

229
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,750
as you today.

230
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,000
Wu Xie, run quickly!

231
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,880
What about Ah Ning?

232
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,510
If you carry her with you,

233
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,790
none of us will be able to escape!

234
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,470
What about this? I'll distract the snakes.

235
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,110
-I'll see you later.
-Fatty!

236
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,450
Hurry up.

237
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,890
Come and chase after me!

238
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,770
Come on.

239
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,770
Come on.

240
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,310
Come on!

241
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,590
Fatty!

242
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:45,970
Let's go.

243
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,190
I'll lure the snakes away first

244
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,430
and come back for you later.

245
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,310
These wretched creatures!

246
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,750
Come over here. Come on.

247
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,730
Why isn't there any sound?

248
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,250
They aren't surrounding me, right?

249
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,770
Seriously, all the bad things that I said

250
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,890
became reality today.

251
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,010
This ruthless creature.

252
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,290
Where were you biting?

253
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,829
How dare you come after my groin?

254
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,790
I'll teach you all a lesson!

255
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,000
I did a somersault. I did it.

256
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,780
Fatty!

257
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,210
Fatty!

258
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,990
Fatty!

259
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,170
Fatty, are you all right?

260
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,740
Ah Ning, I'm sorry.

261
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,850
I'm going to save my brother.

262
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,830
Fatty!

263
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,390
Fatty!

264
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Fatty!

265
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,800
Fatty, wake up!

266
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,680
Fatty!

267
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,530
Thank goodness,

268
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,920
he is still alive.

269
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,150
Hang in there.

270
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,640
We have antidote back at the camp.

271
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,910
I'll carry you back.

272
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,880
Fatty!

273
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,470
Fatty.

274
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,520
You have to hang in there.

275
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,550
I said I'll bring you home.

276
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,560
Fatty,

277
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,230
you have to go on diet after
we get back this time.

278
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,520
Fatty,

279
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,220
it is impossible to go back
by the original route.

280
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,140
I'm going to look for a way to
bring you back to the camp.

281
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,670
Fatty!

282
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,910
Fatty, are you okay?

283
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,450
What is that in your stomach?

284
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,060
Did the poisoning worsen?

285
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,010
Snake eggs?

286
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,680
I know.

287
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,880
Those darn creatures laid
eggs in your stomach

288
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,350
to use human bodies as hatching ground.

289
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,730
Therefore, that place just now

290
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,830
was not a storage place for food.

291
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,220
Instead, it was a nursery room tiger
keelbacks built for themselves!

292
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,210
Let's go, I'm bringing
you back to our camp.

293
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,590
Back to Zhang

294
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,840
and Pan Zi.

295
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,930
Let's go.

296
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,310
Zhang,

297
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,930
you are leaving?

298
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,260
In less than three days' time,

299
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,050
someone will be here to fetch you.

300
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,830
Look after Wu Xie for me.

301
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,630
Zhang.

302
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,670
You are not going to
look for Wu Xie,

303
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,660
right?

304
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,540
Take care, Zhang.

305
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
Take care, Zhang.

306
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,800
Fatty,

307
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,430
although this doesn't seem very high

308
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,950
with only three or four meters to go,

309
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,980
we will make it to the other side
if we hang on for awhile more.

310
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,440
Fatty,

311
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,740
I promise,

312
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,980
after we go back this time,

313
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,630
I'll definitely keep fit.

314
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,270
My aim is to lift 100kg of weight.

315
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,230
What is going on?

316
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,380
Fatty!

317
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,270
Fatty!

318
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,780
Fatty!

319
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,150
Fatty!

320
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,500
Fatty!

321
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,470
You are here.

322
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:06,690
Let's go inside.

323
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,950
We are running out of time.

324
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,340
Wu Xie is not here yet.

325
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,280
I already lured him to this place.

326
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,720
If he can't find his way in,

327
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,930
it means we were wrong about him.

328
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,880
Fatty!

329
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:29,830
Fatty!

330
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,350
Fatty, don't scare me.

331
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,250
This current is too strong.

332
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,410
It will be difficult to go
back via the original route.

333
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,040
What happened?

334
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,850
The water stopped.

335
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,900
It seems there is a gate
above this tunnel.

336
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,230
When the gate opens,

337
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,950
a whirlpool will appear
on the river surface

338
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,430
and channel the water here.

339
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,830
Therefore,

340
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,640
this place is a reservoir.

341
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,620
When the water level is up,

342
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,340
the gate will automatically shut.

343
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,920
Safety first, sirs.

344
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,550
After you go down, if something happens,

345
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,710
just tug at the rope.

346
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,910
I'll pull you up.

347
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,360
You are quite considerate.

348
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,200
Why don't

349
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,830
you join us on our way down?

350
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,920
-That way, you will be able to help.
-No, Mr Black. It is all right.

351
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,560
You two inspected the
situation down there.

352
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,590
It is bottomless with strong current.

353
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,650
Normal people won't be
able to go down there.

354
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,350
The fact is, we don't
have the equipment.

355
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,840
Even if we did,

356
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,540
I am not skilled enough.

357
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,190
Besides,

358
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,860
this medicine I'm using

359
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,270
must avoid water.

360
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,230
Medicine?

361
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:02,670
What medicine?

362
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,740
I almost went blind.

363
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,090
Luckily, Mr Black gave me
some medicine for my eyes.

364
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,480
The thing is, I can't go
into water for six months.

365
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,220
It is better to go blind.

366
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,650
It is dirty.

367
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,880
Are you ready?

368
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,600
Let's dive.

369
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,450
This is what you meant by "strong current"

370
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,650
and "bottomless"?

371
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,400
We need to take precautionary measures.

372
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,680
It is necessary.

373
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,670
Master San, it is safe.

374
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,080
All of you get ready to go into the water!

375
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,900
What is the meaning of this?

376
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,760
"Bottomless with strong current"?

377
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,270
Master San,

378
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,550
precautionary measures

379
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,070
are still necessary.

380
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,320
However,

381
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,380
I'm not the only person

382
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,500
with bad eyesight in this team.

383
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,390
Shut up.

384
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,220
All right, listen to me.

385
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,730
Although the water isn't deep,

386
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,470
these are the debris flushed
from the ground surface.

387
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,790
There might be snakes in here.

388
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,710
Be careful.

389
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,080
Spread out to inspect the way ahead.

390
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,280
I'll go take a look over there.

391
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,430
I'm going this way.

392
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,640
Master San, where are we going?

393
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,960
Judge for yourself.

394
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,180
Let's go.

395
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,000
Judging by the direction
the water is flowing,

396
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,370
we should be able to go out through here.

397
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,310
This is great, Fatty!

398
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,510
We found the direction!

399
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,630
I told you

400
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,630
we will definitely get out.

401
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,640
Master Xiao San.

402
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,970
Who called me?

403
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,830
Master Xiao San.

404
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,270
Who is there?

405
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,150
Master Xiao San.

406
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,700
You called me Master Xiao San.

407
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,330
Do you work for Uncle San?

408
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,450
I knew it.

409
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,880
Buddy!

410
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,460
Buddy!

411
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,370
This isn't right.

412
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,090
This person has been dead for awhile.

413
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,090
It must be those snakes' doing.

414
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,270
Darn it.

415
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,300
Even if I lost my blade,

416
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,710
I'll still mash you up.

417
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,190
Master Xiao San.

418
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,600
Master Xiao San.

419
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,880
Why is it speaking with human voice?

420
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,180
The snake learned to speak human language?

421
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,310
Who are you?

422
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,240
Are you Zhang?

423
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,040
Since when do I look like that mute?

424
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,200
Xiao Hua?

425
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,510
Why are you here?

426
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,780
Let's go.

427
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,350
This is bad. It is calling for help.

428
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,800
There are a group of snakes!

429
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,010
Fatty!

430
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,320
Fatty!

431
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:44,949
Fatty disappeared.

432
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,960
Don't worry.

433
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,130
Someone is doing their job.

434
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,170
He is safe.

435
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,170
Let's go.

436
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,240
Uncle San.

437
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,510
This rascal.

438
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,460
Why are you so disobedient?

439
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,710
I have not kicked him yet.

440
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,080
Wu Xie!

441
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,120
Still pretending, are you?

442
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,840
What are you doing?

443
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,250
Saving your life.

444
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,370
Lie still.

445
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,580
Your back

446
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,340
is full of tiger keelbacks' hatchlings.

447
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,130
Don't move.

448
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,610
Hold him in place.

449
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,340
Here, bite this.

450
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,230
Wear your shirt.

451
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,440
From now on, don't go
into the wilderness alone.

452
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
Thank you.

453
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,510
How did these tiger keelbacks

454
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,020
climb onto my body?

455
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,720
These tiger keelbacks' hatchlings

456
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,960
survive on human blood.

457
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,450
You must have gotten it in the water.

458
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,340
Many others were bitten.

459
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,670
You are aware of that as well?

460
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,200
I told you to go back
but you wouldn't listen.

461
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,060
Didn't I tell you?

462
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,260
"This place is dangerous. Leave quickly"

463
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,540
Are you illiterate, or did
you not understand me?

464
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,440
I would have hit you if
you weren't my nephew.

465
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,440
If you weren't my Uncle San,

466
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,560
I wouldn't have come after you.

467
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,490
Do you know how many people I saw

468
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,270
died from snake bites
on my way here?

469
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,950
Each time I flipped a corpse over,

470
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,870
I was afraid it might be you.

471
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,810
We came across snake tide too.

472
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,790
What about you?

473
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,290
Why isn't Pan Zi with you?

474
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,230
Back in the rainforest,

475
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,800
we also came across giant python.

476
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,240
Pan Zi was also severely
injured in order to save us.

477
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,270
Later, we went to your campsite

478
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,480
but we came across snake tide again.

479
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,690
So, we decided to let Pan Zi
stay behind at the temple.

480
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,680
Don't worry,

481
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,930
Zhang is with him.

482
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,740
How did you and Fatty get here?

483
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,680
We met a mud man

484
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,430
who was following us secretly.

485
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,110
After that, Fatty and I
saw her at our campsite

486
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,650
so we chased after her to no avail

487
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,870
but we ourselves ended up here.

488
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,430
Mud man?

489
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:11,930
That said,

490
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,580
she did not intend to harm us.

491
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,050
Therefore, Fatty and I guessed
this person should be...

492
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,610
We were only guessing.

493
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,220
Child, what was your guess about? Tell me.

494
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:35,530
I did all the talking up until now.

495
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,000
It is time for you to tell
me what happened.

496
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,560
Listen.

497
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,890
I think I heard some noise.

498
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,590
What are you talking about?

499
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,160
You are changing the topic again!

500
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,520
Listen up, everyone!
This place isn't safe.

501
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,440
Pack up and we'll set out in a minute.

502
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,500
Do you think he did that intentionally,

503
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,030
on purpose,

504
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,720
or that's exactly what he meant?

505
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,570
Of course he is.

506
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,190
Mop.

507
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,040
Master Hua'er,

508
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,320
how can I help you?

509
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
Nothing.

510
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,160
Master Hua'er,

511
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,000
didn't you call me just now?

512
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,680
Let me know if you need anything.

513
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,920
No need to be shy.

514
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,910
I didn't call you.

515
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,550
Keep your hands off my belongings.

516
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,390
Master Hua'er,

517
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,740
in that case,

518
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,570
I won't bother you.

519
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:51,250
Mop.

520
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,550
Master Hua'er.

521
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:58,940
Mop.

522
00:41:01,924 --> 00:41:11,924
