00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,670
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>Episode 16</i>

4
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Water.

5
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
Water.

6
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,220
Water.

7
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,520
Water.

8
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,270
How long have we been waiting?

9
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,100
I have no idea.

10
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,690
It's been a few days, I guess.

11
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,050
Time flies when we're having fun.

12
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,250
How much food do we have left?

13
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,620
I have a good news

14
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,040
and a bad news.

15
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,930
Which one do you want to hear first?

16
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,300
The bad news.

17
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,520
We have one pack of hard tack left.

18
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,450
The good one.

19
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,410
There are a lot of
tiger keelbacks though.

20
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,390
After we finish the last hard tack,

21
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,510
we'll get out of here.

22
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,290
Eat it when we're hungry.

23
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,590
Sleep for a while.

24
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,380
We won't feel hungry if we're asleep.

25
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,920
Do you think we're getting closer?

26
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,620
If we can't get out of here
before it gets dark...

27
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,510
Let's eat this food supply.

28
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,030
Okay.

29
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,330
Good sirs, please be kind.

30
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,470
I am as thin as a horse pole.

31
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,790
I'd taste awful.

32
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,830
Let me tell you.

33
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,430
There are many ways

34
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,290
to eat this kind of food supply.

35
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,540
You're right.

36
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,320
The backbone can be made into soup.

37
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,470
As for the meat on the spine,

38
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,330
we can slice them

39
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,420
and pan fry them.

40
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,520
I'm short and have a short spine.

41
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,520
There's nothing much to eat.

42
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,950
The belly can be fried with tomatoes.

43
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,270
And the shank,

44
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,990
it can be grilled with the skin.

45
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,510
Put some onions on the bottom.

46
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
When the onions completely

47
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,240
pick up the flavour,

48
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,670
oh, God.

49
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,900
Mr Black,

50
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,880
onions seem to be bad for the kidneys.

51
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,350
Finally,

52
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,090
I suggest that we grill two ribs.

53
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,030
When they turn crispy,

54
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,530
sprinkle some cumin,

55
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,590
chilli powder,

56
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,350
they will be amazing.

57
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,440
And when the fat bubbles,

58
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,400
top it off
by sprinkling some spring onions.

59
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
It's so good.

60
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,670
Master Hua'er,

61
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,150
I'm allergic to spring onions.

62
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,210
Daytime thoughts

63
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,170
are reflected in the dreams at night.

64
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,650
Zhang,

65
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,790
if you still refuse to come out,

66
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,650
you'll owe Fatty
for dying from starvation.

67
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,290
You'll owe me.

68
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,590
You finally got out!

69
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,390
Zhang Qi Ling!

70
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,270
Zhang,

71
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,760
when did you get out?

72
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
Drop the act.

73
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,480
I know you're trying to fool me.

74
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,030
I won't fall for it!

75
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,510
Has he lost his memory again?

76
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,630
Nonsense.

77
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
He won't lose his memory.

78
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,300
Zhang Qi Ling.

79
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,070
-Zhang Qi Ling!
-Zhang.

80
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,140
Zhang Qi Ling!

81
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,750
We're running out of time.

82
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,870
We're running out of time.

83
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,210
Did Zhang

84
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,590
see something scary in there

85
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,630
and get traumatised?

86
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,510
Impossible.

87
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,880
Zhang has seen everything.

88
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,430
Why would he be traumatised?

89
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,140
What on earth is in there?

90
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,350
Zhang, look at me.

91
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,770
I'm Fatty.

92
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,570
Do you remember me now?

93
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,850
Zhang.

94
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
What's the matter?

95
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,630
There's a woman in there.

96
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,070
There's nothing inside.

97
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,750
You saw it wrong.

98
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,710
No way.

99
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,990
Xiao Hua said,

100
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:40,090
Heavenly Queen Mother
had also gone in there.

101
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,059
Did you

102
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,160
actually...

103
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,830
Run.

104
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,040
Hurry, hurry. Run.

105
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,750
Wu Xie,

106
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,380
are you sure

107
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,410
you saw Heavenly Queen Mother?

108
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,340
It's her.

109
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,840
They look exactly the same.

110
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,400
How is that possible?

111
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,880
The real Heavenly Queen Mother
is still inside the jade meteorite?

112
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,340
Could she really

113
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,230
have gained longevity?

114
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,110
I find it unbelievable as well.

115
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,270
I do hope

116
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,830
that it was just my illusion
due to starvation.

117
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,270
Forget about these.

118
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,400
Zhang is out now.

119
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
Let's just go.

120
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,430
Hurry, hurry.

121
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,970
An earthquake again.

122
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,240
Snake Mother.

123
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,440
It's the Snake Mother on the relief!

124
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,470
Run!

125
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,360
Zhang.

126
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,350
<i>This is like
throwing straws against the wind.</i>

127
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,430
Wu Xie,

128
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,920
you're out of your mind.

129
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,930
That was horrible.

130
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,030
That was horrible.

131
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,990
Weren't you quite brave just now?

132
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,530
Don't mention it.

133
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,980
I almost wet my pants.

134
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,880
Although Zhang lost his memory,

135
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,260
he didn't forget about

136
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,190
this life-saving thing.

137
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,750
Cut the nonsense.

138
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,070
Let's get out of here.

139
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,030
Hold on.

140
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,550
It's a mark left by Master Hua.

141
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,920
I think so.

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,800
Let's go.

143
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,700
Here. This is not spicy.

144
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,330
Give me the bone soup.

145
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,080
Not bad.

146
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,840
All we need is wine.

147
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,230
We have wine!

148
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,960
Wine's coming.

149
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,200
Good food and good wine,

150
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,250
good wine and good food.

151
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
Thank you for not leaving me
in the desert.

152
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,950
I, Mop,

153
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,910
will never forget both of your kindness.

154
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,470
Here. This is where we parted ways
with Master San.

155
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,230
Hold him.

156
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,020
There are traces of snake movement.

157
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,180
Fatty.

158
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,860
Uncle San is dead.

159
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,670
Nonsense.

160
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:56,910
Look.

161
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,370
Master Hua'er is showing us the way out.

162
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,980
Besides,

163
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,940
Master Hua'er and your Uncle San
are relatives.

164
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,640
He wouldn't have abandoned him.

165
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,770
Let's get out of here first.

166
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,700
You're right.

167
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,450
Xiao Hua must've taken him away.

168
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,990
Let's go.

169
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,900
Why don't you let me do it?

170
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,600
I'm fine.

171
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,950
Careful.

172
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,820
It will cool down after blowing on it.

173
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,670
This is for you.

174
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,670
This...

175
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,110
Both of you are so kind to me.

176
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,280
We have to be kind.

177
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,430
No, no.

178
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:33,390
Where has Master Hua'er taken us?

179
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,460
We didn't come in through this way.

180
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,330
Are we going to starve to death here?

181
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,750
Who told you to overeat

182
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,540
when we were waiting for Zhang?

183
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,630
You should've kept it for now.

184
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,910
There is always a way out.

185
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,470
Try it.

186
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,170
Eat it.

187
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,310
I'm not hungry.

188
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,829
Watch me.

189
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,630
How is it?

190
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,900
It tastes like chicken, huh?

191
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:23,800
Tastes like lobster.

192
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,119
Australian lobster.

193
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,030
By the way,

194
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,980
after this, I'll investigate Yellow Silk.

195
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:34,990
Will you join me?

196
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,150
I...

197
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,370
I have taken another job.

198
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,210
What job?

199
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,390
Forget it.

200
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,470
I shouldn't ask.

201
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,520
How about you?
Are you going back to Beijing?

202
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,150
You?

203
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,130
I'll go back to Hangzhou first,

204
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,920
then I'll start working.

205
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,470
It's me.

206
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,420
Book two flight tickets for me right now.

207
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,390
One ticket to Hangzhou
and another one to Beijing.

208
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,470
Don't ask so many questions,

209
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,350
just do it.

210
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,690
Business class, definitely business class.

211
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,270
Take it as a keepsake.

212
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,380
Mr Black, I actually...

213
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,930
It's all in the wine.

214
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,710
It's all in the wine.

215
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,340
It's all in the wine.

216
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,600
Have a taste. High protein.

217
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:37,590
Tiger keelback!

218
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,940
Wu Xie, it's much more joyful
to share the joy than enjoying it alone.

219
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,980
I have to find one for Zhang.

220
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,630
Zhang, here.

221
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,830
Eat it.

222
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:03,670
Let's go.

223
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,790
Go up and check it out.

224
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,070
Let's go.

225
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,750
There's a mark here.

226
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,390
Zhang.

227
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,600
Put him down.

228
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,390
Zhang.

229
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,390
Are you feeling better?

230
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,510
Wu Xie,

231
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,510
you've been carrying him.

232
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,510
Let me do it.

233
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,910
Be gentle.

234
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,850
Finally we got out.

235
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,640
It's not safe here either.

236
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
Snakes are everywhere.

237
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,270
You're right.

238
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,450
We can't dally here.

239
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,830
Hurry, let's get the hell out of here.

240
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,310
-Let's go.
-Watch out.

241
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,670
Zhang,

242
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,750
hang in there.

243
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,030
We'll get out of here soon.

244
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,330
Pan Zi.

245
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,860
Master Xiao San,

246
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,990
you finally came round.

247
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,710
Where's Zhang?

248
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,100
He is exhausted

249
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,200
and has a fever.

250
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,870
Wu Xie, you've come to.

251
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,530
Let Zhang sleep for a while,

252
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,580
I will show you our hero.

253
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,350
Thank you.

254
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,740
Replenish some water and salt.

255
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,090
You're dehydrated.

256
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,000
But don't finish it in one shot.

257
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Thank you for saving me.

258
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,790
Don't worry about it.

259
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,810
Sit, sit.

260
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,080
Sit down.

261
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,040
Madam Dolma and the others

262
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,370
saved Pan Zi in the rainforest first.

263
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,420
Then they waited for us here.

264
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,290
How about Xiao Hua and Shades?

265
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,650
And my Uncle...

266
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,840
We didn't see them.

267
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,080
We haven't been here for long.

268
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,440
We haven't seen anyone come out.

269
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:56,060
He was ahead of us

270
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,650
and left marks along the way.

271
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
Don't worry. He'll definitely be okay.

272
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,280
Grandma Dolma,

273
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,000
Zhang seems have lost his soul

274
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,550
in Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother.

275
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,870
Is there any way to retrieve his soul?

276
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,350
A young man lost his soul.

277
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,750
Is there any way to get it back?

278
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,340
He didn't lose his soul,

279
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:30,360
but he's hiding his own soul.

280
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,450
My grandma said

281
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,630
that Zhang didn't lose his soul.

282
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,300
He's hiding his own soul.

283
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,990
Only he can find it.

284
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,650
If he fails to do so...

285
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,540
He will definitely find it.

286
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,230
Even if he can't,

287
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,880
I'll help him out.

288
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,950
Then, are there any traditional remedies?

289
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,360
For example, putting a patch
on his belly button,

290
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,830
sticking some grass in his ears

291
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,200
or doing that dance.

292
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,270
Tashi.

293
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,950
Where should we go after this?

294
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,390
I will send you to the highway,

295
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,780
but the rest will be up to you.

296
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,300
Thank you.

297
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,990
-It's nothing.
-Thank you.

298
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,180
By the way,

299
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,750
what is this water?

300
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,230
It has a funny taste.

301
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,580
It's something that you'll remember
for the rest of your life.

302
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,800
Goat dung ball.

303
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,670
It's unique indeed.

304
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,830
I'll remember this taste my whole life.

305
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,580
Good luck.

306
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,220
It's such a nice highway,

307
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,480
but why aren't any travellers

308
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,470
coming this way?

309
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:14,890
Cars!

310
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,320
Fellas!

311
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,590
You guys are amazing.

312
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,470
You dare walk here?

313
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,350
Brother, are you from Northeast?

314
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,020
I am. Which part of Northeast
are you from?

315
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,460
-Changchun.
-Changchun.

316
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,760
That young man over there

317
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,090
is from Paektu Mountain.

318
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,190
Paektu Mountain?

319
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,340
Do you need a ride?

320
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:37,750
Nice!

321
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,990
Hurry up!

322
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,870
Thanks, brother.

323
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,390
I'll buy you tofu with egg
when we get to Changchun.

324
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,390
It's nothing.

325
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,470
Don't worry about it.

326
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,180
<i>Wu San Xing, you old fox.</i>

327
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,560
<i>Don't run!</i>

328
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,500
<i>I'm keeping it from you</i>

329
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,670
-<i>for your own good!</i>
-<i>For my own good!</i>

330
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,690
<i>I'm your uncle.</i>

331
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,990
<i>Who else should I be nice to</i>

332
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,360
<i>if not you?</i>

333
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,910
<i>People said,</i>

334
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,480
<i>in free solo climbing,</i>

335
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,480
<i>there are more dead legends
compared to the living ones.</i>

336
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,520
<i>What we're doing
is very much like theirs.</i>

337
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,520
<i>We might encounter death,</i>

338
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,660
<i>it's just that we don't know
if it's today or tomorrow.</i>

339
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,150
<i>Don't worry.</i>

340
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,150
<i>I'm the third master of Wu Family.</i>

341
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,320
<i>I won't die yet.</i>

342
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,430
It's good that he forgot everything.

343
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,850
This trip is a loss.

344
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,570
Three of us

345
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,390
are going to stay in the hospital

Enough.

You should thank my brother

353
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,830
-Heart rate.

359
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,760
Just a fever. Nothing serious.

360
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,670
He needs drips to reduce inflammation

Dr Liang.

362

Besides a fever,

363
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,460
he has a little...

364

Here,

365
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,530
he's a little confused.

366
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,220
He can't remember a lot of things.

367
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,890
So, when he comes around,

368
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,480
he might not even know who we are.

369
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,080
This is quite devastating for the family.

But I won't be able
to draw conclusions now.

371
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,550
It may be trauma,

372
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,070
it may also be caused by drugs.

373
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,260
We need further check-ups.

374
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,270
Thank you, doctor.

375
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,530
His temperature has been so high

376
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,920
and he still has fever.

377
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,640
Now his body is so hot
that even his tattoo appears.

378
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,830
After he got down from there,

379
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,960
he only said this.

380
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,030
He said,

381
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,100
we're running out of time.

382
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,990
God knows what that means.

383

Since Zhang lost his memory,

384

no one else knows

388
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,900
He can forget everything else,

-as long as he doesn't...
-Family shouldn't make noise in the room.

How could he leave with such injury?

There are only two possibilities now.

First, he's already dead.

426
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,230
It's pointless even if we found him.

427
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Second, he's still alive,

428
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,370
he got himself out of there.

Nineteen years ago,

432
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,740
I didn't believe
that Xie Lian Huan had died.

433

It's the same now.

I believe that Wu San Xing is still alive.

435
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,840
He always said,

436
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,390
I shouldn't investigate this,

437
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,720
I shouldn't care about that.

438
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,270
He wanted me to stay put in Hangzhou.

The Mystic Nine

453
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,630
had never done anything else after that.

to be their new plan after the excavation
on the Paracel Islands.

are a part of the plan.

No.

465

The Mystic Nine chose you.

466
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,020
Chose me?

467
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,950

00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,370
Pan Zi, has the injury on your back
gotten better?

512
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:31,030
How is Master San doing?

513
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,550
Did Master Hua'er take Master San out?

514
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,780
Xiao Hua couldn't find them.

515
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,950
Couldn't find them?

516
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,370
He couldn't find them

517
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,820
or their bodies?

518
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,670
Neither.

519
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,030
Pan Zi.

520
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,630
Everything will be fine.

521
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,990
Master San will not die.

522
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,110
I'll go back to Changsha
and watch the stock market for him.

523
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,270
Master San will return for sure.

524
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,510
Okay.

525
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,470
I'll book you a flight ticket to Changsha.

526
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,410
We'll leave Uncle San's business to you.

Master Xiao San,
you have to take care of yourself.

529
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,990
Remember to tell me
if there's any news about Master San.

530
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,030
Just like the evergreen mountain
and ever flowing water.

531
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,230
Brother, we'll meet again someday.

532
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,180
See you again.

533
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,910
I'm off.

534
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,060
Go ahead.

535
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,710
Zhang has been transferred
to the psychiatric department.

536
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,630
But he's not doing any better.

537
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,700
Why don't you stay here?

538
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,170
I will.

<i>After I sent you an email,</i>

542
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,060
you finally returned my call,

00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,070
Uncle Er.

You don't have to worry about the rest.

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,810
I'll take care of them.

I'll take care of them.

<i>What are you going to do?</i>

550
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,550
You say that all the time,

551
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,260
<i>but you never tell me anything.</i>

552

You always set me up for this and that.

553
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,710
I ended up being involved in everything.

554
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,520
<i>Listen, Uncle Er,</i>

555
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,800
<i>regarding this matter,</i>

or tell me what exactly is going on.

I'm keeping it from you for your own good.

Wu Family

or actually the Mystic Nine?

562
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,550
Come back to Hangzhou.
