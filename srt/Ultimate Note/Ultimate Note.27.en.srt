1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,840
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 27</i>

4
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,520
Fine clouds float easy and free,
shooting stars shine with sorrow.

5
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,000
I've spent three years with
Fairy Huo just like that.

6
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,960
The recovery and identification of the
ancient books are boring.

7
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,120
It's time consuming.

8
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,960
Besides, everyone was under

9
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,079
tremendous pressure.

10
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
We rarely spoke to each other.

11
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I would have cracked up long ago

12
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
if Fairy Huo hadn't accompanied me.

13
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,120
By the third year,
on the Dragon Boat Festival,

14
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,560
we stopped receiving ancient books.

15
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
I thought it was strange,

16
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,800
so I went out for a sneak peek.

17
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,440
I followed Fairy Huo's team

18
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,080
to the mountainside

19
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,800
and saw the cliff was
carpeted with dense caves.

20
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,480
They set up many ropes
and cable apparatus.

21
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,110
Those ancient books
must've been brought out

22
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,190
from the caves.

23
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,600
Some of the cables
were already taken down.

24
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,240
I guess the operation
might come to an end.

25
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,200
And after the Dragon Boat Festival,

26
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,400
something crazy happened.

27
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,400
Hurry up! Help!

28
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,720
-Somebody, help!
-Help!

29
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,920
The third day after
the Dragon Boat Festival,

30
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,760
over ten stretchers were carried out
from the mountain.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,600
The bodies on the stretchers
were covered with blood.

32
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
And then,

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,470
a large roll of silk manuscripts
that were soaked with blood

34
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,390
were sent to my tent.

35
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,240
I knew they were the Yellow Silk
as soon as I saw them.

36
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,760
Many people have died

37
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,519
for these silk manuscripts.

38
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,959
Fairy Huo was there the whole time

39
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,240
when I deciphered the books.

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,760
She attached great importance to it.

41
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,560
I guess these are the things
they looked for.

42
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,200
There are many types of Yellow Silk.

43
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,520
But there is one type
that is extremely rare

44
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,320
and very hard to decipher.

45
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,120
They were the kind of silk
that was sent in this time.

46
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,000
But you still deciphered them.

47
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,960
I could only translate them into words

48
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,240
and turn them into
modern Chinese characters.

49
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,160
Underlying these Chinese characters
is the password.

50
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,560
I can't decode the

51
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,240
deeper meaning.

52
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,240
It has been ten days since I finished

53
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,880
restoring the Yellow Silk.

54
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,440
Yellow Silks are priceless.

55
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,600
Even the ones produced

56
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,880
by rubbing can cost a fortune

57
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,560
if the rubbing is clear.

58
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,000
But they seemed nervous.

59
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,440
If I took it, I could've gotten
into trouble.

60
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,080
But if I didn't, I could've missed
the opportunity of a lifetime.

61
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,760
Just then,

62
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,920
I got greedy.

63
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,640
Tell Fairy Huo

64
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,400
the Yellow Silk has been restored.

65
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,550
Yes, just a minute.

66
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,600
Well, well.

67
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,080
Aren't you brave?

68
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,080
You dared to steal the Yellow Silk?

69
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,680
Weren't you afraid of
offending the Mystic Nine?

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
I was greedy at the time.

71
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,280
How was I supposed to know
it would last three years?

72
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,080
Didn't you say you did it for my grandma?

73
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
Of course I did.

74
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,640
I would have left if it weren't
for your grandma.

75
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,960
But who wouldn't take advantage
of the situation?

76
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,000
I figured it wouldn't be a problem.

77
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,320
The Yellow Silks were incomplete
in the first place.

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,920
No one counted them.

79
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,520
No one would notice if anything's missing.

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,320
I thought I could fool everyone.

81
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,760
But the next day, things took
a turn for the worse.

82
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,600
Comrade,

83
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
we have to check everyone.

84
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
Please cooperate.

85
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,440
Cooperate.

86
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,520
I'll cooperate.

87
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,120
Turn around.

88
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay, that's all.

89
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,520
Please come with us.

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Come.

91
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,960
Comrade!

92
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,320
Comrade!

93
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Fairy Huo!

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,159
I was taken into a tent.

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,159
There were around ten people there.

96
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,520
I'd never seen the leader before.

97
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,400
He looked dignified.

98
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,820
Where are the silk manuscripts?

99
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,600
I already gave them all to you.

100
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Where is the one that you hid?

101
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
Hid...

102
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,040
What are you talking about?

103
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,960
You... You're mistaken.

104
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
That was the most
terrifying moment of my life.

105
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,240
Though he used a light touch,

106
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,600
it felt as if my whole skull
was going to crack.

107
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,440
Shoe.

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,760
It's in my shoe.

109
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
So did they let you go?

110
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,680
I thought I was going to die.

111
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,080
But who would have known?

112
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Fairy Huo saved me.

113
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,640
Thanks to the bond we had developed
over those three years.

114
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,000
And she was grateful to me for
translating the Yellow Silk.

115
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,200
Then I left.

116
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Who would have thought about it?

117
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,040
Fairy Huo never came to

118
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,080
my store after I left.

119
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,480
I never had a full meal

120
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,840
since I came back from Sichuan.

121
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,550
I almost went to the
street to beg for food.

122
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,880
Until one day,

123
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,320
a foreigner

124
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,240
asked me about the Yellow Silk.

125
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,360
I can't say it.

126
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
I promised Fairy Huo
not to say it.

127
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,640
That brat offered me a huge price.

128
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
I can't refuse it.

129
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,600
Maybe I was really poor at that time.

130
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,840
How was I supposed to open this store
if I didn't take the money?

131
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
We wouldn't even have met.

132
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,080
Alright.

133
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,560
Hurry up and go on.

134
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,200
That was the second time
that I took the risk in my life.

135
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,840
I drew the Yellow Silk out

136
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
according to my memory and

137
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
sold it to him.

138
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,760
But I swear

139
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,040
I didn't say a word about what
happened on the mountain.

140
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,440
What's the result of that operation?

141
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,480
I don't know. I didn't follow them
till the end.

142
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,040
They discovered me in the half way

143
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
and the level of

144
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,240
confidentiality of that
operation was high.

145
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
There was never a rumour

146
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,880
about that operation.

147
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,960
That's why I said

148
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,920
you can only ask
Fairy Huo about it

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,280
if you want to know more details.

150
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
By the way,

151
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,110
send my regards to Fairy Huo.

152
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,400
Tell her I'm still single.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,880
You've studied architecture
for so many years,

154
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,160
and you didn't find anything peculiar?

155
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,280
Looks like a house from the Ming or Qing
Dynasty judging by its structure.

156
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,120
Take a look at the lighting of this house.

157
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,880
There's a problem with
the design of the windows.

158
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,720
It can't get the lighting

159
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,200
if it was that close to the roof.

160
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,400
The designer might do it on purpose

161
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,310
if the beam was avoided intentionally.

162
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,200
Lighting is the most important thing
to a house

163
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
for people to live in.

164
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,840
The house is uninhabitable.

165
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Mr Zheng,

166
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,240
have you seen this
kind of house before?

167
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,520
I knew

168
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,360
there was a place

169
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,800
kind of like this.

170
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,560
It's just the protocols
were not that strict.

171
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
Mortuary?

172
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Right.

173
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,280
It's the place to keep dead bodies.

174
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,640
I've checked grandma's letter.

175
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,400
She never joined

176
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,840
any operation after 1965.

177
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,160
Either the Mystic Nine

178
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,880
had found what they wanted,

179
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,760
or something happened halfway

180
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,040
which halted their collaboration.

181
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,760
It might be the latter.

182
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,520
Your aunt, Huo Ling,

183
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,720
Chen Wen Jin, and all the
second generation members

184
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,800
have explored the Paracel Islands.

185
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,000
It means

186
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,240
Mystic Nine's operation is still ongoing.

187
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,400
This leader is powerful.

188
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,160
To be able to gather the Mystic Nine

189
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,320
and all that equipment

190
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
without making any news.

191
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,040
Why didn't I hear my grandma mention it?

192
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,680
It's it.

193
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,080
It's it.

194
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,880
What is it?

195
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,680
Chen Wen Jin mentioned it

196
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,240
repeatedly in her diary,

197
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,480
but couldn't tell what exactly it was.

198
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,400
So there's no way

199
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,720
we could tell it is

200
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
just by that word?

201
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,000
It

202
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
has been affecting the

203
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,040
operational plan of
the Mystic Nine.

204
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,120
And it started earlier than
the Paracel Islands

205
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,720
or even earlier than Banai.

206
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,600
From your grandma's time to Wu San Xing,

207
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Chen Wen Jin

208
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,040
and Wu Xie's time,

209
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,000
it has always been there.

210
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,680
Perhaps

211
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,160
from the moment the Mystic Nine was born,

212
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
the fate of the members

213
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,320
has been under its influence

214
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,920
no matter what path they chose.

215
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,880
Every generation of the Mystic Nine
was involved.

216
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
The death of everyone is very odd.

217
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,520
The leaders of the Xie family,

218
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,200
your master, Wu Lao Gou,

219
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,480
my master, Er Yue Hong

220
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,360
and the Master Buddha you mentioned.

221
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,320
What on earth did you do

222
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,080
as the older generations?

223
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,040
Then,

224
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,320
is it our turn now?

225
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,440
Wu San Xing had told me before.

226
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,800
You want to break the tie?

227
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,400
How do you know your existence

228
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,440
isn't an arrangement?

229
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,080
Who knows

230
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,560
whether our current investigation

231
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,080
is being arranged.

232
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,600
However, we are

233
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,600
in it anyway.

234
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,800
From the current situation,

235
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,200
I started to suspect

236
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,720
it is not a kind of power

237
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,360
or a kind of compulsion,

238
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,080
it's the emotional impact.

239
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,720
That's why it can be anytime, anywhere.

240
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,600
It is everywhere.

241
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,200
Otherwise, everything is hard to explain.

242
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,840
Right, Xiu Xiu.

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,800
I would like to meet your grandma.

244
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,760
You know how she's like.

245
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,360
Anyway, she'll be dropping
by Xin Yue Restaurant.

246
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,320
Okay,

247
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,360
I'll wait for her there.

248
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Alright.

249
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Where did you find this thing?

250
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,000
I accidentally found it when I

251
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,360
was cleaning my house.

252
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,920
It's extremely rare.

253
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,960
Lei style architecture mostly revolved

254
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,280
around royal palaces,

255
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
gardens and large mausoleums.

256
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,720
It's hard to find something like this

257
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,320
private mortuary.

258
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
How about this?

259
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,840
You hand it over to me.

260
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,120
I would like to do some research.

261
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,160
Actually, I don't want

262
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,600
this paper.

263
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,520
I only want to know

264
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,960
what's behind this paper.

265
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
How about this?

266
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,720
You check it for me
within the profession.

267
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,960
I'll give this paper

268
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,360
to you

269
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,440
if there's a result.

270
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Deal.

271
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,150
How frank.

272
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,760
Fatty,

273
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
this dude,

274
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,160
I really admire the willpower

275
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,320
of you both.

276
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,400
However,

277
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,520
our boss' scanning machine
is already here.

278
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,880
Stop digging.

279
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,800
The machine isn't here yet,

280
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,079
I'll dig it a little more.

281
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,359
Look.

282
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,640
Right on cue.

283
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,160
Can this junk

284
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,040
scan the whole mountain?

285
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,319
This is a drone

286
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,480
which can scan the whole mountain.

287
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,280
It's equipped with various sensors

288
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,800
that can detect the hollow

289
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,320
and solid parts of the mountain,

290
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,440
and its mineral composition.

291
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,480
It was specifically imported
for this task.

292
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,280
It beats manual labour anytime.

293
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,720
Moreover,

294
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,040
our boss is more anxious than you are.

295
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Fine.

296
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,680
I'll go do something else.

297
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,270
Mr Zheng,

298
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,000
this place is ordinary,

299
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,360
but it's my friend's shop.

300
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
So it's safe.

301
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,800
It's better to be safe.

302
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,270
This is Mr Ruan, who wants to
buy your item.

303
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,800
Buy?

304
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,210
I never want to sell it.

305
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,360
I said

306
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
if you could find out

307
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,360
about Yangshi Lei,

308
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,520
the drawing's yours.

309
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
Here's the thing.

310
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,960
Master Xiao San, don't refuse.

311
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,440
This is no small sum.

312
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,680
You could live off it

313
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,240
for three years even without
running your business.

314
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,040
How about helping each other?

315
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,040
This is collaboration.

316
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,640
Employers use this trick when it's
inconvenient to talk about money.

317
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,520
Hold each other's hand,

318
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,400
move their fingers, which means haggling.

319
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
Enjoy the tea.

320
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,400
Master Xiao San holds
the cup in his hand.

321
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,370
This is called "stop."

322
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,720
Which means he would never sell it.

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,000
You know it?

324
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,720
I'm an antiquarian.

325
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,760
Master Xiao San is busy travelling,

326
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,120
so I do everything at Wushanju.

327
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,520
Forgive me.

328
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,320
Your store must be making a lot

329
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,240
for you to give up a profitable business.

330
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,720
May I ask

331
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,960
how much your salary is?

332
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,160
Is your store still recruiting?

333
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,280
<i>Hangzhou to Changsha</i>

334
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,840
I won't pay you this month.

335
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,040
Please don't.

336
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,440
You'll get paid in two days.

337
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,800
Keep that in mind.

338
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,160
Mr Ruan,

339
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,440
what do you want this drawing for?

340
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,880
My master likes it.

341
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
So we have to find it.

342
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,680
I can't say more.

343
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,880
Can you pass a message then?

344
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,720
Let me meet your master.

345
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
I'm more interested

346
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,840
in why he wants this thing

347
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,480
than the price.

348
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,720
My master is a powerful man.

349
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,040
He doesn't usually see outsiders.

350
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,560
Mr Zheng,

351
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,200
the Mystic Nine is

352
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,160
the greatest antiquarian, isn't it?

353
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,240
Of course.

354
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,480
During the republican period,

355
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,400
everyone knew about

356
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,800
the governor of the Mystic Nine
in Changsha.

357
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,240
You'll have to join
one of the nine major powers

358
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,160
if you were to run a business
in Changsha City.

359
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,960
There's no other way.

360
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,640
Wu family is one of the Mystic Nine.

361
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,720
Will your master oblige?

362
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,800
I can try, but I can't promise.

363
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,960
This is my name card,

364
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,420
<i>Xishan, Zheng Fu Zhong</i>

365
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,880
Xishan, Zheng Fu Zhong.

366
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,310
<i>Wu Xie</i>

367
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
Tomorrow, before noon,

368
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,560
wait for my call.

369
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Then,

370
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,560
gentlemen,

371
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,800
I'll leave now.

372
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,280
Goodbye.

373
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,760
Never thought that the way of
flicking plaque is still available now.

374
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,760
The opponent really wants the drawing

375
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,200
if he was to offer you
a good price like this.

376
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,960
Bring more people with you

377
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,680
if he promised to have a meetup.

378
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,320
You can't show your weakness

379
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,560
in front of others.

380
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,240
Thanks for reminding me.

381
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Mr Fatty!

382
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Mr Fatty!

383
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,640
Where are you going?

384
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,880
I'm going to cut wood.

385
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,200
You've almost

386
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,080
cleared out the mountain.

387
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm begging you.

388
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,560
We have enough firewood.

389
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,760
Then I go feed the pigs.

390
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,080
You already fed them four times
in the morning.

391
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,880
Then, I'll go pick some mushrooms.

392
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,800
You'll feed the mushrooms
to the pigs too.

393
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,840
Have you picked the peanuts?

394
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,440
The peanuts haven't ripened yet.

395
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Mr Fatty,

396
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,640
I knew you're sad,

397
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,600
but there's no more thing to do
in the house.

398
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,200
Then let me

399
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,520
do something.

400
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,920
It's Wu Xie.

401
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,450
Hello, Fatty.

402
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,530
Hello,

403
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Wu Xie.

404
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,440
How are you guys?

405
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,120
We're fine.

406
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,360
Have you found any clue?

407
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Yes, I guess.

408
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
Fatty, I tell you what.

409
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,080
Three days later,

410
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,600
I need to stop by Xin Yue Restaurant.

411
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
It might have clues in there.

412
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,280
Xin Yue Restaurant?

413
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,480
It's dangerous there.

414
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,240
How about this?

415
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Wait for us.

416
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,880
I'll go back to Beijing
with Zhang tomorrow.

417
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
Okay.

418
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,920
I'll go back to Beijing tomorrow.

419
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,460
But...

420
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,720
But before I go,

421
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,080
there's something I must do.

422
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,640
It hurts.

423
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
It hurts so much!

424
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Mr Fatty,

425
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Mr Fatty.

426
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,280
All the boys here

427
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,840
get tattoos

428
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,480
once they enter adulthood.

429
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
They get

430
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,880
tattoos of the girls they love

431
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,720
on their bodies

432
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,240
to symbolise their undying devotion.

433
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,400
Uncle Gui,

434
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,200
are there any other methods

435
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,000
to show affection?

436
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,520
No.

437
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
Only tattoos?

438
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
Yes.

439
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Do it.

440
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Master Xiao San,

441
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,860
how could you exclude me

442
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,250
from your investigation?

443
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,120
How's the situation with Uncle San?

444
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,320
It's fine.

445
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
Still manageable.

446
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,000
Do you want me to come to
Xin Yue Restaurant with you?

447
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,040
It's better to have company.

448
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
No need for that.

449
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,720
I asked Fatty and Zhang.

450
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Fatty

451
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,000
may be talkative,

452
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
but he is dependable.

453
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,680
Fatty and Zhang

454
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,360
are pretty much your sworn brothers.

455
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,200
I can rest assured
if you're with them.

456
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,040
They should be coming back
to Beijing now.

457
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,280
Wang Meng,

458
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,400
you should go back to Hangzhou
to tend the store.

459
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,640
Boss, about my train ticket...

460
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,560
I'll pay it together with your salary

461
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,240
after I finish my work.

462
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,920
Great!

463
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,800
You're the best!

464
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,920
-Dig in, boss.
-Cheers!

465
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Here.

466
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,240
Gently I flick my sleeves,

467
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,640
not even a wisp of cloud
will I bring away.

468
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,680
Come, I drink with you.

469
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,800
I can't drink.

470
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,080
I have dietary restrictions
after getting the tattoo.

471
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,560
You got a tattoo?

472
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,110
There's a tradition
in Uncle Gui's village.

473
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,600
Men need to get a tattoo that represents

474
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,000
the lady they love

475
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,840
before getting married.

476
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,680
Where's it?
Let me take a look.

477
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,120
Where's it?

478
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,320
Does your tattoo only appear

479
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,240
when heated like Zhang's tattoo?

480
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,880
No.

481
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,390
Isn't it here?

482
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,720
Here.

483
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,960
Where?

484
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Here.

485
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,080
Is that a tattoo?

486
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,560
Do you know how hurt
it is to get a tattoo?

487
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,480
Are those who dare to get a tattoo human?

488
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,680
I took good care of Zhang

489
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,800
when you were not around.

490
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,480
Did I, Zhang?

491
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,120
I heard it on the phone

492
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,200
that you want to go to
Xin Yue Restaurant.

493
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,840
We need to dress up

494
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,960
after this meal.

495
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,310
Otherwise,

496
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,520
we can't even enter Xin Yue Restaurant.

497
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,160
Seriously?

498
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,440
Xin Yue Restaurant isn't like
those in Liulichang.

499
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,840
They are a grand hotel

500
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,120
with a permit to host auctions.

501
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,320
Only members are allowed in.

502
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,680
The auction items are pricey.

503
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,640
Collectors submit their most prized

504
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,080
private collections to them,

505
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,880
where they are subjected

506
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,640
to a rigorous selection process.

507
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,980
<i>Xin Yue Restaurant</i>

508
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,640
Then, file a record, have application and
verification to the relevant departments.

509
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,560
They will only start the auctions
after receiving the approval.

510
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

511
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,880
We have an auction today,

512
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,840
so no walk-ins.

513
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,800
We are here for the auction.

514
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,320
Then may I see your invitation?

515
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,390
If you don't have an invitation,

516
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,760
a bank document

517
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
verifying your net worth

518
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
is also acceptable.

519
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
Why are you looking at me?

520
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,680
My bank card was over-limit long ago.

521
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,920
I, Fatty, am known

522
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
for being a big spender.

523
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,640
I never save my fortune.

524
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
Forget it.

525
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Why don't we

526
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,310
leave him here?

527
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,600
An old man with amnesia?

528
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,640
There's no password.
Use it however you like.

529
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,920
Thank you.

530
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,400
A black card?

531
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,400
Where did you get it?

532
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,320
I found it.

533
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,160
It's all for nothing if
the flowers are not fertilized.

534
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,520
It's all for nothing if
the flowers are not fertilized.

535
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Zhang,

536
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,840
are you keeping case-dough?

537
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,080
Doesn't it belong to Xiao Hua?

538
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,280
I keep it for him.

539
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,370
I keep...

540
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,120
I'll give him a call.

541
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,120
Tell him I'll give it back to him
when I'm back in Beijing.

542
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,440
You don't trust me.

543
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,720
Mister, here's your card.

544
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,320
You're welcome.

545
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Please.

546
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,760
Master Hua'er.

547
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Master Hua'er.

548
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,560
Fatty,

549
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,000
what did you use my card for?

550
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,040
Authorization.

551
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,320
It's just an authorization.

552
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,560
I didn't use your money.

553
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,480
Are you guys in Xin Yue Restaurant?

554
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,320
We came here to enjoy tea.

555
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,760
What are you doing there?

556
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,830
Say it.

557
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,000
Master Hua'er, the signal here is bad.

558
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:47,040
It will be a scene in
Xin Yue Restaurant today.

559
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,480
<i>Xin Yue Restaurant</i>

560
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,060
<i>Signature Spicy Crab</i>

561
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,220
<i>Wangye Roast Duck</i>

562
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,440
Oh my god.

563
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,160
How is a 7000 yuan pot of tea
not considered robbery?

564
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,120
It's really a good place.

565
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,360
You have promised Xiao Hua that

566
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,280
you won't use his money.

567
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,400
At least we need to order
something cheap.

568
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,160
Hello, sirs.

569
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,360
Allow me to explain the menu.

570
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,040
Our restaurant has more options

571
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,080
like these affordable options.

572
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,480
You can choose this on this page.

573
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,800
1800 yuan for a pot of tea,

574
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,440
including complimentary snacks
and pumpkin seeds.

575
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,520
The pumpkin seeds are free?

576
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,440
Yes.

577
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,520
Can I have two catties of them?

578
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,840
Yes, sir.

579
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,440
Does anyone here look like they're going
to buy your Yangshi Lei drawing?

580
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,040
Seem like your buyer is rich enough to

581
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,680
join the auctions here.

582
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
I really can't tell.

583
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,560
Just wait.

584
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,800
What is the auction item today?

585
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,880
Alert! Alert!

586
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,960
The debtee is less than
one meter away from you.

587
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,600
Master Hua'er!

588
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Master Hua'er!

589
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,239
Master Hua'er!

590
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Please.

591
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,040
How conservative of you guys.

592
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,719
Here you go, the owner.

593
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,159
Thank you.

594
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,960
Master Hua'er,

595
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,239
your room is ready.

596
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,600
What are you guys doing here?

597
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
I found a Yangshi Lei drawing.

598
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
An interested buyer

599
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,880
asked me to meet him here.

600
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,600
Yangshi Lei?

601
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,040
I know who the buyer is.

602
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,720
-Xiao Hua, how do you know him?
-Wu Xie,

603
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
there's something you

604
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,800
shouldn't say in Xin Yue Restaurant.

605
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,040
Master Xiao San.

606
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,600
Liu Li Sun?

607
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,840
Who is your boss?

608
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,320
Our boss is

609
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,960
the infamous

610
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,320
Liu Li Sun.

611
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,040
He is the bellwether

612
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,880
of Beijing's art industry.

613
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,160
Where there's him,

614
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,680
there's good stuff.

615
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,920
It's just a raw pearl.

616
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,440
You know that?

617
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
I heard of it.

618
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,920
Recently, there has been no news
about Wu San Xing.

619
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,120
Where is he?

620
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,440
That's Uncle San for you.

621
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,000
Always disappearing.

622
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,400
I heard he's dead.

623
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,240
Is it true?

624
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,760
Master San is mysterious
and unpredictable.

625
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,400
It's not that you can see him
whenever you want.

626
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,320
If Wu San Xing finds out

627
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,040
someone is saying bad things about him,

628
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,320
that person will lose his tongue.

629
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,200
Niece,

630
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,600
it was just a joke.

631
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,880
I'm not your niece.

632
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,760
My third uncle is fine,

633
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,480
thanks for asking.

634
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Gentlemen,

635
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,720
a VIP invites you to come upstairs.

636
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,440
How ungrateful!

637
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,400
I wish Master San could live a long life.

638
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,760
When watering the flowers,

639
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,680
<i>Lotus Hall</i>

640
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
admiring the fragrance of the flowers
even if her red sleeves are wet.

641
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,440
This room is named after a poem

642
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,720
Liu Xiao Chuo, "A Beauty With Lotus."

643
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,640
Gentlemen,

644
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,520
here we are.

645
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
After you.

646
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,680
Xin Yue Restaurant

647
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,840
is showing off their cultural heritage.

648
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,950
Maybe it's their rules.

649
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,520
Zhang,

650
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
form an array.

651
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,560
We're here to support our Master Xiao San.

652
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,880
Stop looking at me.

653
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,920
Watch your word!

654
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,960
We are now your man.

655
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
Let's go.

656
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,160
Master Xiao San,

657
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,080
please.

658
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,360
Okay, Fatty.

659
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,800
Who is the buyer of
the Yangshi Lei drawing?

660
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,960
Here.

661
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,760
Xiu Xiu?

662
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,440
Wu Xie.

663
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Why are you here?

664
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
Follow me.

665
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,480
Grandma,

666
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,560
they are here.

667
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,240
This is my grandma.

668
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,760
Everyone calls her Fairy Huo.

669
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,120
You can call her Granny Huo.

670
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,920
Hello, Granny Huo.

671
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,520
I am Wu Xie.

672
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,880
You do resemble Wu Lao Gou.

673
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,240
I didn't believe it at first.

674
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,840
So that traitorous dog

675
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,960
did have children.

676
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,960
Do you know my grandfather?

677
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,840
More than that.

678
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,960
It's great that

679
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,320
both of you are friends.

680
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,800
You resemble him even more
when you smile.

681
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,960
Looks like you're no saint, either.

682
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,520
Did my grandfather owe a debt
to the Huo family?

683
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
Just straight to it.

684
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,600
Do you agree to sell the thing?

685
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Actually, the Yangshi Lei drawing
means nothing to me.

686
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,560
I just want to know

687
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,400
why you're buying it at such
a high price,

688
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,470
and what's on the drawing.

689
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,840
You want to know?

690
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,470
Sure.

691
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,600
Provided it's not you who's asking,

692
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,480
but your grandmother.

693
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,800
A love grudge.

694
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,480
I'm sure of it.

695
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,610
Please get ready.

696
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,520
The auction is about to begin.

697
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:11,894
