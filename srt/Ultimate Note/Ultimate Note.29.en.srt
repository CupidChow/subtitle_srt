1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,840
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 29</i>

4
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,360
So handsome!

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
Help!

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,800
Quicksand?

7
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,840
My shoulder!

8
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,120
I shouted for help

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,440
at you two.

10
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,560
But I almost died

11
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,320
-from your actions!
-Shut up!

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Hurry and lie down!

13
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,680
It's easier said than done!

14
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,960
-How can I lie down with my waist?
-Sit down!

15
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,520
Pull your legs up!

16
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,720
Slowly.

17
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,720
Use small actions.

18
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
We're under someone's toilet now.

19
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,240
Would I pull up

20
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,280
any treasure here?

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Shut up! I'll leave you here
if you continue!

22
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,920
Give me your hand!

23
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,320
Darn it.

24
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
The wall entrance closed.

25
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Look!

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,840
There's a door!

27
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,840
It's in the east.

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,520
I wonder if we could get out.

29
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,760
Let's go.

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,240
How can a life-threatening

31
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,160
thing like this be here?

32
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Xiu Xiu said

33
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,940
this is her family's vacant lot.

34
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,800
It's normally used for training.

35
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,680
Mrs Huo is really something.

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,960
She almost buried

37
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,160
half of me in sand

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,840
with a darn training ground.

39
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,160
This quicksand simulator is so realistic.

40
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,240
How deep is it?

41
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,230
This type of quicksand

42
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,800
is lethal no matter how deep it was.

43
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
The sand will fill your lungs

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,480
whenever you breathe

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
once it reaches your chest.

46
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,480
Your lungs won't be able to expand

47
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,840
and you'll die of suffocation.

48
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,200
We must leave immediately!

49
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,779
<i>Entrance</i>

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
This is an entrance.

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
I bet there'll be an exit.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Why don't

53
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,280
we take a look inside?

54
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
We're at a dead end now.

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,920
We have to go in.

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
Come.

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
Let's go.

58
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,880
The Heavens granted me
a pair of dark eyes,

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,760
so I could see the light.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,700
<i>First Floor</i>

61
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,600
It's the first floor.

62
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
There might be a second floor.

63
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,320
I can't see any stairs.

64
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,240
This place is octagonal.

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,640
The Huo family either built this

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,200
based on a tower

67
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,360
or a building.

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,440
Lye?

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,840
It must have simulated

70
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,920
the design and set-up of a place.

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,120
This is really a training ground.

72
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,520
We must be careful.

73
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
It would be dire for us if we inhale

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,440
the lye.

75
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,240
What is this?

76
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,680
A caliduct?

77
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,760
Nonsense!

78
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,160
Is the caliduct in your house open-ended?

79
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,920
An open-ended pipe is called a chimney.

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,800
A timer.

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,520
Would the Huo family use real traps

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
on the training ground?

83
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,440
What if someone gets killed?

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:37,920
We must leave here to

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,360
ensure our safety.

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,680
Look at that window.

87
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,640
The position of the window

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,720
corresponds to the one in the floor plan.

89
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,320
Could this be

90
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,880
a model of a morgue?

91
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
If that's true,

92
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
it's such a coincidence.

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,480
Mrs Huo has been eyeing your
floor plan long enough.

94
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,620
This must be a replica

95
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,870
of the Yangshi Lei

96
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,480
floor plan you have right now.

97
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,360
If this was a training ground

98
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,640
related to the Yangshi Lei Archives,

99
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,680
they'd have surveillance.

100
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,760
That's great.

101
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,000
Can you hear us,

102
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
head of the Huo family?

103
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,400
Why don't we negotiate?

104
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,040
If you shut the timer down,

105
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
we can discuss further
over a glass of wine.

106
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay?

107
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,760
Don't you want the Yangshi Lei drawing?

108
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
I'll tear it apart

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,400
if you don't emerge.

110
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm really tearing it!

111
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,600
That's enough!

112
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,799
It's futile.

113
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
I don't think Mrs Huo knows

114
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,360
that her granddaughter

115
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,240
brought us here.

116
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,280
She'll come here

117
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,919
right away if she knows we're here.

118
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,520
We don't have much time.

119
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,160
Hurry and find a way out!

120
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
Zhang.

121
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,920
What's the problem?

122
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
The final destination.

123
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,320
Final destination?

124
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,600
My final destination.

125
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,920
Zhang!

126
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,840
Have you been here?

127
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,030
Look.

128
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,960
There are four pillars here.

129
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,830
But the Qilin is facing that pillar

130
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,400
so accurately.

131
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
Something's not right.

132
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,760
A Qilin head with a dragon's body.

133
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,640
What is this thing?

134
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,840
Gilded bronze Qilin head.

135
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,720
Look.

136
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
The pattern on the Yangshi Lei drawing

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
is the same on this rivet?

138
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,040
It's the same.

139
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
It's sequenced too.

140
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,200
From one to seven.

141
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,480
Could it correspond to the
respective floors?

142
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,400
It's possible.

143
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,520
This picture matches the rivet above.

144
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,440
And the floor above

145
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
must match

146
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,200
this picture marked number one.

147
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,760
If we press accordingly on the rivets

148
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,640
with the floor plan,

149
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,760
would we open the door?

150
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,080
What?

151
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
Is there a time limit?

152
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,240
Hold your breath!

153
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,520
So that was where the lye came from!

154
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,440
Mrs Huo is so cruel!

155
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,680
How can she use real traps in her
own training ground?

156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,190
Press it, Wu Xie!

157
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,360
Don't rush me! I have to be sure!

158
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,560
Roll it up!

159
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,240
Hurry!

160
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,800
That's it!

161
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,400
Let's go!

162
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,440
Hurry!

163
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,840
Welcome to the second floor hotel.

164
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,350
Who knew we could

165
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,040
escape with the Yangshi Lei drawing?

166
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,800
No wonder Mrs Huo wants it.

167
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,920
But now it seems

168
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,480
she's clearly informed

169
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,040
of our presence.

170
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,400
Think about it.

171
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,680
We're here at this old shop

172
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,640
and Fatty fell down.

173
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,560
These are not coincidental.

174
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
It's been arranged.

175
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,120
What do you think the old lady wants?

176
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,110
To let us die here

177
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,760
and steal your map?

178
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,800
Too bad we have this drawing.

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,440
<i>Granny Huo couldn't trap us here.</i>

180
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,600
<i>Let's go.</i>

181
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,360
<i>We'll see what secrets are behind</i>

182
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,440
<i>this drawing.</i>

183
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,920
<i>This Yangshi Lei drawing
is that of a morgue.</i>

184
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,160
<i>During the Renzong period,</i>

185
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,920
<i>Fan Zhong Yan established a morgue
at Suzhou for his people.</i>

186
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,200
<i>Then it was used to store coffins</i>

187
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,440
<i>for foreigners or vagrants</i>

188
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,400
<i>who passed away there.</i>

189
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,800
<i>According to fengshui,</i>

190
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,240
<i>morgues are highly ominous.</i>

191
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,320
<i>The more bodies it contains,</i>

192
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,400
<i>the more inauspicious
the morgue is.</i>

193
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,080
Mrs Huo is so atheistic.

194
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,640
Why can't I see any staircases here?

195
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,560
It's due to superstitions.

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,440
A morgue would not have stairs

197
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,560
or exits,

198
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,840
as that would be bad for fengshui.

199
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,360
But there will be hidden passageways

200
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,920
for the families and workers
to get across the rooms.

201
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,960
The labels on this Yangshi Lei drawing

202
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,440
must indicate the way
to open the passageways.

203
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
<i>Thanks</i>

204
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,360
<i>to you and Zhang,</i>

205
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
<i>we cracked the Yangshi Lei drawing.</i>

206
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,200
Otherwise,

207
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,430
who knows how much lye

208
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,600
I'd have ingested.

209
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,760
There are various sizes of
labels in the drawing.

210
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,400
Big from close, small from afar.

211
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,520
From the angle of the Qilin,

212
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,840
the markings on the rolled drawing

213
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,000
will correctly match

214
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,600
the rivets on the pillars.

215
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,480
I should've learned drawing

216
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,800
or scenography

217
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,920
and use them to escape rooms.

218
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,320
I feel that this old lady

219
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,080
must be spying on us somewhere.

220
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,910
Why don't

221
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,240
we agitate her

222
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,470
and scold her

223
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,720
to lure her out?

224
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,360
Do you think Mrs Huo

225
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,480
would be so gullible?

226
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,360
You're right.

227
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,880
This Qilin is facing...

228
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,720
This way!

229
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,520
<i>These are sliding doors.</i>

230
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,920
<i>Seems like this is a moving maze.</i>

231
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,440
The style kind of reminds me
of Qimen Dunjia.

232
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,119
<i>There are eight exits.</i>

233
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,720
Let's choose one.

234
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,800
The room just now.

235
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,240
The Qilin is facing the real door.

236
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,880
Let's follow the Qilin's direction.

237
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,520
The Qilin is facing the Living Door.

238
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,360
In Qimen Dunjia, the northeast
is indicated by the Living Door.

239
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,280
We saw the same thing

240
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
in the Land of the Heavenly Queen Mother.

241
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,640
Who would've thought that after millennia,

242
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,560
Yangshi Lei architecture hasn't changed.

243
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
Let's see what would be new here.

244
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,920
We can widen our horizons here.

245
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:49,800
Let's go.

246
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,720
Go around it.

247
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,480
Let's go.

248
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,320
What do you think these
metal cages are for?

249
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,800
Why do I think it's not easy?

250
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,800
It's hard to say.

251
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
I wonder what

252
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,800
Mrs Huo is up to.

253
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,880
That's not right.

254
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
We're moving towards the Living Door.

255
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,280
Why can't we get out?

256
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,800
Let's go further.

257
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,280
Thank god Zhang was quick.

258
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,080
We'll be minced meat if he can't save us.

259
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,640
Why did the Living Door lead us to death?

260
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,640
Hurry!

261
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,880
Leave, Wu Xie!

262
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,360
Hurry!

263
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,680
Zhang!

264
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
No way!

265
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,000
This is not right!

266
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,080
This place is really a moving maze!

267
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,680
We went towards the Living Door.

268
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,920
What was wrong?

269
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,360
This is a morgue.

270
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,040
A morgue?

271
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,120
<i>Lei Tower Floor Plan</i>

272
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,560
<i>There's a similar place
like this before.</i>

273
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,400
<i>A morgue?</i>

274
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,560
<i>That's right.</i>

275
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,880
<i>The place for the dead.</i>

276
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,400
The dead won't take the Living Door.

277
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,880
We should take the Death Door
in the southwest.

278
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,760
That makes sense.

279
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,080
Southwest...

280
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,640
Let's have a go.

281
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,520
Let's go.

282
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,360
Wu Xie.

283
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,640
Wait.

284
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,600
We've been spinning around

285
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
this maze long enough.

286
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,280
How can we remember the direction?

287
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,000
Go back to the Qilin sculpture.

288
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,080
We'll try again.

289
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,520
-Okay.
-There's no need.

290
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,480
It's turning.

291
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,320
Turning?

292
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,680
What's turning?

293
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,120
Zhang.

294
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,440
Do you mean the sculpture was turning?

295
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,000
That's it.

296
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,720
We've been loitering around

297
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,480
this maze for a long time now.

298
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,480
This sculpture might have
spun in many angles.

299
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,480
The tail would've changed its course now.

300
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,560
What a jerk.

301
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,880
They won't let us turn back.

302
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
You're right,

303
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,160
but you're also wrong.

304
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,800
If this was the original building,

305
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,360
there's no turning back.

306
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
However,

307
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,280
the Huo family made a replica.

308
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,400
There must be something we can use.

309
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,780
What we need to do now

310
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,920
is to find some kind of reference
to ascertain our position.

311
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
We can do it however

312
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,350
if we're outside.

313
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,840
What can we use

314
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,800
in this wretched place?

315
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,440
Hush!

316
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,480
Listen.

317
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,880
It's the booby trap of the previous room.

318
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,960
Southwest.

319
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,360
The Qilin was facing northeast

320
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,560
in the previous room.

321
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,000
The exit of this room

322
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,000
is also by the northeast wall.

323
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,360
Yes.

324
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
So this direction is southwest.

325
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,520
Southwest.

326
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
South.

327
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,960
Southeast.

328
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,400
Thank goodness to the weak soundproof.

329
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,960
It'll be troublesome if we can't hear it.

330
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,320
No matter how the metal cage moves

331
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,240
or how the sculpture spins,

332
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,520
the four winds will never change

333
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,040
no matter what happens to the
exterior of the building.

334
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,840
It won't disturb us as well.

335
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,960
This old lady is too much.

336
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
The lye would go off
for three minutes.

337
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
We have to get out in three minutes.

338
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,880
We'll find our direction with it.

339
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,100
Let's go.

340
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,880
This must be the pillar by the Death Door.

341
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,280
Life means death.

342
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,080
Death

343
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,520
means life.

344
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,120
This Yangshi Lei is really intimidating.

345
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,320
Let's leave now, Wu Xie.

346
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,240
What is this?

347
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,440
Why would the Huo family place
a document here?

348
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,040
Isn't this your Uncle San?

349
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,240
Who is the young lady beside him?

350
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,760
She looks beautiful.

351
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,040
He's not a girl.

352
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,880
He's Xiao Hua.

353
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,360
Xiao Hua?

354
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,240
I could hardly recognise him.

355
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,640
Then again,

356
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,000
Master Hua'er looks just as dashing now.

357
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,400
This person

358
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,400
is not Uncle San.

359
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,320
Year 1983.

360
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,360
This archaeological team

361
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
hasn't been to Xisha.

362
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,520
He's Xie Lian Huan.

363
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,080
What did the Huo family want

364
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
to keep the Xie family's photo?

365
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,920
If they place it here,

366
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,200
it's otherwise not important

367
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,400
to take it away,

368
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
or it's too important

369
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,000
which must be placed here.

370
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,040
This is the real Master San.

371
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,080
First the Xie family,

372
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,480
then the Wu family.

373
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,880
The other families might be here as well.

374
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,200
Mrs Huo was so unoccupied in collecting

375
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
intelligence on the Mystic Nine.

376
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,960
This was when I was young.

377
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
This is three...

378
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,440
No.

379
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,480
Year 1989.

380
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,960
It was Xie Lian Huan then.

381
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
He was celebrating my birthday.

382
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,880
Where do you think Mrs Huo
got the picture from?

383
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,720
He really looked just the same to me.

384
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,320
Wu Xie!

385
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,400
You...

386
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,880
Do you have retrograde amnesia too?

387
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,960
You lost your memory

388
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,960
and became immortal like Zhang.

389
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,760
How could it be?

390
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,480
I was 12 years old in 1989.

391
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,840
The two pictures were taken
within two days.

392
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Could it be

393
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,880
that you were changed too?

394
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,720
Is it you?

395
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
How can you switch up with disguise?

396
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Think closely.

397
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,590
This person was so much older than me.

398
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,240
I should be changing with him instead.

399
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,000
That makes sense.

400
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,960
Regardless,

401
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,920
You're the only Master Xiao San I know.

402
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,640
The others are fake.

403
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,960
That's not right.

404
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,560
This

405
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,600
is an old forgery.

406
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,280
Let's look for other clues.

407
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,920
Wu Xie!

408
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Where are they?

409
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,000
Where are they?

410
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,040
Wu Xie!

411
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,120
Wu Xie!

412
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,200
Oh no!

413
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,320
It's empty.

414
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
These are all photos of the Mystic Nine.

415
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,080
Photos of everyday life.

416
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,920
Only this one is different.

417
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,520
It seems she deliberately

418
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,280
left this photo for me.

419
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,670
This old lady was up to something.

420
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,000
Shall we continue?

421
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,160
Yes.

422
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,960
We shouldn't waste her efforts.

423
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
She lured us here

424
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,960
with so much effort

425
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,640
for the Yangshi Lei drawing.

426
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,280
But

427
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,440
what is her actual plan?

428
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,640
Where did she get these photos?

429
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,080
We have to find out.

430
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,960
My grandmother wants me to go home?

431
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,160
Yes, young lady.

432
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,940
Grandma planned all along

433
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,680
to take them here.

434
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,720
Where are my friends?

435
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,240
We don't know.

436
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,120
Where's my grandmother?

437
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,000
This...

438
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,590
We don't know.

439
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,400
She merely asked us to take you home.

440
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,720
I can't find out from my grandmother.

441
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,880
Can't you tell me with your own mouth?

442
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,200
Young lady!

443
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,720
What are you doing?

444
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,480
She merely asked us to take you home.

445
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,240
This must be the pillar.

446
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,840
We must be careful.

447
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,360
We don't know what

448
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,760
the old lady had in store for us.

449
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,280
Here.

450
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,400
No problem.

451
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,200
It's fake.

452
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,920
There are treasures which the
Huo family didn't get.

453
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,560
The previous two rooms

454
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,040
had decent booby traps.

455
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,640
This room was peculiar

456
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,360
to have none.

457
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,720
Human-faced tortoise?

458
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
In the legends,

459
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,400
Shennong's descendants depicted
man-faced beasts

460
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,360
in their murals.

461
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,360
One of them was the human-faced tortoise.

462
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,520
It was written in the
Imperial Readings of Taiping Era.

463
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,640
What does it mean

464
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,000
to have it here?

465
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,240
If the human-faced tortoise
in this replica

466
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,760
is authentic,

467
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,040
it would be worth a lot of money.

468
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
This is a rare item

469
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,880
in the market.

470
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
Not many would know about it.

471
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,680
What kind of wealth would she have

472
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,260
to make such a huge human-faced tortoise?

473
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,600
A normal family couldn't afford

474
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,480
a Yangshi Lei designed morgue.

475
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,800
Besides the human-faced tortoise,

476
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,280
there's nothing valuable in here.

477
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,640
Let's go to the next room.

478
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,199
Grandma.

479
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
I didn't know

480
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,040
we had a training ground

481
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,320
underneath the old shop.

482
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,280
Didn't you lure Wu Xie
and the others there

483
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,480
with the Yangshi Lei drawing?

484
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,440
Why should you do this?

485
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,600
Can't we sit down and talk?

486
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,440
You said so yourself.

487
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,560
It's a training ground.

488
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,360
Or to say, an escape room.

489
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,960
How dangerous could it be?

490
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,520
I'm sure they'll make it out alive.

491
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,159
The training ground

492
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,320
is only a preparation facility
for expeditions.

493
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,760
Should they go in there?

494
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,280
They're my friends.

495
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,560
Nothing can happen to them.

496
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,840
If you don't release them,

497
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,960
I'll go by myself.

498
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,000
I'll cripple you if you do.

499
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,000
You can do as you please in other times.

500
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,120
But I have something important
to take care of.

501
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,000
I won't let you disturb me.

502
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm not disturbing you.

503
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,200
You kept a secret from me

504
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,760
and used me.

505
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
It's okay if you don't set them free.

506
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,500
I'll sit here

507
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,640
and never leave...

508
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,760
Stand up!

509
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,120
Is that your seat to take?

510
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,840
I've spoiled you too much.

511
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,800
Go back to your room.

512
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,260
Three.

513
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,160
This one.

514
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,040
The graphics on the

515
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,400
drawing are really exquisite.

516
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,920
Look.

517
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
This is a circle,

518
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,800
which means

519
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,720
it's the front.

520
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,400
This one

521
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:06,680
is half drawn.

522
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,880
It must correspond to this.

523
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,200
No.

524
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,920
This should be oval.

525
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,200
That's right.

526
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
It's oval.

527
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,120
There's an angle to it.

528
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes.

529
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,520
There's an angle.

530
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,120
It's wrong.

531
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,800
That's it.

532
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,360
How was it? Hurry and press the button!

533
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,440
No! Just now I...

534
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,840
What's so secretive?

535
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,240
Madam.

536
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,480
They carved something.

537
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,920
Besides,

538
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,520
we can't get a clear view

539
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,680
of Wu Xie's drawing.

540
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,800
Never mind.

541
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,440
Whether he takes the long way,

542
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,720
or hands it directly to me,

543
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
it makes no difference.

544
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,560
Yes.

545
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,880
In the previous floors,

546
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,560
we've regenerated the floor plan

547
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,960
based on Wu Xie's actions.

548
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,560
I smelt something dangerous.

549
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,600
Seems like

550
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,360
Zhang smelled it too.

551
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,480
A dangerous smell?

552
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,840
Why can't I smell it?

553
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,640
What are you two chit-chatting here for?

554
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,160
Let's move if it's dangerous!

555
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,840
It's not as dangerous

556
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,680
as you think it is.

557
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,520
We live in a world of law.

558
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,600
Besides, Mrs Huo

559
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,880
is my senior.

560
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,840
She won't harm me.

561
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,320
Now that we're here,

562
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,040
we can't leave empty-handed.

563
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
There might be no riddles here,

564
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,280
but the human-faced tortoise

565
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,800
was a hidden message.

566
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,880
Sorry, Professor Wu.

567
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,600
Your grand theories

568
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,080
are way

569
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
over my head.

570
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,670
The human-faced tortoise

571
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,400
in the Imperial Readings of Taiping Era.

572
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,840
Come over.

573
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,280
I'll teach you a lesson

574
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,600
to make you understand.

575
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,040
Say, Professor Wu.

576
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,040
Why can't we learn

577
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,980
outside the maze

578
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,000
properly?

579
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,960
Let's not stay here.

580
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,840
Do you have a pen?

581
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,720
Or anything we can write with.

582
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,760
Yes.

583
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,640
You.

584
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,960
You can do it.

585
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,880
I don't think I can.

586
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,320
I say, Professor Wu.

587
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,920
Stop trying to show off.

588
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,560
You have something

589
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,480
called a bag.

590
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,920
That's right.

591
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,040
It's better to write it down.

592
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,120
Look closely.

593
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,320
Okay.

594
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Fine!

595
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,760
You really think you're a professor?

596
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,320
Come.

597
00:40:50,014 --> 00:41:00,014
