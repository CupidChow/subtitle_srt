00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,720


3
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,430


4
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,280


5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680


6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,000


7
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,950


8
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,920
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

9
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,820
<i>Episode 36</i>

10
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,800
Listen.

11
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,890
A large number of King Shibie

12
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,039
is coming this way.

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,240
Hurry up.

14
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,800
You guys go on.

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,100
I'll deal with them.

16
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,430
Thick chain. One, two, three, four, five.

17
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,350
Thin chain,

18
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,710
3, 7, 9, 14, 20.

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
That's wrong.

20
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,400
Change the order.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,800
Thick chain.

22
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:19,950
One, two, three, five, four.

23
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,079
Thin chain.

24
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,520
3, 7, 9, 14, 20.

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,640
Wrong again.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
One, two, three, five, four.

27
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,050
One, two, three, five, four.

28
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,190
-Is it correct?
-No.

29
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,320
Try the reverse order, Wu Xie.

30
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,760
The reverse order?

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
We did it!

32
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,720
Black, we did it!

33
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,840
That's quick!

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,720
Xiao Hua,

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
mark the rusted chain.

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,240
Okay.

37
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,150
-Time to go!
-Xiao Hua, let's go.

38
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,490
Black-haired monster?

39
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,250
It's fast. Be careful.

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,840
Let's go.

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
Leave now. Seal off the iron plate.

42
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,760
-We can't let it escape.
-What about you?

43
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,120
If we succeed this time,

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,310
it's your turn to owe me 1000 sheep.

45
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,579
Not if you don't come back alive.

46
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,880
But even the King of Hell
wouldn't want to take you in.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,040
I'm a kind person.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,400
Of course I'll come back alive.

49
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,470
Black!

50
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,829
Black!

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,880
Xiao Hua.

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Let's go.

53
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,240
Let's go now!

54
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,600
Are you really going to seal it?

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
If we do so,

56
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,190
Black will be trapped inside.

57
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,450
He said he could get out.

58
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,770
I'm sure he will.

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,430
You take photo.

60
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,310
I'll get help.

61
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,460
Get ready.

62
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,720
We're departing in half an hour.

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Yes, madam.

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,360
Did you get the third picture?

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,520
Grandma,

66
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,480
let me take a look at the photo.

67
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,760
Just one look.

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,430
You're already heading out.

69
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,390
I'm not asking too much, am I?

70
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,780
When did you untie it?

71
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,120
Sheesh.

72
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,720
The rope is made of a special material.

73
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,340
I was tied up for two days.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,520
But,

75
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,450
I untied it an hour ago.

76
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,570
Give it back.

77
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,710
I'm going with you.

78
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,820
No way.

79
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,690
I heard someone saying

80
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,320
that you're going down yourself.

81
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,430
If I can't follow and protect you,

82
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,120
I'll have to burn it.

83
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,150
Fine.

84
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,280
You're a Huo, after all.

85
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,770
I lost.

86
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
Get an outfit

87
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,560
for her to try on.

88
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,090
Send her off.

89
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,490
We leave at once.

90
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
Grandma got me again.

91
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,230
Where's my phone?

92
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,409
<i>Xiu Xiu,</i>

93
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,200
<i>Grandma</i>

94
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,240
<i>if you're reading this letter,</i>

95
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,200
<i>then you've woken up.</i>

96
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,790
<i>That was an imported drug.</i>

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,320
<i>It's said that it can cause
unconsciousness for six hours.</i>

98
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,430
<i>When you are awaken,</i>

99
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,480
<i>we should have already gotten
into Zhang family's Old Pavilion.</i>

100
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,210
<i>Although we had numerous</i>

101
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,170
<i>Old Pavilion's simulation training,</i>

102
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,040
<i>I'm well aware</i>

103
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,200
<i>that this path is extremely dangerous.</i>

104
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,550
<i>I have only one advise.</i>

105
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,110
<i>You're the heir of Huo family.</i>

106
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,560
<i>Take good care of Huo family.</i>

107
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
I can't breathe.

108
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,000
Still, you have to endure it.

109
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,350
We must warm each other up
at this freezing place.

110
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,560
What's wrong with Wu Xie?

111
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,960
I told him to hurry up.

112
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:05,050
Is he really going to
let us freeze to death?

113
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,320
You actually show up

114
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,550
at this critical moment.

115
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,240
Mrs Huo,

116
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,360
what a show you've put on.

117
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,800
Incredible.

118
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,290
Here's the picture.

119
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,740
Did we come back here to take photos

120
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,060
because you want to study them?

121
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,250
The trigger was cleverly designed.

122
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
It's worth studying.

123
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
This is strange.

124
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,480
What is it?

125
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,800
A stone fragment

126
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,140
is stuck in the gap.

127
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,270
This piece didn't come out.

128
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,200
Hurry.

129
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Send a message to Banai.

130
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,160
The third photo was wrong!

131
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,150
Mr Xie.

132
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
Is there anything from Banai?

133
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,760
Someone sent a message,

134
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,490
saying Mrs Huo delivered the photo herself

135
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,440
and is now unreachable.

136
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,600
They've called the police,

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,080
but nothing's found yet.

138
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,600
Get them back no matter what.

139
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,730
Even if we have to
blast away the mountain.

140
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,350
Others look for Shades.

141
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Yes, sir.

142
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,830
Wu Xie.

143
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,400
Pull yourself together.

144
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,570
Banai is Zhang's territory.

145
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,920
He might discover the
details others neglected

146
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,550
and postpone the plan.

147
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,180
But both Zhang and Fatty trust me.

148
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,850
They must think that
nothing could go wrong.

149
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,820
If they hit the triggers,

150
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,450
those who have skills could escape,

151
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,730
but the rest of them couldn't.

152
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,520
I brought this upon them.

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
<i>I'm a man without</i>

154
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,320
<i>past and future.</i>

155
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,440
<i>Had I disappeared,</i>

156
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,030
<i>no one would notice.</i>

157
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,190
<i>The secret about you may be buried deep,</i>

158
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,080
<i>but we'll find out the truth with you.</i>

159
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
<i>My friend's a dead person?</i>

160
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,680
<i>We've gone through a lot together.</i>

161
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,040
<i>And we've been to many places.</i>

162
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
<i>I know better than others</i>

163
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
<i>what kind of person he is.</i>

164
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:44,790
<i>Run!</i>

165
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,510
<i>You can't always rush
to the front, Zhang.</i>

166
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
-<i>Zhang!</i>
-<i>Zhang.</i>

167
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,880
<i>Hang in there.</i>

168
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,320
<i>We're almost there.</i>

169
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,470
<i>I'll notice if you disappear.</i>

170
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,840
<i>Luckily,</i>

171
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,420
<i>I didn't cause your death.</i>

172
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,720
<i>I'm taking you home.</i>

173
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,000
<i>What's your name exactly?</i>

174
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,710
<i>Just call me Mr Black.</i>

175
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,070
<i>I'm worthy of the high price.</i>

176
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,400
<i>Don't worry.</i>

177
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,720
<i>I'll protect you.</i>

178
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,220
<i>Did you do that on purpose?</i>

179
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,280
<i>This was Dog Beating Technique.</i>

180
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,320
<i>Aren't those words a
disgrace to the educated?</i>

181
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,640
<i>You wear it better than me.</i>

182
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:00,970
<i>Of course.</i>

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
<i>Watch out!</i>

184
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,200
<i>Life matters more at times like this.</i>

185
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,920
<i>Looks like</i>

186
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,280
<i>I'd better call you Shades
or Mr Black from now on.</i>

187
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
<i>Did you hit something?</i>

188
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,410
<i>Probably the trigger.</i>

189
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,650
<i>Why didn't you say that just now?</i>

190
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,230
<i>You were sleeping soundly.</i>

191
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,430
<i>I didn't want to wake you up.</i>

192
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,870
<i>Do you hear anything?</i>

193
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,750
-<i>No.</i>
-<i>Come closer, then. Hurry.</i>

194
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
<i>Are you really blind?</i>

195
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,120
<i>If we got out safely,</i>

196
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,560
<i>I'll make a green pepper
and shredded pork fried rice</i>

197
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,240
<i>without green pepper for you.</i>

198
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,430
Master Xiao Jiu.

199
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,090
Huo family's men have been
searching for quite some time,

200
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,520
but none of them returned.

201
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,200
Master Xiao Jiu,

202
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,079
do we continue looking for
Mr Black around the mountain?

203
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,599
Yes.

204
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,599
Yes, sir.

205
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,319
It's been seven days.

206
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,859
But we didn't hear anything from them.

207
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,480
I need to go there.

208
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,069
Wu Xie.

209
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,190
Even Zhang couldn't handle that trigger.

210
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,589
Do you think you could
enter the Old Pavilion?

211
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,990
It's uncertain whether Mrs Huo's alive.

212
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,870
Do you think Xiu Xiu
will give up searching?

213
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,390
Xiu Xiu isn't in control.

214
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,840
We can only wait for things
to turn for the better.

215
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,590
If words go out that something
happened to Mrs Huo,

216
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,870
the rescue operation

217
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,160
may be secretly obstructed,
let alone getting them out.

218
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,180
Wu Xie, you and I too

219
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,470
are ordinary men.

220
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,800
Most of the time, defeating fate

221
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,000
is just a glorious wish.

222
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,000
I know that.

223
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,560
I'm just an ordinary man.

224
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,670
Be it the secret about the Old Pavilion

225
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,190
or the force that's been
guarding it in the dark,

226
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,780
they're not something I can deal with.

227
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,470
Still, I'm going.

228
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,050
I told you, you can't do it alone!

229
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,200
Then I'll get some men
and equipment, okay?

230
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,700
I know you Xies are cautious.

231
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,300
But this time,

232
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,200
don't ever think about stopping me.

233
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,480
Wu Xie!

234
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,160
Fine.

235
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,150
When you're ready,

236
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,520
come to me.

237
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,640
I'll arrive in Changsha
the day after tomorrow.

238
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,360
I need some men to go to Guangxi with me.

239
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,540
Okay, I'll pick you up at the airport.

240
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,760
Master Xiao San.

241
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,680
Pan Zi.

242
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,910
It's been a while.

243
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,830
Long time no see.

244
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,680
Your hair...

245
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm just getting old.

246
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,880
It's inevitable.

247
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,600
Come.

248
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,140
You changed your car?

249
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,400
Sold.

250
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,680
Those diggers were asking to be paid.

251
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,040
I can't have them talk bad
about Master San.

252
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,120
Why didn't you tell me that?

253
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,400
It's okay.

254
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,640
I can get it together.

255
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,610
Let's go.

256
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:27,610
Talk in the car.

257
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,840
How's the preparation going?

258
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
Master San isn't around.

259
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,390
Some elites left Wu family.

260
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,950
What about the men at Uncle San's shops?

261
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,320
Those pricks?

262
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,420
They used to lick Master San's boots.

263
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,640
Now that he's gone,

264
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,320
we don't keep in touch anymore.

265
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,390
Well,

266
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,880
a human heart turned evil

267
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,320
is more disgusting than pests.

268
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,860
You didn't get to see that

269
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,460
because Master San
was protective over you.

270
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,670
No matter what,

271
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,440
let's have a meal with the leaders

272
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,470
and see if they would help.

273
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,640
Come in.

274
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,760
Pan Zi.

275
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,130
You...

276
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,690
Master San and I agreed

277
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,770
to live in a nursing home when we get old.

278
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,950
So, I didn't buy a house.

279
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,980
Why didn't you move to Uncle San's place?

280
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,730
If I did,

281
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,600
it's like announcing to everyone

282
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,180
that he's not coming back for now.

283
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,170
Here.

284
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,200
Have a seat.

285
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,310
I'll call them now.

286
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,340
Wang Ba Qiu.

287
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,590
It's me,

288
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,510
Pan Zi.

289
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,890
Well,

290
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,760
Master Xiao San is back.

291
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,490
He wishes to buy all of you a meal

292
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,950
and talk about our future.

293
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,520
When are you available?

294
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,250
Maybe it's the bad reception.

295
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,260
Wang Ba Qiu.

296
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,820
Don't hang up on me yet.

297
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,580
Listen,

298
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,860
Master Xiao San is back.

299
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,900
He wishes to buy all of you a meal

300
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,240
and talk about our future.

301
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
Sure. No problem.

302
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,490
We'll be there.

303
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,070
Master Xiao San.

304
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,210
You're asking for a favour.

305
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,540
If they're being harsh,

306
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,680
please put up with it.

307
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,960
Uncle Qiu, long time no see.

308
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,350
Wu Xie,

309
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,630
how are you doing?

310
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
Master Xiao San.

311
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,560
Sit here.

312
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,040
Why do you want to see us?

313
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,170
Uncles,

314
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,600
I need a tomb-raiding group in Guangxi.

315
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,290
Are you interested?

316
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,670
Master Xiao San,

317
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,560
are you forming a group of your own?

318
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,120
Yes.

319
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,380
According to the rules,

320
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,780
before you form a group,

321
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,320
you need to give something up.

322
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,650
Otherwise,

323
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,650
we can't be sure whether
you're telling the truth.

324
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,360
Look at you.

325
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
When did Wu family ever trick anybody?

326
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
We may misjudge people sometimes.

327
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,120
Especially in times like this.

328
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,680
Who knows what is true and what is not.

329
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,560
Furthermore,

330
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,720
this is your first time forming a group.

331
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,090
Even if I do you the favour

332
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,160
or lend you a hand,

333
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,440
my underlings

334
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,900
may not agree with me.

335
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,650
Exactly, Master Xiao San.

336
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,200
Life's not been easy for everybody.

337
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,780
To have these men work for us,

338
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,780
we need money.

339
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,560
During Chinese New Year,

340
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,510
you got an advance pay for one year

341
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,590
from Master San, didn't you?

342
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,200
That was Master San's money.

343
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,040
Is Master Xiao San his son?

344
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,230
Wang Ba Qiu,

345
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,000
you're not treating Master San fairly.

346
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,600
We have to be reasonable.

347
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,040
Pan Zi.

348
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,120
Don't be a busybody.

349
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,840
Alright.

350
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Qiu,

351
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,260
you know Pan Zi.

352
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,510
Don't say that.

353
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,110
Let's forget it

354
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,430
and talk business with Master Xiao San.

355
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,350
Master Xiao San,

356
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,200
we're sitting here,

357
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,560
calling you "master".

358
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,910
That's enough respect for Master San.

359
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,360
If you really want to make it happen,

360
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,050
easy.

361
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,160
Master San's house

362
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,440
and Wushanju's shops in Hangzhou...

363
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,650
Let us keep the house deeds

364
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,800
and you'll get our help.

365
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,620
If we can get things done,

366
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,960
that's good news for all.

367
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,880
If we can't,

368
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,460
consider yourself unlucky.

369
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,530
I...

370
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,880
Wang Ba Qiu.

371
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
So, you're coveting Master San's shops?

372
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
Listen up.

373
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,260
I'm alone and poor,

374
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
but over my dead body

375
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,760
will you get to
steal Master San's business.

376
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,920
Is that it?

377
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,520
You trying to be a hero here?

378
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,290
Wang Ba Qiu!

379
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,190
Let's talk peacefully.

380
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,700
For Uncle San's sake, at least.

381
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,120
Master Xiao San's smart
enough to ride the tide.

382
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,880
He's smarter than you!

383
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,720
Look at the circumstances, won't you?

384
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm going to kill you anyway.

385
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,960
Old thing,

386
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,530
die along with Wu San Xing's wealth.

387
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,570
Wang Ba Qiu.

388
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,600
Don't you dare go this far.

389
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,370
Master Xiao San.

390
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,080
Darn you!

391
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,800
I'll spread the word tomorrow

392
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,230
to make sure you won't gather a group.

393
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm sorry, Master Xiao San.

394
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,570
Wushanju's business

395
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,540
has always been the worst in the family.

396
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,870
In order to pay less to the family,

397
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,150
I even cook the books for a few times.

398
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,780
But Uncle San never told me

399
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,040
that his men are out of control.

400
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,470
Master San kept saying that

401
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,920
he did this for your sake.

402
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,960
Where is he now?

403
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
Let me make a call.

404
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,680
<i>Hi,</i>

405
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,950
<i>the number you have
dialled is turned off.</i>

406
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,740
How about this?

407
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,160
Let's wait for another day.

408
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,640
I'll visit the shops tomorrow.

409
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,230
I'll go with you.

410
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,600
No way.

411
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,890
You showing up there

412
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,350
is like telling everyone that
Wu family has collapsed.

413
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,320
Master Xiao San.

414
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,040
These are all your favourite.

415
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,470
Braised pork.

416
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,950
Scrambled egg with green chilli pepper.

417
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,910
Come on.

418
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,820
What happened?

419
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,110
Nothing.

420
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,600
I ran into Wang Ba Qiu's men
at one of the shops.

421
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,880
We had a fight.

422
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,980
I'm fine.

423
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:53,560
Master Xiao San.

424
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,880
I have decided.

425
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,880
If nothing works,
the two of us can go alone.

426
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:58,250
The fewer people, the easier.

427
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,200
No.

428
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,950
If you go,

429
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,040
it is over for Uncle San's shops.

430
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,750
Then perhaps we can ask Master Er to help.

431
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,380
Okay.

432
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,200
I'll ask him.

433
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,400
Pan Zi.

434
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,970
We have no more soda.

435
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,920
Can you buy some?

436
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,100
Sure.

437
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,590
Right away.

438
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,840
<i>Pan Zi.</i>

439
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,470
<i>I got in touch with Uncle Er.</i>

440
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,140
<i>He agreed to help.</i>

441
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,840
<i>I need to return to Hangzhou at once.</i>

442
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,190
<i>Pan Zi.</i>

443
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,580
<i>You are Uncle San's long-time follower.</i>

444
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,060
<i>And you've been calling
me "master" for nothing.</i>

445
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:10,910
<i>All this while,</i>

446
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
<i>the things we've been doing</i>

447
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,830
-<i>are too dangerous.</i>
-<i>Master Xiao San!</i>

448
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,350
<i>The wounds on your body are adding up</i>

449
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,310
<i>without proper recuperation.</i>

450
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,040
<i>Don't worry, Master Xiao San.</i>

451
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,330
<i>I'm not one that will die easily.</i>

452
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,960
<i>You're safe with me.</i>

453
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,950
<i>I won't give up on finding out
the truth behind these mysteries</i>

454
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,280
<i>to protect the people around me.</i>

455
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,360
<i>Pan Zi.</i>

456
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,640
<i>This is the end of you task.</i>

457
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,650
<i>If I drag you into this,</i>

458
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:46,970
<i>I'd let Uncle San down.</i>

459
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,000
<i>Take care.</i>

460
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,670
<i>All the best.</i>

461
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,650
<i>Wu Xie.</i>

462
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,630
I've been waiting for days.

463
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,960
What took you so long?

464
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,240
Why are you here?

465
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Let's talk inside.

466
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,080
You dropped something.

467
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,620
<i>The 1000 sheep up ahead are enjoying the
sounds of my whips like they're drum roll</i>

468
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,930
"The 1000 sheep up ahead"

469
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
"are enjoying the sounds of
my whips like they're drum roll."

470
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,750
Su Shi's poem?

471
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,570
But it's wrong.

472
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,920
It should be 100 sheep.

473
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,520
Thanks.

474
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,560
I heard things weren't smooth in Changsha.

475
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,800
Things have changed.

476
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,760
Wu San Xing is ruthless.

477
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,830
After trying every means to involve you,

478
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,520
he went missing again.

479
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,800
He's probably trying to
sneak away for a second time

480
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,080
to escape from It.

481
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,909
As long as either Wu San Xing
or Xie Lian Huan stays alive,

482
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,090
there will always be an "Uncle San"

483
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:20,060
trapped in this matter.

484
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,610
You're also his pawn to escape.

485
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Wu Xie.

486
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,560
Keep this in mind.

487
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,320
The fate of Wu family or even Mystic Nine

488
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,560
lies in your hand.

489
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,600
Xiao Hua,

490
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,360
you told me this, didn't you?

491
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,800
I'm just an ordinary man.

492
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,159
I do some digging,

493
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,010
and they're able to
piece together my whole plan.

494
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,460
It is hiding in the dark,

495
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,020
while I'm an easy target out there.

496
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,260
There's nothing I can do.

497
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,679
You can be more than Wu Xie

498
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,909
if you wish.

499
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,740
What do you mean?

500
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,580
I made this for you.

501
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,520
A human skin mask?

502
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,660
When did you make it?

503
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,950
After Wu San Xing died.

504
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,020
He's not dead.

505
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,560
Neither did he ever show up again.

506
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,200
It's no different from dying.

507
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,090
Wu San Xing is cunning.

508
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,440
One day,

509
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,880
he might return on his own.

510
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,250
Wu Xie.

511
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,170
You want to go to Banai, don't you?

512
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,240
I can provide manpower, materials and even

513
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,200
financial support.

514
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,290
Uncle San is missing.

515
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,810
We don't know if Mrs Huo is alive.

516
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,670
It has got the first and second
generations of Mystic Nine.

517
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
Me alone

518
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,360
can't escape It.

519
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,560
That's why I came up with this plan.

520
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,480
A plan that may get away from It.

521
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Could Uncle San

522
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,260
have planned about this too?

523
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,760
I have been thinking

524
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,380
what plan did Wu San Xing make.

525
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,360
And I only got these three ideas so far.

526
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,400
First,

527
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,970
through this journey
and clues he provided,

528
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,100
Wu San Xing wanted to

529
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,120
hand over his plan to you,

530
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,760
and make you the next successor.

531
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,980
Second,

532
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,800
he's slowly passing on to you

533
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,300
his way of thinking

534
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,250
so that you will know
and understand about It,

535
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,740
and will be able to fight It.

536
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,180
Third,

537
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,310
he wanted you to become Wu San Xing,

538
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
the person who executes the plan

539
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,920
and distracts It again.

540
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
It...

541
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
It...

542
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,400
Chen Wen Jin said...

543
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,510
<i>The team was being watched.</i>

544
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Uncle Er said...

545
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,150
<i>In the process,</i>

546
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,110
<i>they must've found some clues.</i>

547
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,340
<i>These clues form a thought.</i>

548
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,140
Even what Xie Lian Huan said...

549
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,880
It's all because of It

550
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,200
that we end up like this!

551
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,280
It is controlling the
members of Mystic Nine

552
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,520
<i>and has been in pursuit of immortality.</i>

553
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,560
<i>I think the Mystic Nine</i>

554
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,440
<i>was reluctant to accept this.</i>

555
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,780
<i>Some members tried to go against It.</i>

556
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
And Wu San Xing

557
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,720
was one of them.

558
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,080
I got you now.

559
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,390
<i>Paracel Islands
Archaeological Team, 1985</i>

560
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,640
<i>They were wrong,
Chen Wen Jin and the others.</i>

561
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,880
<i>It is not someone</i>

562
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,720
<i>or some organization.</i>

563
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,740
<i>Golden Horse WED13</i>

564
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,400
<i>It is the combination</i>

565
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,760
<i>of all those who want
immortality since the ancient times.</i>

566
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,560
<i>Be it the old
archaeological team in Banai</i>

567
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,530
<i>or our expedition team who went west.</i>

568
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,880
<i>It</i>

569
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,920
<i>is probably a team member</i>

570
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,830
<i>who was affected by his desire.</i>

571
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,210
<i>This is mental bewitchment
that you mentioned.</i>

572
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,810
<i>That's why it knew everything</i>

573
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,920
<i>China Mail, Wu Xie</i>

574
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,480
<i>and is everywhere.</i>

575
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,510
<i>The so-called Ultimate
isn't something real.</i>

576
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,400
<i>It may just be a story.</i>

577
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,600
<i>Because of this story,</i>

578
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,160
<i>many people set out on
an adventure to look for it.</i>

579
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,050
<i>Chen Wen Jin.</i>

580
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,070
<i>Zhang.</i>

581
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,620
<i>You and me.</i>

582
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,770
<i>We might be witnesses to the story.</i>

583
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,400
But I lost Zhang.

584
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,880
Uncle San's existence

585
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,360
seems surreal now.

586
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,780
He can only hide behind
things that have happened.

587
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:39,850
I can feel him,

588
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,470
but I can never see him clearly.

589
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:46,490
Maybe

590
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,770
he's just an identity.

591
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,400
A guide.

592
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,880
A person who got me into this.

593
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,070
All of you call me the Chosen One,

594
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,520
but I've never believed in that.

595
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,970
A replacement must be prepared.

596
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,550
Since young,
I learned to write Shou Jin font.

597
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,120
I listened

598
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,480
to the mysterious stories my grandpa told,

599
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:22,970
and I explored many places with Uncle San.

600
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,960
Everything I did growing up
was planned out.

601
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,810
I was chosen,

602
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,480
trained,

603
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,650
and made the Chosen One,

604
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,870
maybe only to become a replacement

605
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,950
or

606
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,680
one of the replacements.

607
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,040
After all, there was only
one person in the tape.

608
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,050
He looked like me,

609
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,550
but he was older,

610
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
and was involved in
this earlier than I did.

611
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,960
So,

612
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,800
replacement is another
form of immortality.

613
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,180
The immortality of an identity.

614
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,170
Wu Xie,

615
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,650
you have no choice.

616
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,560
As you're the Chosen One.

617
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,070
Maybe

618
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,150
with a thorough plan

619
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,320
which is made meticulously,

620
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,960
what is fake may become real.

621
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,040
And I can become that person.

622
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,600
Do you want to continue investigating?

623
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Yes.

624
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,840
If I'm born to take this responsibility,

625
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,200
I'd like to see what there is

626
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:41,830
behind it.

627
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,040
<i>Don't worry.</i>

628
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,160
<i>I'm Master San of Wu family.</i>

629
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,240
Done.

630
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,080
Master San.

631
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,240
How long can it last?

632
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,430
Four weeks at most.

633
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,670
When one wears a mask for too long,

634
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:16,290
it's impossible to take it off.

635
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,800
<i>The truth-seeking journey still goes on.</i>

636
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,910
<i>Xiao Hua was right.</i>

637
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,720
<i>The secret to immortality</i>

638
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,920
<i>In Banai, 1976</i>

00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,470
<i>and the secrets of Zhang Qi Ling</i>

640

<i>as well as Mystic Nine,</i>

641
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,760
<i>they're inside
Zhang family's Old Pavilion.</i>

642
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,040
<i>Due to my mistake,</i>

643
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,060

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,480
<i>while Uncle San and

647

<i>Xin Yue Restaurant</i>

648
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,840
<i>I have never felt this
lonely and helpless.</i>

649
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,760
<i>But I cannot stop.</i>

650
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,070
<i>For the sake of those</i>

651
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,400
<i>who were involved</i>

652
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,580
<i>and are still involving,</i>

653
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:53,740
<i>whether in the past or present,</i>

654
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,270
<i>either they're dead</i>

655
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:56,790
<i>or alive.</i>

656
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,230
<i>Once again, I will embark

<i>This time, I will bring them home.</i>

658
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:15,144
