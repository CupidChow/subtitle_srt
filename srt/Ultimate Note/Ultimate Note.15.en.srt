1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,720
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,780
<i>Episode 15</i>

4
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,759
This Shibie Pill was made by
the Heavenly Queen Mother.

5
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,370
And then she fed the pill to these people

6
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,500
to test its efficacy.

7
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:08,930
This...

8
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,110
I've seen this at Golmud Sanatorium.

9
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,550
Chen Wen Jin said it before.

10
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,790
That Huo Ling

11
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,840
can not be considered human as of yet.

12
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,180
Looks like

13
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,940
this has to be Huo Ling.

14
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,990
Seems very likely that Chen Wen Jin
had been taken advantage of,

15
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,950
to experiment on Law of Longevity.

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,120
Perhaps Master San found out

17
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,829
and so

18
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,730
he faked her death

19
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,550
and is investigating in secret
as the Invisible Man.

20
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,079
The fact that he and Xie Lian Huan
are at odds today

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,400
is inevitable.

22
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,480
Did you build this underground palace?

23
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,780
This hole doesn't seem like
it was made for humans.

24
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,930
We have to crawl our way out.

25
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Enough talk.

26
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,530
So long as we can get out.

27
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,120
We have no idea what's ahead.

28
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,270
Stay alert.

29
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,400
Let's go.

30
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,840
Look at how this person is dressed.

31
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,300
It's exactly the same as the guy

32
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,960
in the painting at the fake palace.

33
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,180
It is most likely Emperor Mu of Zhou.

34
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,900
He was at the fake palace,

35
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,050
as well as the real palace.

36
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,100
What do you think Emperor Mu

37
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,000
did to the Heavenly Queen Mother

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,280
that she is favouring him so much?

39
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,680
Love.

40
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,910
Love?

41
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,230
In the legend,

42
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,830
Heavenly Queen Mother did indeed
meet with Emperor Mu.

43
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,640
But how likely

44
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,490
do you think the story is true?

45
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,310
The truth is before our eyes.

46
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,230
Heavenly Queen Mother
is certainly ruthless though.

47
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,300
Look at her longful expression.

48
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,750
I think

49
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,680
she fell in love for real.

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,160
If Heavenly Queen Mother did fall in love
with Emperor Mu,

51
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,870
it is probable that

52
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,790
she told him about her secret
to longevity.

53
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,480
Do you remember the painting
in the fake palace

54
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:36,000
where Heavenly Queen Mother
looked forlorn.

55
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,780
She was most probably
waiting to reunite with Emperor Mu.

56
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,320
Eight horses travel 30,000 miles a day.

57
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,560
Why did Emperor Mu

58
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,120
not return?

59
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,480
Unfortunately,

60
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
he never did go back.

61
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,350
Forget about the legend.

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,040
This is what's important right now.

63
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,200
Did you think of something?

64
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,720
Nothing.

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,260
Looks like this

66
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,220
is Heavenly Queen Mother's
ultimate secret.

67
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Which is what I'm after.

68
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,190
I bet Wu Xie and Chen Wen Jin
are also after the same thing.

69
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,960
But what is it?

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,160
Come on.

71
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,920
Let's go and find Wu Xie and the rest.

72
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
Finally I'm able to stretch my limbs.

73
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,980
What's in the water?

74
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,600
No need to make a fuss.

75
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,850
Tell you what.

76
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,120
This is a lifesaver when
you're in a pickle.

77
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,070
High in protein,

78
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,010
tastes like chicken,

79
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,010
very crunchy.

80
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Let it go.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
Stop torturing it.

82
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,810
If the shrimp is a special breed,

83
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,330
it'd be a waste to kill it.

84
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,990
Look at how many there are.

85
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,510
There's at least 800 if not 1000.

86
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,250
Catching a few won't be a problem.

87
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,670
What the heck.

88
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,080
Why is it this stupid thing again.

89
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,760
It's a symbol of bad luck.

90
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,159
The Birdman statue means

91
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
we must not be far away from the centre
of the palace.

92
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,210
Be careful, guys.

93
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,110
Twelve zodiacs?

94
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,490
This is a man's head.

95
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,000
A woman's head.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,920
Woman's upper and lower body.

97
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,710
Man's upper and lower body.

98
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Is this a puzzle?

99
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,290
The tiles with the two heads...

100
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,640
Can they move?

101
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,570
It's going to need some time.

102
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,770
The Queen Mother doesn't let
anything slide.

103
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
She's super cautious.

104
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,330
Let's divide and conquer, Master Hua'er.

105
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,920
I'll take care of the jade soldiers.

106
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,800
You solve the puzzle.

107
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
Easy.

108
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,830
These soldiers do not break.

109
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,880
Killing the snakes inside
might do the trick.

110
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,260
This is not right.

111
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,559
I'm not very familiar with ancient attire,

112
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,480
but I can differentiate
between man and woman.

113
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,320
Can you hurry up?

114
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,730
I'm trying to find inspiration here.

115
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,690
Thinking requires quiet concentration.

116
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Slow and steady.

117
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,830
Behind you.

118
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,730
Heavenly Queen Mother found the way
for human and animal symbiosis.

119
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
It's an incredible feat.

120
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,030
She must have

121
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,170
Maybe the way to open the door

122
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,720
is to assemble the tiles
to portray human-animal symbiosis.

123
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,900
So these tiles

124
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,880
must be a decoy.

125
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,200
Are you here for a tour?

126
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,340
Young man,

127
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,090
have more patience.

128
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,150
I know what to do now.

129
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,910
Then pick up the pace, will you?

130
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,610
But the problem is what to slot
into these holes?

131
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Try these.

132
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,050
Master Hua'er.

133
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,260
Can't you hold one for me?

134
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,720
I'm here to do just that, aren't I?

135
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,790
The woman has

136
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,430
a human upper and snake body.

137
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,210
As for the man...

138
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,320
A human upper and scorpion body.

139
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,040
The dragon totem was a result
from the evolution of this being.

140
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,140
This gross bug

141
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,710
is the original form of a dragon?

142
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,480
If you've been to the Cloud Top Palace,

143
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,150
you'll see that humans and scorpions
can co-exist in harmony.

144
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,110
You've been there?

145
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,680
I heard stories.

146
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,820
These containers weigh differently.

147
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
I think the door works
with a weight mechanism.

148
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,040
Come.

149
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,270
Come on, don't just stand there.

150
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,710
Did you think of something?

151
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,910
We've come this far.

152
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,460
You still can't remember anything?

153
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,240
Listen, Zhang.

154
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,700
If you can't remember a thing,

155
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,480
why did you leave such ambiguous clues?

156
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,750
Next time,

157
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,860
make sure you leave signs
that we can understand.

158
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,060
It's okay.

159
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,730
Finding a sign means
we're on the right path.

160
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,770
The Birdman statue we saw

161
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,160
could very well be a warning to outsiders.

162
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,660
We don't know what's ahead.

163
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,650
I'll go check it out.

164
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,850
I'll go, too.

165
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,600
I'll go with you two.

166
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,390
We should all go.

167
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,440
It wasn't easy getting here.

168
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,120
How much treasures do you think
the Queen Mother hid in here?

169
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,550
Besides,

170
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,240
us brothers should experience
the thrill together.

171
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,500
This journey

172
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,960
has taken a lot from us.

173
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,650
Don't forget about Ah Ning.

174
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,800
Pan Zi, too, is badly injured.

175
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,920
And my Uncle...

176
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,850
That's right.

177
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,340
Let's go.

178
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,870
Go.

179
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,070
This pond

180
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,420
should be the main water supply storage
for the palace.

181
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,240
You guys, go and light the lamps.

182
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,410
Okay.

183
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,840
What is this?

184
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,430
Clay pot fragments.

185
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,240
There are motifs on them.

186
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,230
It looks similar to those found at
the shipwreck in Devil City.

187
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,740
These things cut.

188
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,010
Be careful.

189
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,770
There are so many fragments.

190
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,130
Offerings?

191
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,060
Scared by clay fragments.

192
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,590
That's something new.

193
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,890
It's unbelievable to me, too.

194
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,640
Wu Xie.

195
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,890
Why does this thing seem
to be getting brighter?

196
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,520
You're right.

197
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,000
It's turning reddish.

198
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,240
Let's go take a look.

199
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,620
There's something in the water.

200
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,680
The worms are sucking our blood.

201
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,480
That's why it's turning red.

202
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,390
We've been transfusing it with our blood.

203
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,800
Quick! Cut the worms!

204
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,840
There are too many!
We can't kill them all.

205
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,480
Get onto dry land.

206
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,920
Danger!

207
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,960
The worms have been sucking our blood,

208
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,830
increasing in weight.

209
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,450
It pushed the coffin down
and triggered the trap.

210
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,100
Wu Xie, look up there.

211
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,510
The human face is surrounded by
rings of traps.

212
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,080
Only one ring was triggered.

213
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,010
If all of them open up,

214
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,330
we won't know what's coming for us.

215
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,360
No time to worry.

216
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,650
We have to help Zhang.

217
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
No, this isn't working.

218
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,430
Killing the worms releases the blood.

219
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,480
They suck it up again
once it flows into the pool.

220
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,880
Get on it!

221
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,160
Tiger keelback!

222
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
-Cut the worms. I'll handle the snake.
-Okay.

223
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,530
Master Fatty, help me!

224
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,329
Can't you see I'm busy here?

225
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,800
Guys.

226
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,800
Victory is before us!

227
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,240
There aren't many worms left,

228
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
not enough to trigger the mechanism.

229
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,280
-Get on the ledge.
-Go!

230
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,200
An earthquake?

231
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,490
I don't think so.

232
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,970
The tiger keelback seemed
spooked by something.

233
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,840
There's something more powerful here?

234
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,320
Never mind that.
We need to get on dry land.

235
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,540
The water is swarming with worms.

236
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,420
Aunt Wen Jin!

237
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,570
Hurry!

238
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,320
Could this be...

239
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,400
The only one qualified
to sit at the throne.

240
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm guessing

241
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,690
it is Heavenly Queen Mother herself.

242
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,520
The Queen Mother knew a thing or two
about health maintenance.

243
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,720
What kind of techniques did she employ

244
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,440
for her to be able to sit here,
still in one piece after centuries.

245
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,640
No.

246
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,440
This isn't the Queen Mother.

247
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,720
Her complexion looks odd.

248
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
Like she's wearing a mask.

249
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,820
His face seemed to have worn a mask, too.

250
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,080
But it has fallen off.

251
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,700
The mask seems to be

252
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,740
able to change a person's face.

253
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,970
As well as work as perservative.

254
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,500
Master Fatty,

255
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,610
the Queen Mother made a fake of herself

256
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,060
and placed it here.

257
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,540
Where did she go though?

258
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,200
You asking me? Who should I ask then?

259
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,680
The likely explanation

260
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,620
would be that she didn't want
anyone to know

261
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,540
she had left.

262
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,590
The Queen Mother got herself
a replacement.

263
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,170
She must have gone to another place.

264
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,690
So I haven't seen any good treasures
along the way.

265
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,010
That's because there are all
on this old woman.

266
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,140
Go on, touch it.

267
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,420
I'm sure it isn't poisonous.

268
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
A message.

269
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
A message from who to whom?

270
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,520
A message Xuan Nv left for Queen Mother.

271
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,700
The person in the coffin on the pool

272
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,490
is most likely Xuan Nv.

273
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,960
Look at that face.

274
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,480
It is most probably Xuan Nv.

275
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,290
When we were underneath it,

276
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,770
that face looked so scary.

277
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,070
Now, looking at it from the platform,

278
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,040
the face is actually smiling docilely.

279
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,210
So Xuan Nv saved her sweet side

280
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,370
for Heavenly Queen Mother.

281
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,320
Who is this Xuan Nv?

282
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,450
According to legend, she is the one
who protects the Queen Mother.

283
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,480
<i>She is not only a special envoy,</i>

284
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,970
<i>she is also a great general.</i>

285
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,840
<i>She is well-versed with military affairs
and strategies.</i>

286
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,040
<i>To put it simply,
she is the head of security.</i>

287
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,050
Master Fatty,

288
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,070
what's written on the stone tablet then?

289
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,790
There is no end to your questions, huh?

290
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,960
It is most likely a goodbye letter

291
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,040
Xuan Nv wrote to the Queen Mother.

292
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
Xuan Nv knew her time was ending.

293
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,810
She worried that after her death,

294
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,840
no one would be able to protect
the Queen Mother's territory.

295
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,030
So she made her tomb into a trap,

296
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,450
to protect the Queen Mother
even after her death.

297
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,680
Xuan Nv is one loyal subject.

298
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,620
This is a trap.

299
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,880
Why is it placed here?

300
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,300
If the Queen Mother stands up,

301
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,320
it will trigger the trap.

302
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,430
The trap might not be lethal.

303
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,100
I don't think Xuan Nv would harm
Queen Mother.

304
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,980
Queen Mother wouldn't put herself
in danger either.

305
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,560
Stand up.

306
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,350
Xuan Nv's coffin.

307
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
Impressive.

308
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,130
The worms all disappeared.

309
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,850
So once the mechanism is triggered,

310
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,640
the blood-sucking worms
would disappear.

311
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,550
That's great.

312
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,920
We're safe.

313
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,350
Looks like Xuan Nv wanted to ensure
that Queen Mother

314
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,070
could safely cross the pool.

315
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,670
Is this person really dead?

316
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,980
If she is dead,

317
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,420
what's the purpose of this mechanism?

318
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,980
If she isn't dead...

319
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,250
Didn't the Queen Mother try to find
the elixir of immortality?

320
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,530
Could it be...

321
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I knew it.

322
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,320
This is a fake after all.

323
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,800
Take it.

324
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,800
What is it?

325
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,600
Something that can save you.

326
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,220
What's that smell?

327
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,480
These aren't what I'm looking for.

328
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,260
Aunt Wen Jin.

329
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,130
What is it you're looking for?

330
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,060
I can't say for sure what it is.

331
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,110
But it is definitely not the throne.

332
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,600
There's no time.

333
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,960
I have no time.

334
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,910
Aunt Wen Jin.

335
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,960
What are you really looking for?

336
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
This is the Queen Mother's
ultimate secret.

337
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,480
This is my end goal.

338
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,120
Your end goal

339
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,740
is the Queen Mother's stone ceiling?

340
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,820
This isn't any normal stone.

341
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,300
It's a space stone.

342
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,580
Space stone?

343
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,470
Isn't this aerolite?

344
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,440
My goodness.

345
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,210
The scale!

346
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,480
Imagine it.

347
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,440
Such a humongous stone
fell from the sky.

348
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,780
Wham!

349
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,250
This basin could very well
have been created by it.

350
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,180
This isn't any space stone.

351
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,770
It's a jade meteorite.

352
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,070
Jade meteorite?

353
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,500
You mean it's made out of jade?

354
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,200
It's just called that.

355
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,760
Even if it was jade,

356
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
you wouldn't be able to move it.

357
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,570
Nice.

358
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,060
I've read a bit in historical books

359
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,020
about records of jade meteorite.

360
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,750
I never thought they'd be such a big piece

361
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,990
in Heavenly Queen Mother's Palace.

362
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,360
The thing I'm looking for

363
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,160
must be inside the jade meteorite.

364
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,030
You want to go inside?

365
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,580
Yes.

366
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,710
Wait.

367
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,400
Hook yourself onto this rope.

368
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,000
Make sure to notify us if anything.

369
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
Aunt Wen Jin.

370
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,410
Please be careful.

371
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,330
Save your worries.

372
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,010
With her skills,

373
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,470
one Chen Wen Jin equals two of you.

374
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,740
Oh no!

375
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,250
She didn't use the rope.

376
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,300
Aunt Wen Jin!

377
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,360
The rope!

378
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,020
-Zhang!
-Zhang!

379
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,560
Zhang!

380
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,320
Fatty, crouch down.

381
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,240
What do you take me for?

382
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,560
Zhang.

383
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,870
Zhang!

384
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,520
Again.

385
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,240
Why is it so slippery?

386
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,720
No, it's too slippery.

387
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,760
I can't get up there.

388
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,790
What are you looking at?

389
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,480
With that size,

390
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,850
you guys could go through.

391
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,130
Me? I'd be stuck in there.

392
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,920
If you two can't do it,

393
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
I...

394
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,480
There's no way I can.

395
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,710
We never expected you to do it.

396
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
Good-for-nothing.

397
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,430
Master Hua'er, Mr Black.

398
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,700
What are you two doing here?

399
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,150
Where did you two come from?

400
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,720
Finally, we found you.

401
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,200
We took a different route just now.

402
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,250
The tunnel led us straight to
the water storage pool.

403
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,170
It was filled with dead tiger keelbacks.

404
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,420
So I thought

405
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,600
you guys must have gone through
a tough fight.

406
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,220
Why is it just you and Wu Xie?

407
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,200
Where are the others?

408
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,350
They went inside the jade meteorite.

409
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,880
The ball on the wall mural is this?

410
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,480
This is the jade meteorite?

411
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,970
You know it?

412
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,830
Not really.

413
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,140
I heard some stories
from other adventurers.

414
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,550
I didn't think it really existed.

415
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,960
And found at Queen Mother's, no less.

416
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:10,090
Do you know what's in it?

417
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,190
That I have no idea.

418
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,430
Anyway,

419
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,300
I wouldn't dare go in.

420
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,200
According to the murals we've seen,

421
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,800
Queen Mother went inside.

422
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,670
Queen Mother went inside?

423
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,080
That's why she placed
a replacement out there.

424
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,230
Why did she go inside herself?

425
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,530
To be immortal.

426
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,390
If Queen Mother herself went inside,

427
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,640
does that mean

428
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,770
it isn't as dangerous as we thought?

429
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,180
It's probably not.

430
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,760
Plus, for Chen Wen Jin,

431
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,920
it's probably a good thing.

432
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,870
You said Chen Wen Jin
is running out of time, right?

433
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,270
But she made it in time.

434
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,310
Yes.

435
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,000
Aunt Wen Jin did say that

436
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,010
this is her end goal.

437
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
She rushed here

438
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,210
just to enter the jade meteorite.

439
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,070
It's likely that the meteorite

440
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,360
can help stop her body from deteriorating.

441
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,270
From what we know so far,

442
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,460
there's a kind of medication
called Shibie Pill

443
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,930
that can change the body.

444
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
Aunt Wen Jin mentioned it before.

445
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,590
When she fell into a coma
in the Paracel Islands,

446
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,200
she was taken to Golmund Sanatorium.

447
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,370
From that point on,

448
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,000
her body started mutating.

449
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,860
It is very possible that she was fed
the Shibie Pill

450
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,560
during that time.

451
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,840
That's possible.

452
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
Wait a minute.

453
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,870
Zhang had been to Paracel Islands, too.

454
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,500
He hasn't aged either.

455
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
Are you saying that

456
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,170
Zhang was fed the Shibie Pill, too?

457
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,410
That's why he went in?

458
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,800
That Mute Zhang?

459
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,720
No way.

460
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,350
Shibie Pill is so valuable.

461
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,760
Why would they waste it on him?

462
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,070
Wait.

463
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,750
So what happens to Zhang when inside?

464
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,580
Will he and Aunt Wen Jin come back out?

465
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,800
Chen Wen Jin probably won't come back.

466
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,040
As for Zhang...

467
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
He'll most likely come back.

468
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,010
Can I trust what you just said?

469
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,890
Fine then.

470
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,570
I'll wait for him here.

471
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,000
Since we've come this far,

472
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,250
I'm going to check it out, too.

473
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,530
I know you're capable,

474
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,270
but I advice you not to go in.

475
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,110
What's so scary about it?

476
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,980
The unknown is always scary.

477
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,550
You're not Mute Zhang.

478
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Forget it.

479
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,590
I don't think this place

480
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,470
can give me the final answer anyway.

481
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,480
That means this journey had been a waste.

482
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,180
A journey is never wasted.

483
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,640
Master Hua.

484
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,910
Mr Black.

485
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,100
We should go.

486
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,720
I lost so much.

487
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,210
All my men are gone

488
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,480
and I haven't gotten any return.

489
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,750
Oh, right.

490
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,870
There was a nice outfit just now.

491
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,630
It should be valuable.

492
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:04,850
Listen.

493
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,200
Go retrieve it.

494
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,780
I don't dare to, Mr Black.

495
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,720
I just want to go home.

496
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,970
Then what are you complaining?

497
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,020
Wu Xie.

498
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,970
Are you really going to wait for Zhang?

499
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,030
Back at Cloud Top Palace,

500
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,880
I failed to see him return.

501
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,770
This time,

502
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,150
I'm staying here until he comes back.

503
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,090
I still have many questions for him.

504
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,840
That mute

505
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,200
does have a lot of secrets.

506
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,730
If you're able to find out more
about his secrets,

507
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,230
you'll most likely get answers
to many of your questions.

508
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,520
But,

509
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,660
I'm guessing he himself is not sure
of things.

510
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,120
We'll head back then.

511
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,320
Wu San Xing is injured out there.

512
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,620
There is only one guy with him.

513
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,060
You guys go.

514
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,960
Look after Xie Lian Huan.

515
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,290
Mop.

516
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,660
Give them the supplies.

517
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Mr Black.

518
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,610
Are we not giving them any food?

519
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,800
We are.

520
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,220
Yours.

521
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,600
We left you with the supplies.

522
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,270
Make sure to leave
when you get through half.

523
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,410
Don't starve to death.

524
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,710
So the second message left
on the Yellow Silk

525
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,480
points to Queen Mother's secret.

526
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:00,960
which is the jade meteorite.

527
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,250
Consume the Shibie Pill

528
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,650
and then enter the meteorite.

529
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,360
That's the secret
to Queen Mother's immortality.

530
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,800
Immortality.

531
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,429
What a joke.

532
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,179
Who in this world can live forever?

533
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,429
Has anyone ever seen an immortal?

534
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,889
Young man.

535
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,679
You shouldn't make conclusions
of what you don't yet know.

536
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,520
Even if you saw one,

537
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,510
you might not know that
they are actually immortal.

538
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:30,080
After all, you're just a mortal.

539
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,179
I don't care if immortality
is real or not.

540
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,719
Either way, I don't want to think
that generations of Mystic Nine

541
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,090
had been chasing after
such a meaningless thing.

542
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,989
Besides, you told me this.

543
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,480
I managed to find Queen Mother's Palace
in such a short time.

544
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,080
If it's really like you said,

545
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,410
Mystic Nine with its long history

546
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,800
and abundance of talent,

547
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,730
immortality would've been reached
long ago.

548
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,750
So many lives wouldn't have been lost.

549
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,320
Judging from your words,

550
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
you still seem somewhat upset.

551
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,320
This is Chen Wen Jin's end goal,

552
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,160
but it's definitely not mine.

553
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,600
When I get back,

554
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,840
I'll continue to investigate.

555
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,850
Following these signs we made,

556
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,280
Wu Xie can avoid needless detours.

557
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,380
Don't worry.

558
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,480
Master Xiao San is born lucky.

559
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,560
Let's go.

560
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
Wu Xie.

561
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,800
How about we play a game?

562
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,130
What game?

563
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,070
Tunnel...

564
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
We're one short.

565
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,300
If only Master Hua'er
and Shades didn't leave.

566
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,270
They could've kept us company.

567
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,030
We could even play mahjong.

568
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,030
That's right.

569
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Is this another earthquake?

570
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,020
The ground shook when we were at the pool.

571
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,910
It scared away the tiger keelbacks.

572
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,270
I hope there isn't
anything scarier in here.

573
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,940
It has come to this.

574
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,390
Let it be.

575
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,670
I'm going to do something very meaningful.

576
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,610
I've looked everywhere. There's no one.

577
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:24,810
The body is gone, too.

578
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,030
Snakes have been here.

579
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,800
I covered him with this clothing.

580
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,160
Could the snakes have moved him?

581
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,420
I can't say for others

582
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,160
but Master San is smart and cunning.

583
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
We shouldn't worry
as long as there is no body.

584
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,160
That's true.

585
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,650
He's fooled me for over 20 years.

586
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,920
I know this much.

587
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
That's right.

588
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,400
Master San has to be alive and well.

589
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,400
We should go, sirs.

590
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,220
Who knows if the snakes will return?

591
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,730
Maybe he's gone ahead.

592
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,740
If we hurry, we might catch up to him.

593
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,160
Yes, let's go.

594
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,220
I don't even dare to blink my eyes.

595
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,700
Water drops every 30 seconds.

596
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,530
Are you having fun counting?

597
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,280
Wu Xie.

598
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,190
I'll be serious.

599
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,630
Once this bottle is filled,

600
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,300
we will have to go.

601
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,650
Okay.

602
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,080
Are you sure you're taking us
the right way?

603
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,380
If it's correct,

604
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,480
I'm going to leave Wu Xie a sign.

605
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,620
It's fine.

606
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,690
When they see these shrimp,

607
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,700
they'll know

608
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,230
that they represent our thoughtfulness.

609
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,600
Lame.

610
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,620
You don't get it.

611
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,460
Come here.

612
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,850
Quick.

613
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,820
-Mr Black.
-Hungry?

614
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,120
You must be hungry.

615
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:37,950
Eat it.

616
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,680
We'll fatten you up

617
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,440
so we can have a good new year.

618
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,280
If you spit it out,

619
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
we'll beat you up.

620
00:39:52,984 --> 00:40:02,984
