1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,039
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,880
<i>Episode 21</i>

4
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,820
Wu Xie,

5
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,680
tell me how you got that photo.

6
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,229
<i>Have you found any clue?</i>

7
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,750
I have.

8
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,200
Where are you now?

9
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,920
<i>I'm in Guangxi.</i>

10
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,080
Guangxi?

11
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,680
What are you doing there?

12
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,759
Also,

13
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
tell me

14
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,789
how you got that photo first.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,170
<i>Fine, I can tell you that.</i>

16
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,440
<i>But you have to prepare
three sets of diving equipment for me.</i>

17
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,710
No problem.

18
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,510
But you have to come to Changsha first.

19
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,520
See you in Changsha.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,800
One more thing,

21
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,160
I will get you the equipment,

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,110
but you have to tell me everything.

23
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,630
<i>Why should I go to Changsha?</i>

24
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,110
You'll find out once you get here.

25
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,600
<i>Where can I see you after I get there?</i>

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,600
I'll send you an address later.

27
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,110
That place belongs
to an old friend of ours.

28
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,380
<i>Old friend?</i>

29
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,630
<i>Who is that?</i>

30
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,720
I can tell that the decoration
of this restaurant costs a lot.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,160
Wu Xie, you're here.

32
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,760
Xiu Xiu,

33
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,930
are any of our old friends

34
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,190
running a restaurant?

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,329
You'll find out later.

36
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,240
Wu Xie,

37
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,410
here's the equipment you wanted.

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,190
Premium stuff.

39
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,160
Not bad, Xiao Hua.

40
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,680
You must've spent a lot.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,170
I can give them to you if you like them.

42
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,150
No, no.

43
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
The Wu family has its own rules.

44
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,160
Do you want them or not?

45
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,050
I'll return them if you don't.

46
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,460
-Buy them yourself.
-Hold on.

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,900
No.

48
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,300
You brought them all the way here,

49
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,760
taking them back
would be a pain in the neck.

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,060
How about this?

51
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,750
Rules are rigid, but people are flexible.

52
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,990
There's only one word
in the Wu family's rules.

53
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,110
Flexibility.

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,990
I guess I have no choice
but to accept them.

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,579
Okay.

56
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,500
So...

57
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,280
Now, can you tell me

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,770
where you got this photo?

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,860
Alright.

60
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,700
For the sake of this,

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,070
I will tell you.

62
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,700
Huo Xiu Xiu called earlier.

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,000
They've already found

64
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,140
the thing that you mentioned.

65
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,750
I didn't expect them to find it.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,060
But it covers a huge area,

67
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,390
they want to know
what they should do next.

68
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,260
Now, can you tell me

69
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,630
what is this pattern about?

70
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,850
This Qiongqi

71
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,190
is a tattoo of the tribe of Master Buddha.

72
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,029
Could the sloped shouldered man
be working for Master Buddha?

73
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,510
But why did he attack us?

74
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,450
Or does Master Buddha's secret
lie in Banai?

75
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,950
So he assigned the man
with sloped shoulders there

76
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,700
to guard this secret.

77
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,400
No matter what,

78
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,430
the clue you found in Guangxi

79
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,080
definitely has something to do
with Master Buddha

80
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,270
and also the secret of the Mystic Nine.

81
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,080
You have a point there.

82
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,990
I have to go back quickly.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,920
Did you make me travel
all the way to Changsha

84
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,510
just to tell me this?

85
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,340
Xiao Hua,

86
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,180
the premium model you bought.

87
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,530
This particular model,

88
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,650
this particular type,

89
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,020
has only recently launched in Beijing,
isn't that right?

90
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,980
In that case,

91
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,300
you could've told me to get it in Beijing.

92
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,330
Why should I travel to Changsha?

93
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,140
You've found a clue, haven't you?

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,050
Is it about my uncle...

95
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,330
You've found clues about
Xie Lian Huan, haven't you?

96
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,430
You're right.

97
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,820
I'm investigating Wu San Xing.

98
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,860
I talked to Mop before.

99
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,340
Mop told me,

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,780
Wu San Xing was planning
to take him to Xiangxi

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,390
after leaving Tamutuo.

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,659
So did you find him?

103
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,830
But I know he went to Xiangxi

104
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,740
to search for the ancient
Yi City Waterway, too.

105
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,800
I went there.

106
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,560
It was excavated decades ago.

107
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,600
Besides, the excavation method

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,210
was Two Finger Technique
of the Zhang family.

109
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,020
I continued investigating

110
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,820
and I realised the people who went there

111
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,390
were likely to be
Master Buddha and my master.

112
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,790
As you see it,

113
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,420
does Xie Lian Huan know this?

114
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,390
He must've been
going after something there.

115
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,260
Since Master Buddha took it,

116
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,100
if we can find it,

117
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,740
we might find some clues
about Wu San Xing.

118
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,540
Are you saying

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,860
that after Master Buddha took it,

120
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,380
he's been keeping it in Changsha?

121
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,770
I assume he's hiding it
in a secret chamber in Changsha.

122
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,210
We came to Changsha

123
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,659
to look for that secret chamber.

124
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,050
This was considered good stuff
in the 1970s.

125
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:59,240
It's an old state-owned
factory made watch.

126
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,450
It might still work if you fix it.

127
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,180
Mr Fatty.

128
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,080
This watch

129
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,730
will work if you fix it.

130
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,890
But you're a big shot businessman.

131
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,590
Aren't you here

132
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,210
to invest in tourism development?

133
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,450
Why are you searching for a watch
in the lake?

134
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,620
What do you know?

135
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,760
It's an antique,

136
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,710
antique!

137
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,890
It's very valuable!

138
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,170
Fatty,

139
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,800
what are these?

140
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,960
Are these

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,110
animal bones?

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,780
These... These are some cow bones.

143
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,930
We fished them out of the lake.

144
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,340
A girl like you shouldn't see this.

145
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,320
Here. Have this.

146
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,770
Look, this is fully made of steel.

147
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,840
Hold on.

148
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,120
Tell the chef to add a few more dishes.

149
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,660
-Yes, sir.
-Hurry up.

150
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,990
Master Xiao San.

151
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,040
Mop.

152
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,660
Is this yours?

153
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,980
It's a sideline.

154
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,460
You should come here more often.

155
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,039
Make yourself home.

156
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,210
Home?

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,049
Are we that close?

158
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,210
Of course.

159
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,130
Master Hua'er saved my life.

160
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,290
I am a righteous man.

161
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,070
If Master Hua'er looks for Master San,

162
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,050
I'll look for Master San as well.

163
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,510
Master Xiao San,

164
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,490
take your time,

165
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,920
I'll get another two bottles of good wine.

166
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,020
Mop,

167
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,360
you don't have to leave.

168
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,770
Wu Xie,

169
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,240
we got the clues

170
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,530
from Zhang Ri Shan.

171
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,920
He should've known
that we are looking into these things.

172
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,090
That's why he gave us these clues.

173
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,970
Besides, all these years,

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,540
Master Buddha's secret chamber

175
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,720
has been under secret surveillance.

176
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,260
That's right, that's right.

177
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,410
We've found him.

178
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,110
The keeper of the secret chamber

179
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,090
is no longer alive,

180
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,860
his son is also already dead,

181
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,160
but his grandchild is still alive.

182

<i>Riverside Courtyard</i>

183
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,530
So people actually care about this.

184
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,620
Do you have a phone?

185
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,060
Great. Come, come.

186
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,910
Vote for me.

187
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,000

Come on.

190
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,870
Can I give you money instead?

191
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,580
What is wrong with you?

192
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,930
What is wrong with you?

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,730
Seriously. I don't need money.

194
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,220
Don't talk money with me.

195
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,430
Cheap.

196
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,410
That's really cheap.

197
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,310
I'm pursuing my career,

198
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,800
realising my music career dream.

199
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,020
Do you understand?

200
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,560
However, it's not that I can't tell you

201
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,780

After that, share it on QQ.

204
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,900
Then...

205
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,050
Then, join my fan group.

206
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,550

Now I'll get dozens of my buddies

210

and join your fan group.

211
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,300
Then, I'll start
a secondary fan group for you.

212
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,810

214
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,460
I will be the leader of your fan group.

215

Dreams are the most important thing
for young people.

216

You have my support.

217
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,780

218
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,660
you get me.

219
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,250
You really do.

220
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,540
Alright.

221
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,260
Since we get along so well,

222
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,540
I'll tell you guys.

223
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,560
Actually, I don't know
what my grandpa and dad

224
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,540
were doing either.

225
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,370
They'd make me go somewhere
every three months

226
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,590
to take a picture.

227
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,120
Then, someone

228
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,570
would give me 100,000 yuan every year.

229
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,140
These are the photos I took.

230
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,740
Did you deliver these photos to anyone?

231
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,230
The shipping address is long gone.

232
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,180
After I took over,

233
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,430
it was changed into email.

234
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,130
Yeah,

235
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,820
the email address is stated on it.

236
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,640

237
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,380
Who gave you the money?

238
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,820
Didn't I write the account number on it?

239
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,620
If you want to know, find out yourself.

240
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,360
What's wrong
with the young people nowadays?

241
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,740
Little girl,
I think you have a great body.

242
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,180
Very nice figure.

243
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,140
Do you have any music career dreams?

244
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,620
Why don't we start a band?

245
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,020
It'll be a hit for sure.

246
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,700
I've even come up with a name.

247
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,700
We'll be the Legend of Dragon and Phoenix.

248
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,030
Isn't it cool?

249
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,670
You don't know me.

250
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,350
These photos

251
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,110
were taken starting from the 1960s.

252
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,620
Before 1970,

253
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,110
this was a department store.

254
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,870
A factory was built here after 1970,

255
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,910
and then demolished.

256
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,470
Then, two years ago,

257
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,060
a commercial street was built here.

258
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,670
Those people did these things

259
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,030
and took these photos

260
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,260
with the intention of

261
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,620
recording the surroundings
of Master Buddha's secret chamber.

262
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,500
I found it.

263
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,490
Their photos

264
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,980
had always been delivered to Beijing.

265
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,000
As for the account number,

266
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,870
although I didn't find out
who exactly it was,

267
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,960
Xin Yue Restaurant is very likely

268
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,350
to be the party who had been paying them.

269
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,040
Xin Yue Restaurant?

270
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,350
It really is Zhang Ri Shan.

271
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,780
Master Hua, Master Xiao San.

272
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,980
I got the news.

273
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,320
In the 1970s,
the construction of this factory

274
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,060
was managed by an old leader named Zhang.

275
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,490
Master Buddha.

276
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,290
Master Buddha managed the construction
of this factory

277
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,310
to hide his secret chamber.

278
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,580
In the 1990s,
the commercial street was demolished.

279
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,280
During the demolition,

280
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,670
they must've discovered something.

281
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,030
I found it, I found it.

282
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,500
In March of 1999,

283
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,920
<i>Demolition of machinery factory in
Xiangjiang, Changsha</i>

284
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,560
they did find something underground.

285
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
<i>reveals thousand-year-old secret.</i>

286
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,180
What Master Buddha
had been hiding carefully for decades

287
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,350
was dug away just like that.

288
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,060
No.

289
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:47,940
He found a better way to keep it.

290
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,550
Where did it go?

291
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,240
<i>Painted screen with
animal print on nut wood</i>

292
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,140
<i>Donated by: Mr Zhang</i>

293
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,360
As expected from Master Buddha.

294
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,230
Hiding the screen in a museum

295
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,110
is the safest indeed.

296
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,300
Mr Zhang

297
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,910
should be Zhang Ri Shan.

298
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,990
How old was Master Buddha?

299
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,620
This screen does look old.

300
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,150
Besides, look.

301
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,990
These holes seem to be bitten by bugs,

302
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,310
but they seem too organised.

303
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,790
All the holes are about the same size.

304
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,930
Something's wrong.

305
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,740
Great.

306
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,250
That means we're in the right direction.

307
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,740
Sneak it out.

308
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,810
Are you kidding?

309
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,540
This is a museum.

310
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,230
It's okay.

311
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,240
Just duplicate it

312
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,450
and study it later.

313
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,760
Duplicate?

314
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,450
Do you know what a one-to-one
mirror replica is?

315
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,010
This is a one-to-one mirror replica.

316
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,820
It'll definitely pass
for the genuine article.

317
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,910
Don't worry.

318
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,120
It's exactly the same size
as the one in the museum.

319
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,600
Even the size, position and edge
of each hole

320
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,580
are exactly the same.

321
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,460
There's not even the slightest difference.

322
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,860
Guys, take your time.

323
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,660
This warehouse is mine,

324
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,390
you can stay here as long as you want

325
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,270
and ask for anything you want.

326
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,390
We have everything.

327
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,780
There's nothing special about this screen.

328
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,420
Could it be like what you said,

329
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,980
the clues are actually on these holes?

330
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,980
Could these holes actually
be a kind of secret code?

331
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,000
Like Morse code,

332
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,220
binary code, and whatnot.

333
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,350
This could also be a painting.

334
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,900
If we join the dots,

335
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,260
the clues will be shown.

336
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,740
But there are too many dots on the screen.

337
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,320
They're also a mess.

338
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,270
There are hundreds of ways
to connect the dots.

339
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,270
How should we do it?

340
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,860
But I was going to say

341
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,150
I feel like I've seen it somewhere.

342
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,980
It seems a little familiar.

343
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,910
Xin Yue Restaurant.

344
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,340
In the photo of Xin Yue Restaurant,

345
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,220
there's this screen.

346
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,300
Go have a meal at Xin Yue Restaurant.

347
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,920
Take a photo

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,190
of the left side of the corridor
on the first floor.

349
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,370
Sirs,

350
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,620
why don't we go back first?

351
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,060
Let's come back two days later.

352
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,250
Look.

353
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,740
Look at the weather.

354
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,460
Maybe

355
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,900
it might rain.

356
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,690
When it rains on this mountain,

357
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,089
mudslides can occur.

358
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:14,990
Isn't...

359
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,170
Isn't that dangerous?

360
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,700
It's only mudslides.

361
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,210
It's not that big of a deal.

362
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,460
The two of us

363
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,540
have extensive experience surviving
in the wilderness.

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,670
A little mudslide is nothing.

365
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,440
Uncle Gui,

366
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,420
how about this?

367
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,980
Take Yun Cai home.

368
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,820
And we'll continue to stay here.

369
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,190
After the rain stops,

370
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,580
bring us some supplies.

371
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,850
Why do they get to stay

372
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,110
but I have to go home?

373
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,860
Enough.

374
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,010
Stay out of this.

375
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,190
How dare you say that?

376
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,340
You have no idea

377
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,670
how dangerous mudslide can be.

378
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,050
Alright. Pack your stuff

379
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,300
and we'll depart right now.

380
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,830
Look.

381
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,020
The rain might go on for a few days.

382
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,840
We're also running out of dried food.

383
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,970
Save on the food.

384
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,300
When the rain is less heavy,

385
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,540
I'll bring you dried food.

386
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,720
Why don't you just go back with me?

387
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,430
If it rains,

388
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,880
no one dares to come here anymore.

389
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,070
It's better to be safe than sorry.

390
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,820
Don't worry, Uncle Gui.

391
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,800
Both of us

392
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,590
will return in one piece.

393
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,250
After you and Yun Cai get to the village,

394
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,900
slaughter some livestock.

395
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,130
After we go back, we'll have a nice meal

396
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,290
and enjoy a feast.

397
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,940
Then I'll give you one more
piece of advice.

398
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,250
The mountain
is different from the outside world.

399
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,020
You must be careful.

400
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,010
Rest assured.

401
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,730
Alright.

402
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,120
Yun Cai, let's go.

403
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,500
Take care, Yun Cai.

404
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,300
Alright, Zhang.
Let's start our handicraft class.

405
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,180
Let's put these bone pieces together.

406
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,480
Xiao Hua,

407
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,370
we've received the photos you asked for.

408
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,400
That's right.

409
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,420
This is the screen.

410
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,690
This globe...

411
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,380
Xiu Xiu, do you remember this?

412
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,660
Isn't this the globe
in Wu San Xing's house?

413
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,290
There's indeed a globe in his room.

414
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,780
It looks similar to this.

415
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,750
But how did you guys know

416
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,170
that there's a globe in his room?

417
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,500
Have you been to Xie Lian Huan's room?

418
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,840
When was it?

419
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,380
It's for investigation.

420
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,660
We did all these for investigation.

421
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,260
In that case, our next step should be...

422
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:17,140
Let's go take a look there.

423
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,820
Wu Xie,

424
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,980
didn't I tell you

425
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,940
that Zhang and I fish out
a pile of bones from the lake?

426
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,530
Well,

427
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,820
I will put together a few sets for you.

428
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,220
So when you come back,

429
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,160
they'll beat drums and strike gongs
to welcome you.

430
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,930
How's that? Aren't I a good friend?

431
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,900
Okay, that's it for now. Bye-bye.

432
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,520
It seems Wu Xie's deduction was right.

433
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,900
Since we found this pile of bones,

434
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,780
it means the first expedition team

435
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,760
had been killed by Panma.

436
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,330
Then, the second expedition team arrived

437
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,300
and replaced them.

438
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,590
Panma

439
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,800
is a piece of work.

440
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,200
Rest in peace.

441
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,560
Seniors,

442
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,680
we are sorry.

443
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,820
Both of us

444
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,800
never meant to interrupt your sweet dream.

445
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,840
However,

446
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,350
we really need you to come up here.

447
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,280
Sorry, please forgive us.

448
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,620
Zhang,

449
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,860
won't you say something?

450
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,110
Okay, fine.

451
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,840
Fish, fish, take the bait.

452
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,230
Fish, fish, take the bait.

453
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,870
Fish, fish, take the bait.

454
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,590
Fish, fish, take the bait.

455
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,870
Fish, fish, take the bait.

456
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,430
Fish...

457
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,030
Fatty!

458
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,060
Boss.

459
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,040
Come in.

460
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,200
Boss.

461
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,210
You get anything from here?

462
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,280
As far as I know,

463
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,360
Zhang and Fatty
never came out of the water.

464
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,850
We couldn't find anything.

465
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:39,210
Do you think
they might have already died in the lake?

466
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,030
No.

467
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,050
You mean they found it?

468
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,460
They beat us to it again?

469
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,230
But we have not

470
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,750
found a way down until now.

471
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,380
You can't.

472
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,700
The equipment.

473
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,510
It's already in Banai.

474
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,820
They will arrive this afternoon.

475
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,580
If you're going to buy me lunch,

476
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,300
at least take me to a nicer place.

477
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,360
I was afraid that a high-end restaurant

478
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,870
is too good for your cheap stomach.

479
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,460
Here comes fried rice with
green pepper and shredded pork!

480
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,510
Mr Black!

481
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,660
I miss you so much!

482
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,370
Our food supply has put on some weight.

483
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,240
I will put on more weight

484
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,910
so that I can always be your food supply.

485
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,030
You must have something
to discuss with Master Hua.

486
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,110
I'll leave you two alone.

487
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:40,780
Mop,

488
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,600
stay here. It's fine.

489
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,710
Alright,

490
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,230
you told me to stay for another day,

491
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,540
what is it that's so important?

492
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,390
I heard,

493
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,100
you're looking into Master Buddha
and Yellow Silk.

494
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,060
Did you find something?

495
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,190
Not bad.

496
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,570
Mr Black,

497
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,460
I used the best ingredients

498
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,780
in this fried rice.

499
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,340
I used black pig.

500
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,300
Figure out how to vacuum seal it,

501
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,300
so that I can eat it
when I'm leaving for another job.

502
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,910
Sure.

503
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,630
Mr Black,

504
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,030
stop beating around the bush.

505
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,930
Xiao Hua returned his flight ticket

506
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,180
just to wait for you.

507
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,150
I found a place

508
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,140
with a very important clue there.

509
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,830
What clue?

510
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,340
You'll find out when you get there.

511
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,920
We'll set out tomorrow.

512
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,310
Where are we going?

513
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,430
Just come with me.

514
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,840
I have everything set up for you.

515
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,270
Why haven't they returned yet?

516
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,430
Mr Wu,

517
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,910
when I was leaving the lake,

518
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,150
I told them over and over again

519
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,150
to leave the mountains before it rains.

520
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,350
But look,

521
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,600
we haven't even seen them till now.

522
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,270
It's driving me crazy as well.

523
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,880
I've waited at the base everyday,

524
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,000
but I have yet to see them.

525
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,070
No.

526
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,190
I have to find them.

527
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,670
No, no.

528
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,720
Mr Wu, that's really dangerous.

529
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,830
It had been raining for a few days.

530
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,920
Based on my experience,

531
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,460
there might be mudslides anytime.

532
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,480
Not only you,

533
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,120
even our most experienced hunter

534
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,360
would have to leave his fate
to the mountains.

535
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,080
But I can't just sit here and wait.

536
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,000
Mr Wu, don't worry.

537
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,020
At this moment,

538
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,880
the most dangerous place is the path
leading into the mountain.

539
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,290
They're staying by the lake,

540
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,950
it's actually safer than the mountain.

541
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,430
They'll be fine.

542
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,520
The worst-case scenario here is

543
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,080
that they might get sick from the rain.

544
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,140
But...

545
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,600
I took you guys into the mountains,

546
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,120
I will take full responsibility.

547
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,100
But we shouldn't risk our lives,

548
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,760
should we?

549
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,550
Don't try to stop me.

550
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,800
No matter what you say,

551
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,520
I will never leave them alone.

552
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,870
I didn't come here to stop you,

553
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,800
I know someone who can take you there.

554
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,410
Mr Black, we've been going around
this canola field

555
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,920
for three times.

556
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,920
Are we here for a spring tour?

557
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,400
Where on earth are you taking us?

558
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,920
That's a long story.

559
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,680
After I came back from Tamutuo,

560
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,200
I got a small task.

561
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,190
-This task...
-Hold it right there.

562
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,470
I'm not interested in your story,

563
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,600
just cut to the chase.

564
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,730
Young people like you

565
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,160
are too short-tempered,

566
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,520
you're impatient.

567
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,280
I found an important clue

568
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,890
which is closely related

569
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,620
to the Yellow Silk you're looking for.

570
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,710
Just tell us

571
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,030
what exactly it is.

572
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,000
That clue is actually a place.

573
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,070
Here is it.

574
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,390
You know what,

575
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,880
don't ever underestimate this field.

576
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,700
Back then, Master Buddha

577
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,120
found it after a lot of hard work.

578
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,540
Besides, a big secret actually lies here.

579
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,280
Stop the cart!

580
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,260
Don't stop! We're not there yet.

581
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,970
Sirs, who should I listen to?

582
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,440
Listen to me. Stop the cart!

583
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,530
Enough is enough.

584
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,510
Stop acting already.

585
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,110
Master Buddha would never come here.

586
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,610
Even if he had,

587
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,120
he left empty-handed.

588
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,170
Even if Master Buddha left empty-handed

589
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,960
it doesn't mean
that we'll end up the same way.

590
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,940
Mop,

591
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,710
keep driving. It's right ahead of us.

592
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,420
Sirs,

593
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,710
who should I listen to?

594
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,820
Listen to me!

595
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,120
Shoot.

596
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,100
Who exactly hired you?

597
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,150
No one hired me.

598
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,290
I just want to share with you

599
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,780
the important clue which I found.

600
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,990
Would you be so kind?

601
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,230
Take out the credit card machine.

602
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,710
You want to pay me?

603
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,050
A good guy like me

604
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,530
conducts business based on trust.

605
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,050
I will never disclose
any of my clients' information.

606
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,050
It's Master Er.

607
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,090
Master Er from the Wu family.

608
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,080
What did he ask you to do?

609
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,120
No signal?

610
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,390
No,

611
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,860
how is this possible?

612
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:08,920
No signal?

613
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,720
No signal.

614
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,280
How could there be no signal
at this critical moment?

615
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,260
Mr Black,

616
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,650
you know you can trust

617
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,110
Xiao Hua.

618
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,920
I will be the guarantor of the fees.

619
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,620
He will pay you a handsome sum.

620
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,540
Why did Master Er hire you?

621
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,800
As a matter of fact, it was nothing.

622
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,480
He wanted me

623
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,860
to take you guys around.

624
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,320
Take a walk

625
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,390
and relax.

626
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,520
Go somewhere irrelevant,

627
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,700
as long as you don't wander off.

628
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,850
Where does he not want me to go?

629
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,560
It depends

630
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,470
on where you're going.

631
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,090
Sir,

632
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,530
can you take Wu Xie into the mountain?

633
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,210
No.

634
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,380
Mr Panma,

635
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,980
back in Buffalo Trench,

636
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,540
-I...
-Since we managed to get out of it,

637
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,950
I guess we're considered sworn friends.

638
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,510
Of course I'm willing to help you.

639
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,570
But with the current situation,

640
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,050
I really can't do it.

641
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,340
When I got here, I heard

642
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,490
that it had been raining for two days.

643
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,550
But look.

644
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,600
The rain has stopped.

645
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,460
The rain has stopped here.

646
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,200
But it might not be the same

647
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,240
in the mountain.

648
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,730
It's very cloudy in the mountain,

649
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,840
there must be a heavy downpour.

650
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,690
Maybe there's a mudslide now.

651
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,840
Mr Gui was right.

652
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,930
Whoever goes into the mountains now

653
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,550
will die on his way there.

654
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,280
-But...
-My dad lacks experience.

655
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,070
He only goes to the mountain
a few times a year.

656
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,460
But you go there everyday,
there won't be any problems.

657
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,520
Yun Cai, you grew up in the mountains,

658
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,690
you should know its condition very well.

659
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,990
I said that because I believe

660
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,130
you'll be able to make it.

661
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,320
You've been in the mountains for decades.

662
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,040
There's nothing you haven't seen.

663
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,280
Sir, if you refuse to help,

664
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,500
his friends might actually die
in the mountains.

665
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,460
It's not that I don't want to help

666
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,130
or I'm afraid of dying,

667
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:44,300
but I won't let you die in vain.

668
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,540
They're staying by the lake,

669
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,400
not in the mountains,

670
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,500
I guess

671
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,850
they will be fine.

672
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,650
Based on my experience,

673
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,990
it should stop raining
in two or three days.

674
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,860
I'll take you there then.

675
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,440
Panma is a stubborn old man.

676
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,210
We can definitely go in the mountains,

677
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,710
it's just that the rain
makes it a little difficult to walk.

678
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,250
He just wants to steer clear of trouble.

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,250
Whenever it rains,
he'd go on and on about mudslides.

680
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,370
Does mudslide happen so easily?

681
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,890
I have only seen mudslide once
my whole life.

682
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,560
I have another idea.

683
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,180
What idea?

684
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,160
Don't ask.

685
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,280
Try to get me a set of old overalls.

686
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,690
If it's possible,

687
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,560
get me a female wig as well.
