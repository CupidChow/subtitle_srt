1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,900
<i>Ultimate Note</i>

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>Episode 10</i>

4
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,850
The steel blades are gone.

5
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,520
The blades retracted.
Something worse is coming.

6
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,229
I understood the
purpose of this contraption.

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,680
Even if someone survives the blades,

8
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,920
they'd still fall to their demise.

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,580
No wonder there were no human remains.

10
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,500
They were pushed off.

11
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,300
Let's shove a rope

12
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,300
onto the statue on the
opposite site and climb over.

13
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,380
It won't work.

14
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,920
There's no anchor point
to withstand the weight.

15
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,180
Will a man-made anchor point work?

16
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,260
We need at least three minutes to
get to the other side in this distance.

17
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,430
We can't make it.

18
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,390
Pan Zi.

19
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,460
The stone wall and the
statue are the same height.

20
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,500
With the same height,
we can jump across.

21
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,419
Let's give it a shot.

22
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,590
This is the only way.

23
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,310
We're running out of time. Get on!

24
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,880
Come on, get up here.

25
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,100
It's the tiger keelback.

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,579
No wonder there were
no snakes in the forest.

27
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,540
All of them are gathered here.

28
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,250
This altar was meant to
sacrifice for snakes.

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,020
When the sacrifices
were thrown from above,

30
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,260
their fates were sealed.

31
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,940
Either to be fed to the snakes,

32
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,780
or be pierced to death by the blades.

33
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,010
I don't trust fate.

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,460
We're going to enter alive

35
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,540
and leave alive.

36
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,300
Come on.

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,250
Let's go.

38
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,260
Master Xiao San, here.

39
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,840
Fatty, hurry up.

40
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,340
Fatty.

41
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,670
You really need to lose some weight.

42
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,990
Do you hear me?

43
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,579
It's time for you to lose weight.

44
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,940
You agreed to treat me to roasted duck and

45
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,540
hotpot and lamb after we get out of here.

46
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,480
What's the matter?

47
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,740
Are you breaking your promise?

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
If you remain fat,

49
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,420
no one can save you.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,560
Stick to instant noodles.

51
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:58,750
No way.

52
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
We're currently on the level

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
similar to the height of the statue.

54
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,860
We can probably jump across.

55
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,410
Why is the wall going back?

56
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,440
There is a giant sewer below.

57
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,670
It's covered with a massive rock.

58
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,930
It looks like there's a long way to go.

59
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,540
This sewer

60
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,620
probably leads right to Palace
of Heavenly Queen Mother.

61
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
-Does the palace really exist?
-Of course.

62
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,540
Did we come all the
way here for a holiday?

63
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,350
If we could seize a few items,

64
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,830
we don't have to worry
for the rest of our lives.

65
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,510
This would be a trip worthwhile.

66
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,900
Master Hua'er.

67
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Since you're familiar,

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,500
please lead the way.

69
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,780
Mr Black.

70
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,880
You're skilled.

71
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,450
Guard our rear.

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,360
When you grabbed my collar,

73
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,590
you were pretty tough.

74
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,860
Let us

75
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,280
walk together.

76
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
I shouldn't occupy your chance to perform.

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,440
The waters below are turbulent.

78
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,330
Its depth is unpredictable.

79
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,730
Did you bring any diving equipment?

80
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,860
Yes.

81
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,110
It's back at the campsite.

82
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,480
What?

83
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,770
That snakes' nest?

84
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
-Go back and retrieve them.
-Master San.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,960
Many of our men have died.

86
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,340
Don't worry.

87
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,650
Nobody asked you to.

88
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,820
You and your men

89
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,280
are holding us back.

90
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,580
Blind jerk.

91
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,020
I addressed you as
Mr Black out of respect.

92
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,230
We're not coming with you if you say that.

93
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,340
Let's walk together.

94
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,020
Master San.

95
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,700
You escaped the snakes' nest.

96
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,659
The campsite is still dangerous.

97
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,300
Shades and I will accompany
you to retrieve the gear.

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,020
As for the passers-by,

99
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,140
let them rest here.

100
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,900
I...

101
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,430
If we do not return within three hours,

102
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,870
do whatever you need to do.

103
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,980
Get some sleep.

104
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,500
Perhaps,

105
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,850
we might need a human shield later.

106
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,940
Mop.

107
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,630
The three of them left.

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm afraid...

109
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,120
We do not fear death,

110
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,870
but these tiger keelbacks are fierce.

111
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,830
Bunch of useless fools.

112
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,500
No wonder they'd belittle us.

113
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,050
Mop.

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,100
Do you think they purposely left us here?

115
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,909
They left the difficult tasks to us.

116
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,510
Many of our men died.

117
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,960
They better not keep
the benefits to themselves

118
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,210
and abandon us here.

119
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,060
Master San.

120
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,520
The men you recruited
this time are unreliable.

121
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,040
Not everyone is as diligent
and reliable as Pan Zi.

122
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,640
They work according to their wage.

123
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,480
They only work for money, not men.

124
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,180
You should employ more expensive services.

125
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,700
Back when I was wealthy, I get to choose.

126
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,280
The family business is
going downhill in recent years.

127
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,040
We can't afford more reliable teams.

128
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,540
Do you hear him?

129
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,110
Give Master San a discount.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,810
Although I'm expensive,

131
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,130
you get your money's worth.

132
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,800
The ratio between price
and performance is higher.

133
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,700
Am I right, Master San?

134
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,660
Master San!

135
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,270
Master San!

136
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,380
Master San.

137
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,490
Master San.

138
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,960
Well,

139
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,840
you're the third son of
the famous Wu Family.

140
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,300
You shouldn't collect the gear yourself

141
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,940
while we rest.

142
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,030
If word gets out,

143
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,090
we will be out of jobs.

144
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,530
Cheap goods

145
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,860
are the ones with most schemes.

146
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,520
You...

147
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,140
Master San.

148
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,740
We will listen to your orders.

149
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
All right.

150
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,440
Since you offered,

151
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,680
I'll take it.

152
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,810
Everyone worked hard during this trip.

153
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,810
Of course

154
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,250
I'd not forget your share.

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,840
I'll thank you

156
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,300
on behalf of the men.

157
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,140
It's basically a gigantic
human coin pusher.

158
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,180
I thought citizens of Kingdom of
Heavenly Queen Mother were religious.

159
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,660
That they only worshipped snakes.

160
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,860
But they were also arcade lovers.

161
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,540
It took 30 seconds for the
stone wall to reach the top.

162
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,140
We can utilise the
duration to jump across.

163
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,539
There's still a chance.

164
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,690
I'll do it first.

165
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,330
Allow me.

166
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,530
If anything happens,

167
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,730
at least I'm more skilled than you are.

168
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,900
All right.

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
Great job!

170
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Wu Xie.

171
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
This works.

172
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,830
It looks pretty simple.

173
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,500
Watch me!

174
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,420
Fatty.

175
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,460
Hurry up.

176
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,210
Yes!

177
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,680
Good gracious.

178
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,810
Wu Xie, come over!

179
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,740
Okay.

180
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,780
Don't be nervous.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
Do not look down.

182
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,080
Follow my instructions.

183
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,580
When I say jump, you jump.

184
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,860
One.

185
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,580
Two.

186
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,710
Three. Jump!

187
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,940
Wu Xie!

188
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:58,930
Wu Xie!

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Master Xiao San!

190
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,820
The goddess descended.

191
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,550
Zhang.

192
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,340
Wu Xie.

193
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,120
Are you alright?

194
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,600
Where's Zhang?

195
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,600
He's gone again.

196
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,820
Zhang

197
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,450
sure loves playing hide and seek.

198
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,900
It has only been a while

199
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,140
but we've lost him.

200
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,500
I don't know,

201
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,300
but I'm sure he has his reasons.

202
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,380
Let's quit guessing.

203
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,770
All right.

204
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,440
It's getting late.

205
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,950
Let's hurry up.

206
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,610
After finding Master San,

207
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,210
we may be able to reunite with Zhang.

208
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,290
Pan Zi.

209
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,370
Where should we go?

210
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,360
This is bad.

211
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:06,980
The red smoke has dispersed.

212
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,490
The compass.

213
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,460
Right.

214
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,490
We saved him. Now it's time to get moving.

215
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,560
Pan Zi.

216
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,740
Without the red smoke
to determine the direction,

217
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,900
can we still find Uncle San?

218
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,650
Although it's gone,

219
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,270
if we follow the compass and the map,

220
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,390
there will be no problem.

221
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:55,590
If we continue to hurry,

222
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,910
without any incidents,

223
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,900
we will be able to reach
in two to three hours.

224
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,100
Pan Zi.

225
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,510
Look at the sky.

226
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,680
It's getting dark.

227
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,730
The terrain is complicated.

228
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,670
If we face any danger,

229
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,100
it will be hard for us to arrive
at Master San's as planned.

230
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,540
How about this?

231
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,560
Let's return at the original spot to rest.

232
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,560
We will depart once we're well rested.

233
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,190
Sure.

234
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,140
Give me some water.

235
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,910
Are you going to say it?

236
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,980
What? I'm very thirsty.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,920
You're fine now.

238
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,960
Yes.

239
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,680
I'm going to say the same thing.

240
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,120
Watch the Xie household.

241
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,510
Xiu Xiu and I found
two porcelain pieces at Lancuo.

242
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,030
The clues directed us here.

243
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,660
Then, I met you here.

244
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,060
Don't you have anything to say?

245
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,180
It's pointless even if you
find scattered pieces of clues.

246
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,800
I reminded you.

247
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,620
This is something you
don't want to get involved.

248
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,290
Since you said it's pointless,

249
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,210
why didn't you tell me the
clues you know directly?

250
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,600
I didn't tell you

251
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
because I don't want your generation

252
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,960
to repeat our mistakes.

253
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,740
We no longer have a choice,

254
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,260
but you do.

255
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,420
Didn't you realise?

256
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,380
Everything we did over the years,

257
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,910
all the places we went,

258
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,460
were as if they were arranged.

259
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,520
It's like something

260
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,650
was luring us step by step into the trap.

261
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:40,130
That is why I insist to come.

262
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,620
I want to see if I can solve this trap.

263
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,630
You want to solve this trap?

264
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,540
How do you know if your
decision to come here

265
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
wasn't premeditated?

266
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,260
What are you doing?

267
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,850
What's Pan Zi doing up there?

268
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:34,990
Is he sleeping?

269
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,310
We detected movements there.

270
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,630
He climbed up to take a look.

271
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,460
What's wrong?

272
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,010
Look.

273
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,590
On a tree around a few
hundred metres from here,

274
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,820
someone is there.

275
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,660
How could you see that?

276
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,390
I couldn't see clearly due to the leaves.

277
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,710
However, I'm sure it was a person.

278
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,580
It has long hair. I think it's a woman.

279
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,130
-A woman?
-A woman?

280
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,990
Check it our yourselves.

281
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,260
Ah Ning.

282
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,160
Ah Ning?

283
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,100
That person

284
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,920
is wearing Ah Ning's coin bracelet.

285
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,340
It is Ah Ning.

286
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,980
They moved Ah Ning's body here.

287
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,030
I'd always thought

288
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,220
the snakes in this forest are peculiar.

289
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,640
They have a disposition similar to ants.

290
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
In the ant nest,

291
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,060
there's a queen
responsible to produce eggs.

292
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,360
The others ants will feed the queen.

293
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,130
These snakes brought
Ah Ning's corpse all the way here.

294
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,210
It's likely that

295
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,520
they are feeding it to the Snake Mother.

296
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,280
If that's the case,

297
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,010
we're at the snakes' nest right now.

298
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,130
It's going to be filled with snakes.

299
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,900
We can't stay here.

300
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:20,870
Let's move.

301
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,860
No.

302
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,020
Since we found her body,

303
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,460
we need to take her along.

304
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,400
Wu Xie.

305
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Don't be naive.

306
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,600
Look at the situation we're in.

307
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,540
Are you going to stay here to
be food to the Snake Mother?

308
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,750
Yes, Wu Xie.

309
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,010
I understand what you're feeling,

310
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,590
but this is too dangerous.

311
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Exactly.

312
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
No.

313
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,570
I can't leave her here.

314
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
What's happening?

315
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,900
I think someone was talking over there.

316
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,890
What is going on?

317
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,980
Did Ah Ning fake her death?

318
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,910
Feudal superstition aren't real.

319
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,990
Master Xiao San.

320
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,589
Master Xiao San.

321
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,099
Someone is calling my name.

322
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,849
Your name?

323
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,500
I don't hear it.

324
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,650
It's not calling my original name.

325
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,030
It's calling me Master Xiao San.

326
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,470
Listen closely.

327
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,770
Master Xiao San.

328
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,600
That doesn't sound like Ah Ning.

329
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,560
Who does it belong to?

330
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,090
Is it possible that

331
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,030
it came from Ah Ning's walkie-talkie?

332
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,180
Walkie-talkie?

333
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,800
Yes.

334
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,770
Ah Ning has a walkie-talkie with her.

335
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,980
If the speaker of the walkie-talkie

336
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,450
is muffled with a damp cloth,

337
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,130
it will make a sound similar to this.

338
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,040
That's great.

339
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,750
If the walkie-talkie still works,

340
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,030
we can contact others.

341
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,740
There are too many snakes.

342
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,860
I think

343
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,780
we're infiltrating the nest
of the tiger keelbacks.

344
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,700
What's the point of drawing a knife now?

345
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,410
What other ideas do you have?

346
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,660
Here, hold this.

347
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,780
Listen to me.

348
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,820
Grab on tight.

349
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,910
Do not let go.

350
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,920
Grab onto it even if it hurts.

351
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,340
Will this work?

352
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,440
Don't worry.

353
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,350
Wait for my cue. We will charge ahead.

354
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,240
Okay.

355
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:28,630
Run!

356
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,430
How did it go?

357
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,250
They did not come after us.

358
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,540
The snakes are afraid of people
who are fearless like us.

359
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,950
Pan Zi, I'm keeping this trick in my book.

360
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,320
How many waterproof cloth do we have left?

361
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,380
We've plenty.

362
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,630
However, we're running low on alcohol.

363
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,910
We can't employ this method anymore.

364
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,450
The snakes are coming after us.

365
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,380
We need to run.

366
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,500
This place is too dangerous.

367
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,580
Stop concerning ourselves with
trivial matters and the walkie-talkie.

368
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,980
We can't afford to risk our lives again.

369
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,340
Over here.

370
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,150
There are snakes here too.

371
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,990
The other way. Let's go.

372
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,910
Run.

373
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,920
Snake!

374
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,430
Snakes!

375
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,430
Check the place in front.

376
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,300
Master San.

377
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,580
They are dead snakes.

378
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,260
Let's go.

379
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:38,110
Do not move.

380
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
The snakes are not completely dead.

381
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,580
Be careful.

382
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,920
Watch out.

383
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,680
Your foot.

384
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,460
It's fine.

385
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,730
I'm wearing imported combat boots.

386
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,540
It's durable and resistant
to practically everything.

387
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,820
Stop showing off with
that cheap boots of yours.

388
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,000
Help him, hurry.

389
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,570
-Carry him into the tent.
-All right.

390
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,820
Why are the snakes charging forward?

391
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,320
Pan Zi, where did you take us?

392
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,480
We came back to the same place.

393
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,340
No, we didn't.

394
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,860
I'd never been to this part of the forest.

395
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,780
They are not after us.

396
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,040
They are outflanking us.

397
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,220
What?

398
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
How smart are these snakes?

399
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,740
They induced snake charm.

400
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,980
They are becoming demons.

401
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,980
Listen.

402
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,830
These snakes aren't regular snakes.

403
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,940
We can't defeat them recklessly.

404
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,800
Since they fight as a guerrilla,

405
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,700
we will respond with a
game of hide and seek

406
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,780
to lose them.

407
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,550
Come on.

408
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,550
Hold on.

409
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,740
Something isn't right.

410
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,060
It's easy for them to kill us.

411
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,880
They can hide within the bushes

412
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,010
and when we pass by,

413
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,180
with one strike,

414
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,540
we would have died.

415
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,050
Why are they complicating things?

416
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,610
Are you saying that

417
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,210
they aren't surrounding us

418
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,030
but they are scaring us?

419
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,340
They weren't planning on killing us?

420
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,830
What do they want?

421
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,920
I don't know.

422
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,200
But before anything is certain,

423
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,900
do not behave recklessly.

424
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,420
Wu Xie.

425
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,410
Don't be naive.

426
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,860
We're humans and they are snakes.

427
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,780
We don't know how snakes think.

428
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
I get it.

429
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,090
They are like the herding dog

430
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,580
while we are the sheep.

431
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,130
They are trying to herd us
into a specific location.

432
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,080
Where are the snakes

433
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,340
trying to lure us into?

434
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,070
-I don't know either.
-What do we do?

435
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,120
Should we go back?

436
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,720
We can't go back.

437
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,960
We are surrounded from all sides.

438
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,130
We're being forced to walk the plank.

439
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,330
I think

440
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,500
we can only face them head on.

441
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,540
Animals are usually afraid of fire.

442
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,460
Through the blaze,

443
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,940
-we charge ahead.
-All right.

444
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:12,130
Okay. Let's make a gamble.

445
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,710
Come on.

446
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,750
Who is it?

447
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,660
Who is it?

448
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,380
Who is it?

449
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,980
Is it the walkie-talkie?

450
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,660
Someone is talking.

451
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,460
Are they Master San's men?

452
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,530
Pan Zi.

453
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,910
It's me,

454
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,080
Pan Zi.

455
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,580
Who are you?

456
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,720
I'll check it out.

457
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:15,790
Be careful.

458
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:49,770
Don't move.

459
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,240
I just drained your blood.

460
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,160
Just stay where you are.

461
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,550
Once we return,
I'll give you two pairs of good shoes.

462
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,670
Can you pay me instead?

463
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,370
There's no signal.

464
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,510
Right.

465
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,420
Just give me in cash.

466
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,700
Master San.

467
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,790
How do you feel?

468
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,790
It's fine.

469
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,690
Okay, we will just

470
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,850
take a break here.

471
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,470
We will move along once you're better.

472
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,030
By the way, Master San,

473
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
we're at the campsite
for more than three hours.

474
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,210
Mop and his men are impatient.

475
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,510
If we make them wait,

476
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,240
they might cause us trouble.

477
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,310
Those cowards

478
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,100
gave us plenty of
troubles on the way here.

479
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,880
They better not create any more problems.

480
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,910
If they turn against us,

481
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
we will have to deal with them seriously.

482
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:53,930
With the both of you here,

483
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,940
they'd not be able to keep up.

484
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:12,370
We're almost at the Palace
of Heavenly Queen Mother.

485
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,110
But here we are, burying
corpses at this stupid place.

486
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,900
I've been doing this for a long time,

487
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,520
but I'd never taken such a cowardly deal.

488
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,660
Mop.

489
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,210
You insisted on coming.

490
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,370
Get out of here.

491
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Mop.

492
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,060
I saw Wu San Xing enter Shades' tent.

493
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,250
I found it suspicious.

494
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,260
-I tried to eavesdrop.
-What did you hear?

495
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,580
He says, he's going to
deal with us seriously.

496
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,090
I don't think they planned
to give us our share.

497
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,530
What a lousy excuse of retrieving
gears before entering the palace.

498
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,900
They'd swiftly get rid of us
after using us.

499
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,920
Screw him.

500
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,820
Wu San Xing dares to trick me.

501
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,700
If this goes on,

502
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,500
all of us will be killed.

503
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,690
Let's do this.

504
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,220
Let's retrieve the equipment

505
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,460
and enter the palace on our own.

506
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,220
Mop.

507
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,260
Let's snag the equipment.

508
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,860
Use your head.

509
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,700
We can't win against
them if we snag head on.

510
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,860
Have you heard of the trick of
luring the tiger out of the mountains?

511
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,230
Luring the tigers?

512
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
We will split up.

513
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,180
I'll take some men to distract them.

514
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,350
Take the rest of the people
and steal the equipment.

515
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:18,150
Once we have the goods,

516
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,930
we will ditch them immediately.

517
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,660
Boss.

518
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,060
You're indeed a strategist.

519
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,340
You're the reincarnation of Zhu Ge Liang.

520
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,760
Do you know my full name?

521
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,360
Zhu Ge Mop.

522
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,940
By the way,

523
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,460
what's a strategist?

524
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,500
Master San.

525
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,970
What's the matter?

526
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,700
Master San.

527
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,990
By your orders,

528
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,060
we dug the graves.

529
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,050
Master San.

530
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,820
You've been devising a plan for a while.

531
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,380
When are we departing for the
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother?

532
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,220
We will leave once Shades recovers.

533
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,580
I don't mind,

534
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:13,290
but my buddies are getting impatient.

535
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,380
We're right at the entrance of
Palace of Heavenly Queen Mother.

536
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,780
You wouldn't let us enter,

537
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
it's pretty frustrating.

538
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,980
Think about it.

539
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,620
Don't hinder the rest of us

540
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,980
from making money just because of one man.

541
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,660
Besides,

542
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,480
they came a long way.

543
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,900
They have not received anything.

544
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,940
I've already given you the payment.

545
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,870
Master San.

546
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,470
We're all honest people.

547
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,770
We've had a fair share
of troubles along the way

548
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,620
and lost several men too.

549
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,420
With that meagre payment,

550
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,030
would you do it if it was you?

551
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,580
Since this is your stance,

552
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,870
we're not going to waste our time.

553
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,330
We quit.

554
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,340
You can't enter the palace without me.

555
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,890
The one who cannot enter is you.

556
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,180
While we're chatting here,

557
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,990
my men have taken all your equipment.

558
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,220
You should stop wasting your time

559
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,360
and get back home while you can.

560
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,260
Can you leave this place?

561
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,270
Attack!

562
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,340
Charge!

563
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,360
It gets ugly

564
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,110
when I fight.

565
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
If you'd like to part ways,

566
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,020
I'm not going to let you come for nothing.

567
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:37,690
At least,

568
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,570
I've to leave you with a lesson.

569
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,940
You were bitten by a snake.

570
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,980
You're still acting arrogant.

571
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,980
Attack.

572
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,460
Stop!

573
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,680
I said I'm teaching you a lesson.

574
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,300
Please cooperate.

575
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:03,330
Hold on.

576
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,820
Think carefully.

577
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,210
No matter how skilled you are,

578
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:08,930
you can't compete with our numbers.

579
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,980
Besides,

580
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,940
your equipment are with us.

581
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,070
Equipment?

582
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,880
Are you referring to these?

583
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,770
You...

584
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,830
You...

585
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,470
You played dirty.

586
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,830
So what if you're a fighter?

587
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,270
You're bullying honest people.

588
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,680
Honest people?

589
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,720
Do you know how to spell the word honest?

590
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,110
Do you want me

591
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,550
to carve it on your face?

592
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Ask him.

593
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,870
We had to do all the dirty work.

594
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,950
He's only paying us little to nothing.

595
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,750
Departing on this journey,

596
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,720
everyone has families.

597
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:54,590
How could you bully me?

598
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,830
Go on and cry.

599
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,190
Cry

600
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,510
and you will get nothing.

601
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,190
Get back to work.

602
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,060
Why is there no movement?

603
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,050
Is Pan Zi still up there?

604
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,890
Pan Zi.

605
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,580
Pan Zi.

606
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,500
Pan Zi.

607
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,370
I'll go have a look.

608
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,540
Be careful.

609
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,620
Blood.

610
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,940
Pan Zi is not up there anymore.

611
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:54,990
What?

612
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,590
This is a snake nest.

613
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,610
Run!

614
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,120
There's one here too.

615
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,180
There are so many snakes.

616
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,280
These dirty creatures,

617
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,450
I'm going to kill them.

618
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,630
A signal flare?

619
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,580
They are running away.

620
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:51,220
Pan Zi!

621
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,360
Run!

622
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,380
Pan Zi!

623
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,270
Let's go!

624
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,980
Pan Zi!

625
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,889
Pan Zi's backpack.

626
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,239
-Pan Zi.
-Pan Zi.

627
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,810
-Pan Zi!
-Pan Zi!

628
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,920
This one is golden.

629
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,780
Are there two of them?

630
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,489
-Run!
-Run!

631
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,290
Wu Xie, run!

632
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,010
Fatty!

633
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,270
That snake is violent.

634
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,380
I'm going to kill you!

635
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,409
-Pan Zi!
-Pan Zi!

636
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,280
Master Xiao San, the dagger!

637
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,290
Come at me.

638
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,800
Are you alright?

639
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,170
Come on!

640
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,470
Pan Zi, hit its vitals!

641
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,980
Pan Zi!

642
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,800
Pan Zi!

643
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,260
Where's your wound?

644
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,230
Go.

645
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,980
Go and find Master San.

646
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,520
-Pan Zi!
-Pan Zi!

647
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,090
Examine his wounds.

648
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,000
This looks like a bite from the python.

649
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,850
Although the pythons are vicious,

650
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,900
they are not poisonous.

651
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,660
If we stop the bleeding
and seal with wound in time,

652
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,920
he will be alright.

653
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,100
We need to hurry up and
get Master San to save Pan Zi.

654
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,260
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

655
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,780
It's broken.

656
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,140
I can't see the map.

657
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,100
We can't stay here anyway.

658
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,340
Let's go anywhere.

659
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,200
We might find our way out of luck.

660
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,500
Go this way.

661
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,550
Hold on.

662
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,470
Wu Xie, your physique is extraordinary,

663
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,830
but your luck is horrible.

664
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,210
Let's go this way.

665
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,630
Let's go.

666
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,670
Hang in there.

667
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,330
Are we on the right track?

668
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,370
It feels like we're making circles.

669
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,930
We picked the direction randomly.

670
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,530
It's fortunate that we could make it here.

671
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,030
What do we do now?

672
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,250
Where should we go?

673
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,930
Pass me the backpack.

674
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,170
I'll find the path.

675
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,740
Pan Zi.

676
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
A campsite.

677
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,280
Wu Xie!

678
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,550
I found the campsite!

679
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,140
Fatty.

680
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,750
It's my uncle's campsite.

681
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,910
Is it?

682
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,920
It's safe.

683
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,750
Leave the suturing to me.

684
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,950
Keep guard outside.

685
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:01,910
Okay.

686
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,970
<i>Why didn't they brush their
teeth after squeezing toothpaste?</i>

687
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,980
<i>Why are the footprints wet?</i>

688
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,440
Endure it.

689
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,640
Your wound needs to be disinfected.

690
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,130
Where's Wu Xie?

691
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,210
Don't worry.

692
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,690
He's keeping guard outside.

693
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,470
I'll stitch your wound up.

694
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,660
Then, I'll inject you with anti-tetanus.

695
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,180
There is no anaesthetic in here.

696
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,810
You need to endure the pain.

697
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,870
It's fine.

698
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,060
A minor injury like this,

699
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,190
I can take it.

700
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,880
Back in the days when
there was no anaesthetic,

701
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,990
people would place this on the head.

702
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,900
Then, hit it with a stick,

703
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,010
and the person would black out.

704
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,340
Do you want to...

705
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,430
What's the difference of
hitting me on the head directly?

706
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,670
That's enough. Give me a sip of wine.

707
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,110
Here.

708
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:32,830
Bite on this.

709
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,460
It's done.

710
00:41:03,704 --> 00:41:13,704
