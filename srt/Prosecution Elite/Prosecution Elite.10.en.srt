I'm sorry.

16
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,160
We can't allow it.

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,720
Why?

00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,160
you're the only one in this business?

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,440
So be it.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,830
We'll go if you can't do it.

Aren't you going to talk?

48
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,160
I miss our time in university.

49
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,830
Even after a fight,

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,750
we would go for spicy hotpot.

Unlike now.

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,950
I was very angry with you that day.

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,440
I almost called you

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
to ask you what was going on.

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,550
Luckily I held it in.

58
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,760
I want to ask you.

59
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,070
Are you having
a relationship with the lawyer

60
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,040
of Huiquan Corporation?

61
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,670
Or do you think

62
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
this evenly-matched

63
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,320
corporate lawyer is too free

64
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,760
and you want to practise with me?

65
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,760
I even think

66
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,110
it was my own fault.

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
I shouldn't have given up

68
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,830
Shi Xiaohu's account so easily.

69
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,350
Why didn't you just call

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
to interrogate me?

71
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,350
You could also throw a tantrum.

72
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,640
Do you think I didn't want to?

73
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,350
I would love to.

74
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,670
But coincidentally

75
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,440
Mr. Luo was with me

76
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
so he calmed me down.

77
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,950
He even gave me a lecture.

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,640
I even said he favored you.

79
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,160
Then I gave it a thought.

80
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,440
I think I can't

81
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,110
blame you on this matter.

82
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,230
You're working for our country.

83
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,040
Like me, you have no choice.

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,440
Everyone has their masters.

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
But there's something

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,950
you should apologize to me for.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,830
You should have told me immediately

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,440
so I could be prepared.

89
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,440
You always use surprise attacks

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,720
and make me work overtime.

91
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,550
Look at me.

92
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,230
My skin is getting bad.

93
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,830
I still need to find a boyfriend.

94
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,550
How can I

95
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,160
attract other people?

96
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,640
Why didn't you contact me?

97
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,040
Did you call me?

98
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,550
Because I was busy.

99
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,040
I have cases every day.

100
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,640
Do you really think I'm very free?

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,390
Yitang.

102
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,160
You look great today.

103
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,160
You know that

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,320
I care about you.

105
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,880
As if I don't care about you.

106
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
What a great meal.

107
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,640
This strawberry is very sweet.

108
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,320
Try it.

109
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,160
Stop wasting time on me.

110
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,950
I'll leave when Zhao Jikai is here.

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Zhao Jikai is quite sincere.

112
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,160
Not many men used to

113
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,440
beg for peace for you.

114
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,230
He called you?

115
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,830
He called me.

116
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,110
He said you two argued.

117
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,350
You're surely in a bad mood.

118
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,550
He told me to check on you.

119
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:34,760
Here he is.

120
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,040
You look good.

121
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,640
An Ni.

122
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,880
Thank you.

123
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Don't say that.

124
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,350
Don't forget that she's my best friend.

125
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,950
Even if you don't ask,

126
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,510
I'll still come and check on her.

127
00:06:59,550 --> 00:06:59,950
Alright.

128
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,230
I'll not disturb
your candle light dinner.

129
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,350
Enjoy your meal.

130
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,510
Take care.

132

(Where are you? I'll pick you up.)

133
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,670
No need.

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,510
No need to pick me up.

135
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,640
Send me the address.

136
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,920
I'll take a cab there.

139

Who is that?

140
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,640
Chairman is coming back.

141
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,230
Why are you

142
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,070
so unhappy about his return?

143
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,830
Xiao Mu'en is his favorite now.

144
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,320
I'm no longer as beloved.

145
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,550
Regarding the downsizing,

146
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,200
I'll get it done in two days.

147
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,720
Remember,

148
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,030
at work,

149
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
the two of us

150
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,150
can never have any problem.

151
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,320
If you have something to do,

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,640
go ahead.

153
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,150
I'll never be unreasonable again.

154
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,960
I'm wrong as well.

155
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,910
Too many things happened recently.

156
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,910
Sometimes I even

157
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,230
feel like I'm old now.

158
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,320
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,710
What old?

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,840
Move in with me.

161
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,640
Are you serious?

162
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,550
I want to see you every day.

163
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,030
This flower looks good.

164
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,840
Its name is very special.

165
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,670
Wow, Mr. Xiao.

166
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,470
You know about flowers as well.

167
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,440
When I was small,

168
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
there were many of these

169
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,910
planted near my house.

170
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Then I must test you.

171
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,960
What's its name?

172
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,030
Tigridiopalma.

173
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,440
It's similar

174
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,350
to a tiger.

175
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,840
What a formidable name.

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,230
Pretty and formidable.

177
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,640
Tigridiopalma.

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,230
Listen.

179
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,960
Please get us a few

180
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,520
of your signature dishes.

181
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,470
We're two.

182
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,150
-Not too much.
-Okay.

183
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,230
To avoid wasting.

184
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,150
As for alcohol...

185
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
She can't drink alcohol.

186
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,030
Forget it.

187
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,960
Hurry up, please.

188
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,350
Thank you.

189
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,760
What's wrong?

190
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,840
Tigridiopalma.

191
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,080
It grows in the area
of Guangdong, China.

192
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,840
Li Yitang said that

193
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,350
you're from Jiangzhe Area.

194
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
How did you

195
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,840
grow up with this kind of flower?

196
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
You'll hear

197
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,230
100 versions

198
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,440
of Xiao Mu'en from 100 people.

199
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,350
This is even more interesting.

200
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,320
Which version of Xiao Mu'en

201
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,790
is the real Xiao Mu'en?

202
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,910
What do you mean by real

203
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
and fake?

204
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,880
Sometimes I find it

205
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,200
hard to determine.

206
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,550
Just like me,

207
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,230
I grew up

208
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,030
in Guangdong.

209
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
After junior high school,

210
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,230
I moved to Jiangzhe Area.

211
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,960
But it didn't take long

212
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,150
until I moved abroad.

213
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,520
In Guangdong,

214
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,960
I lived truly

215
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,960
for more than 10 years.

216
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,000
But now that I think about it,

217
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,960
the only thing I can recall suddenly

218
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,910
and impressed me deeply

219
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
seems to be

220
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,840
the scent of Tigridiopalma.

221
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,640
Its scent is very special.

222
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,440
It calms people.

223
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,710
When I think about its scent,

224
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,840
it makes me recall

225
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,030
the times I spent

226
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,230
with my mother.

227
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,230
But in Jiangzhe Area,

228
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,960
although I lived there

229
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,150
for only one and a half years,

230
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,230
but the face of everyone

231
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,030
I've met,

232
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,670
even

233
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,150
every sentence they said to me

234
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
are still fresh in my memory.

235
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,350
Tell me,

236
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,760
which one of these

237
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,840
is real and fictional?

238
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,710
After your story,

239
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:08,440
the scent

240
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,550
of this flower has become more extreme.

241
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,670
Don't you want to know

242
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
why this restaurant has
flowers from Guangdong?

243
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,110
This job of yours

244
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,760
makes you want to go
to the bottom of everything.

245
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,550
You must find the truth of everything.

246
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,710
Why do you care?

247
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,230
Isn't it good enough that

248
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,400
we can enjoy the scent

249
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,200
of this flower here?

250
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,320
Well said.

251
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,790
James.

252
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,550
I'm on the flight back.

253
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,910
What's going on?

254
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,470
Are you kidding me?

255
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,150
The investment

256
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,760
must be in our account

257
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,910
by the end of this month.

258
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,960
These are rumors.

259
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,910
I must tell you once again,

260
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,080
our group

261
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,030
is stable,

262
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,470
just

263
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,550
and legal.

264
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,760
We're even in a good relationship

265
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
with the local government

266
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,960
and the mainstream media.

267
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,710
These two are baseless accusations.

268
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,030
It's none of our business.

269
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,710
Shoot.

270
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,470
James.

271
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,030
Let me tell you.

272
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,960
This App of ours

273
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,880
has the best matrix

274
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,710
in Huibo and live platform

275
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,910
among other products.

276
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,150
My current negotiation term

277
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,470
is to have a specific fixed investment.

278
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,150
Singapore,

279
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,230
USA and Japan.

280
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,030
You can't reduce your investment share.

281
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,440
Not even a single cent.

282
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:21,557
(Huiquan)

283
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,543
(PSBC: WeBank has credited 3,000 yuan
to your account through a transfer.)

284
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,590
Not bad. The money is coming back.

285
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,910
Hello, Zhanpeng.

286
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,230
How is it, Yonggang?

287
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,440
I didn't lie to you, right?

288
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,840
It has only been a few days

289
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,550
and your 6000 yuan

290
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,910
has already made 3000 yuan of profit.

291
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,760
You're very lucky.

292
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,640
Over the past few days
the European market

293
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,470
was fluctuating.

294
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,440
We made a fortune with short sale.

295
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,030
Alright.

296
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,000
You may get back your principal.

297
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,880
No.

298
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,840
I don't need the 6000 yuan urgently.

299
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,030
Leave it there for a few more days.

300
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,350
A few more days.

301
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,350
Make more money.

302
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,030
I'll buy you drinks.

303
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,440
Yonggang.

304
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,960
Who do you think I am?

305
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,440
I let you take some advantage

306
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,760
because you're my old friend.

307
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,640
I don't care

308
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,350
for a bit of money.

309
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,030
You didn't trust me.

310
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,550
I accepted your money

311
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,030
because I was angry.

312
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,710
You know?

313
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,080
Okay.

314
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,760
That's it.

315
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,350
Take your principal back.

316
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,590
Alright.

317
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,840
Zhanpeng.

318
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,030
Zhanpeng.

319
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,440
I was wrong.

320
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,760
I was short-sighted.

321
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,520
Listen.

322
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,030
Give me a number.

323
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,960
How much money should I invest

324
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,350
so you can accept it?

325
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,710
At least...

326
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,550
a million yuan.

327
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,760
Zhanpeng.

328
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,960
Don't fool around.

329
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,550
I don't have so much money.

330
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,550
What is this?

331
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,640
A bank book.

332
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,440
Haven't you seen it before?

333
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:00,640
Wait.

334
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,670
How did you get so much money?

335
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,030
I earned it.

336
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,030
Here's the thing.

337
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,470
For the sake of our friendship,

338
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,960
please make some allowance.

339
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,400
Don't take a million yuan,

340
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,550
but 500,000 yuan.

341
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,230
I'll invest it

342
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,110
for just 10 days.

343
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
When there's a profit,

344
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,230
I'll give you a 20% share.

345
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,110
What about that?

346
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,230
What a rare sight.

347
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,960
It's neither birthday

348
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
nor occasions.

349
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,110
Yet Xiaojiao is buying us a meal.

350
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,110
When she buys us a meal,

351
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,320
it's either good news

352
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,760
or bad news.

353
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,200
The two of you...

354
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,110
Speak up.

355
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,000
What happened?

356
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,760
Something big.

357
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,960
Say it.

358
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,030
Why are you playing tricks?

359
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,440
I can't eat like that.

360
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,230
Sit tight.

361
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,150
Okay.

362
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,640
I...

363
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,350
am pregnant again.

364
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,840
What?

365
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,230
Again?

366
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,440
- You're pregnant again?
- You're pregnant again?

367
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,110
Not bad.

368
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,230
You're having a second child.

369
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,310
Great.

370
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,110
I didn't expect it either.

371
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,350
Yonggang must be very happy.

372
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,760
I haven't told him.

373
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,160
When I just found out,

374
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,760
I hesitated

375
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,160
if I should keep it.

376
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,310
You know about

377
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,830
what happened.

378
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,160
We're under a lot of pressure.

379
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,350
Besides, I see

380
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,470
how hard Yonggang works without an end.

381
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,800
I feel bad for him.

382
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
If we have another child,

383
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,760
we're

384
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
asking him to die.

385
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,830
But I don't have the heart.

386
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,760
It's my baby after all.

387
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,110
How could I?

388
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,000
So I've decided

389
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,470
to keep it.

390
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:40,920
How great.

391
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:44,430
No.

392
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,070
You can't drink coffee
when you're pregnant.

393
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,400
Who's the experienced one?

394
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,230
The doctor said,

395
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,520
a little coffee is fine.

396
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Besides, you forgot that

397
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,950
when I was pregnant with Jianing,

398
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,520
I was

399
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,280
eating well as usual every day.

400
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,950
I was fit

401
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,430
and ran faster than you two.

402
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,830
She's very fit.

403
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,160
But you still shouldn't drink so much.

404
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,110
Caffeine is bad for babies.

405
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,640
I know.

406
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,710
Alright.

407
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,470
Now

408
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,950
An Ni and I don't have to fight.

409
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,760
We were fighting about

410
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,230
who should be your child's godmom.

411
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,230
This is great.

412
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:11,640
An Ni.

413
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,640
You'll take the first one.

414
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
I'll take the second one.

415
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,640
I reserved.

416
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,520
Reserve what?

417
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,560
You should hurry up.

418
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,830
The two of you should hurry up.

419
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
You're eyeing on my children

420
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,950
and giving them stress.

421
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,110
Eat more.

422
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,230
Take this.

423
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,230
Eat mine too.

424
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,350
What do you mean?

425
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,950
Annoying.

426
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,920
(Practicing social responsibility)
Today,

427
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,560
we called for

428
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,920
a gathering with the managers

429
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,110
of every outlet

430
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,230
to have this meeting

431
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
to mainly

432
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,640
discuss about

433
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,160
some problems and challenges

434
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,040
faced by Jiangcheng Telecom lately.

435
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,920
I believe,

436
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,520
everyone knows that

437
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,230
the telecom and online frauds

438
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,040
that happen

439
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,230
in the whole area

440
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,280
of Jiangcheng are emerging endlessly.

441
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,950
There's even

442
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,350
some foreign

443
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,920
criminal groups behind this.

444
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,160
Everyone,

445
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,110
as the person
in charge of the basic level,

446
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,710
I know that

447
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,310
it was stressful

448
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,760
for everyone

449
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,230
to work with
the prosecution and the police

450
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,760
while attending to

451
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,760
the daily preventive work.

452
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,230
However,

453
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,830
the preventive work

454
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,160
against telecom and online frauds

455
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,760
can't stop.

456
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,640
Not only that,

457
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,280
we must also keep upgrading it.

458
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,520
Everyone shall take note.

459
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,560
Right now,

460
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,830
other than

461
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,640
continue cooperating

462
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,710
with the prosecution and the police

463
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,040
to arrest the criminals

464
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,350
who are dormant

465
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,160
in Jiangcheng area,

466
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,430
we must also

467
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,950
work on the relevant legal publicity.

468
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,950
So that the folks

469
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,640
can have corresponding

470
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,830
legal awareness

471
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,950
while using telecom network.

472
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,920
At the same time,

473
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,230
they can be more alert.

474
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,830
I know that

475
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,400
some of you

476
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,710
are feeling dread

477
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,160
and think that

478
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,310
it's hard enough to complete

479
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,760
the current tasks.

480
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,350
And now

481
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,430
we have to

482
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,760
work on things outside of our duties.

483
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,950
You may think that we're

484
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,160
following the process

485
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,040
and being bureaucratic.

486
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,350
But, everyone,

487
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
legal publicity

488
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,950
and

489
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,310
daily preventive work
is equally important.

490
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,040
We can even say that

491
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
the former

492
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,160
is more important than the latter.

493
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,230
Jiang Xin.

494
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,760
You are

495
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,230
an experienced member
of Jiangcheng Telecom.

496
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,710
The outlet you're in charge of

497
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,640
has been rated as
progressive many times.

498
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,430
Your daughter, Prosecutor An,

499
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,830
is the famous and one of the
top ten prosecutors in Jiangcheng.

500
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,560
Therefore,

501
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,830
you're not only
the hero of Jiangcheng Telecom,

502
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,950
you're also the mother of a hero.

503
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I'm thinking about

504
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,160
having your outlet

505
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,520
lead a good head start

506
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,430
to hold the first presentation.

507
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,830
Me?

508
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,760
It's decided.

509
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,110
What does everyone think?

510
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,950
Good.

511
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:34,427
(Exclusive official partner)

512
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,950
I hardly sit in your car.

513
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,950
You work without end day and night,

514
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,640
always come home at midnight

515
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,350
when your dad and I are sleeping.

516
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,520
In the morning,

517
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,350
you leave before we wake up.

518
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,350
From day to night,

519
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,920
I feel like we're only two in our world,

520
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,430
right?

521
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,880
Mom, stop complaining.

522
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,350
I know what you mean.

523
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,110
After I'm busy with this round,

524
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,350
I'll take you to good food,

525
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,920
okay?

526
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,950
Forget it.

527
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,350
This promise

528
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,920
was made last year
and will last until next year.

529
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,160
Ah.

530
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,830
I can't digest this.

531
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,040
Troubled times.

532
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,310
Why are you so troubled?

533
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,760
You're going to retire next year.

534
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,800
Just hold on to your last post, mom.

535
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,230
Don't stress yourself too much.

536
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,310
Who wouldn't want that?

537
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,760
But right now

538
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,160
cybercrime is rampant.

539
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
Our telecom company

540
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,830
is being troubled by this every day.

541
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,830
Our superiors keep reminding us

542
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,430
to start legal education in our outlets

543
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,920
to enhance people's awareness.

544
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,640
Ah.

545
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,560
My head hurts just thinking about this.

546
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,280
Hey.

547
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,560
An Ni.

548
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,830
You can help me.

549
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,950
How can I help?

550
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,070
You're one of the top ten prosecutors

551
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,520
of Jiangcheng.

552
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
The public speaking held by you

553
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
is going to stand out.

554
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,950
The effect will be great.

555
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,830
No way, mom.

556
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,040
I'm too busy recently.

557
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,040
I don't have time to prepare this.

558
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,040
Besides,

559
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,920
I have to report this to Prosecutor Guo.

560
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,040
It's troublesome.

561
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,760
I know one person.

562
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,640
If he is willing to help,

563
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,560
your event will be very successful.

564
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,350
He?

565
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,350
Who?

566
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,230
Why are the telecom outlets

567
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,920
so strict now?

568
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,560
We just want to have a sim card.

569
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,560
They want a real name and a photograph,

570
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,830
and no blacklist.

571
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,350
I've been running around

572
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
but I didn't get any.

573
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,040
Aren't they

574
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,110
taking away our livelihood?

575
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,680
Forget it.

576
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,230
I understand now.

577
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,920
We can't make money this way.

578
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,110
Telecom companies are so strict.

579
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,830
Prosecutors and police are against us.

580
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,640
We can't keep doing this.

581
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,350
We should

582
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,640
just stay put

583
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,280
and find a job
in the electronic factory.

584
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,760
Bao.

585
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,040
Look at yourself.

586
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Can you stay put and work honestly?

587
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,040
Let me tell you.

588
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,520
Having a job is impossible.

589
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,950
I can never have a job.

590
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,680
What do you want?

591
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,160
We can't get sim cards.

592
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,310
Don't even think about finding one.

593
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,430
The sales keep telling
their customers that

594
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,160
reselling sim cards is illegal.

595
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,560
You can't even lend it out.

596
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,950
I think

597
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
anyone with a slight sense

598
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,640
will never sell you his sim card.

599
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,880
Bao.

600
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,350
I still have a way.

601
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,230
We still have a line

602
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,230
that connects to foreign countries.

603
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,950
What do you mean?

604
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,040
I have a boss.

605
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,350
Everyone calls him Tang.

606
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,800
He's not into something small.

607
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,760
He's in big business.

608
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,760
Why don't I

609
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
take you to see him?

610
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:29,560
Big business?

611
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,680
Yo.

612
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,430
Tang.

613
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,520
Are you busy?

614
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,520
You brat,

615
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,640
who told you to come here?

616
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,040
I told you not to come here.

617
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,040
Tang.

618
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,070
I have no choice.

619
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,110
I really have no choice.

620
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,830
It's getting harder
to collect sim cards.

621
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,640
Telecom companies

622
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,310
don't give us any opportunity.

623
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,830
If this goes on,

624
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,430
we will starve.

625
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,350
Help us.

626
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,110
Guide us.

627
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,230
Show us a good way.

628
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,560
If you have no way,

629
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,830
I'll do whatever you do.

630
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,920
Do what I do?

631
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:04,160
Yes.

632
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:04,920
Hmm.

633
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,110
You aren't

634
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,590
able to do my work.

635
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:07,920
Hey.

636
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,640
No.

637
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,350
Tang.

638
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,230
Do you have the heart

639
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,470
to see these rascals

640
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,560
starve to death?

641
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,560
Okay.

642
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,640
Since you're so pitiful,

643
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,560
I'll give you a chance.

644
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,760
Right now

645
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,350
I have a big business for you.

646
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,710
Are you interested?

647
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Yes.

648
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,830
What work is that?

649
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,310
Everyone, come and have a look.

650
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,950
Have a look.

651
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,640
(Special promotion with free gifts)
The manufacturers are having sales.

652
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,560
Great rewards.

653
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,710
Our products are all for free.

654
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,920

00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,640
Our products

656
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,520
are so awesome.

657

(Special promotion with free gifts)

658
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,110
Without doing anything

659
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,110
I can get these for free?

660
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,230
Everything is for free.

661
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,710
Have a look.

662
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,950
Everything is for free.

663
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,830
Free.

664
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:50,950
Sir, madam.

665
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,560
Have a look.

666
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,230
Have a look.

667
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,710
Sir, madam.

668
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,160
Just send us the verification code.

669
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,590
Madam.

670
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,560
What's up, Bao?

671
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,430
Is this the big business Tang gave you?

672
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,710
You're not professional enough.

673
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,110
Bao.

674
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,040
Do you think we're really doing charity?

675
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,070
Giving out things for free

676
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,280
to the old people?

677
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,640
Bao.

678
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,070
I'll be honest with you.

679
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,640
Tang has a foreign boss.

680
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,920
They're getting ready on both ends.

681
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,830
First is sim cards.

682
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,040
Second is network.

683
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,640
Now they need online accounts.

684
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,430
A sim card

685
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,230
that's bound to a registered account

686
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,830
cost more than 1000 yuan.

687
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,280
More than 1000 yuan?

688
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,310
Do you think they're silly?

689
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,160
Why would they

690
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,560
sell their online account to you?

691
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,470
That's why

692
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
we choose the old people as target.

693
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,560
They can't operate their phones well.

694
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,920
They don't understand this at all.

695
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,430
They're also penny wise.

696
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,920
For the sake of some basins

697
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,560
and detergents,

698
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,160
they'll let us

699
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
register accounts for them.

700
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,560
You don't believe it?

701
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,310
I'll demonstrate it for you.

702
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,110
Sir, madam.

703
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,680
Sir, madam.

704
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,160
Have a look.

705
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,640
Everything is for free.

706
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Free.

707
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,430
Young man.

708
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,040
Are these really for free?

709
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,760
All for free.

710
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,920
Everything is for free.

711
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,160
Sir, what do you think about this basin?

712
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,830
Don't we need to do anything?

713
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,950
How is this possible?

714
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,640
Sir.

715
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,920
It's easy.

716
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,640
You only need to register on your phone.

717
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,560
Once you receive the verification code,

718
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
let us know, that's all.

719
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,040
This is an old phone.

720
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,830
It can't go online.

721
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,040
How do we register?

722
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,560
No problem.

723
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,110
We'll help you.

724
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,350
Help me have a look.

725
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:20,560
Okay.

726
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:20,710
Here.

727
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,520
Madam, it's done.

728
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:21,830
Madam.

729
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,430
Okay.

730
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,880
Thank you.

731
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,520
Here, madam.

732
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,070
Here, sir.

733
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,040
The verification code is received.

734
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,710
That's all.

735
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,040
Here.

736
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,110
Your detergent.

737
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,950
I understand it now.

738
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,920
You're making use

739
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,430
of these old people

740
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,950
to register accounts for scamming.

741
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,430
Once it's busted,

742
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,920
police will come for them.

743
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,950
Your boss would be gone by then.

744
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,230
Am I right?

745
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,350
Keep it low.

746
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,710
But I don't understand something.

747
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,560
Why must you do it

748
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,110
near this outlet?

749
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,230
Bao.

750
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,430
You don't get it.

751
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,710
This is called agglomeration effect.

752
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,760
The old people here

753
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,950
only use handphone for elderly.

754
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,310
They reload their
phone credit in an outlet.

755
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,760
This outlet

756
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,640
is the biggest one around here.

757
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,040
The effect here is the best.

758
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,640
Don't just stand here.

759
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,430
Help out.

760
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,950
Keep working.

761
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,190
Madam, don't worry.

762
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,070
Help me.

763
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,070
Okay.

764
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,310
(Information Counter)
Xu.

765
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,950
What's the occasion today?

766
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,230
Our outlet
doesn't have any event, right?

767
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,350
I don't know either.

768
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,000
They said outside of our outlet

769
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
someone is giving out free gifts.

770
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,760
There's no such thing as free gifts.

771
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Hello, madam.

772
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,640
Is there a promotion?

773
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,950
No.

774
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,830
As long as

775
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,310
you let them register
an account with your phone,

776
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,040
you can get things for free.

777
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,520
That person looks familiar.

778
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,040
Isn't he that young man

779
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,950
who wanted to get a sim card from us?

780
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,230
You're right.

781
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
That's the person.

782
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,830
He was here every second day.

783
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,230
He must be a sim card dealer.

784
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,760
-Call the police.
-Okay.

785
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:08,187
(Public Security)

786
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,590
You again.

787
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,800
Kui...

788
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,520
What Kui?

789
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,430
Call me officer.

790
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,710
You were just released.

791
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,640
Yet you don't stay put.

792
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,830
Are you causing trouble?

793
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,560
No.

794
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,230
No, I...

795
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,190
I didn't cause any trouble.

796
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,110
I...

797
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,280
No, I...

798
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,590
I don't want to go back there.

799
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,350
I...

800
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,160
I can provide important clues.

801
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,040
I'll tell you about my superior.

802
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,640
I knew it.

803
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,560
You didn't confess everything last time.

804
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,470
Besides,

805
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,070
those that scammed the old people

806
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,830
were your subordinates, right?

807
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,190
No, we're not related.

808
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,310
They...

809
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,070
They have a boss.

810
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,760
His name is...

811
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,400
Tang.

812
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,040
Tang?

813
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,470
Okay.

814
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,920
Take him back.

815
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,520
Kui.

816
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,160
I...

817
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:56,578
(Huiquan)

818
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Where are you going?

819
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,350
Mr. Xiao.

820
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,520
We're leaving.

821
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,160
Leave?

822
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:11,950
What do you mean?

823
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,640
Don't you know?

824
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,710
We're fired.

825
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,920
This morning

826
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,880
Mr. Zhao's secretary informed us.

827
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,880
They told PR

828
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,070
to fire us

829
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,680
instantly.

830
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,710
Tell me.

831
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
We've worked hard for so many years.

832
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,430
Yet they fired us at will.

833
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,280
Mr. Xiao.

834
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,880
Take care.

835
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,280
(Promote awareness in preventing scams,)
Thank you, China Telecom,

836
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,950
(enhance the ability to detect fraud)
for giving me this opportunity

837
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,110
to talk to you.

838
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:43,950
I

839
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,880
was also forced here

840
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,560
by my student.

841
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,070
I haven't prepared well.

842
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,350
But I have this opportunity

843
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,310
(Luo Jiangxiao)
to talk to you,

844
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,350
remind you,

845
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,920
and increase

846
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,280
your awareness against
telecom and online frauds.

847
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,800
At the same time,

848
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,520
I can also

849
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,920
communicate with the anti-fraud staff

850
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,880
working on the frontline.

851
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,640
I'm very happy about it.

852
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,760
Let me talk to you

853
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,470
about the various types

854
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,470
of telecom and online frauds.

855
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,950
So everyone will have an idea

856
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,680
and take the first line of defense.

857
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,880
How to prevent

858
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,190
telecom and online frauds?

859
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,470
Remember three things.

860
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,040
First,

861
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,070
don't believe in free lunch.

862
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,710
The fraud criminals

863
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,880
know that some people

864
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,040
are petty and cheap.

865
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,470
So they set up a trap.

866
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,950
When victims

867
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,400
receive such calls

868
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,230
or messages,

869
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,560
they think

870
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,070
they're the world luckiest person.

871
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,160
Benefits blinded their thoughts.

872
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,470
That makes them the easy target.

873
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,400
Secondly,

874
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,590
protect your identity.

875
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,560
For example,

876
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:07,760
when some people
withdraw money at the ATM,

877
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,950
they throw the receipt away

878
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:12,470
right after checking it.

879
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,680
This provides opportunities

880
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,070
to the fraud criminals.

881
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,280
Therefore, we must

882
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,560
protect the identity information of
us and our family.

883
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,350
Especially the old people.

884
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,230
If you want to withdraw money,

885
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,070
don't trust outsiders.

886
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,280
You may

887
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,470
ask for help from the bank staff.

888
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,070
Third, verify real identity.

889
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,950
If someone you know send you a text

890
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,190
on WeChat, SMS or QQ,

891
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,160
asking you to transfer money

892
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,590
due to certain reasons,

893
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,950
remember

894
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,400
to call the person involved

895
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,830
and to ask if the incident is real.

896
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,040
If

897
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,760
you can't reach that person,

898
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,680
you may verify

899
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,710
with his colleagues, friends or family.

900
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,870
Don't be reckless.

901
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,470
As the saying goes,

902
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,760
real knowledge

903
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
comes from practice.

904
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,150
Today

905
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,630
the representatives of the telecom group

906
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,360
are also here.

907
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,320
They are

908
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,800
the staff who fight on the frontline.

909
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,840
They have

910
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,760
a great number
of real cases as examples.

911
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,950
Give them a round of applause

912
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,430
to welcome them onto the stage

913
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:41,150
and share with us,

914
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:41,630
okay?

915
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,470
Okay.

916
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,560
Mr. Xiao.

917
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,230
Please come in.

918
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,150
Ms. Li.

919
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,950
I came to ask you

920
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,080
(List of laid-off employees)
what this name list is about.

921
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,670
Why

922
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:59,360
is the personnel change

923
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,470
mainly aimed

924
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,950
at my old team in Green Broadcasting?

925
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:03,870
I would like to know

926
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,670
what the company thinks about them.

927
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,760
Mr. Xiao.

928
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,150
Take a seat first.

929
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:16,870
Here's the thing.

930
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,360
I hope you
don't overthink on this matter.

931
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,280
Personnel change

932
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:22,000
is a normal procedure of the company.

933
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,560
Such a big corporate

934
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,150
surely have personnel change, right?

935
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,950
If the old ones don't go,
new ones have no place.

936
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,950
They have skills and

937
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,670
firm ideas.

938
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,230
The company fired them

939
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,190
without reasons nor warning.

940
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,280
I don't understand.

941
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,630
Personnel arrangement is
not within my scope of authority.

942
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,040
This is the company's decision.

943
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,760
If it's the company's decision

944
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,560
or Mr. Yin's decision,

945
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
then I have nothing to say.

946
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,950
If this is Mr. Zhao's decision,

947
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,390
then I suggest

948
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,000
you to fire me

949
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,280
and let them stay.

950
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,280
They're all talented.

951
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,670
They've done nothing wrong.

952
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,470
That's not necessary.
Compared to leaving,

953
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,630
you actually have better choices.

954
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,760
What do you mean?

955
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,150
Mr. Xiao.

956
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,630
You're a smart person.

957
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,870
You have strong capabilities.

958
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,670
I of course don't wish that

959
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,870
anything could harm you.

960
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:18,760
But I also don't wish
that your recklessness

961
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,360
would affect Mr. Zhao.

962
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:26,280
I never want to harm anyone.

963
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,470
Fine.

964
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:32,150
Since you can't settle this matter,

965
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,360
I shall talk to the chairman.

966
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,950
Well said.

967
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,360
I'm benefited a lot.

968
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,560
How was it,

969
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:54,870
mom?

970
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,670
Ah.

971
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,230
An Ni.

972
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,230
Our eyes have opened.

973
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,870
I have to thank you.

974
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,230
Mr. Luo

975
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,760
gave an excellent speech.

976
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,670
Very comprehensive.

977
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,280
I was thinking about

978
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,800
inviting him

979
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,670
to educate us again.

980
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,150
Mom, you...

981
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,630
Forget it.

982
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:12,840
Mr. Luo came this time

983
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,190
for my sake.

984
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
He's very busy.

985
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
We can't keep troubling him.

986
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:17,760
You're right.

987
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,280
Hello, speaking.

988
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,080
I get it.

989
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,190
Okay.

990
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,430
I'll be back now.

991
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,150
What? You have to go back?

992
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,360
A while ago,

993
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,280
police arrested

994
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,870
a group of young men

995
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,670
near our outlet,

996
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,840
who scammed

997
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,280
old people to register

998
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,430
online accounts.

999
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,870
Since then,

1000
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,630
our superior has arranged

1001
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,670
on-site inspection
throughout the region.

1002
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,870
Once anything is found,
we call the police immediately.

1003
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,430
Just now

1004
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,560
our telecom company called

1005
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,080
and said the monitoring center

1006
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,870
found something odd.

1007
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,630
They told me to go back and investigate.

1008
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,280
Why don't you go home first?

1009
00:37:59,360 --> 00:37:59,840
An Ni.

1010
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,280
I'll go back when I'm done.

1011
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,040
Okay.

1012
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,360
I shall go back first.

1013
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,000
I have to look up some information.

1014
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,560
Okay.

1015
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,600
Mom, I see that Mr. Luo
is enjoying his conversations.

1016
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,870
Please thank him on my behalf.

1017
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,560
Okay.

1018
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,870
Go home soon, mom.

1019
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:12,520
Okay.

1020
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,630
I'll go first.

1021
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:29,094
(Intelligent Cloud Network
Dispatch Operation Center)

1022
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,630
Sir.

1023
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,760
There has been

1024
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,800
an unreasonable multiplication

1025
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,390
of calls in this area.

1026
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,670
I suspect that

1027
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,470
in this area

1028
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,360
someone is using
a modem pool to commit frauds.

1029
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,360
Have you called the police?

1030
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,670
Yes, I did.

1031
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,670
I've sent the location

1032
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,670
to the police.

1033
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,080
How's the adaptability?

1034
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,150
Not bad.

1035
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,560
It has been running on
full capacity for more than 10 hours.

1036
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,760
No problem at all.

1037
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,150
Our previous

1038
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,800
estimation was too conservative.

1039
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,150
According to this speed,

1040
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,910
we can make

1041
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,360
20 to 30 thousands calls a day.

1042
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,840
In a month,

1043
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,390
we can make a million calls.

1044
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,840
A million calls?

1045
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,040
If a million calls are made.

1046
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,560
how much money will we earn?

1047
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,470
Don't move.

1048
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,470
Run.

1049
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,280
Arrest him.

1050
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:45,950
Is there more?

1051
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,600
One...

1052
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,670
One ran away via the staircase.

1053
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:05,739
(Scrap Collection Center)

1054
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,390
Mr. Yin.

1055
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,280
President.

1056
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:28,870
Mu'en.

1057
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,230
I haven't seen you for a while.

1058
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,470
Have you been working a lot?

1059
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,430
You don't look quite happy.

1060
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:43,360
Just right.

1061
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,150
Mr. Yin.

1062
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,600
I have to report something to you.

1063
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,670
My old team in Green Broadcasting

1064
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,280
is all fired.

1065
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,150
Do you know about this?

1066
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,080
Hmm...

1067
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,560
I don't know about this.

1068
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,950
Whose decision is that?

1069
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,950
Zhao Jikai.

1070
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,870
Oh.

1071
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:07,950
Okay.

1072
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
I get it now.

1073
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Let me handle this.

1074
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,080
Don't take this personally.

1075
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,080
The company still needs you.

1076
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,630
I get it.

1077
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:18,280
Okay.

1078
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,600
Today

1079
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,760
Deputy Mayor Xu
is coming for an inspection.

1080
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,150
Let me get this matter done.

1081
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,150
Then,

1082
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,150
I'll ask you

1083
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,280
and Zhao Jikai to come to my home.

1084
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,950
I've prepared some good tea

1085
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,430
so you two can have a talk.

1086
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,600
Okay.

1087
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,230
Okay.

1088
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,230
Alright.

1089
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,950
See you later.

1090
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,760
It has nothing to do with me.

1091
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,360
You saw it.

1092
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,080
I saw them.

1093
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,760
He rushed over suddenly.

1094
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,390
It has nothing to do with me.

1095
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:46,950
Not me.

1096
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,470
Not me.

1097
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,360
Please be my witness.

1098
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,870
It has nothing to do with me.

1099
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,870
He's dying.

1100
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:53,870
Here.

1101
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,390
You take him back first.

1102
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,470
I'll stand guard here.

1103
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,150
How is he?

1104
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,080
It has nothing to do with me.

1105
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,870
It wasn't me.

1106
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,950
Call 120.

1107
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,470
Who was the one who ran out?

1108
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,950
He was our employer.

1109
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,670
Officer.

1110
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,760
We're just working here.

1111
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,630
As for others,

1112
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,190
we have no idea at all.

1113
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,040
Didn't he mention

1114
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,760
why he needed the modem pool?

1115
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,080
I'm here just to work.

1116
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,230
This...

1117
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,280
How would we know?

1118
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,280
Hmm...

1119
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,870
I only heard him
mentioned on a phone call.

1120
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,230
I think...

1121
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,000
It was...

1122
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,560
Wei.

1123
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:41,670
And something else.

1124
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,000
Country F Harbor City or so on.

1125
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:45,870
Yes.

1126
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,670
He also mentioned

1127
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,470
Xin.
