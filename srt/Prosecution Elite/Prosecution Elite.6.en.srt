(Evidence Transfer Notice)

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Come in.

17
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,440
Sir, you are looking for me?

18
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:47,921
Take a seat.

19
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:54,721
Do take a seat.

20
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:59,921
Regarding the litigation filed

21
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,601
by Shi Xiaohu's mother,

22
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
we decided to hold

23
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,880
a hearing.

24
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:10,000
We will invite both parties
to conduct a talk

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,000
to mediate the dispute.

26
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:16,520
The court verdict is legally binding.

27
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:18,601
And there is no problem whatsoever

28
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:20,481
with the laws applied.

29
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:23,681
Since it involves Huiquan,

30
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:25,121
we treat this matter very seriously.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,000
This case

32
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:28,401
will reflect our capability

33
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,401
to protect

34
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,041
home-grown businesses

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
and to nurture

36
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,321
urbanization.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,241
I do think that you

38
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,160
should preside over the hearing.

39
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:43,720
Zhan Mei

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,520
can be very opinionated.

41
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:48,321
You have to be prepared for it.

42
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:50,201
You might need

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,241
to recuse yourself.

44
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:55,920
I will bring recuse up

45
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,481
even if you didn't remind me here.

46
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,920
After all, this concerns my job ethics.

47
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:04,041
However, I still think that I should
release a statement.

48
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
I studied and verified

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,761
the documents, the court verdict,

50
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,160
and the evidence

51
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,601
submitted

52
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:11,561
by Zhan Mei.

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I have visited Zhan Mei's house too.

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,841
It's

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,481
a normal, typical case.

56
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,121
But to resolve

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:20,961
the dispute,

58
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:23,160
it can be quite challenging.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,681
However, I do hope

60
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,800
that I can

61
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,880
retrieve Shi Xiaohu's game account.

62
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,961
We'll see whether

63
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,720
he did commit

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,401
copyright infringement or not.

65
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,160
Li Yitang works for Huiquan

66
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:39,080
while I work for the Procuratorate.

67
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,481
If the higher-up

68
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,201
wants me to recuse myself

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I shall comply.

70
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Good.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,961
Gather everyone now

72
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,360
and try to reach a consensus.

73
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:57,841
Resolve the conflict.

74
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,280
Yes, sir.

Pick it up already.

81
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,681
Is it from a debt collector?

82
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:49,281
No, from Li Yitang.

83
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,441
(Hi.)

84
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:54,600
(The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.)

85

(Please try again later.)

86
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,281
What the hell, An Ni?

87
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,441
You're being way too cautious here.

88
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,841
Maybe she just wants

89
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:07,881
to hang out with you.

90
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:09,920
Friends respect

91
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,281
each other's boundary.

92
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,121
I will hang out with her
once this case is over.

93
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:15,200
Do you have to do that?

94
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,881
Yes, she is

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,600
attending the hearing.

96
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,881
But you don't have to avoid her
like a plague.

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,800
Right, Mr. Wang?

98
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Darn it.

99
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:26,881
I forgot he's on leave.

100
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,561
How long will he be gone, by the way?

101
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,920
Isn't his case going

102
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,401
to court the day after tomorrow?

103
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,480
I did nothing wrong anyway.

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
Why should I avoid her?

105
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:46,721
The outsiders see clearer.

106
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,241
Darling.

107
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:01,961
- You're back.
- Yes, I am.

108
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,281
Do you want to eat?

109
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,600
I can reheat them for you.

110
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,360
No need. I ate already.

111
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,241
Darling,

112
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:16,640
forgive me.

113
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,640
What happened?

114
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,360
Chen Yonggang, you...

115
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:26,640
Yonggang!

116
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,640
Oh my god.

117
00:06:28,001 --> 00:06:30,241
I have always wanted this.

118
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,841
The one you like is all sold out.

119
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,681
I picked this one from the store.

120
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,360
Limited edition.
It costs around 20,000 yuan.

121
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,441
Open it.

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
You scared me!

123
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,001
I thought something happened to you.

124
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:41,640
Open it.

125
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Where did you get the money?

126
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:47,161
Don't worry.

127
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,241
It's my bonus.

128
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,401
Do you know how much Mr. Xiao

129
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,920
asked for us?

130
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:54,520
30,000 yuan.

131
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:57,480
30,000 yuan?

132
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:00,441
And you spent 25,000 of it
to buy me a bag.

133
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,320
Yes.

134
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Yonggang.

135
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,681
We need to pay the tuition
of Jianing's pre-school

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,681
and the mortgage.

137
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,881
Return it, please.

138
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:13,080
Yes, we do need money.

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,241
But that doesn't mean
we shouldn't treat ourselves.

140
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,401
Besides,

141
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,001
money can be earned.

142
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:21,640
Huibo is now part of Huiquan.

143
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,200
We will become successful.

144
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,200
I will give Jianing and you the life
you deserve.

145
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,200
Open it. Do you like it?

146
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,281
Hey.

147
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,281
I want to do it again.

148
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,840
(This late at night?)

149
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,160
(Think it through.)

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,720
(You aren't always
going to be this lucky.)

151
00:08:38,321 --> 00:08:40,441
(Just wait for a few days.)

152
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,920
Listen.

153
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:43,720
I have a hunch.

154
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,160
A strong hunch

155
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,160
that tells me it will work today.

156
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,681
Just buy some for me.

157
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,600
Now.

158
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,001
This is what you want.

159
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:00,920
Thanks.

160
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,561
Xuan, come with me
to the police station.

161
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:05,681
The court notifies us that the trial
begins in three days.

162
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:06,139
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

163
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,040
Wait.

164
00:09:09,521 --> 00:09:11,561
We have enough evidence
to indict him already.

165
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:13,480
Why should we interrogate him?

166
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,521
His testimony doesn't matter.

167
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,960
Yes,

168
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,761
but without his testimony,

169
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,720
this case feels imperfect.

170
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:23,001
All right. What tactic this time?

171
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,441
Psychological warfare.

172
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:26,081
On one hand, we find out

173
00:09:26,081 --> 00:09:26,960
the criminal motif.

174
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,280
This will provide leads
regarding the online gambling

175
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,521
and loan scam behind everything.

176
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:31,441
On the other hand,

177
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:33,960
we tell him that confession

178
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,280
is grounds

179
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,321
for leniency.

180
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:40,321
Zhu Xin leads a fancy life
on the surface

181
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,761
but it's all an act.

182
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,081
He has debt problems.

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,400
The death of his wife

184
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,480
must have something to do with his debt.

185
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,761
I just need to find the reason.

186
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:52,840
To indict the defendant,
we just need to prove

187
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:53,480
that he intended to kill her.

188
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,761
We do not need to find out

189
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,881
why he wanted to kill her.

190
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,561
And to recover the truth,

191
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,521
we need

192
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,681
to identify the root of the problem.

193
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,720
Today, we will find out

194
00:10:04,761 --> 00:10:05,561
why he killed his wife

195
00:10:05,681 --> 00:10:06,840
and obtain the key evidence.

196
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,600
Let's go. You drive.

197
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,321
Okay.

198
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,200
(Protect Justice)

199
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:24,561
Name, please?

200
00:10:25,881 --> 00:10:26,681
Zhu Xin.

201
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:27,521
Zhu Xin.

202
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,121
You are speaking to An Ni,

203
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,160
a prosecutor from
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate,

204
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:33,681
and Han Xuan, her assistant.

205
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,321
According to

206
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,040
The Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China,

207
00:10:36,081 --> 00:10:36,960
we can

208
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:38,681
interrogate you.

209
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:40,920
Mr. Han,

210
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,081
isn't it a hassle

211
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,960
to repeat the introduction twice?

212
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:47,241
You...

213
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,561
Let's make it brief

214
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,121
and cut to the chase.

215
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,840
I already talked to you

216
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,561
about the policy issues.

217
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,441
We even had a trial.

218
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:01,521
Why do you think

219
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:02,761
we're here today?

220
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:09,480
Beat me to it.

221
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,280
My job here is to cooperate.

222
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,761
If you want to chat with me,
I will chat with you.

223
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,800
Okay.

224
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:21,280
Then please co-operate with us.

225
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,321
I'll be frank with you.

226
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,201
Confess

227
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,720
and we can all go home early.

228
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,081
If not,

229
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,201
I'll make you confess at the court.

230
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,761
We have

231
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
the evidence.

232
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,121
We know how and why
you committed the crime.

233
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,081
This will be the last interrogation.

234
00:11:41,321 --> 00:11:42,521
As usual,

235
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,280
confess, plead guilty,

236
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:46,761
then we can consider leniency.

237
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,561
If you don't,

238
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,081
it's fine.

239
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:52,480
The judge will give you a sentence
that he deems fit.

240
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,681
The outcome will be different

241
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:56,321
and you

242
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
get to decide which one you want.

243
00:11:59,561 --> 00:12:02,681
I'm innocent. You can't indict me.

244
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,761
More than 80 hours till the trial.

245
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,321
I can give them all

246
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,641
to you.

247
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:12,521
Let's see

248
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:14,321
if you

249
00:12:15,441 --> 00:12:16,561
will get tired or not.

250
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:19,040
Of course, we will.

251
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,720
We are humans.

252
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,081
We will get tired,

253
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:24,160
hungry, or sleepy.

254
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,521
But what can we do?

255
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:27,081
This is our job.

256
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,761
We're doing this for you.

257
00:12:30,121 --> 00:12:31,360
In case you don't know,

258
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,040
the law states that no interrogation

259
00:12:33,321 --> 00:12:35,040
can last for more than 12 hours.

260
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,121
Therefore,

261
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,960
you only have 12 hours
to make your decision.

262
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,681
Count yourself lucky

263
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,561
that you didn't commit
the crime earlier.

264
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,441
The Guiding Opinions on the use

265
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,441
of Plea Leniency System

266
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:48,040
implemented on 2019

267
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,681
give people like you

268
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,920
a chance to redeem yourself.

269
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,881
A lighter sentence
means you get to live.

270
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,360
Leniency means you

271
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,040
can get a new life.

272
00:12:58,321 --> 00:12:59,201
Criminals can

273
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,761
be reintegrated into society like this.

274
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:02,321
A confession

275
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:04,840
and an appropriate amount
of compensation

276
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,321
can provide solace
to the victim's family.

277
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:09,720
We are working tirelessly here

278
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:12,360
so that you can live.

279
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:22,960
You're my savior now?

280
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:25,561
You are prosecutors.

281
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,001
You want to indict me.

282
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:29,360
You want me to die.

283
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,840
Protect me?

284
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,521
What an irony.

285
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:40,081
I would rather entrust my life
to the lawyers.

286
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,121
Thank you.

287
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,441
I believe the mega lawyer squad

288
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,040
your family

289
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,121
hired for you has briefed you

290
00:13:47,121 --> 00:13:48,521
about leniency.

291
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,121
I'll add something to it.

292
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:52,321
The violent,

293
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,761
disturbing nature

294
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:55,360
of the crime

295
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,881
is enough to land you the death penalty.

296
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,521
Zhu Xin,

297
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,920
you don't need me to tell you

298
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,360
what will happen to you, do you?

299
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:07,480
According

300
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,121
to Clause No. 232 of Criminal Law,

301
00:14:10,561 --> 00:14:11,881
voluntary manslaughter is punishable

302
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:13,001
by the death penalty,

303
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,800
life imprisonment,

304
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,681
or imprisonment for more than 10 years.

305
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,960
Zhu Xin.

306
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,121
You will decide whether

307
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:20,561
you get to live or die.

308
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
Don't bluff.

309
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:23,480
I trust my lawyers.

310
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,441
They will clear my name.

311
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:32,121
Zhu Xin.

312
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,201
You know,

313
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,480
pleading not guilty
only brings about two outcomes.

314
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:40,081
Either the prosecutors win

315
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:41,641
and the defendant is indicted,

316
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,480
or the judge believes
the defendant is innocent

317
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,360
and the defendant can walk away.

318
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,121
Please note

319
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
that pleading not guilty
is not easy at all.

320
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,201
You need to have ironclad evidence

321
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,280
to prove your innocence,

322
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,960
to nullify the accusation

323
00:14:56,081 --> 00:14:57,881
brought against you.

324
00:14:58,081 --> 00:14:59,761
Only by then you can convince

325
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:01,040
the judge of your innocence.

326
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
Pleading not guilty

327
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,040
without sufficient evidence

328
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,881
will only backfire on you.

329
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,360
Not only will you lose the case,

330
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,121
you will also lose the rights normally

331
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,800
given to a defendant.

332
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,681
We have handled similar cases before.

333
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:18,081
Defendants plead not guilty.

334
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,040
But if the prosecutors
bring out evidence

335
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,480
that is hard to be refuted,

336
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,840
then no matter how hard

337
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,360
your lawyer tries to claim
that you're not guilty,

338
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,600
you will lose

339
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:28,840
your chance

340
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:29,480
at leniency.

341
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:30,920
Zhu Xin.

342
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:33,360
If the defendant continues

343
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,761
to feign ignorance despite the evidence,

344
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,160
the defendant
will be given a harsher punishment.

345
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,441
If you confess

346
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:38,681
to your crime,

347
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,121
accept the accusation
brought against you

348
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,441
by the prosecution,

349
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,521
agree to sign the guilty plea

350
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,441
for a more lenient sentence,

351
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,840
then you will be given
a lighter punishment.

352
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,001
Please give this

353
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,280
some thoughts.

354
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
I owe someone money.

355
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:06,241
Who?

356
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,280
It was a gamble.

357
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,641
With whom?

358
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:09,641
Friends.

359
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,761
How big was the wager?

360
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,960
How much?

361
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,121
Around nine million yuan.

362
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:14,960
How?

363
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:18,521
I can't remember.

364
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,400
Zhu Xin.

365
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:27,400
After what we have gone through,

366
00:16:27,881 --> 00:16:30,720
do you think it's fair
to hide anything from us?

367
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,321
You

368
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,081
look cunning.

369
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,081
But I think you are very innocent.

370
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,121
You mentioned a gamble just now.

371
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,480
Have you ever wondered

372
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,600
why you kept losing more and more money?

373
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,001
Why you racked up more and more debts?

374
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,641
Isn't it odd?

375
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:52,280
Why would the dealer

376
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,441
lend money to someone he knows

377
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,201
has a lot of debts?

378
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,040
Why would he indulge you?

379
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,400
Maybe you are the victim.

380
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,641
Zhu Xin.

381
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,241
I

382
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,200
have questioned the people around you.

383
00:17:10,881 --> 00:17:12,241
You're not a bad person per se.

384
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:13,960
You have a very feisty wife.

385
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,881
So you keep a lot to yourself.

386
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,600
If you weren't

387
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,161
at your wit's end,

388
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,761
you would never ever kill your own wife.

389
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:24,241
You married her, after all.

390
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:27,041
You loved her.

391
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,161
If I were you,

392
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,360
I would be thinking

393
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,480
about how I could punish those people

394
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
who conned you.

395
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,560
She is dead.

396
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:46,041
Think of this from another perspective.

397
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,881
Did you kill your wife?

398
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:49,521
Or did someone kill your wife?

399
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,440
Or perhaps someone used your hands

400
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:52,560
to kill your wife?

401
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
Do you want to protect those people?

402
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,001
I confess.

403
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:09,921
Those brats.

404
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,360

the review meeting.

434
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:33,680

each department to...

436

Sorry.

438
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,241
(Credit)
your performance.

439
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:47,840
Sorry.

we've decided to take legal actions against you.)

442
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:43,080
That's how I fell victim.

443
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,881
Did you save their contacts?

444
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:51,761
They

445
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,960
put us in a chat group

446
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,161
with burner IDs.

447
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:57,320
They change every day.

448
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,480
I deleted so many messages
from my previous phone.

449
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:02,840
I don't think I have their contacts.

450
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,600
Do you remember the link and the name

451
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,080
of the gambling site?

452
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,521
Truth be told,

453
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:10,720
the link changes every day.

454
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,480
When I log in with the same link

455
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,320
the next day,

456
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,440
it won't work.

457
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,401
Then how did you continue to wager?

458
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,680
In the chat group,

459
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:28,600

460
00:22:28,641 --> 00:22:30,600
some links irregularly at night.

461
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Can you recall the name

462
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,840
of those loan apps?

463
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
I'm sure I installed them

464
00:22:39,881 --> 00:22:41,080
no less than 20 times.

465
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:43,560
They all have weird names.

466
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:47,200
One in particular stood out though.

467
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,161
It's very similar to

468
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,560
a video game company here.

469
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,761
Similar spelling, at least.

470
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,521
Huiquan?

471
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:57,720
Yes.

473

Zhu Xin.

474
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,480
We will write what you said

475
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,121
in the guilty plea.

476
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:20,720
This is your plea.

477
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,960
Read it through.

478
00:23:23,281 --> 00:23:25,600
If you're okay with it,
we'll bring your lawyer here

479
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,480
and you'll sign it.

480
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,761
Do you think he confessed

481
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,001
out of guilt

482
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:38,560
or out of revenge?

483
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:41,641
Both. They feed

484
00:23:41,761 --> 00:23:42,720
on each other.

485
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,680
There are many people like him.

486
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,680
They have a lapse of judgment
and make a mistake.

487
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,881
So the perpetrators preyed

488
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,881
on their weaknesses.

489
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:53,360
They exploited their victims.

490
00:23:54,281 --> 00:23:56,281
Throughout human civilizations,

491
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
greed is one thing

492
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,241
that remains unchanged.

493
00:24:00,281 --> 00:24:02,881
Thanks to technology,
there are more ways

494
00:24:02,881 --> 00:24:04,161
to scam people.

495
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,080
Yet, whatever trick the scammer uses,

496
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,041
it all revolves around greed.

497
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,840
It blinds you. So much so

498
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,440
that you don't know who

499
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,281
or what you're dealing with.

500
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,641
As long as greed exists,

501
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,881
crime will not disappear.

502
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,480
He sure was greedy.

503
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,641
Why would anyone greed

504
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:22,881
for several hundred yuan?

505
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,761
How much do you earn per month?

506
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:29,680
No matter how small the sum is,
it's still money.

507
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Not to mention it's free money.

508
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,281
Right.

509
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,161
Put it on.

510
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:52,960
Hello?

511
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:55,720
I just want to remind you
to be punctual tomorrow.

512
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,480
Don't worry. I'll be there.

513
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,881
Zhu Xin confessed.

514
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:01,360
What was the noise?

515
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:04,521
Someone reported

516
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:06,521
the base of
an illegal adult streaming site.

517
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:07,881
(Zhu Xin confessed.)

518
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,680
(His statement corroborates our theory.)

519
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,521
Someone targeted him and invited him
to the chat group.

520
00:25:11,521 --> 00:25:12,960
After he clicked on the link,

521
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,560
he would be redirected to

522
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,960
gambling or adult sites.

523
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,560
(You know what happened next.)

524
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,480
Oh.

525
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,720
Another thing.

526
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,641
Yes?

527
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,360
If you're busy,

528
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,720
we can speak later.

529
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Don't leave me hanging.

530
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,161
I'm not buying you a meal.

531
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,200
Okay.

532
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:29,680
Zhu Xin also used

533
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,241
a loan app.

534
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:32,960
(This loan app)

535
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,440
(contains the links
to those adult websites.)

536
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:37,440
(I think)

537
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,960
(we can dig further.)

538
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,840
Not only is there a loan scam,

539
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,320
there might also be illegal gambling
or adult businesses.

540
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,281
Honestly,

541
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,680
the cases we have recently

542
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,560
feel so similar.

543
00:25:46,761 --> 00:25:48,960
Could this be Zhang Xiaobei's

544
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,041
loaning platform,

545
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:53,320
but in different names?

546
00:25:54,241 --> 00:25:55,840
It's possible.

547
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,440
And based on what

548
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,881
Zhu Xin told us,

549
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:00,600
the culprits

550
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,521
are tech-savvy and armed

551
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,001
with countersurveillance measures.

552
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:06,360
They change their ID often.

553
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,761
What an elaborate scheme

554
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:10,001
to keep the victim trapped forever.

555
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:11,480
Those brats.

556
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,921
They are everywhere.

557
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,241
I suggest that we both

558
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,480
notify our superiors.

559
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,921
(If necessary, we can combine our cases.)

560
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:22,881
Please look into the clues

561
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,680
given by Zhu Xin.

562
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:26,521
What are you having for dinner?

563
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,921
Witness, you may leave.

564
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,161
Witness, Miss Lin Shuang,
please appear before the stand.

565
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:03,600
Miss Lin Shuang,

566
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:06,281
you are apprised of the importance
of truthfulness

567
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:08,921
and the consequences of perjury,

568
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,241
are you not?

569
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,281
(Defendant)
You also signed and swore

570
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:13,560
(Defendant)
that you will be telling the truth.

571
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:14,960
(Witness)
Is that right?

572
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,200
Yes, Your Honor.

573
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,401
The trial will resume.

574
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,080
(Defendant)
Defendant, you may speak.

575
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,360
Your Honor,

576
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:28,921
although my client

577
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,801
pleaded guilty,

578
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,281
I insist to exercise my right
to defend my client.

579
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,041
According to the information

580
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,440
and evidence I have,

581
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,881
I believe my client is innocent.

582
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,281
Lin Shuang.

583
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,560
Around 11 PM on April 8th,

584
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,840
what did you see?

585
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,041
I saw

586
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:52,560
someone open the hood

587
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,080
of Yuan Fangfang's car

588
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,680
and tinker with it.

589
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,041
Was Zhu Xin the person you saw?

590
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:58,520
(Witness)

591
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,001
No.

592
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,560
It was Yuan Fangfang's cousin, Yuan Qi.

593
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,121
Do you know

594
00:28:06,161 --> 00:28:07,080
if Yuan Qi

595
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,960
harbored any intention
to kill Yuan Fangfang?

596
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,560
For the inheritance, no doubt.

597
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:13,401
Fangfang's late grandfather

598
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,161
left his family a house.

599
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,600
Fangfang's grandmother

600
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,401
wanted to give the house to Yuan Qi

601
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:21,200
but Fangfang wouldn't have it.

602
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:24,041
Yuan Qi came to visit Fangfang

603
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:26,121
to talk things through.

604
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:27,360
Prosecutor.

605
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,680
Do you wish to question the witness,
Miss Lin Shuang?

606
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:31,200
Yes.

607
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,641
Miss Lin Shuang,

608
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,680
what is your relationship
with the victim?

609
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,041
I'm the victim's hairdresser

610
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,480
and her neighbor.

611
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,080
I own a hair salon in the neighborhood

612
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,881
and Fangfang was my regular.

613
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,521
So you are close to the victim.

614
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:49,281
Unlike other establishments,

615
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:51,641
I like to be friends with my clients.

616
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,041
So when they are free,

617
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,720
they come and hang out with me.

618
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:56,680
Friends?

619
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
So Fangfang and you are friends?

620
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,921
(Witness)

621
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:01,921
Not like

622
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:03,801
close friends.

623
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,200
Has the defendant ever visited

624
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,801
your hair salon?

625
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,881
Procurator,
I know what you try to imply here.

626
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:18,680
I run a legit business.

627
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,161
Miss Lin Shuang, please answer
my question.

628
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:23,320
No,

629
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:26,881
Zhu Xin has never come to my salon.

630
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,041
So you are not close to Zhu Xin.

631
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:31,680
I mean, we are in the same

632
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,720
neighborhood. I see him often.

633
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,881
Zhu Xin is very nice to Fangfang.

634
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:37,600
Sometimes,

635
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,680
he even came with her
when she got her hair done.

636
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,840
They look lovely together.

637
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,921
How do you know

638
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:46,521
about Fangfang's inheritance dispute?

639
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:49,041
She told me.

640
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:50,881
Other than gossiping,

641
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,960
what else can we do?

642
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,080
And how do you know

643
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,801
she has a cousin?

644
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,881
One day, Fangfang was in my salon.

645
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,521
She saw a bald man

646
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,161
and pointed at him.

647
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,600
She told me that's her cousin, Yuan Qi.

648
00:30:10,761 --> 00:30:11,761
So you have never

649
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,080
met Yuan Qi in person?

650
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:14,761
No.

651
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,121
That night, you saw, from your salon,

652
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:19,161
that someone was doing something
to the car.

653
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,001
Yes.

654
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,761
We did some investigation
around the area

655
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,801
and we have questioned you too.

656
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:25,440
You claimed that Fangfang's car

657
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,840
was in the blind spot
of your security cameras.

658
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,761
Why didn't you tell the prosecutors

659
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:30,600
or the police

660
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,440
what you saw that night?

661
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:38,761
Because I didn't want

662
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,480
to get myself involved in this.

663
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,360
Now that this is getting out of hand,

664
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:46,281
I felt bad withholding the information.

665
00:30:46,641 --> 00:30:48,041
Zhu Xin is a kind man.

666
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:49,320
I have

667
00:30:49,641 --> 00:30:52,041
to speak up

668
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,960
or a kind man will be wrongfully jailed.

669
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,720
From where exactly did you see Yuan Qi?

670
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,480
My salon has two floors.

671
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,960
I was on the balcony
on the second floor.

672
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:03,960
Your Honor,

673
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:06,121
the witness claimed that Yuan Qi
has a criminal motif.

674
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,161
Yuan Qi is now one of the suspects.

675
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,600
I suggest we adjourn for half an hour

676
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:11,960
so that the police can summon

677
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:12,960
Yuan Qi here.

678
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,761
I agree.

679
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,432
(Shuang)

680
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,161
So?

681
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,720
I just checked all social media

682
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:26,360
platforms.

683
00:31:26,401 --> 00:31:27,641
Lin Shuang posted all these online

684
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,041
in the evening of April 8th.

685
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,401
Download the posts and photos

686
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
she uploaded six months before and after

687
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,360
the crime.

688
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:36,720
They will be useful. Hurry.

689
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,200
Okay.

690
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:43,960
The trial will resume.

691
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Miss Lin Shuang,

692
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:50,080
at around 11 PM on April 8th,

693
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,360
it was a cloudy night.

694
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,600
You caught a silhouette
from the balcony.

695
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,121
Despite the weather condition,

696
00:31:55,161 --> 00:31:56,600
are you sure that the person you saw

697
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:57,600
is Yuan Qi,

698
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,440
and not Zhu Xin?

699
00:32:01,161 --> 00:32:02,320
Yuan Qi is bald.

700
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,840
It's obvious under the street lamp.

701
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:07,360
Anyone of sound mind

702
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
can tell.

703
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:09,921
Are you sure

704
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:12,440
you were of sound mind?

705
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:14,761
What do you mean?

706
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,840
You posted this online

707
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:18,881
(To Time and Age)

708
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:19,881
(To Time and Age)
that night.

709
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,241
What were you holding, Miss Lin Shuang?

710
00:32:25,761 --> 00:32:27,080
How did you find that photo?

711
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,360
It's alcohol.

712
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,320
The percentage?

713
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,680
It's a cocktail.

714
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,080
It's not high.

715
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:42,080
I was sober.

716
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,000
What about this photo from a month ago?

717
00:32:44,761 --> 00:32:45,365
(My tolerance is so bad now...)

718
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,401
I...

719
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,241
You said here

720
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:52,801
that your tolerance deteriorated
as you aged.

721
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,200
Explain how you,

722
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,840
under the influence of alcohol,

723
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:58,600
came to the conclusion that you

724
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
saw Yuan Qi, and not Zhu Xin.

725
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,281
After all, cocktail
is an alcoholic drink.

726
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:07,480
Yuan Qi is bald.

727
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:09,720
He was wearing an Arsenal jersey.

728
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:11,840
It's my favorite football club

729
00:33:11,921 --> 00:33:13,720
so I am very certain it's Yuan Qi.

730
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:16,080
An Arsenal jersey?

731
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,161
Won't it draw attention?

732
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,801
If Yuan Qi was there,

733
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:20,881
why

734
00:33:20,921 --> 00:33:22,680
would he wear a jersey of your favorite
football club,

735
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,281
appear before you,

736
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:26,241
and tamper with the brake cable?

737
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:30,241
I...

738
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:32,080
Procurator,

739
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,360
I'm not him.

740
00:33:34,521 --> 00:33:36,720
I can't read his mind.

741
00:33:40,161 --> 00:33:41,161
Miss Lin Shuang,

742
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:43,560
is the person in this photo Yuan Qi?

743
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,521
Yes.

744
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:46,641
It's Yuan Qi?

745
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:47,720
Yes.

746
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:49,241
Are you sure?

747
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,401
Yes.

748
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,360
Your Honor,

749
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,480
Miss Lin Shuang

750
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:55,521
saw Yuan Qi in this photo.

751
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,241
This confirms that the culprit

752
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,881
is Zhu Xin.

753
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:02,440
Impossible.

754
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,401
Zhu Xin is not bald.

755
00:34:05,921 --> 00:34:08,200
Your Honor, Yuan Qi is here.

756
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:10,920
Please summon him to the stand.

757
00:34:11,561 --> 00:34:12,361
Agreed.

758
00:34:13,241 --> 00:34:15,120
Miss Lin Shuang, you may leave.

759
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,001
Witness, Mr. Yuan Qi, please appear
before the stand.

760
00:34:29,521 --> 00:34:30,120
Yuan Qi.

761
00:34:30,521 --> 00:34:31,521
On the evening of April 8th,

762
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,200
did you pay your cousin a visit?

763
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,281
What were you wearing?

764
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,241
On April 8th,

765
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
I did visit Fangfang.

766
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,960
I was wearing an Arsenal jersey.

767
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,801
We had an argument.

768
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,880
Then, I left.

769
00:34:48,361 --> 00:34:49,920
I also left my jersey

770
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,521
in her home.

771
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,680
When did you arrive?

772
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,801
I arrived at Fangfang's place
at 8:30 PM.

773
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,521
You can check the record

774
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,120
for when I got my temperature taken
by the neighborhood committee.

775
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,801
Fangfang then

776
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,521
died later that night.

777
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:07,601
Your Honor,

778
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:10,001
the defendant has the habit
of wearing wigs.

779
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,400
Miss Lin Shuang

780
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,880
might not be aware of that.

781
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,960
Your Honor,

782
00:35:17,321 --> 00:35:18,120
I plead guilty.

783
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,321
I killed Yuan Fangfang.

784
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,120
I let her down.

785
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,160
I let her parents down.

786
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,720
I confess.

787
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,521
Your Honor, fellow judges,

788
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,400
as the public prosecutor,

789
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,640
I have conducted a meticulous

790
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:49,480
and thorough review

791
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,680
of the investigation
carried out thus far.

792
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:53,480
That's why I came to this conclusion.

793
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,601
That's why I brought this to court.

794
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,601
Likewise,

795
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,561
as a law practitioner,

796
00:35:58,841 --> 00:35:59,680
I believe you

797
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,521
must have collected

798
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,480
and analyzed the evidence

799
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,081
from your client.

800
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,440
You must have an idea

801
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:10,720
of what truly happened

802
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,120
and you should know
who's right and who's not.

803
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:15,120
It

804
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,120
is irrefutable

805
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,120
that Zhu Xin murdered

806
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,920
his own wife.

807
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:21,400
It is a violent

808
00:36:21,521 --> 00:36:23,200
and malicious act.

809
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,561
The defense lawyer refused to allow

810
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:28,160
the defendant to plead guilty.

811
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:29,361
However, during the trial,

812
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,041
the defendant confessed.

813
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:33,561
During the previous interrogation,
the defendant

814
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:35,120
also provided crucial information

815
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:37,480
regarding an online scamming syndicate

816
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,601
to law enforcers.

817
00:36:40,361 --> 00:36:41,480
Considering his behavior,

818
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,880
I urge Your Honor

819
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,480
that he be given

820
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,561
a lighter sentence.

821
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:48,841
That concludes my statement, Your Honor.

822
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:53,281
(110. What can I help?)

823
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,321
(Madam,)

824
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,241
(a girl I met online scammed my money.)

825
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:59,120
(I clicked on the link
and my money is all gone.)

826
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
(110. What can I help?)

827
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,041
(Help!)

828
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:02,601
(My pension has been scammed.)

829
00:37:02,601 --> 00:37:04,041
(Please give us more details.)

830
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:05,680
Fellow colleagues,

831
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,361
the Supreme People's Procuratorate

832
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,001
and the Ministry of Public Security

833
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,400
instructed us

834
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,920
to track down

835
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,440
the recent spike in illegal

836
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:15,561
online activities.

837
00:37:16,521 --> 00:37:18,081
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate

838
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:21,361
and Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau

839
00:37:21,561 --> 00:37:23,720
will oversee the operation jointly.

840
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:26,720
I had a meeting this afternoon

841
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:28,321
with Chief Bai.

842
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
We decided to combine

843
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,440
the online gambling cases

844
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:34,081
behind Zhu Xin's case.

845
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:36,001
I gathered all of you here

846
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,400
to share

847
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:41,001
some recent data for
illegal online activities.

848
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,041
In 2021,

849
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:45,561
the Supreme People's Procuratorate
and the Ministry of Public Security

850
00:37:45,561 --> 00:37:48,361
launched for illegal online activities.

851
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,241
A comprehensive operation

852
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,561
to crack down

853
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:54,081
online frauds
and other illicit activities.

854
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,761
282,000 people are convicted

855
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,521
of fraud, gambling, or dissemination
of inappropriate materials.

856
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,160
It was an increase of 98.5%

857
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:04,440
compared to the previous year.

858
00:38:04,841 --> 00:38:07,761
In the same year, during

859
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,880
a joint operation to crack down

860
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,281
illegal trade of SIM cards
and credit cards

861
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,361
for unauthorized withdrawals
or bank transactions,

862
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,841
129,000 people were convicted.

863
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,640
Which was 9.5 times greater
than the previous year.

864
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:22,281
The Supreme People's Procuratorate
and the Ministry of Education

865
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,081
also launched a campaign

866
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,680
in school to raise awareness

867
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:30,081
to prevent students from falling victim
to online scams

868
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,561
or become an unwitting perpetrator.

869
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:35,841
My colleagues.

870
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:39,120
We need to put a stop

871
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:40,841
to these crimes immediately.

872
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:43,640
Chief Bai,
would you like to add something?

873
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:47,720
My colleagues,

874
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:50,120
the police and the prosecutors

875
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:51,120
will work

876
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:53,321
hand in hand this time.

877
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
During this rare occasion,

878
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:56,321
I hope we can foster teamwork

879
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,920
and camaraderie.

880
00:38:58,081 --> 00:38:59,041
I believe

881
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,920
under the bright leadership

882
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:04,361
of Prosecutor Guo here,

883
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,120
the investigation process

884
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,801
will be more efficient

885
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:09,521
than ever.

886
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:10,960
Our goal

887
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,321
is to uproot

888
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:15,761
all online crimes,

889
00:39:15,801 --> 00:39:18,561
to prevent tragedies.

890
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,081
At the moment,

891
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:21,720
the priority

892
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:24,120
is to locate Zhang Xiaobei.

893
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:36,720
Let me know if our canteen
is to your liking.

894
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,321
I have been here many times

895
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:40,521
but it's my first time eating here.

896
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:42,321
Your canteen is much bigger than ours.

897
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:43,960
And warm meals too, to boot.

898
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Long, are you enjoying the food?

899
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,841
Yes!

900
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,801
Have some more.

901
00:39:48,321 --> 00:39:49,521
You finish everything so quickly.

902
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,321
Xiaobei

903
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,120
is very vigilant.

904
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,081
We forged

905
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,160
his SIM card

906
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,841
but he hasn't used his phone lately.

907
00:39:58,321 --> 00:39:59,200
I think

908
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,720
he's using his backup SIM card.

909
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,680
And the card is registered
under someone else's name.

910
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,880
Also,

911
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,001
we entered his name into Huiquan's

912
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,081
game database.

913
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,041
Nothing.

914
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:10,640
Then try something else.

915
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,521
Check Shi Xiaohu's account

916
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:13,680
and see if he used to play

917
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,001
with Zhang Xiaobei.

918
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:17,960
Zhang Xiaobei seems to care a lot
about Shi Xiaohu's death.

919
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,321
I think

920
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:21,200
they must be very close.

921
00:40:21,241 --> 00:40:21,761
Picture this.

922
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:24,160
Xiaobei once visited Xiaohu's mother.

923
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,120
Knowing Xiaobei,

924
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:29,200
I beg to differ.

925
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:33,480
It's either Xiaohu did Xiaobei

926
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,120
a huge favor,

927
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:38,720
or Xiaobei owed Xiaohu something.

928
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,601
Players like Xiaohu

929
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:46,801
will top up money.

930
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,801
Because he's addicted to the game.

931
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:51,841
But you know
Xiaohu's financial situation.

932
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,880
Zhan Mei never mentioned that Xiaohu

933
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,001
took out a loan online.

934
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,081
There can only be two explanations.

935
00:40:56,361 --> 00:40:59,321
One, Zhan Mei is not aware that Xiaohu

936
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:00,361
took out a loan.

937
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,001
Two, Xiaohu never ever

938
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,321
took out a loan at all.

939
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,801
He wanted to top up money

940
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:07,361
but he lacked the means to.

941
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,960
So the priority now

942
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,200
is to get his game account.

943
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:15,281
My men went to Huiquan

944
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,761
but they wouldn't cooperate.

945
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,521
They gave us tons of arguments,

946
00:41:18,521 --> 00:41:19,720
like Zhang Xiaobei

947
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,640
made the decision to jump
into the river himself.

948
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:25,321
And that we have to present the evidence

949
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:27,321
that his decision has something
to do with the game.

950
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:29,440
But we have none.

951
00:41:30,601 --> 00:41:32,321
That's Li Yitang for you.

952
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,200
But let's start

953
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,081
from Shi Xiaohu.

954
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,361
Let me handle it.

955
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,120
You will dig around and see

956
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,680
if there are similar victims.

957
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,480
If you can,

958
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,920
find

959
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:44,720
Xiaobei's hideout too.

960
00:41:45,601 --> 00:41:47,200
These criminals

961
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,640
just want money.

962
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:52,400
If we know how they get their money,

963
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,160
we will be able to trace them.

964
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,041
The dishes here

965
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:58,480
are way better than our canteen.

966
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,440
Really?

967
00:41:59,841 --> 00:42:01,081
Get more then.
