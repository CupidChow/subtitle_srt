15
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,760
I truly hope that
you can live through every day happily.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
Perhaps you still remember.

17
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:50,480
Your mother and I divorced
when you were very young.

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,279
The marriage was short-lived.

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,879
It wasn't a happy one.

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,360
But there were some wonderful memories.

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,559
At least

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,240
I am proud to have a healthy and lively son.

23
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,000
Tiancheng.

24
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,160
Even without my protection,

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,679
I hope you can keep living
the way you do now.

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,639
Live on and well.

27
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,279
Find your success in life.

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,199
Dad, why are you saying that?

29
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,279
I...

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,839
I failed you.

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,880
Over the years,

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,520
I've been deceiving.

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,360
I've been lying to myself.

34
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:08,360
I want to face who I really am for once.

35
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:14,520
Please understand me.

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,559
Tiancheng.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,479
Do you know what has happened to Huiquan?

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,559
Zhao Jikai has been arrested.

39
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,520
Because there were villains
in the company.

40
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:42,559
The true villain was me.

41
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,559
Every bad thing that happened
was my doing.

42
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,800
Qian Tianxin was ordered to set up
an operation base abroad by me.

43
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:54,479
I ordered Zhao Jikai to steal user data

44
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,039
and commit cyber crimes.

45
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:02,199
The one escaped fugitive
of Operation 7·23 was me.

46
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:04,479
Impossible.

47
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,000
This can't be true! You're lying!

48
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,479
I'm going to turn myself in.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,160
My son, I am sorry.

50
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,880
I will always love you.

51
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,079
Dad!

52
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,559
Dad!

53
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,519
Dad!

54
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,839
Dad!

55
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,519
Dad!

56
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,239
Dad!

57
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:46,839
Dad!

58
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Dad! I failed you!

59
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:49,040
Dad!

60
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,040
Dad! You can't go there!

61
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,600
Dad! You can't do this!

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,440
This is my fault.

63
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Drive.

64
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,920
Dad!

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,559
Dad!

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,279
Dad!

67
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:56,959
Dad!

68
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,679
Dad!

69
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:58,600
Dad!

70
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,359
Dad!

71
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,239
Dad!

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,839
(Xiao Mu'en, I get it.)

73
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,160
(You're telling me this)

74
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,959
(so I'll forever live in guilt.)

75
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,320
(You won.)

76
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,880
(I did let you down.)

77
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,959
(I failed Zhou Ling.)

78
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,679
(However,)

79
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,880
(that doesn't I don't
have a chance to repent.)

80
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,160
(Inaugural speech of Xiao Mu'en,
chairman of Huiquan)

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,079
Mr. Liu. Look at the time.

82
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Mr. Xiao isn't here yet. Will he be late?

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,119
Impossible.

84
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:33,040
Today is his big day.

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,279
He might be late to his own wedding,

86
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,720
but he will never be late for this.

87
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,320
We've all witnessed Mr. Xiao's capability.

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,679
We must choose the talented,

89
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,519
not the close ones.

90
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I believe...

91
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,959
A call from Mr. Xiao.

92
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,239
Excuse me.

93
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:53,559
Sure.

94
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:54,200
I must answer this.

95
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,799
I need to get this.

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:55,760
Go on.

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,359
Where is Captain He?

98
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,799
I want to see him.

99
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,079
Sir, sit down.

100
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,040
- Mr. Yin.
- Where is he?

101
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,839
Thank you.

102
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,760
You can tell me anything.

103
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,600
Who are you?

104
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,359
Prosecutor An Ni sent me here.

105
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,399
You're from the Procuratorate.

106
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:22,959
Yes.

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,959
The Procuratorate.

108
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,880
Assistant Prosecutor Han Xuan.

109
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,079
She has a message for you.

110
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,640
"Keep a level head,

111
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,279
do not do anything you will regret

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,880
or make your family sad.

113
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,200
Please believe in the law
and the Procuratorate."

114
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,679
We will protect the private company
according to the law.

115
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,079
We will protect the private entrepreneurs
that have been violated.

116
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,440
Don't worry.

117
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:45,239
Things will get better.

118
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,079
I don't get it.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,480
How do you know I'd be here?

120
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,079
Your son called Mr. Wang Heyu.

121
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,700
(Yin Tiancheng)

122
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,980
(Yin Tiancheng)

123
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,320
Hello?

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,640
Yin?

125
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,920
(Hello? Are you Wang Heyu the prosecutor?)

126
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,839
(I want to file a report.)

127
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,200
I want to expose a crime!

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,279
Someone is going
to give a false testimony.

129
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:13,920
Yin?

130
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,880
Hold on.

131
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,239
I need you to calm down.

132
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,399
Clear your mind.

133
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,679
Tell me the detail.

134
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,600
Who are you exposing?

135
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,839
What are you exposing?

136
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,239
I want to expose Xiao Mu'en.

137
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,359
He is the mastermind of Operation 7·23.

138
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,880
(He came to my home and forced my father
to be his scapegoat.)

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
(He is now on his way to the Rongdu Hotel
for the press conference.)

140
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,440
Arrest him now!

141
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,160
Do it now!

142
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,119
Are you sure about this?

143
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,160
Are you...

144
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,440
Listen.

145
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:41,839
Simply filing a report and framing someone

146
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,239
will make you legally responsible.

147
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,760
Mr. Wang.

148
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:47,239
I don't have the evidence,

149
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,440
but I have a lead.

150
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Xiao Mu'en came for my father.

151
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,000
(He thought the house was empty,)

152
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,320
(so he said something highly confidential.)

153
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,799
(I didn't get the whole thing,)

154
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,040
(but I know something is off with him.)

155
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,399
Think about it.

156
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,679
Why would my father willingly turn himself in?

157
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,359
Why would he admit to being
the master of Operation 7·23?

158
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,440
(Xiao Mu'en must have blackmailed him!)

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,679
Yin.

160
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,079
Calm down.

161
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,320
Do not do anything reckless.

162
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,440
(I'll inform the task force of what you just told me.)

163
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:17,440
Look.

164
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,640
Let's stay in contact.

165
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,799
If there's anything, I'll inform you.

166
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,480
Okay?

167
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:25,600
(Mr. Wang,)

168
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
(I don't know the law,)

169
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:29,600
but I have to keep my father safe!

170
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,839
He's on the way to
the special task force.

171
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,039
(I don't know if I'm obstructing your operation.)

172
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,479
(What should I do now?)

173
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,200
Yin.

174
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,479
Don't worry.

175
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,039
I'm here for you.

176
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,960
Mr. Wang Heyu told Ms. An Ni everything.

177
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,440
So, she sent me here.

178
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
I came as fast as I could

179
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,239
and made it here before you.

180
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,679
Mr. Yin.

181
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,640
You are an elder,

182
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,039
but I have to say this.

183
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,679
You are the owner of a corporation.

184
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
Before you take any action,

185
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,599
you should first think about
the fate of the company.

186
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,840
Fate?

187
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,400
It means nothing to me now.

188
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,760
I am no longer the chairman of Huiquan.

189
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,679
I stand by what I said.

190
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,000
Don't worry.

191
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,679
Have faith in the law and the Procuratorate.

192
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,440
Things will get better.

193
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,820
(Inaugural speech of Xiao Mu'en,
chairman of Huiquan)

194
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,550
(Speaker: Xiao Mu'en)

195
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,159
Fellow media outlets,

196
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,679
fellow comrades from Huiquan,

197
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,599
good evening.

198
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,320
It's an honor to be part of

199
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,880
this grand meeting with all of you.

200
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,080
This meeting will mark a milestone

201
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,400
for Huiquan Corporation.

202
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,679
Up next, we will all witness

203
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:09,200
a man who once managed a subsidiary

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,880
that became the next chairman of Huiquan.

205
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,520
It means Huiquan Corporation

206
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,559
is a company of self-reformation.

207
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,679
We are an internet-based company
that garners talents.

208
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,200
We are a company full of hope

209
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,640
and collections of knowledge.

210
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,239
Come in.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,559
Procurator Guo.

212
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,280
Take a look at this.

213
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,119
According to Yin Tiancheng's report,

214
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,239
Xiao Mu'en is a prime suspect of Operation 7·23.

215
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,400
He is suspected of ordering
the murder of Zhang Wanru.

216
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:53,799
I suggest the task force

217
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,919
begin investigating Xiao Mu'en now.

218
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,039
We must inform He Luyuan

219
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,320
to apprehend the suspect Xiao Mu'en.

220
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,679
Where is he now?

221
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,039
He's now at Huiquan's press conference.

222
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,880
He will be announced
as the new chairman soon.

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,039
Huiquan Corporation has been severely wounded

224
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,599
by this tumor from the internet.

225
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,320
If he manages to become the next chairman,

226
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,280
he will have a huge
negative impact on society.

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,400
An Ni.

228
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,799
Inform He Luyuan now.

229
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,239
He must act at once and apprehend Xiao Mu'en.

230
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:20,159
Use force if necessary.

231
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:20,440
Yes.

232
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,000
Now,

233
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,799
let's welcome Mr. Xiao to give us a speech.

234
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,880
After his speech,

235
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,359
I have good news for all of you.

236
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:36,479
Next, with a round of applause,

237
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
let's welcome Mr. Xiao to the stage.

238
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:48,359
(Thank you, Mr. Ding, board members,)

239
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
(and the executives of Huiquan,)

240
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,960
(and our friends from the press.)

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,119
I thought Mr. Xiao would be here.

242
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:56,080
What is this?

243
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,919
Who knows?

244
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,440
Maybe he'll be here later.

245
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,640
This is a video to warm up the crowd.

246
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:04,000
(On behalf of myself and Huiquan Corporation,)

247
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,159
(I have heartfelt words for you.)

248
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,599
(I believe you've all heard Mr. Ding.)

249
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,440
(Creativity and breakthroughs.)

250
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,359
Mr. Ding.

251
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,919
What is the meaning of this?

252
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,039
I thought Mr. Xiao would be here.

253
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,039
Why isn't he showing up?

254
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,320
He's only playing a video for us?

255
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,640
Nothing I can do about it.

256
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,840
Mr. Xiao just called me.

257
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,440
He had an accident on the way here.

258
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,440
He wants us to play
the recorded speech.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,479
He says he'll be here when he's done.

260
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,119
An accident at a time like this?

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,960
I hope it's just an excuse.

262
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,039
Enjoy life while you can.

263
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,840
Maybe he is in the company of some lovely ladies.

264
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,080
(In the past,)

265
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:55,080
(the internal reshuffling
of Huiquan Corporation)

266
00:12:55,719 --> 00:13:00,200
(has caused panic and affected
the growth of this company.)

267
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,000
(With the resolution
from the board members)

268
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:05,320
(and the consensus from our shareholders,)

269
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,159
(Huiquan Corporation's former chairman,)

270
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,760
(Mr. Yin Huiquan, will no longer)

271
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,679
(hold any position in
the company starting today.)

272
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,239
(He is stepping down as the chairman,)

273
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:18,640
(but he is still an honored shareholder of Huiquan.)

274
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,440
(He will continue to
light the way for our company.)

275
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,300
(An Ni)

276
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,140
(An Ni)

277
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,840
An Ni, what is it?

278
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,239
An Ni?

279
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,239
(What is it?)

280
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,239
It's nothing.

281
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,960
What is it? Spill it.

282
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,200
Are you calling to tell me to stay safe?

283
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,640
Stay safe.

284
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:31,919
Don't worry.

285
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,880
I know.

286
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,159
(I give you my word that I will do my best)

287
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,000
(to lead Huiquan out of this dark time
into glory once again.)

288
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,880
(The old Huiquan is no more.)

289
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,599
(We shall welcome a new age.)

290
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:07,239
(Every employee, every executive,)

291
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,960
(every brother and sister,)

292
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:11,719
(as members of the big family of Huiquan,)

293
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,359
(each of you shall have the chance
to prove your worth.)

294
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,119
(I shall treat each and every one of you equally.)

295
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,840
(I hope that everyone can trust and support me)

296
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,880
(wholeheartedly.)

297
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,119
(Three years.)

298
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,400
(In three years,)

299
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,599
(I shall lead you)

300
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,039
(in building a corporation)

301
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,919
(of unprecedented power.)

302
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,119
(Our goal)

303
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,400
(is to make Huiquan's product)

304
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,159
(become part of every household.)

305
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,400
(Our products shall serve everyone
who enjoys life.)

306
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,799
(Every talented young person capable)

307
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,000
(of starting their own career)

308
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,960
(will be willing to start a live stream)

309
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,440
(with Huiquan.)

310
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:53,520
(Huiquan will be part
of millions of households.)

311
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,840
(We will become
an inseparable part of their life.)

312
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,400
(Users of Huiquan will never regret choosing us.)

313
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:05,960
(Fellow shareholders, I assure you a new Huiquan)

314
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,359
(will usher in a new era never seen before.)

315
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,559
(Huiquan's stock price
and market value will skyrocket.)

316
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,840
(Can we do this?)

317
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,799
Mr. Xiao's speech moved me to tears.

318
00:16:40,239 --> 00:16:42,200
I, we,

319
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:45,119
have no reason not to believe that Huiquan,

320
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,359
under the lead of Mr. Xiao,

321
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,200
will have a brilliant tomorrow ahead.

322
00:16:56,599 --> 00:17:00,119
I hereby announce that

323
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,200
the new chairman of this company is Xiao Mu'en.

324
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,199
Commence operation!

325
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,400
Turn on the lights.

326
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
Stay where you are.

327
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,319
Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau.

328
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,239
Cease all activities now.

329
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,199
We need everyone to cooperate.

330
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,959
Who is the person in charge?

331
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:23,839
Me.

332
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,719
It's me.

333
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,680
I'm the administrative director.

334
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,400
This event is organized
by the administration department.

335
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,160
Who installed this camera?

336
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,239
We never installed a camera there.

337
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,239
(Yin Huiquan, I didn't wrong you.)

338
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,520
(You'll meet Zhou Ling
in hell very soon.)

339
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,800
(Li Kui.)

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,199
(Are you at the scene?)

341
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,800
(Captain He, don't bother coming.)

342
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,239
(Xiao Mu'en was never here.)

343
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,800
(He only played a recorded speech
on the big screen.)

344
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,180
(The capital line chart of criminal gang
in Operation 7·23)

345
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,940
(The capital line chart)

346
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,760
Ni.

347
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:49,400
Have your breakfast.

348
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:52,439
Don't worry.

349
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:53,760
He's not getting away.

350
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,119
These cyber syndicates are like cancer.

351
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:01,280
Everywhere they go, there's a sickness.

352
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,040
See?

353
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:05,520
This is the amount of money

354
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
they accumulated with illicit conduct
over the years.

355
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:08,880
They have a full suite of

356
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,239
back-end tech for their cyber crimes.

357
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,119
With money and tech,

358
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:14,199
they can rebuild their operation

359
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:16,040
anywhere on Earth.

360
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,280
If he gets away,

361
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,199
who knows how many

362
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,920
cases of 7.23 will there be?

363
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,920
How many families will be harmed?

364
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,119
I should have realized it sooner.

365
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:35,880
Ni.

366
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,359
Qian Tianxin's has been sentenced.

367
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,800
She's been sentenced to death

368
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:41,160
and all her assets will be confiscated.

369
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,719
Justice will prevail.

370
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,160
No one can escape it.

371
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,959
Yes, Procurator Guo?

372
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay.

373
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:52,560
Got it.

374
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,520
I'll be there now.

375
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,079
What is it?

376
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,599
Yin Huiquan is here.

377
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Yin Huiquan?

378
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,319
Thank you,

379
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,839
(Procuratorate of Jiangcheng)
prosecutors and your superiors

380
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,319
(Procuratorate of Jiangcheng
is loyal and responsible)

381
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:09,319
for offering help

382
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:10,040
(Procuratorate of Jiangcheng is loyal and responsible)

383
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,199
to me and Huiquan Corporation.

384
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:14,839
You saved Huiquan and me

385
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,560
from the ledge.

386
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,239
You have my gratitude.

387
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Before this,

388
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,000
all the details of the conversation

389
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,359
I had with Xiao Mu'en

390
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:30,319
have been told to the Procuratorate.

391
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,160
That should help your investigation.

392
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,439
However,

393
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,599
I must ask a favor of you.

394
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,599
After all, he is...

395
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:53,119
Because the twisted life he's lived

396
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,040
is directly related to me.

397
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,439
I hope that you can

398
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
save his soul with proper education.

399
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,800
Mr. Yin.

400
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,119
We understand how you feel.

401
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:12,000
We appreciate the honesty.

402
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,199
But we must abide by the law.

403
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:18,560
Yes.

404
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,680
Yes.

405
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,119
I only hope I can help him

406
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,400
as much as I can.

407
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,239
Ms. An.

408
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,119
I...

409
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,079
I've failed Huiquan.

410
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,359
I've failed the people.

411
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,319
I was so foolish.

412
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:48,640
How could I have fallen

413
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,439
for that despicable
Xiao Mu'en's deception?

414
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,119
Formality is not needed here.

415
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,640
We abide by the law
and protect the legal rights

416
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,359
of private companies
and entrepreneurs.

417
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,520
It's our duty to do so.

418
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,680
Our duty is to provide high-quality

419
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,800
prosecutorial services

420
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,280
and legal protection
for the healthy development

421
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,520
of the private economy.

422
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:16,719
We investigated the other board members.

423
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,560
They aren't involved
in any criminal activities.

424
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,119
They were only
blackmailed by Xiao Mu'en.

425
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,640
However,

426
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,239
the Public Safety Bureau

427
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:24,079
has reprimanded their actions.

428
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:30,959
Thank you.

429
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,800
Without your help,

430
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,880
we would have been fooled
and made a grave mistake.

431
00:22:38,959 --> 00:22:42,160
Mr. Yin was wronged.

432
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:48,199
Sorry.

433
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,439
Yesterday,

434
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:53,640
the bunch of us were flustered.

435
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,319
Mr. Yin,

436
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,920
you've been wronged this entire time.

437
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,239
We've decided to reinstate you

438
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,880
as the chairman.

439
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:07,400
Mr. Ding.

440
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:07,839
Come on.

441
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,000
Sit down.

442
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,199
I'd like to say a few words.

443
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:15,239
Actually,

444
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,239
I will not accept the resolution

445
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:22,599
the board and the shareholders

446
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,119
have made against me.

447
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,199
However,

448
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,839
when Xiao Mu'en came to my house,

449
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,599
everything became clear to me.

450
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,479
In the past,

451
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,839
I've made too many mistakes.

452
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,560
I owed too many too much.

453
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,160
I created Huiquan with my own hands.

454
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:50,040
But because I was too conceited
and short-sighted,

455
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,479
I almost doomed my own company.

456
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:55,239
I brought this to myself.

457
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,520
But now,

458
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,199
I don't even have the chance to repent

459
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,920
for all the mistake I've made this whole time.

460
00:24:08,199 --> 00:24:08,719
Mr. Yin.

461
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,319
Being Xiao Mu'en scapegoat is not a way to repent.

462
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,199
You are only allowing the evil to thrive.

463
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,920
If you truly wish to make amends,

464
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:21,920
rather than wallow in self-resentment and regret,

465
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,920
you should start by making Huiquan carry out

466
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,880
the social responsibilities
it has today.

467
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,719
Enforce the management
and censorship,

468
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,760
strengthen your discipline.

469
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,160
Starting today,

470
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,680
put the company in the right direction.

471
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,079
It's not too late.

472
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,199
She is right.

473
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,920
Mr. Yin.

474
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,839
Last night, I couldn't sleep.

475
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,680
I thought about many things.

476
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,119
I realized I was mistaken.

477
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,959
We were so obsessed with

478
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,119
expanding the company

479
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,680
through mergers and acquisitions.

480
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,680
But in the process,

481
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,800
we planted the seeds of hidden risks.

482
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,640
We overlooked that part.

483
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,680
I'd like to use this opportunity
to make a request

484
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,239
to the municipal government.

485
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,439
Go ahead.

486
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,880
I'll relay the message.

487
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,439
Given all the controversies

488
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,959
Huiquan has been caught up in lately,

489
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,280
I gave it a long thought.

490
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,319
I think

491
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,000
as a privately-owned high-tech corporation,

492
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,479
it's almost impossible to

493
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:33,839
have a comprehensive monitoring system.

494
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,280
We can get rid of tumors

495
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,359
like Zhao Jikai and Xiao Mu'en.

496
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,239
However,

497
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,520
do we not have any responsibility?

498
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,560
The cases with Shi Xiaohu

499
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,680
and Zhang Xiaobei,

500
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,560
how do we explain these?

501
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,160
I've come to this decision

502
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,400
after much consideration.

503
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,719
I believe our prosecutorial authorities

504
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,400
should regularly provide Huiquan

505
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,439
with legal education

506
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:07,119
on national policies and laws

507
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,920
so that we can operate
in compliance with the law

508
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,319
as we have a healthy
and stable development.

509
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,000
Mr. Yin, that won't be a problem.

510
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,439
The authority would love

511
00:26:18,479 --> 00:26:20,160
for corporations like Huiquan

512
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,800
to become better and obey the law.

513
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:25,280
Yes.

514
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,760
Thank you.

515
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:29,160
Thank you.

516
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,839
Thank you.

517
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:33,239
Thank you so much.

518
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,040
You gave Huiquan a second life

519
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,239
so it may be reborn.

520
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,479
Good morning.

521
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:47,000
Mr. Wang, we meet again.

522
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,680
Thanks for the other day and this case.

523
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,319
It's you again.

524
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,839
But you did great last night.

525
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,719
You pulled your dad back from the ledge.

526
00:26:58,479 --> 00:26:59,439
Mr. Yin.

527
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,880
You are standing here alive and sound,

528
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,920
all thanks to your great son.

529
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,760
Yes.

530
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,239
When I went back last night,

531
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,920
Tiancheng told me

532
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:14,959
he didn't like Huiquan's operation

533
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,920
and the fields it's involved in.

534
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,680
He also told me

535
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,239
he was tired of constantly living

536
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,199
under my protection.

537
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,319
He wants to try things he likes,

538
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,239
something meaningful.

539
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,800
Honestly,

540
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,560
I rather admire his way of doing things.

541
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,920
I plan to spread Chinese culture

542
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,280
and tell the tales of China.

543
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,160
I want to record the beautiful
and exciting moments

544
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:44,160
and my target audience
shall be the overseas viewers.

545
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,479
This will become an indirect competition

546
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:48,119
for Huiquan in terms
of content creation.

547
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,479
Dad, if you don't like how it goes,

548
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:53,119
acquiring my company is the only way.

549
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:56,439
I won't lower the price simply
because you are my father.

550
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,359
You have to think this through.

551
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,000
Starting a business won't be easy.

552
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,160
I'm not afraid.

553
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,160
If Xiao Mu'en could do it, I can too.

554
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,560
I never went through
any hardship as a kid,

555
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,439
so Xiao Mu'en took advantage of me.

556
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,800
Reality is much harsher

557
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,119
than the fairy tales
we were told as children.

558
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,439
(After the case with Shi Xiaohu,)

559
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,439
(our company founded a fund)

560
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,280
(for the underage.)

561
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:25,640
(You told me about the social orphans.)

562
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:26,880
(I did some follow-up.)

563
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,199
(I'd like to use this chance)

564
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,680
(to request permission)

565
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,760
(to use this funding)

566
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,239
(to set up a special charity
school in Jiangcheng.)

567
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:38,599
We're going to take in social orphans
and legal orphans.

568
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,800
Be it Huiquan's action or your charity work,

569
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,280
both are great.

570
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,160
I know.

571
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,359
From now on,

572
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,239
I have one more place to hang out at.

573
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,280
When I feel stressed or frustrated,

574
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I'll head to the school

575
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,680
and spend time with the kids.

576
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,880
Fairy tales...

577
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,719
An Ni.

578
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:00,760
Procurator Guo.

579
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
I know where Xiao Mu'en is.

580
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,439
Are you saying

581
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:06,439
Xiao Mu'en hasn't left Jiangcheng yet?

582
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:09,959
Look.

583
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,479
I'll call Chief Bai now.

584
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,920
Contact He Luyuan.

585
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,400
Okay.

586
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,680
Mr. Yin, excuse us.

587
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:16,719
He Luyuan.

588
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,760
He could be at the charity school.

589
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,160
(If he's there, the children are in danger.)

590
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,800
(He could use them as hostages.)

591
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,319
Yes.

592
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,520
(Don't worry.)

593
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,719
I'm on my way.

594
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,040
Stay safe.

595
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,959
Be careful not to fall.

596
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,119
One.

597
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,199
Two.

598
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,560
Three.

599
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,680
Four.

600
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,000
Five.

601
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:40,319
Six.

602
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:41,920
Seven.

603
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,000
Eight.

604
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,760
(The warm orange lanterns ignite hope)

605
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,280
Shush.

606
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,239
Headmaster, why are you here?

607
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,760
You know who I am?

608
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,959
The teachers told us about you.

609
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,800
You are a great person.

610
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,560
You donated a lot of money to our school.

611
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,760
The teachers also told us

612
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,640
we should grow up to be great people like you,

613
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,680
someone who help others.

614
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,119
Great.

615
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,520
I believe you will do great things

616
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,280
for society when you grow up.

617
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,560
Headmaster, why don't you go out?

618
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,319
Because

619
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,839
someone are looking for me.

620
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,319
Are you playing hide-and-seek too?

621
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,479
Can we play together?

622
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,479
Sure.

623
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,160
Let's play together.

624
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:14,880
How is the situation?

625
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,760
Captain He, the teacher did a roll call.

626
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
One girl is missing.

627
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,359
She never came out.

628
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,760
We suspect Xiao Mu'en has taken her as the hostage.

629
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,280
Right?

630
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,599
Right.

631
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,520
Long Yanling.

632
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,400
Hold this.

633
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,800
Zhou Siyue.

634
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:36,920
(The warm orange lanterns ignite hope)
If you need a hostage,

635
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,479
I'll go in there. Let the girl go.

636
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,400
Don't be afraid.

637
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,359
Who are you?

638
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:05,640
- I am a prosecutor.
- He isn't here.

639
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,319
- Tell me.
- He isn't over there.

640
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,920
What were you doing in there?

641
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,719
Big brother and I

642
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:10,479
were playing blindfold hide-and-seek.

643
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,119
The one who gets caught
must pass this note along.

644
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,599
(An Ni, I'm waiting at the rooftop.)

645
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,239
Don't come any closer!

646
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,640
I want to see An Ni.

647
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,839
The rest of you, back off!

648
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,439
An Ni.

649
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,839
See this?

650
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,760
It's sunlight.

651
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,160
People like me lack one thing.

652
00:33:22,719 --> 00:33:26,560
The blinding yet warming sunlight

653
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:31,160
that brings warmth to those around.

654
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,520
It feels like

655
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:42,760
the first ray of sunlight after being imprisoned

656
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,719
in that cold and bottomless cavern.

657
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:00,959
I brought you here to tell you

658
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:05,199
that I was once inspired

659
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,560
by that ray of light.

660
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,159
It lighted up my heart.

661
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,639
Thank you.

662
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm content with having that moment in this life!

663
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,879
Wait!

664
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,520
Xiao Mu'en.

665
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,120
Or should I call you Zhou Siyue?

666
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,840
I'm standing before you as a prosecutor

667
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,560
on behalf of the countless families that fell apart
because of you.

668
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,600
I can't let you die.

669
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,800
If you have any conscience left,

670
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:50,360
get down from the edge.

671
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,239
Come with us and face justice for what you did.

672
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,239
Why should I?

673
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,000
Why should I bow down to you?

674
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,120
What right do you have to judge me?

675
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,600
When I was in pain and helpless,

676
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:05,399
did you give me the chance

677
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,199
to be a good man and live?

678
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,399
I can tell you

679
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,840
why those people get deceived.

680
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,959
They believed they'd get free rewards
falling from the sky.

681
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,239
But they didn't know

682
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,360
that greed, fear, and blind obedience

683
00:35:27,439 --> 00:35:28,879
were the trap beneath them.

684
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,439
So please,

685
00:35:30,919 --> 00:35:33,040
spare me the fancy words.

686
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,000
Negotiation tactics won't work on me.

687
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,639
If you want to arrest me, fine.

688
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,120
You have to do so as An Ni,

689
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,560
and not the prosecutor you are!

690
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,439
It must be you!

691
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:46,879
Okay!

692
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:49,239
I am An Ni.

693
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:52,320
I don't want you to die.

694
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,199
I want you to live.

695
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,199
You've come this far.

696
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,800
You don't even fear death.

697
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,800
We won't be able to stop you.

698
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:04,760
But as your friend,

699
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,479
I'd like to bid you farewell.

700
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,439
Zhou Siyue.

701
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,760
Would you come down?

702
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,560
What are you doing now?

703
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,760
Are you mocking me?

704
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,040
Have you forgotten

705
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,719
how you pushed me away at my house?

706
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,959
I will never forget
that look in your eyes.

707
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,560
You looked at me with disgust.

708
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,040
As if...

709
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,959
As if I was filth!

710
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,040
Do you take me for a fool?

711
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,120
That's not true.

712
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:40,040
You misunderstood.

713
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,120
I was scared at the time.

714
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,199
Don't lie to me!

715
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,360
I'm not lying!

716
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,840
Zhou Siyue.

717
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,239
Come down.

718
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:50,000
Let me give you a last goodbye.

719
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,120
Would you dare come down?

720
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,159
Why?

721
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
Because we were friends.

722
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,440
(Detention Center)

723
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:10,239
Captain He.

724
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,320
What more do you

725
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,239
wish to learn from me?

726
00:38:30,959 --> 00:38:32,360
Let's talk about something else.

727
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:35,800
Something unrelated to the case.

728
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,560
Judging by your mood,

729
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,239
I doubt I'll get anything useful about the case.

730
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,120
You're not bad.

731
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,679
Let's talk about you.

732
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,080
I'm interested in you.

733
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:54,560
Sure.

734
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,479
Captain He.

735
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,360
I envy you.

736
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:01,479
Me?

737
00:39:02,439 --> 00:39:03,479
What for?

738
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,320
I work 365 days a year.

739
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,719
My phone is always standing by

740
00:39:08,919 --> 00:39:11,360
and I must rush to the scene upon calls.

741
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,879
I regularly skip my meals

742
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:14,959
and am deprived of sleep.

743
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:20,280
Your job is truly a tough one.

744
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,360
I believe the environment

745
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:24,040
is what shapes your personality.

746
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,479
If I were like you,

747
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,040
I bet I'd have a decent life.

748
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,479
I believe you're capable of that.

749
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,919
I agree with you

750
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:40,360
that the environment shapes us.

751
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,479
Therefore,

752
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,800
you have my sympathy.

753
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,000
By that I don't mean

754
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,159
I look down on you with pity.

755
00:39:49,879 --> 00:39:51,120
I'm not that fragile.

756
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,120
I am cuffed, but to me,

757
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,360
no one in this world can look down on me.

758
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,479
Yes, you are right.

759
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:02,479
No one has the right to look down

760
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,159
on anyone from above.

761
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,679
With your intellect and capability,

762
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,959
had you used them for the right things,

763
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,520
you could have had a successful career.

764
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Captain He.

765
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,959
This might sound harsh to you.

766
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,919
Go ahead.

767
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:23,719
We don't think on the same level.

768
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,360
You can never begin to fathom

769
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
what I pursue.

770
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,080
I admit you are more educated than me.

771
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,280
You studied at a prestigious school abroad.

772
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,159
But give it a try.

773
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,360
Maybe I could understand.

774
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,120
There is a writer that I like a lot.

775
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,159
Dietrich Bonhoeffer.

776
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:47,280
He once wrote this,

777
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,239
"Freedom is not about self-serving,

778
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,840
it's about getting away from oneself."

779
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,479
When a human is bound

780
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,479
by identity and lifestyle,

781
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,479
they won't be free.

782
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,120
Do you get it?

783
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,360
As human society developed,

784
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:13,760
your rigid law can no longer
shackle free thoughts.

785
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,080
I believe that you will live

786
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,439
to see the greatness I seek

787
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,120
will become more common and justified.

788
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,760
I don't really understand

789
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,879
what you just said.

790
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:37,719
But who do you think you are

791
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:40,159
when you talk like that?

792
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,639
Do you see yourself as a messiah?

793
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,919
When you see yourself that way,

794
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,120
countless families were torn apart

795
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:50,439
to feed your greedy desire.

796
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,679
Humans have been around
for thousands of years.

797
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:55,239
Something never changes.

798
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:57,919
Such as fairness and justice.

799
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:03,719
You sacrificed countless families for your own desire.

800
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,479
That is not fair.

801
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,120
Therefore, you must pay the price.

802
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:12,080
I don't think there's a need
to carry on this conversation.

803
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,679
If we go on...

804
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,120
It's every man for himself, right?

805
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,280
Today,

806
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,959
I came to bring you to court.

807
00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:32,280
But I came to
this realization on my way here.

808
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,879
I may not learn anything from this job.

809
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,280
I'll get you someone
you'd want to talk to.

810
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:44,479
Thanks.
