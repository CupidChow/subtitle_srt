15
00:01:44,734 --> 00:01:46,013
Today,

16
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:49,693
I came to bring you to court.

17
00:01:50,214 --> 00:01:53,013
But I came to
this realization on my way here.

18
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:55,613
I may not learn anything from this job.

19
00:01:57,414 --> 00:02:00,013
I'll get you someone
you'd want to talk to.

20
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:05,214
Thanks.

21
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:06,613
That's unnecessary.

22
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:08,574
She's here to interrogate you too.

23
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:10,494
She's not representing herself.

24
00:02:10,813 --> 00:02:13,854
She represents the prosecutors of the country.

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,450
(Repent and Reform)

26
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:47,854
I thought

27
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:51,333
they wouldn't let me see you again.

28
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:54,134
I don't know if I should call you
Xiao Mu'en or Zhou Siyue.

29
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,173
You can call me whatever you like.

30
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:59,173
Okay, Xiao Mu'en.

31
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:00,693
I'm An Ni, a prosecutor.

32
00:03:01,774 --> 00:03:03,054
Now, I will interrogate you

33
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,533
as per the reviewing stage.

34
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,854
I will announce the rights and obligations
of this phase.

35
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,093
I know all of them.

36
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,134
An Ni,

37
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:12,693
today, you're the interrogator.

38
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:13,733
As for me,

39
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:15,693
I'm a detainee.

40
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,054
I'll listen to you.

41
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:22,093
Let's get straight to business then.

42
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:26,134
Since when did you start to suspect me?

43
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:27,093
Xiao Mu'en,

44
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:29,093
the prosecutor office

45
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:30,333
is interrogating you
according to the law.

46
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,054
We're interrogating you,
not the other way around.

47
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,854
What if I told you

48
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:37,533
that I suspected you from the start?

49
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:43,173
What do you mean?

50
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:45,054
It's my occupational nature.

51
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,613
I always harbor a doubtful attitude
toward strangers.

52
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,533
My doubts will be decreased gradually.

53
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:52,374
However, for you, it's the opposite.

54
00:03:52,893 --> 00:03:54,494
The more I know you,

55
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,333
the more doubts I have.

56
00:03:57,294 --> 00:04:00,054
If you want to ask me when I confirmed

57
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,253
that you were the suspect of the case,

58
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:03,693
I guess I could tell you.

59
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:07,054
It was when I discovered the photos
in your house.

60
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:10,494
What are you looking at?

61
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,333
I saw that there was a storybook.

62
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:18,054
Mr. Xiao!

63
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:19,694
Mr. Xiao, what are you doing?

64
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:25,654
Don't tell me

65
00:04:26,293 --> 00:04:27,694
you thought that I was...

66
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:28,573
Xiao Mu'en.

67
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:30,534
Han Xuan.

68
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:32,494
Let him speak.

69
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:43,254
Actually, I've already given up

70
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:46,893
back then.

71
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,733
If not, there's no way for you
to discover anything.

72
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:52,453
What have you given up?

73
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,494
I believe that you guys

74
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,333
did a background check on me.

75
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:04,534
I escaped from a nightmarish environment.

76
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,814
I established myself
through academic qualifications.

77
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:13,133
And, I won everything I have right now
through the business field.

78
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:19,893
I was a poor child
who was abandoned by the world.

79
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,333
I carved my own fate

80
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:25,173
through my effort one step at a time.

81
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,293
I did nothing wrong.

82
00:05:29,534 --> 00:05:30,453
Therefore,

83
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:34,293
I own countless amounts of money.

84
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:38,494
I can even establish
my own online empire immediately.

85
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:47,694
However,

86
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,133
after I've obtained wealth, power,

87
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,774
and exacted my revenge,

88
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:02,173
I felt even more empty.

89
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:06,293
What should I do?

90
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:11,774
I have no choice
but to find another goal.

91
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:17,374
I did so in order to make myself forget

92
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:23,094
that I'm a total nihilist.

93
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:27,054
I did so to prove that I'm still alive in the world.

94
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:29,613
An Ni,

95
00:06:32,094 --> 00:06:32,893
actually,

96
00:06:33,534 --> 00:06:35,534
I met you long ago.

97
00:06:35,534 --> 00:06:36,413
You're so messy.

98
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:37,774
He doesn't even know
how to tie his own shoelaces.

99
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,060
I know how to do it.

100
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:45,733
Thank you, miss.

101
00:06:45,934 --> 00:06:46,654
Thank you, miss.

102
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:47,654
All done.

103
00:06:47,893 --> 00:06:49,494
- Thank you, miss.
- Thank you, miss.

104
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:52,853
Mister!

105
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:54,374
Mister!

106
00:06:55,654 --> 00:06:56,814
There's no one there.

107
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:57,814
Let's go.

108
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,853
But Mister was hiding behind the wall.

109
00:06:59,893 --> 00:07:00,694
Yeah.

110
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:06,853
(Ever since I met you in the orphanage,)

111
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:13,013
I was suddenly envious of the life under the sun.

112
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,654
I wanted to live under the sun

113
00:07:16,694 --> 00:07:18,374
and advance together with you.

114
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,214
I know

115
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:23,974
that it's impossible

116
00:07:25,494 --> 00:07:27,333
and that it's too late for me
to turn back.

117
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:30,573
I also know that you will
never be together with me.

118
00:07:33,374 --> 00:07:35,013
Even so, I still can't hold myself back.

119
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:36,974
I want to approach you.

120
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:40,453
I want to approach you,
even by just a little.

121
00:07:41,814 --> 00:07:43,413
It made me feel like

122
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:45,374
there was hope in the world.

123
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:51,254
However, humans are conflicting beings.

124
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:54,453
Just like my mother.

125
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:57,173
She wanted to die.

126
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:59,974
But she struggled when she was drowning.

127
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:02,214
I guess her survival instinct kicked in.

128
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,374
I'm just like her.

129
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:06,974
Although I'm tired of my plans,

130
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:09,613
I still execute them nonetheless.

131
00:08:11,054 --> 00:08:13,254
I joined Huiquan as the CEO
of Green Broadcasting.

132
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,413
I attracted investments for Huiquan
and made a mess of the company

133
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:19,413
until Qian Tianxin was arrested.

134
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,534
That silly woman.

135
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,054
I landed her in this plight.

136
00:08:26,814 --> 00:08:28,054
Without me,

137
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,613
she could've scammed men

138
00:08:30,654 --> 00:08:31,654
and hid herself overseas.

139
00:08:33,134 --> 00:08:34,334
She'd be able to lead a cool life

140
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:35,733
as a bad woman.

141
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,934
I dragged her down.

142
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,773
But she's willing to take the blame for me

143
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:44,814
of her own accord.

144
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:46,134
Aunt Xin,

145
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:49,173
I'm here to tell you

146
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:52,293
to leave this place immediately.

147
00:08:56,613 --> 00:08:57,613
Where should I go?

148
00:08:57,853 --> 00:08:59,574
I've invested so much effort into this.

149
00:08:59,574 --> 00:09:00,973
Now, you want me to leave?

150
00:09:01,134 --> 00:09:02,213
Where can I go?

151
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:03,213
Can I even leave?

152
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,254
I can't.

153
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,574
You should know

154
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,374
the consequences of staying here.

155
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,134
It's not too late for you to leave.

156
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:14,213
I'll deal with the rest.

157
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,533
I'll find a scapegoat.

158
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,014
You'll find a scapegoat?

159
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:26,613
Who?

160
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:31,134
Do you mean Zhao Jikai?

161
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:33,574
That's impossible.

162
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:36,413
This has nothing to do with him.

163
00:09:37,254 --> 00:09:38,853
It's my responsibility.

164
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:40,254
If something does go wrong,

165
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,213
I'll shoulder all of the blame.

166
00:09:42,254 --> 00:09:43,613
Will you be able to?

167
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:57,213
I just hope

168
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:58,454
that you two can be safe.

169
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:02,613
This is what I've been doing since the past,

170
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:04,293
am I right?

171
00:10:07,413 --> 00:10:08,213
Aunt Xin,

172
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:10,973
you can't afford
to be emotional about it now.

173
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:14,014
You should leave while you still can.

174
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:16,054
Leave for my sake.

175
00:10:39,213 --> 00:10:42,613
If things do go wrong,

176
00:10:43,973 --> 00:10:44,973
don't worry.

177
00:10:45,694 --> 00:10:47,454
I will ensure your safety

178
00:10:48,254 --> 00:10:49,454
by any means necessary.

179
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:57,454
(I didn't receive love
from my biological parents.)

180
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,814
However, a woman
who wasn't related to me,

181
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:02,054
was capable of providing that to me.

182
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:06,254
I have to repay the favor.

183
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:08,574
If I can't save her,

184
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:12,613
I'll join her in prison, even in death.

185
00:11:13,093 --> 00:11:15,093
So, you forced Zhao Jikai
to turn himself in

186
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:17,054
to save Qian Tianxin.

187
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:19,533
And, you intended
to murder Li Yitang too.

188
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,613
If I wanted Li Yitang to die,

189
00:11:22,454 --> 00:11:24,014
she would've died for sure.

190
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:26,653
(I promised Zhao Jikai before.)

191
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:28,533
(As long as he obeys my order,)

192
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:30,773
(I won't make things difficult
for Li Yitang.)

193
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:34,334
(I just wanted Li Yitang
to sleep for a few days)

194
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,413
(so that she wouldn't
cause any trouble for me.)

195
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:42,254
This way, I'll have enough time
to interact with Yin Huiquan.

196
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:46,454
So, Yin Huiquan fell from his throne
as the chairman of Huiquan.

197
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:48,853
And, you took over Huiquan Corporation.

198
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,973
I guess your feud with Yin Huiquan

199
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,613
has been resolved then.

200
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:54,814
Since that's the case,

201
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:56,454
you're no longer worried

202
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:58,054
that people might find out
you're Zhou Siyue.

203
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:09,773
That day,

204
00:12:10,894 --> 00:12:12,574
when I invited you to my house,

205
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,494
I was planning

206
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:16,574
to tell you everything

207
00:12:16,814 --> 00:12:19,613
about my past

208
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:24,173
even though I had a shady past.

209
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:28,853
It's a shame that you pushed me away.

210
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,853
It was my first time hugging you.

211
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,213
It was my last time hugging you too.

212
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:40,894
Xiao Mu'en,

213
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:44,653
I hope you can understand

214
00:12:44,694 --> 00:12:45,934
that the prosecutor office is

215
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,014
interrogating you right now.

216
00:12:47,454 --> 00:12:48,934
You're a criminal suspect

217
00:12:48,973 --> 00:12:50,173
while I'm a prosecutor.

218
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,054
Let's return to the case.

219
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:55,254
Okay.

220
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:56,574
I won't put you on the spot here.

221
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,574
Now, you just need to
answer one question.

222
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,574
After that, I'll cooperate with
your investigation

223
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:05,213
no matter what answer you give me.

224
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:06,853
I just hope

225
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,653
that you won't lie to me.

226
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:13,374
Whether I answer your question or not

227
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:16,054
depends on the type of question you're asking.

228
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,613
But I can promise you this.

229
00:13:17,653 --> 00:13:19,334
I never lie.

230
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,733
Not in the past, not now.

231
00:13:26,894 --> 00:13:29,694
What if I wasn't Zhou Siyue?

232
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:31,413
What if I was Xiao Mu'en,

233
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:33,814
the person you saw before?

234
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,574
You'll fall for me, right?

235
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:45,934
Don't tell me

236
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:47,973
you think Xiao Mu'en

237
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,014
was a persona I created

238
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:52,733
in order to escape from the law?

239
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:00,134
No.

240
00:14:02,574 --> 00:14:04,173
Xiao Mu'en is a real person.

241
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:07,374
He's more real than Zhou Siyue.

242
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,814
If I was born in an ordinary family,

243
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:12,773
if I could live like how I wanted to

244
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:14,173
without hiding myself,

245
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,653
I could become Xiao Mu'en,

246
00:14:15,694 --> 00:14:17,973
who's a disciplined, upright, sunny,

247
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:20,733
gentle, friendly, and loving person.

248
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,973
Zhou Siyue and A,

249
00:14:23,014 --> 00:14:25,413
those were the personas I created

250
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:27,254
to rebel against life.

251
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:27,773
An Ni,

252
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:31,213
I'll ask you again.

253
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,733
Will you fall for Xiao Mu'en?

254
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,494
From a personal perspective,

255
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,054
it's not entirely impossible.

256
00:14:43,413 --> 00:14:45,334
However, I wish you won't mix things up.

257
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:46,934
It's impossible for a person

258
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,134
to live as an individual all his life.

259
00:14:49,173 --> 00:14:50,773
He still needs
to be integrated into society.

260
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:53,413
No matter if you're
Zhou Siyue or Xiao Mu'en,

261
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:55,213
you have the same values.

262
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:56,454
And those values

263
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,054
are the complete opposite of mine.

264
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:00,293
As a law enforcer,

265
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:02,413
the law is more important

266
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:04,254
than everything in life,

267
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,613
including love.

268
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:11,054
That's why I won't fall for
a criminal suspect like you.

269
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:13,494
I'll answer your question.

270
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,134
I'll never fall for Xiao Mu'en.

271
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:26,014
I'm starting to feel sorry for myself.

272
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:28,413
Why have I fallen for

273
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:30,533
a clear-headed woman like you?

274
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:33,173
I'm so unlucky.

275
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:35,413
You've asked me your question.

276
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,213
And, I've given you my honest answer.

277
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:39,494
I hope you can fulfill
your end of the bargain now.

278
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:41,814
Okay.

279
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:45,014
Go ahead.

280
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:46,374
Where do we start?

281
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,454
From Zhang Wanru.

282
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:53,093
What's the matter?

283
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,653
Did something bad happen?

284
00:16:00,254 --> 00:16:02,773
Someone sabotaged
our points of operation in Huadu.

285
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:07,054
How could I be in a good mood?

286
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:14,894
Aunt Xin, we were almost imprisoned.

287
00:16:19,293 --> 00:16:21,894
I'm sure there's a mole among us.

288
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,134
I'm sure it's an undercover cop.

289
00:16:24,894 --> 00:16:26,293
Could it be someone from your side?

290
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:31,494
I guess it's someone from my side then.

291
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:35,814
It doesn't matter which side he's from.

292
00:16:38,853 --> 00:16:41,054
We have to find the mole.

293
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:44,853
I've already staged an act.

294
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:47,454
I plan to lure that person out.

295
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:49,533
What will you do after luring him out?

296
00:16:49,973 --> 00:16:51,254
How do you plan to deal with him?

297
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,973
Will you make him vanish?

298
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:54,173
This is an emergency.

299
00:16:54,334 --> 00:16:56,934
I've already contacted a junkie.

300
00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:01,173
We can leave such a task to the professionals.

301
00:17:05,094 --> 00:17:05,893
Wait.

302
00:17:07,214 --> 00:17:09,334
How could you be so reckless?

303
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:11,454
How could you see
such a person personally?

304
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,094
If something goes wrong in Country A,

305
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:15,173
it'll spell more trouble for you.

306
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,133
Li Quan is the person in charge
for Country A.

307
00:17:17,214 --> 00:17:18,533
I told him already.

308
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:20,413
If anything goes wrong in Country A,

309
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:21,854
he'll take the blame.

310
00:17:22,854 --> 00:17:23,974
He should know the consequences

311
00:17:24,493 --> 00:17:25,814
of breaking his promise.

312
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,814
He's not one of us.

313
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:28,773
Can he even be trusted?

314
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:30,454
If something does go wrong,

315
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:32,773
even if you can blackmail him
with his family members,

316
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:34,253
what if he double-crosses you?

317
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,094
Once he double-crosses you,

318
00:17:36,173 --> 00:17:38,173
it'll stir up more trouble.

319
00:17:39,574 --> 00:17:40,373
I know that.

320
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:43,814
Let's overcome this ordeal first.

321
00:17:44,493 --> 00:17:46,334
We can talk about the rest later.

322
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:51,253
No.

323
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,334
We can't afford to wait.

324
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:57,214
Tell me the time, location, and details

325
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:59,173
of your encounter.

326
00:18:00,653 --> 00:18:01,493
Port Selva,

327
00:18:03,094 --> 00:18:05,493
Carey-Layes Avenue No. 117,

328
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,133
it was a cafe called Marie Payne Cafe.

329
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,173
What drink did you order?

330
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,493
Country A's milk coffee.

331
00:18:20,173 --> 00:18:22,773
You put on a disguise

332
00:18:23,054 --> 00:18:24,173
when you met him, right?

333
00:18:28,773 --> 00:18:30,013
There's one thing.

334
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,293
I don't know if he discovered it or not.

335
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,854
I was wearing gloves back then.

336
00:18:36,454 --> 00:18:37,854
One of them fell off.

337
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:40,614
I think he saw my hand.

338
00:18:41,293 --> 00:18:43,173
It's no wonder Paul said

339
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:45,533
that the old man he met
had hands as fair as a woman's

340
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:47,854
in his statement.

341
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:57,454
Since when did you know

342
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:59,454
that Zhang Wanru was an undercover cop?

343
00:19:00,614 --> 00:19:01,734
The branches in Country C

344
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:04,734
were under my supervision.

345
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:06,773
I would make sure

346
00:19:06,773 --> 00:19:08,653
that everything was perfect.

347
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:10,373
The exposure of her identity

348
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:13,253
meant that someone from other branches

349
00:19:13,293 --> 00:19:14,373
might have leaked her details

350
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:17,173
by accident or on purpose.

351
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,533
Thus, I did a filter using the system.

352
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:21,893
Of course,

353
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,814
everyone's communication

354
00:19:23,854 --> 00:19:25,373
was under my surveillance.

355
00:19:25,974 --> 00:19:27,773
I can track all of their calls and texts

356
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:29,253
as long as they're

357
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:33,493
within the signal of the branches.

358
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:34,614
By filtering them out,

359
00:19:34,814 --> 00:19:35,854
I found out

360
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,293
that someone in Country A's branch

361
00:19:37,293 --> 00:19:39,214
contacted the country

362
00:19:39,694 --> 00:19:42,893
and sent a strange text to them.

363
00:19:43,214 --> 00:19:44,734
I followed the clues.

364
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:48,854
And, I found Zhang Wanru
without any difficulties.

365
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,653
According to the rules I set,

366
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,533
she received her punishment.

367
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:56,334
I will never allow anyone

368
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:59,293
to bring the evidence outside alive.

369
00:19:59,653 --> 00:20:01,214
There's something I'm curious about.

370
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:04,054
Don't you feel uneasy

371
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:05,574
when you employ such cruel methods

372
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:08,614
to dispose of your former comrades?

373
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:14,334
Zhang Wanru may be your senior,

374
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:17,454
but to me, she's a traitor.

375
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:22,253
We just have different perspectives.

376
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:24,533
How did you get rid of
your identity as Zhou Siyue,

377
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,094
become Xiao Mu'en,

378
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,694
and sneak into the country successfully?

379
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,334
Money talks.

380
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:31,413
You can be Tom,

381
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:35,214
Jerry, or anyone you like to be abroad

382
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,253
as long as you're
willing to spend money.

383
00:20:40,253 --> 00:20:43,854
Executing my plans in China

384
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,013
proved to be the only challenge I faced.

385
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:49,054
However, I loved challenges.

386
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:51,293
It's just like conquering a level
in a video game.

387
00:20:54,013 --> 00:20:55,214
It gave me a sense of achievement.

388
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:57,334
So, that was the reason
you became Xiao Mu'en

389
00:20:57,574 --> 00:20:59,133
and disguised yourself
as the CEO of a live stream company.

390
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:02,854
If you wish to achieve your goal,

391
00:21:04,214 --> 00:21:05,814
you have to know
what you're getting into.

392
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:10,694
It's the same as choosing the field
you want to start your business in.

393
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,253
That's why I planned out everything in advance.

394
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:18,533
I instructed Qian Tianxin
to send Zhao Jikai to Macau, China,

395
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,133
and created a chance encounter

396
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,413
between me and Yin Huiquan.

397
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,814
Although I didn't interact
with Yin Huiquan before,

398
00:21:27,574 --> 00:21:28,814
I did study his background extensively.

399
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:30,454
I predicted

400
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:32,253
that he would fall for

401
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:34,334
the video game development proposal

402
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:37,653
that I prepared especially for him.

403
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:38,653
Thus,

404
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,814
Zhao Jikai became my vanguard.

405
00:21:42,454 --> 00:21:43,173
Through him,

406
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:48,173
Huiquan acquired and merged
Green Broadcasting without any difficulties.

407
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:49,854
As for me,

408
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:53,214
I joined Huiquan naturally.

409
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,013
No one would suspect

410
00:21:55,293 --> 00:21:57,814
an entrepreneur like me.

411
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:01,773
However, revenge alone won't be able to satisfy me.

412
00:22:02,413 --> 00:22:05,574
It's because I discovered another possibility

413
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:08,253
within the Internet industry.

414
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:10,454
With Huiquan as my cornerstone,

415
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:14,334
I could establish my own online empire.

416
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:18,814
Thus, I changed my plan.

417
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,614
That's why you stayed in the country

418
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:23,854
to keep everything under control.

419
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,173
As for Qian Tianxin,

420
00:22:25,214 --> 00:22:26,373
she'd be in charge of
executing the steps

421
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:28,133
of cybercrime outside of the country.

422
00:22:28,293 --> 00:22:30,893
All of your illicit funds were kept overseas.

423
00:22:31,173 --> 00:22:32,614
Through layers of transfers,

424
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:35,214
they were transferred to
your bank accounts in Europe.

425
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,854
After that, you laundered the money

426
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:40,653
and invested everything into Huibo,

427
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:41,614
expanding the company.

428
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,493
Huiquan was facing financial issues too.

429
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:46,974
Thus, you became the major shareholder
of Huiquan without any difficulties.

430
00:22:47,773 --> 00:22:49,974
And, you took over Huiquan by force, am I right?

431
00:22:50,854 --> 00:22:51,734
I know

432
00:22:52,574 --> 00:22:55,454
financial transactions are hard
to track and verify.

433
00:22:56,694 --> 00:22:58,054
You guys would have no way
to find the source

434
00:22:58,893 --> 00:23:00,893
if I didn't confess.

435
00:23:01,493 --> 00:23:02,293
That's right.

436
00:23:02,974 --> 00:23:04,293
The foreign trust fund

437
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:05,974
that was investing Huiquan,

438
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:07,653
it was all me.

439
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:11,574
I formed the fund through the profits
I made from the scams.

440
00:23:11,854 --> 00:23:14,253
Huiquan has completed
the share buyback process.

441
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,334
The cops have also
located your illicit funds.

442
00:23:18,094 --> 00:23:19,133
During crucial moments,

443
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:20,814
he cast away parts of the profit

444
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,133
to withdraw himself from the issue.

445
00:23:22,454 --> 00:23:23,694
There's nothing wrong with that.

446
00:23:23,734 --> 00:23:25,814
Since when did you remove
the birthmark on your face?

447
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:36,454
The birthmark was a sign of bad luck.

448
00:23:38,653 --> 00:23:41,413
I got rid of it after my mother's passing.

449
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:45,334
I guess it was a type of farewell

450
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:47,694
to the pitiful lives we had.

451
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:50,974
Did you return to your old house

452
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:52,214
and take a picture of your ID card?

453
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:53,694
After her passing,

454
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,214
I returned to our old house with her ash.

455
00:23:58,413 --> 00:23:59,614
I took a picture of my ID card

456
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:04,614
because I didn't want my past to be erased.

457
00:24:05,214 --> 00:24:07,413
I have to remember the real me.

458
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:09,454
I guess you can see it

459
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,454
as the meaning of my existence.

460
00:24:11,854 --> 00:24:13,013
Meaning of your existence, huh?

461
00:24:14,734 --> 00:24:15,734
What about A then?

462
00:24:16,214 --> 00:24:17,293
What about Xiao Mu'en?

463
00:24:17,934 --> 00:24:18,694
Didn't you just say

464
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:21,133
that you wished to live as Xiao Mu'en?

465
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:27,893
All of these are just codenames.

466
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:30,493
They can be discarded
when they run out of usefulness.

467
00:24:30,893 --> 00:24:32,533
You just need to remember this.

468
00:24:33,934 --> 00:24:35,253
I am me.

469
00:24:36,334 --> 00:24:38,214
I'm the king of cybercrime.

470
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:40,734
Xiao Mu'en,

471
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,094
you traveled to Country F legally
before this.

472
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:46,013
However, you snuck back
into the country.

473
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:50,013
That day He Luyuan sent you to
the boarding gate personally.

474
00:24:50,893 --> 00:24:53,094
However, you didn't take the flight
on the same day.

475
00:24:53,814 --> 00:24:56,173
So, it was your plan all long.

476
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:59,493
You staged a heroic act for yourself,

477
00:24:59,614 --> 00:25:01,454
yet you were colluding with Qian Tianxin

478
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:02,413
behind our backs.

479
00:25:03,373 --> 00:25:05,454
You were the one who ordered a hit on me, right?

480
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:08,133
Just like how you ordered a hit
on Zhang Wanru.

481
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,854
I had no idea that Qian Tianxin

482
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,013
had staged such an act.

483
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:19,493
I don't understand.

484
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:22,814
Why must you see me

485
00:25:23,013 --> 00:25:24,214
when you're in such a situation?

486
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:27,293
Don't you understand
your situation right now?

487
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,013
Why did you try to kill her?

488
00:25:34,173 --> 00:25:34,974
Don't tell me

489
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:38,614
you want to kill me as well?

490
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,173
She has to die.

491
00:25:42,614 --> 00:25:44,253
You know that better than me.

492
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:46,533
I've used all kinds of methods on her.

493
00:25:46,574 --> 00:25:48,253
Coercing, tempting, even blackmailing.

494
00:25:48,653 --> 00:25:50,054
She has no weaknesses.

495
00:25:50,054 --> 00:25:51,454
Nothing worked on her.

496
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:52,694
If we keep her alive,

497
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,454
we'll be in deep trouble.

498
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:56,013
Don't you understand?

499
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:57,614
What will happen after you kill her?

500
00:25:59,334 --> 00:26:01,054
Do you think you can kill all of them?

501
00:26:01,173 --> 00:26:01,653
I know

502
00:26:01,694 --> 00:26:03,214
you have different thoughts about her.

503
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:05,293
However, you need to
understand something.

504
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:08,854
You and her are sworn enemies.

505
00:26:09,253 --> 00:26:11,493
If she doesn't die, I'll die!

506
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:14,893
Why do you think I'm doing so?

507
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:17,653
I'm doing so for your noble goal.

508
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:19,854
I'm doing so for the sake of everyone.

509
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:25,413
I have no way to predict what will happen on site.

510
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:31,334
I understand why you're upset about it.

511
00:26:32,854 --> 00:26:34,054
But I hope you understand

512
00:26:35,054 --> 00:26:36,653
why I'm doing this.

513
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:42,214
I did it unconsciously in an attempt
to protect you.

514
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:48,013
It doesn't matter.

515
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:50,413
You can choose
whether to trust my words or not.

516
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:57,934
Maybe making me a heinous sinner

517
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:04,133
might help you feel better, am I right?

518
00:27:05,533 --> 00:27:06,334
Xiao Mu'en,

519
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:08,013
don't tell me

520
00:27:08,013 --> 00:27:09,094
you think I'll feel something for you

521
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,054
when I encounter you like this?

522
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:12,893
Listen.

523
00:27:13,413 --> 00:27:16,253
We never had any pleasant encounters.

524
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:18,974
I will stand on the prosecution bench

525
00:27:18,974 --> 00:27:20,893
and provide allegations of your crimes.

526
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:25,214
And, you will receive
the judgment of law in public.

527
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:27,934
All those cybercrimes you've committed

528
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:29,814
will be nailed on the pillar of shame

529
00:27:29,854 --> 00:27:30,934
so that other people can
learn from your lesson.

530
00:27:33,814 --> 00:27:35,574
It's just a case of winner takes all.

531
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:42,334
I only collected personal details,

532
00:27:42,574 --> 00:27:45,373
filtered them, and ran an algorithm with them.

533
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,734
I want to establish an empire.

534
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:49,854
An all-new online empire.

535
00:27:50,694 --> 00:27:54,214
No matter if it's people or matters,

536
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:55,854
everything will be transparent.

537
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,493
There will be no loneliness,

538
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:04,013
betrayal, violence, shattered families, or...

539
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:04,614
Xiao Mu'en,

540
00:28:04,854 --> 00:28:07,013
stop using such noble excuses

541
00:28:07,013 --> 00:28:08,293
to cover up for your crimes

542
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:09,694
and mislead the public.

543
00:28:10,574 --> 00:28:11,253
Answer me then.

544
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:12,934
What have you done with

545
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:14,094
the personal details you obtained?

546
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:17,734
You used them to sell sexual services
to the users,

547
00:28:17,773 --> 00:28:19,854
make people take their own lives,

548
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:21,893
destroy their lives, influence them to gamble
and take out loans.

549
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:24,214
You're murdering people unknowingly,
do you know that?

550
00:28:24,214 --> 00:28:27,574
All those useless fools
who are addicted to sex and gambling,

551
00:28:27,574 --> 00:28:29,133
are they even fit to be called people?

552
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:30,454
An Ni,

553
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:33,013
maybe it's because you grew up

554
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:34,694
in a sunny and pure environment.

555
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:36,133
When I was young,

556
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:38,173
I'd met too many people like them.

557
00:28:38,893 --> 00:28:41,214
They spent the family's money

558
00:28:41,614 --> 00:28:43,054
on unethical things.

559
00:28:43,173 --> 00:28:45,253
Even if they only have ten yuan left,

560
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:46,293
they'll buy alcohol.

561
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,413
After they get drunk,

562
00:28:47,413 --> 00:28:49,413
they'll abuse their children and wives.

563
00:28:50,094 --> 00:28:51,893
Do you think their lives
will be improved

564
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:55,013
with the absence of my cybercrimes?

565
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:57,214
Listen.

566
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,614
I just brought them out of the pit

567
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:00,694
and threw them into the abyss.

568
00:29:00,734 --> 00:29:01,734
Think about it.

569
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:02,653
I'm protecting their family members

570
00:29:02,653 --> 00:29:03,934
from another perspective.

571
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:04,493
Xiao Mu'en,

572
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,373
what about Yuan Fangfang,
Zhu Xin's wife?

573
00:29:07,734 --> 00:29:10,013
Her husband killed her to get an insurance claim

574
00:29:10,054 --> 00:29:11,814
in an attempt to repay his debt.

575
00:29:12,694 --> 00:29:14,334
What about Zhang Xiaobei, who took
his life by jumping into the river?

576
00:29:14,493 --> 00:29:16,974
What about Shi Xiaohu,
who offended no one?

577
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:19,614
A noble goal requires sacrifices.

578
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:21,334
What a nutcase.

579
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:22,814
He's definitely a nutcase.

580
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:28,013
I'll stop here.

581
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:29,094
An Ni,

582
00:29:29,773 --> 00:29:31,574
I already know my ending.

583
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:38,734
Please give me

584
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:41,173
the prosecution of justice.

585
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:44,574
I only have one request.

586
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:46,893
Please spare me some dignity.

587
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:48,694
Xiao Mu'en, don't worry.

588
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:50,653
We'll clarify our evidentiary requirements,

589
00:29:50,653 --> 00:29:51,773
strengthen our evidence,

590
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:53,133
write down the statements,

591
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,373
complete our reports,

592
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:55,653
list down the outline of our evidence,

593
00:29:55,773 --> 00:29:56,974
and complete our prosecution opinion.

594
00:29:57,054 --> 00:29:59,054
Although your list of crimes
is too numerous to be listed,

595
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:01,533
we will list out
every single one of them.

596
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:05,694
You said so yourself.

597
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:07,734
Everything has a price.

598
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,574
I can tell you this right now.

599
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:13,454
Every second you spend here

600
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,373
is the price you're paying
for what you've done in the past.

601
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:18,974
You once asked me

602
00:30:19,054 --> 00:30:21,493
why I chose to be a prosecutor.

603
00:30:22,214 --> 00:30:23,413
This is the reason.

604
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:27,334
In this world, everything is fair.

605
00:30:27,694 --> 00:30:28,893
Everyone has to pay the price

606
00:30:29,214 --> 00:30:31,454
for what they've done in the past.

607
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:33,893
This is the most important
and only reason

608
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:36,253
I chose to be a prosecutor.

609
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,173
It's the fact

610
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,293
that this job can help people

611
00:30:41,413 --> 00:30:44,094
to uphold justice and fairness in society.

612
00:30:44,454 --> 00:30:45,814
I will always be proud of that fact.

613
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:52,493
Xiao Mu'en, see you in court.

614
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:56,173
Goodbye.

617
00:31:31,653 --> 00:31:33,133

Comrade Li Jia has brought you guys around
different departments

620
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:41,934
and provided you all
with basic training.

621
00:31:41,974 --> 00:31:45,653
I believe you guys have a basic understanding

622
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:46,814
of common criminal cases,

623
00:31:46,814 --> 00:31:48,974
juvenile criminal cases,

624
00:31:49,293 --> 00:31:50,934
criminal cases
involving official positions,

625
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:54,574
economic crime cases, and so on.

626
00:31:54,614 --> 00:31:55,454
However,

627
00:31:55,454 --> 00:31:58,533
learning the basics of a prosecution

628
00:31:58,653 --> 00:32:00,214
is merely one of
the most basic requirements

629
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:02,214
you need to be a prosecutor.

630
00:32:02,293 --> 00:32:03,334
Therefore, today,

631
00:32:03,373 --> 00:32:04,653
we shall observe

632
00:32:04,974 --> 00:32:08,133
the prosecution of Operation 7·23
in order to learn from it.

633
00:32:08,814 --> 00:32:11,854
I hope you guys can learn faster
through real-time situations.

634
00:32:12,054 --> 00:32:13,334
I hope you guys can understand

635
00:32:13,614 --> 00:32:16,694
what it takes to work as a prosecutor.

636
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:21,653
I also hope that you guys can grow up to be

637

I did some statistics.

644
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:39,173
During the past two months,

645
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:41,293
you've read a total of 234 case files,

written a total of 370,000 words
in your case file review,

and written a total of 110,000 words
in your review report.

Do you know how many days

649
00:32:46,653 --> 00:32:48,054
you burned the midnight oil?

650
00:32:49,214 --> 00:32:50,373
Almost 50 days.

Even if I'm just
a prosecutor's assistant,

the workload for this case

653
00:32:53,694 --> 00:32:55,734
is much more than any other cases
that I've dealt with.

654
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:59,214
I always feel uneasy before the trial.

655
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:00,814
I'm afraid that something
might go wrong.

656
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:03,413
Now that we're in the court,
I feel abnormally calm.

657

I feel like everything
has fallen into place.

If that's what you feel,

659
00:33:09,974 --> 00:33:12,293
that means you're only a few steps away
from being a true prosecutor.

660
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:13,893
Really?

661
00:33:15,574 --> 00:33:16,734
Of course not.

00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,734
You still have a long way to go.

(Next, we'll proceed with
the court investigation.)

686
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,973
(First, the prosecutor shall
read the indictment.)

687
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:43,894
The defendants, Zhou Siyue,

688
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:45,374
Li Quan, and Zhang Qiang,

689
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:47,293

the People's Republic of China.

693
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:56,013
They should be held criminally liable

694
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,533
for the intentional homicide.

695
00:34:58,213 --> 00:34:59,493

00:35:05,654 --> 00:35:07,334

700
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:08,614
they're considered joint offenders.

701
00:35:09,374 --> 00:35:10,493
The defendant, Zhou Siyue,

702
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:12,814

According to Article 26

704
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:16,253
of the Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China,

705
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:17,374
he shall be known as the mastermind,

706
00:35:17,533 --> 00:35:20,733
and should be held criminally liable for his crimes.

707
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:22,933
The defendants, Li Quan and Zhang Qiang,

708
00:35:23,213 --> 00:35:25,414
played the secondary roles
in their crimes.

709
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:27,574
According to Article 27

710
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:28,894
of the Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China,

711
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:29,814
they shall be known as the accomplices,

712
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,134
and should be treated with leniency.

713
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:33,773
The defendant, Zhou Siyue,

714
00:35:33,773 --> 00:35:35,414
organized an international
crime syndicate.

715
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:36,013
He committed telecom fraud

716
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:38,334
against the citizens of
the country overseas.

717
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:39,933
The sum was huge.

718
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:43,293
He has violated Article 266

719
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,094

721
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:49,574

722
00:35:49,693 --> 00:35:51,334
organized an international
crime syndicate,

723
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:53,374
established online
gambling establishments overseas,

724
00:35:53,374 --> 00:35:55,054
and influenced the citizens to gamble.

725
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:58,253
He has violated Article 303 of the Criminal Law

726
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,054
of the People's Republic of China.

727
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:01,374
He should be held criminally liable

728
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:03,574
for the operation of
a gambling establishment.

729
00:36:04,174 --> 00:36:05,574
The defendant, Zhao Jikai,

730
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,614
has violated the related rules
of the country

731
00:36:07,614 --> 00:36:10,013
and provided the citizens'
personal details to other people.

732
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:11,414
This is a serious case.

733
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:14,414
He has violated Article 253-1

734
00:36:14,414 --> 00:36:16,614
of the Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China.

735
00:36:16,814 --> 00:36:18,334
He should be held criminally liable

736
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,733
for infringing on the citizens'
personal information.

737
00:36:21,253 --> 00:36:23,094
The defendants Li Quan and Zhang Qiang,

738
00:36:23,174 --> 00:36:24,574
were found to have their crimes omitted

739
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:26,614
after the court verdict

740
00:36:26,614 --> 00:36:27,614
and before the completion
of their sentences.

741
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,814
According to Article 70 and Article 69
of the Criminal Law of

742
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,253
the People's Republic of China,

743
00:36:32,374 --> 00:36:33,773
they should receive combined punishment
for several crimes.

744
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,574
Presiding judge,
the indictment has been read.

745
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:38,493
Defendants, do you acknowledge

746
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,054
the allegations brought forward

747
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:41,213
by the indictment?

748
00:36:43,213 --> 00:36:44,013
I do.

749
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:46,414
I do.

750
00:36:47,894 --> 00:36:48,693
I do.

751
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:56,693
Defense attorney, do you have
questions for the defendant?

752
00:36:57,574 --> 00:36:59,574
Yes. I have questions for the defendant,
Zhou Siyue.

753
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:02,334
The defendant, Zhou Siyue, can stay.

754
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,493
Leave the court
with the other defendants.

755
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:08,693
The defendants acknowledged their crimes
from the start.

756
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,493
If so, this court trial has no challenge at all.

757
00:37:12,414 --> 00:37:13,374
It's like this.

758
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:17,374
Right after the criminal suspect,
Zhou Siyue, was arrested,

759
00:37:18,094 --> 00:37:20,453
the trust fund he established overseas

760
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:23,414
used the capital he left behind in advance

761
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:28,293
to hire a professional Chinese lawyer

762
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:29,773
who performed outstandingly

763
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:33,453
in California, America, to be his attorney.

764
00:37:33,894 --> 00:37:34,854
The court trial today

765
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:37,654
will be an intense one.

766
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:41,453
How could a practicing lawyer in America

767
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,493
participate in a local prosecution?

768
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:46,933
The legal system in America
practices a dual system.

769
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:49,814
Both federal law and state law
co-exist with one another.

770
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:52,213
America practices a case law approach.

771
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:54,614
Therefore, they don't have
a unified Lawyers' Law yet.

772
00:37:54,654 --> 00:37:58,094
As California is still accepting
legal attorneys from overseas,

773
00:37:58,293 --> 00:38:02,493
lawyers from China can participate in
the California bar exam

774
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:05,654
to practice law in America.

775
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:07,414
That means

776
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:08,374
this defense attorney

777
00:38:08,374 --> 00:38:10,693
from California, America,

778
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:11,933
is actually a local lawyer.

779
00:38:13,894 --> 00:38:16,733
The defense attorney of the defendant,
He Jiawei,

780
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:18,094
received his bachelor's degree

781
00:38:18,094 --> 00:38:20,654
in Materials Engineering
from Jiangcheng University.

782
00:38:20,773 --> 00:38:21,414
For his Master's degree,

783
00:38:21,414 --> 00:38:23,414
he majored in Law
in Jiangcheng University.

784
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:26,134
During that period,
he passed the judicial examination.

785
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:27,614
After he graduated,

786
00:38:27,614 --> 00:38:29,894
he took his J.D. in America.

787
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:32,334
And, he passed the California bar exam
in one go.

788
00:38:32,414 --> 00:38:33,614
In the end,

789
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:35,094
he became a trial attorney

790
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:37,174
in the Supreme Court
of the United States.

791
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:39,894
He's also the only person in our city

792
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:42,213
who has the license to practice law
in China

793
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,733
and in the Supreme Court

794
00:38:44,773 --> 00:38:46,334
of the United States.

795
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:47,493
That's who he is.

796
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,253
He's also the overseas talent

797
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,013
acknowledged by our
Ministry of Education.

798
00:38:59,493 --> 00:39:00,374
Comrades,

799
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:01,574
it's like this.

800
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:03,094
As prosecutors,

801
00:39:03,773 --> 00:39:06,933
our duty is to represent the country

802
00:39:08,094 --> 00:39:10,134
in prosecuting crimes,

803
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:14,693
supervise the judicial proceedings,

804
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:20,253
and protect the legal rights
of the participants of the proceedings.

805
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:21,533
Comrade An Ni

806
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,293
spent several years preparing

807
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:25,493
for today's proceeding.

808
00:39:26,493 --> 00:39:29,614
I believe that she's ready.

809
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:31,134
I'm sure

810
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:32,854
she'll perform well today.

811
00:39:34,134 --> 00:39:35,733
I also hope

812
00:39:36,414 --> 00:39:39,814
that you guys can cherish

813
00:39:39,814 --> 00:39:41,293
this rare opportunity.

814
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:46,493
One day, you guys will become
prosecutors yourselves.

815
00:39:48,973 --> 00:39:49,574
Defendant, Zhou Siyue,

816
00:39:49,614 --> 00:39:51,614
do you know Zhang Wanru,
as stated in the indictment?

817
00:39:58,293 --> 00:40:01,054
She's the executive
of a branch in Country A.

818
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:04,894
(At first, I didn't know that
she was Zhang Wanru.)

819
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:08,533
(She joined our organization
with a fake name and identity.)

820
00:40:10,134 --> 00:40:12,013
Which year did
she join your organization?

821
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:13,414
What identity did she assume?

822
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:15,013
It was during the second half of 2017.

823
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:17,213
She lied to us that she was in huge debt

824
00:40:17,773 --> 00:40:19,933
and that she smuggled herself
into Country A to join us.

825
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:21,814
What has she done in your organization?

826
00:40:21,814 --> 00:40:24,814
At first, we trained her
to be an operator.

827
00:40:25,614 --> 00:40:26,814
She was a quick learner.

828
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,334
And, she achieved phenomenal sales.

829
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:32,174
Thus, we decided to let her

830
00:40:32,174 --> 00:40:34,094
train new operators.

831
00:40:35,094 --> 00:40:37,374
The operators she trained
were spectacular.

832
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:39,733
Thus, I promoted her
to be the head of department.

833
00:40:39,973 --> 00:40:41,614
Initially, I wanted Li Quan

834
00:40:41,614 --> 00:40:44,574
to manage my branches in Country C.

835
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:47,654
I wanted her to manage
my branches in Country A.

836
00:40:49,253 --> 00:40:50,733
Do you promote all operators

837
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:54,134
to be the head of department
after several months?

838
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:55,533
That's not the case.

839
00:40:55,933 --> 00:40:58,253
Zhang Wanru contributed a lot
to our branches.

840
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:01,054
That's why I made an exception
and promoted her.

841
00:41:04,054 --> 00:41:05,094
Your Honor, I would like to ask

842
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:05,894
the defendant, Li Quan, some questions.

843
00:41:06,453 --> 00:41:08,334
Bring the defendant, Zhou Siyue,
out of the court.

844
00:41:08,973 --> 00:41:10,253
Summon the defendant, Li Quan.

845
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:27,054
Hello, Li Quan.

846
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,973
I'm the defense attorney of Zhou Siyue.

847
00:41:29,174 --> 00:41:30,134
I have several questions for you.

848
00:41:30,174 --> 00:41:31,574
I hope you can answer me honestly.

849
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:32,733
Okay.

850
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:33,973
Zhang Wanru,

851
00:41:33,973 --> 00:41:35,574
the cop who was murdered
as mentioned in the indictment,

852
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:37,414
do you know her?

853
00:41:37,894 --> 00:41:39,933
I know her, but she used a different name.

854
00:41:40,174 --> 00:41:42,493
I didn't know that her name
was Zhang Wanru.

855
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:44,533
When did she join the organization
in Country A?

856
00:41:45,134 --> 00:41:47,414
She said she was a pharmaceutical rep.

857
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:48,814
She joined us in 2017.

858
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:50,654
She was in huge debt.

859
00:41:51,213 --> 00:41:54,854
After that, she smuggled herself
into Country A and joined us.

860
00:41:54,854 --> 00:41:56,614
Do all members

861
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,733
get promoted to be your trusted aide

862
00:41:57,733 --> 00:41:58,773
within one and a half years?

863
00:41:59,493 --> 00:42:00,293
No.

864
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,773
If so, why was Zhang Wanru
promoted so quickly?

865
00:42:03,293 --> 00:42:06,134
She was already outstanding
during our training.

866
00:42:07,054 --> 00:42:09,654
(We told her to train new operators
after a few months.)

867
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,013
(And, the operators she trained
performed well too.)

868
00:42:12,374 --> 00:42:17,094
(She alone managed the sales training
for the branches in Country A.)

869
00:42:17,574 --> 00:42:18,533
Your Honor, I would like to ask

870
00:42:18,574 --> 00:42:19,414
the defendant, Zhang Qiang,
some questions.

871
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:22,973
Bring the defendant, Li Quan,
out of the court.

872
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,414
Summon the defendant, Zhang Qiang.

873
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:29,094
Hello, Zhang Qiang.

874
00:42:29,253 --> 00:42:31,054
I'm the defense attorney of Zhou Siyue.

875
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:32,213
I have several questions for you.

876
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:33,894
I hope you can answer me honestly.

877
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:35,174
Okay.

878
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:37,493
Zhang Wanru, the cop who was murdered
as mentioned in the indictment,

879
00:42:37,533 --> 00:42:38,733
do you know her?
