I knew you are back.

16

I took it for granted.

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,680
When you weren't here,

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,000
I skipped all my breakfasts.

It's true.

20

So, Mr. Wang,

21
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
how is your wife now?

22
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,360
She's fine.

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,401
You know, Prosecutor Guo,

24
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,920
literally demanded

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,721
that I stayed with her

26
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:58,240
until she made a full recovery.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,481
At first, I was reluctant.

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,521
We have many cases at hand.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,041
Right.

30
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,441
But when I think about

31
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:08,520
what my wife did for me,

32
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,080
I realized I should

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
spend some time with her.

34
00:02:12,361 --> 00:02:14,160
You're unmarried.

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,281
So you don't know
how hard are our family members.

36
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,240
I agree.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,680
Your wife sure is kind.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,281
Anyway,

39
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:26,561
I brought gifts for you two.

40
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:27,680
One for each.

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
This is yours.

not traveling.

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,361
Why did you bring gifts?

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,761
Don't mind the gifts.

49
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Not like

50
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,841
I can afford

51
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,001
expensive gifts anyway.

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,481
Thank you then.

53
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:46,481
Let me open it.

54
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,121
Don't open it with your greasy hands.

to emphasize two points.

97

99

112

Everything

124
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,921
that happened thus far

125
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,481
has something to do

126
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,280
with our fallen comrade in Operation 7·23.

129

She was a national hero

130
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:16,560
who made us proud

131
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:19,241
during the special operation.

132
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,440
She was and still is a hero.

133
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,481
All of you,

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,761
not just me,

135
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,880
should remember her name.

136
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Please carry on.

137
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,560

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,120
the latest update.

175
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:23,320
Two,

176
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:24,840
the joint investigation team

177
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,600
will uncover the truth

178
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:30,440
behind this online loan syndicate.

179
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Dismantle

180
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,880
their network as soon as possible.

181
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,840
They cannot

182
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,400
continue to siphon

183
00:06:38,801 --> 00:06:40,440
money from the innocent

184
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,120
by any means.

185
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:43,880
We can confirm now

186
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,320
that we are facing

187
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:46,921
a huge and organized

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,400
criminal syndicate.

189
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:50,681
The municipal committee

190
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:52,801
announces that

191
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,840
both the security bureau
and the procuratorate

192
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,440
will work together for this operation.

193
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:00,280
Three,

194
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,921
our key witness, Zhang Xiaobei,

195
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
might be alive.

196
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,041
We need

197
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,560
to locate him as soon as possible.

198
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:12,000
All the difficulties and doubtful points

199
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,801
will become clear

200
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,560
if we find him.

201
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,801
Four,

202
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,641
are there any problems

203
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,000
of the online platforms

204
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,440
under Huiquan Technology,

205
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,440
what is the role they play

206
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,160
in this case?

207
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:27,361
Why

208
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,000
do all of them indicate

209
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:31,160
that something's afoot with Huiquan?

210
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,681
Local businesses

211
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,560
are the backbone
of our national economic growth.

212
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,201
They also shoulder

213
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,440
many societal responsibilities.

214
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,681
While it's difficult

215
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,241
to run a business,

216
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:47,041
keeping the business owners in line
is our duty.

217
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
We must unearth the truth.

218
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:50,840
If Huiquan is found guilty,

219
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,641
they should be punished.

220
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,081
If

221
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:56,560
there is no problem with Huiquan,

222
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:59,000
but someone else

223
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
is abusing Huiquan's

224
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,160
online platforms

225
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,761
to conduct illegal activities,

226
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,400
we will step in to rid Huiquan

227
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:06,761
of this pest.

228
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:08,041
Five,

229
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,320
the National Cybersecurity Awareness Week

230
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,880
will take place next week.

231
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:12,201
Illegal

232
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
online loan

233
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,600
and virtual frauds

234
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,521
are prevalent.

235
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:18,801
More and more victims appear.

236
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,120
Raising awareness

237
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,481
is now a priority.

238
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,681
My fellow colleagues,

239
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:28,961
act now.

240
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:33,600
Hello?

241
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,801
Who are you?

242
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,321
Yonggang.

243
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,080
It's me.

244
00:08:37,121 --> 00:08:37,921
Who?

245
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:40,640
(Your classmate from elementary school.)

246
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,041
I sat behind you

247
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,681
and copied your homework. Remember?

248
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,481
Zhan Peng?

249
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:47,840
You copied my homework

250
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,801
so many times

251
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,640
that the teacher always scolded us.

252
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,840
Wait. Weren't you next to me?

253
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,640
You weren't sitting behind me.

254
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,041
(Oh, I sure am getting forgetful.)

255
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:58,801
It's been many years.

256
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,681
(How are you?)

257
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,921
(How's everything?)

258
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
So-so.

259
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,840
What about you?

260
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:04,080
Are you in Jiangcheng?

261
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:05,200
Let's meet up one day.

262
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,681
I'm abroad.

263
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,681
Abroad.

264
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:08,960
But I'll be back in a few days.

265
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:11,121
We'll catch up then, okay?

266
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,881
(Should I add you on WeChat?)

267
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:13,481
Sure.

268
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,200
Just add my phone number.

269
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,121
Add me.

270
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,561
Okay.

271
00:09:17,561 --> 00:09:18,160
Let me see.

272
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,720
All right.

273
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,041
I'll add you.

274
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,180
(Zhan Peng, Confirm)

275
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,921
Another rich person.

276
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,041
Come on.

277
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,840
No need for the fruits!

278
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
- Come.
- Just a small gift.

279
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,400
Have some water.

280
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,160
Let me do it.

281
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:12,720
Careful, it's hot.

282
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,241
Have some water.

283
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,080
Thanks.

284
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:16,921
Thanks.

285
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:18,001
Let me do it, Madam Zhan.

286
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,760
It's fine.

287
00:10:19,121 --> 00:10:19,520
Come.

288
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:20,681
Drink some water.

289
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,561
Madam Zhan.

290
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,321
Someone came to visit?

291
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:23,720
Yes,

292
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:26,041
a girl called Luo Xiaoting.

293
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,241
She came to visit me

294
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,561
and ask for information.

295
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,921
She also said she would

296
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,960
support me

297
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,160
in her own ways.

298
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,241
Madam Zhan,

299
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,801
you're in great shape.

300
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:39,840
It's all

301
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:41,200
thanks to your concern.

302
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:41,921
You

303
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,441
gave me hopes

304
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,600
in this bleak life.

305
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,561
I'm glad to hear that.

306
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,080
Thank you so much

307
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,280
for continuing

308
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,640
the investigation of Xiaohu.

309
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:50,561
No worries.

310
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,400
Madam Zhan.

311
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,481
We came

312
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:53,760
to ask if Xiaohu...

313
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:54,441
Madam Zhan.

314
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:55,681
Just

315
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:56,840
out of curiosity,

316
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,561
did Xiaohu

317
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,241
ever borrow

318
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:01,241
or lend someone money?

319
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Borrow money?

320
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:05,921
He never mentioned it.

321
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,720
No one came here
to collect debts either.

322
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:13,280
Did you use to give him
a lot of pocket money?

323
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,121
No.

324
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:15,481
I only gave him

325
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,041
the money to buy medicine.

326
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,760
You know

327
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,520
how expensive it is with doctors.

328
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,200
Anti-depressants

329
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,681
cost a lot.

330
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,441
Why did you interrupt me?

331
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,280
Xiaohu must have used the money

332
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,121
to repay his online debts.

333
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,801
The truth will only

334
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,321
add to her suffering.

335
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,840
So let her

336
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,640
dwell in her blissful ignorance.

337
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:46,361
Xiaoting,

338
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:47,840
are you free?

339
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,001
If you're free,

340
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,001
let's grab some coffee.

341
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,001
My treat.

342
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,001
Okay.

343
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,000
(Huiquan)

344
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,000
(Luo Xiaoting's Page)

345
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,880
(Huiquan is liable or Shi Xiaohu is liable)

346
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,820
(I'm also a victim of their games.
Luo Xiaoting should launch a petition for victims.)

347
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:27,561
Professor Luo.

348
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,801
Here.

349
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:32,481
Professor Luo,

350
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:34,001
calm down.

351
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:35,640
It's

352
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:37,241
just a minor issue.

353
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,760
Mr. Zhao,

354
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,080
I am mortified.

355
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,441
Since you

356
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,160
are willing to downplay it,

357
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,280
I'll

358
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,720
be frank with you.

359
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,681
One,

360
00:12:57,001 --> 00:12:58,681
I'm sorry.

361
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,520
We're on the same boat,

362
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,720
after all.

363
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:03,881
I also apologize

364
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,280
on my daughter's

365
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,921
behalf.

366
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:09,041
Two,

367
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:10,720
I will call Xiaoting now

368
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:12,520
and ask her to take

369
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,200
this post down.

370
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,241
I will then ask her to post an apology

371
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,121
and pin it on her page

372
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:21,600
for

373
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:22,760
at least seven days.

374
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:24,400
Three,

375
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:26,361
I will use my personal account

376
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,280
to voice my support toward Huiquan.

377
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:32,640
I will also invite several
renowned law experts

378
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,720
to voice their support.

379
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,280
Four...

380
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,600
Four,

381
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:43,361
I am willing

382
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,280
to forfeit

383
00:13:45,921 --> 00:13:47,361
my year-end bonus.

384
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,200
I focused too much on my work

385
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
that I neglected
my daughter's upbringing.

386
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,241
I am ashamed of myself.

387
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:57,321
I failed

388
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,441
as a father.

389
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,400
Professor Luo,

390
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:03,481
calm down.

391
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
You know how easy it is

392
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,720
to rally

393
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
the young people.

394
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,840
I agree with

395
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,441
what you said just now,

396
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,200
except

397
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,600
for the last point.

398
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,241
The chairman said you

399
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,640
are our brain.

400
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,400
I need

401
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,801
your talent.

402
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,400
So I will not deduct

403
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
your year-end bonus.

404
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,441
Instead, I'll give you extra.

405
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:26,481
No, please.

406
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,361
Don't

407
00:14:27,561 --> 00:14:28,840
let me down.

408
00:14:30,561 --> 00:14:31,160
Okay.

409
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,000
(Petition of Huiquan's Victims)

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,880
(Guys, this is how many signatures we got so far.)

411
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,520
Here's your coffee.

412
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:57,640
Thanks.

413
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,160
(Dad)

414
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,600
(Guys, this is how many signatures we got so far.)

415
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,280
Welcome.

416
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,280
An Ni.

417
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:19,801
Take a seat.

418
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:21,801
Sorry, I'm late.

419
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:22,600
Not at all.

420
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,881
May I have your order?

421
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,080
One latte, please.

422
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,960
Noted.

423
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,441
An Ni,

424
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,200
you're usually busy.

425
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,681
What's the occasion?

426
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,881
What? I'm not busy.

427
00:15:33,361 --> 00:15:34,720
I have time to grab some coffee

428
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,921
with my friends.

429
00:15:37,361 --> 00:15:38,041
Well,

430
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:38,720
I

431
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,441
actually...

432
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,241
I'll be frank with you then.

433
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,160
I know

434
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:44,921
you visited Xiaohu's mother.

435
00:15:45,121 --> 00:15:46,840
Are you still following the whole thing?

436
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,041
Yes.

437
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:50,681
I did my own investigation

438
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,441
because Xiaohu's death

439
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:53,520
and Zhang Xiaobei's accusation

440
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,801
against Huiquan

441
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,080
seem to be related.

442
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,840
I want to see you today

443
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,080
for this matter too.

444
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,520
Let's cut to the chase

445
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,001
as I have to head back
to the procuratorate later.

446
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:03,520
Sure.

447
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:04,960
Are you giving me a mission?

448
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,481
Go ahead.

449
00:16:05,481 --> 00:16:06,280
I'll execute it.

450
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:07,600
No, not a mission.

451
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,760
I just want to know

452
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
what you've been doing.

453
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,840
What I've been doing?

454
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:13,881
You post critiques online, don't you?

455
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:16,400
I have read and watched

456
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,520
the content

457
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:19,041
you released.

458
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,520
I like them.

459
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:21,520
You have poignant insights,

460
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
with piercing wits.

461
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,801
And what I love the most

462
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:25,600
is that you are telling your readers

463
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,321
to think critically.

464
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:28,520
Like when

465
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,720
you were defending Xiaohu's mother.

466
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,200
I have watched the video you posted

467
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
yesterday.

468
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,600
I appreciate your genuineness

469
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,801
but do you ever think that perhaps

470
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,121
you were too radical yesterday?

471
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,600
An Ni,

472
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,801
I don't think so.

473
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,681
I was telling facts.

474
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,801
I merely said

475
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:46,921
what others

476
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,640
do not dare to say.

477
00:16:52,481 --> 00:16:53,080
Here's your coffee.

478
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
I

479
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:58,840
have been

480
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,321
meaning to tell you something.

481
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,561
You can be frank with me.

482
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,321
Among all my father's students,

483
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,081
Tang and you are the closest to me.

484
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,081
Although we don't meet often,

485
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,801
you're like my older sister.

486
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,841
Likewise.

487
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:14,081
And that's why

488
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,201
I have to warn you.

489
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,201
Your father

490
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,961
is now working for Huiquan.

491
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,041
An Ni.

492
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
Let me stop you there.

493
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,640
I get it.

494
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,321
It is very

495
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,041
perplexing that my dad goes to work

496
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,280
for Huiquan after he enters retirement.

497
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,201
But

498
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,041
our society does need

499
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,081
someone who gives a voice

500
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,120
to the minority

501
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,201
like you.

502
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,640
I like how

503
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:46,760
you reach out to Xiaohu's mother.

504
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,321
That's amazing.

505
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,480
I'm just worried

506
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,760
that one day,

507
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,201
you might find yourself

508
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,681
at odds with your father's stand.

509
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,280
An Ni.

510
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,240
Don't worry.

511
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,041
I understand your concerns.

512
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,201
I promise you

513
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,081
that my voice will always be there

514
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,441
and it will not be erased.

515
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:07,880
Even if there is a conflict of interest
with my dad.

516
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:10,041
I will stand for

517
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:10,880
what I believe in.

518
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,961
If I make a mistake,

519
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,240
I'll issue an apology.

520
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,721
Oh, Zhan Peng.

521
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,760
My life

522
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:21,561
sucks.

523
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,561
It's awful.

524
00:18:23,441 --> 00:18:25,081
I envy you.

525
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,841
(You used)

526
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,480
to copy my homework.

527
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,520
How come you're

528
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:31,321
more successful than me now?

529
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:32,841
As they say,

530
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,961
make money with your brain.

531
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:37,601
Listen.

532
00:18:37,601 --> 00:18:40,201
The iron rice bowl is no more.

533
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:41,441
(You need)

534
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:43,601
(to use your network
and resources in a smart way.)

535
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:44,640
(I was just like you)

536
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:46,640
(a few years ago. A cubicle worker.)

537
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:47,921
(But my relative)

538
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,240
was managing

539
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,321
investment trust abroad.

540
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:53,681
He made money with his insider information.

541
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:54,601
So

542
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:56,601
I invest in it with my savings.

543
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,441
Guess what happened?

544
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,841
Within a year or two,

545
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,041
my profit margin multiplied.

546
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,120
Listen,

547
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,721
investment trust

548
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:05,400
is very famous out there.

549
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,601
You can search it in the internet.

550
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,360
So,

551
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:08,240
do you want to join me?

552
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:09,160
Let's

553
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,601
get rich together.

554
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,201
Me?

555
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,961
(I'm out.)

556
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,520
(I)

557
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:22,280
have bad luck, I tell you.

558
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:23,041
I always lose money.

559
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,441
Hey.

560
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,441
What did I tell you?

561
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,280
Use your network and resources
in a smart way.

562
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,201
Luck has nothing to do with this.

563
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,681
(We are making money
via information inequality.)

564
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:33,601
(You get it?)

565
00:19:33,801 --> 00:19:34,240
I'm telling you this

566
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,841
because we are classmates.

567
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:36,360
I wouldn't

568
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,640
share this with anyone.

569
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,681
(Now,)

570
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:39,721
(to be honest,)

571
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,841
(my company usually)

572
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,120
invest in millions.

573
00:19:43,601 --> 00:19:45,601
But I allow you
to put in a few thousand yuan first.

574
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:46,640
(Just to test the water.)

575
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,280
(Okay?)

576
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:50,000
(You have to see it with your own eyes.)

577
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
(Once you see the profit,)

578
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:52,240
(you'll believe me.)

579
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:52,801
All right?

580
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,201
I...

581
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,640
Okay.

582
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,400
Zhan Peng,

583
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,201
(I'll)

584
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,801
(give it a try.)

585
00:20:03,921 --> 00:20:05,441
I'll put in 6,000 yuan first.

586
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:07,400
If there's a good return,

587
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,160
great.

588
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,120
If not,

589
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,561
I can still afford the loss.

590
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,640
(Jiangcheng City No. 2 Prison)

591
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,961
Prosecutor An.

592
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,201
Are you going to interrogate me or not?

593
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:41,580
I sit here for the entire morning.

594
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:41,640
(Jiangcheng City No. 2 Prison)
I sit here for the entire morning.

595
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,500
(Jiangcheng City No. 2 Prison)

596
00:20:43,561 --> 00:20:44,921
Are you known

597
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,240
for your patience?

598
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,640
You're an amusing one.

599
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,681
You keep sighing.

600
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:57,120
Li Quan.

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Do you know what is

602
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,480
an omitted crime?

603
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:03,321
If you insist

604
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,280
that you are scammer A,

605
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,921
you will be punished for something
you didn't commit.

606
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:08,321
Xuan.

607
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:10,640
How long does he have to serve?

608
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,240
More than 10 years, I think?

609
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:17,321
More than ten years?

610
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,120
Well, if he gets another sentence,

611
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,041
how many more years does he
have to be here?

612
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:24,280
Li Quan.

613
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,081
How is your health?

614
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,801
I beg your pardon?

615
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,321
I guess his health

616
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:33,120
will determine his jail time.

617
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,041
After all, he did murder
a police officer.

618
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:35,721
It's a heinous crime.

619
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,880
He gets life imprisonment, at least.

620
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:42,880
Prosecutor An.

621
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:45,081
No need to use fear.

622
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,721
Scare tactics don't work on me.

623
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,760
Are you trying to coerce me?

624
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,041
That's against the law.

625
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,801
We don't violate the law.

626
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,081
Li Quan,

627
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,120
we have met many criminals.

628
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:02,480
Most try to weasel out of the situation

629
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,240
but you

630
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:05,801
want to stay here forever.

631
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:06,921
You can't wait for them
to give you an extra sentence.

632
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:08,441
I'll be honest with you.

633
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,441
We know who the real scammer A is.

634
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,520
Your syndicate is meticulous.

635
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:13,561
Before you came,

636
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:15,160
they taught you what to say.

637
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:16,760
But your underlings

638
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,240
are not professional like you.

639
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,520
They look confused.

640
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:21,561
As if

641
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,120
scammer A is a foreign concept.

642
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,201
And they recite their statement

643
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,520
as if they are reading off a script.

644
00:22:26,561 --> 00:22:28,120
Even pauses

645
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
are the same.

646
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:30,480
It's identical.

647
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,841
I know

648
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:34,321
the police

649
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:37,041
want a confession.

650
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,441
Like I said many times before,

651
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,160
I am scammer A.

652
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,601
And I don't know a thing

653
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,240
about Zhang Wanru.

654
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,520
You're funny, Li Quan.

655
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,520
You have committed so many crimes

656
00:22:49,721 --> 00:22:51,640
that you're a legal expert now.

657
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,321
Be nice

658
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,441
and come clean now.

659
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,640
You will shoulder
your rightful punishment.

660
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:01,880
You can choose

661
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,480
to shoulder more punishment.

662
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,801
If the extra punishment

663
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,000
is too heavy for you,

664
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,640
you don't have to shoulder it.

665
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,160
No comments.

666
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,801
Since you're scammer A,

667
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:16,081
do you know Zhang Wanru?

668
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,041
Do you know her true identity?

669
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:20,480
I do.

670
00:23:20,841 --> 00:23:21,400
I know her.

671
00:23:21,561 --> 00:23:23,360
You know her true identity

672
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,760
so why was she killed?

673
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,240
Xuan.

674
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,721
Jot this down.

675
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,081
We have to tell the judge

676
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:30,280
the malicious intent

677
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,280
of the criminal here.

678
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,921
Sure.

679
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,441
Think it through now.

680
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,000
If your testimony is inconsistent,

681
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
you will be punished.

682
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:48,480
Scammer A.

683
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,400
When and how did you learn

684
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,480
about Zhang Wanru's real identity?

685
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:53,640
How did you know

686
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,681
what Zhang Wanru would be doing

687
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:55,640
that fateful day?

688
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,880
How did you set everything up remotely?

689
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:00,000
Which phone did you use?

690
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,240
Which SIM card?

691
00:24:01,321 --> 00:24:02,880
Did you contact anyone on the scene?

692
00:24:03,681 --> 00:24:05,480
How much did you pay the hitman?

693
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:06,480
How did you pay him?

694
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:07,801
On what currency?

695
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,081
I

696
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,921
can't remember.

697
00:24:13,801 --> 00:24:14,801
I did not kill her.

698
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,681
So you can't remember now?

699
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,041
Okay.

700
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:19,841
I'll give you a hint.

701
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:21,000
Paul

702
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,841
confessed in great detail

703
00:24:22,841 --> 00:24:23,721
how he was hired.

704
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,841
But of course,

705
00:24:25,201 --> 00:24:26,400
he will be punished for that.

706
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,841
You said you are scammer A.

707
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,081
So you will be punished
for what you did.

708
00:24:29,561 --> 00:24:31,201
If you can't recall it now, it's okay.

709
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,160
We can stay here

710
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:34,081
until your memory returns.

711
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,561
We have time anyway.

712
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:36,400
Besides,

713
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,441
we don't necessarily

714
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:38,760
need your confession.

715
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,880
We'll just write

716
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:40,921
whatever you say down.

717
00:24:41,321 --> 00:24:42,120
The choice is yours.

718
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:43,921
Take him away.

719
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,081
Li Quan.

720
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,520
Don't you have a relative

721
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:55,760
in Hong Kong, China?

722
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,760
An Ni.

723
00:25:13,081 --> 00:25:14,480
You are scary.

724
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,480
You bombarded him with questions

725
00:25:16,841 --> 00:25:17,801
and messed with his mind.

726
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:19,280
You left him hanging in the end.

727
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,201
His face was as white as a sheet.

728
00:25:22,201 --> 00:25:23,441
What do we do next then?

729
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,721
Keep him guessing for a few days?

730
00:25:25,721 --> 00:25:26,640
The details of the crime

731
00:25:26,681 --> 00:25:28,321
lie in the contradictions

732
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,841
given by these criminals.

733
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,721
And we need them to slip up.

734
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,321
We will decide and adapt

735
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,400
our tactics

736
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,201
to the information given to us.

737
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:37,921
Keep him guessing for a few days.

738
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:38,880
We don't play

739
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:40,321
this game at his pace.

740
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,120
An Ni.

741
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:47,921
Mr. Wang.

742
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,601
I need to talk to you.

743
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:51,321
Tonight,

744
00:25:51,681 --> 00:25:51,880
you,

745
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:52,321
me,

746
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,280
and Prosecutor Guo

747
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,000
have to work overtime.

748
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
What for?

749
00:25:57,961 --> 00:25:59,321
Prosecutor Guo

750
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:00,081
will lead

751
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,520
the three of us to write
a Prosecution Recommendation

752
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,000
to Huiquan.

753
00:26:05,201 --> 00:26:06,480
We will advise the company

754
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,000
to file for a public interest litigation.

755
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
That's so sudden.

756
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,961
I might have forgotten to tell you.

757
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:14,880
Look.

758
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,120
It's either Huiquan crossed someone

759
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,360
(Petition of Huiquan's Victims)
or they did something wrong.

760
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,081
Everyone is canceling them.

761
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:20,841
There

762
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:22,240
you go.

763
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:23,721
Prosecutor Guo

764
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:26,120
saw the articles

765
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,921
too.

766
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,640
And

767
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,961
the higher-up called him

768
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,561
and brought this issue up.

769
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,640
He carefully analyzed

770
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,640
and studied everything

771
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:38,760
and found that minors

772
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,601
or their guardians

773
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,201
are questioning

774
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,441
the games under Huiquan.

775
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:46,441
As prosecutors,

776
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:49,000
we should bear the responsibilities

777
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:50,721
and play our roles.

778
00:26:51,081 --> 00:26:52,921
Our minors protection law

779
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,681
got another amendment too,

780
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,081
which protected

781
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,000
their public interest.

782
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,120
A new section

783
00:27:00,441 --> 00:27:02,400
on cybersecurity was appended.

784
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:03,601
Clause No. 74

785
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:06,721
imposes social

786
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,640
and entrepreneurial obligations

787
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,921
on internet service providers

788
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,000
such as Huiquan.

789
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,801
It also lays out a stricter guideline

790
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:17,201
for future internet products to follow.

791
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,801
As you know,

792
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,601
Huiquan

793
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:23,721
is a forerunner.

794
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,041
And sometimes, the judiciary system

795
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:28,120
is slightly behind
the contemporary world.

796
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,841
This time,

797
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,721
we won't initiate the prosecutorial
procedures right away.

798
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,201
Instead, we will release

799
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:37,120
recommendations via public platforms.

800
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
That way,

801
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,921
we issue a reminder
to all relevant businesses.

802
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,081
And they will have enough time

803
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,520
to make adjustments.

804
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,041
Most importantly,

805
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:48,441
it gives us the opportunity

806
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,240
to filter out

807
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:52,081
the busybodies

808
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,880
from the victims.

809
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,880
Then this notice needs a lot of things.

810
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,441
What kind of companies does it address?

811
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,081
Should the applicable companies

812
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,880
contact us?

813
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:04,000
Should we provide evidence?

814
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,160
That's a lot.

815
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,640
Right.

816
00:28:05,841 --> 00:28:07,640
What should we do now?

817
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,880
You know what?

818
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,360
I have a draft with me.

819
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,520
I referred to Article 2

820
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,801
of Clause 58

821
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,801
in Civil Procedure Law

822
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:17,240
and Law of the People's Republic of China
on the Protection of Minors.

823
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Please go through them

824
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:21,041
and see if I forget anything.

825
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,841
After that, we submit it
to Prosecutor Guo for approval.

826
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,321
Noted.

827
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:24,321
No problem.

828
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,640
Go now.

829
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,081
Okay.

830
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,460
(Huiquan Corporation)

831
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,520
Ms. Li.

832
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,520
The document you need.

833
00:28:33,561 --> 00:28:33,760
Eh?

834
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:33,961
Okay.

835
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:36,601
Professor Luo.

836
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:38,801
Yitang.

837
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,480
Professor Luo.

838
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:40,880
Finally you're here.

839
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:42,921
What do you have now?

840
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,280
Have a look.

841
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:44,841
All right.

842
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,720
(Huiquan Technology Internal Review Statement)

843
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:52,681
You know

844
00:28:53,201 --> 00:28:54,561
what I like

845
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,041
about your quality

846
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
when I was teaching you?

847
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,321
I'm curious.

848
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,081
Decisive and relentless.

849
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:04,321
That's you.

850
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:05,801
Of course,

851
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:07,681
people with great ambition

852
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:10,120
are like that.

853
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:12,520
But now,

854
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,480
I have another piece of advice for you.

855
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,120
You will go far
with strategic concession.

856
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:24,441
I

857
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,081
have talked to several legal experts.

858
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,841
They are willing

859
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:31,240
to help us.

860
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,400
I don't want to be harsh,

861
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,201
but this statement here

862
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,160
is problematic.

863
00:29:38,601 --> 00:29:40,321
It doesn't solve any issues.

864
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:41,721
You write here,

865
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:43,880
Huiquan prospers

866
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,041
under the government's

867
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,561
guidance and supervision.

868
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,801
We did not

869
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,681
and never will commit something

870
00:29:54,441 --> 00:29:55,400
against the law.

871
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:00,841
As a law practitioner,

872
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:02,520
your sentence here is impeccable.

873
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,801
When something happens,

874
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:08,120
our first task
is to remove the liability on us.

875
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:12,601
But among

876
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:13,441
legal principle,

877
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:14,961
sympathy

878
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:15,880
and logic,

879
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,801
only sympathy

880
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,321
can silence

881
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,280
the naysayers.

882
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,801
And

883
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:27,801
this line here.

884
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:30,601
We take this seriously

885
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,400
and will conduct an internal review.

886
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:35,721
I

887
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:37,041
can understand that

888
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,601
but it feels

889
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,280
so superfluous.

890
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:42,400
There

891
00:30:42,681 --> 00:30:43,880
isn't any concrete plan

892
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:49,041
of reformation,

893
00:30:49,441 --> 00:30:51,240
contents and details,

894
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,760
so it makes the readers think
that this is disingenuous.

895
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,280
Also,

896
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:58,160
here.

897
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,201
This line

898
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:01,321
is dangerous.

899
00:31:03,921 --> 00:31:06,081
We will fulfill
the procuratorate's demands

900
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,880
and use facts to prove our innocence.

901
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
It sounds like

902
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,081
too aggressive.

903
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:15,041
As if you're arguing

904
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:16,400
with the procuratorate.

905
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:20,240
The procuratorate

906
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,441
is an official establishment.

907
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:26,400
Do you think they release

908
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,640
a Prosecution Recommendation for fun?

909
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,601
They must have enough evidence

910
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:35,000
to make them think
that this is necessary.

911
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:37,601
That's why

912
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,041
we

913
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,760
should assume a humble position

914
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:43,880
and apologize.

915
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,441
Otherwise,

916
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:49,321
based on the current situation,

917
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:52,801
we will lose the lawsuit.

918
00:31:53,961 --> 00:31:54,721
When that happens,

919
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:57,801
not only do we have to clear our name,

920
00:31:58,201 --> 00:32:01,400
we will also be fined for a huge sum.

921
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,721
All our resources go to that

922
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,400
and for what?

923
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:09,880
The company's reputation

924
00:32:09,921 --> 00:32:11,041
will be in shamble.

925
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,441
I suggest

926
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,880
we wait till the Technology Department
comes here

927
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:18,681
and we revise the statement

928
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,681
sentence by sentence.

929
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,441
We will...

930
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:24,760
What's the time now?

931
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,280
It's midnight.

932
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,120
It's the next day already.

933
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:29,480
We still have time.

934
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
We are supposed to finish it

935
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,640
within 15 working days.

936
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,601
If we can release it

937
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,400
before 9 a.m. tomorrow,

938
00:32:40,561 --> 00:32:43,441
it should be fine.

939
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:46,041
You know,

940
00:32:47,081 --> 00:32:48,441
for this work volume,

941
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,441
other companies

942
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,801
would need a month.

943
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,721
It's all

944
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:57,041
thanks to you, Professor Luo.

945
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,201
By the way,

946
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:00,081
did you

947
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,961
argue with Mr. Zhao?

948
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,120
Usually,

949
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:04,721
in this kind of situation,

950
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:07,480
he will come here in person,

951
00:33:07,681 --> 00:33:09,721
but he sent me instead.

952
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,520
He even

953
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:11,240
told me

954
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,801
not to tell you.

955
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,000
No.

956
00:33:16,201 --> 00:33:18,160
It's just a small misunderstanding.

957
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,921
We'll move on in no time.

958
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,160
Yitang.

959
00:33:25,601 --> 00:33:26,921
Work is work.

960
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:28,961
Life is life.

961
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:30,760
Work hard

962
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:32,400
and live well.

963
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,360
Find a balance

964
00:33:34,801 --> 00:33:36,081
between relationship

965
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:37,360
and friendship.

966
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:39,601
I know.

967
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,760
Let me see.

968
00:33:42,841 --> 00:33:43,081
Sure.

969
00:33:51,081 --> 00:33:51,240
By the way,

970
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:51,601
Xiaoting,

971
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:53,601
your voice recorder isn't working.

972
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:54,921
How are you supposed
to do the interview?

973
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,760
The battery died?

974
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,441
No,

975
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,081
but the memory is full.

976
00:33:59,081 --> 00:33:59,520
Perhaps

977
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,000
you can delete one of the recordings?

978
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:03,601
This is my father's voice recorder.

979
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:05,400
Whatever.

980
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,520
He always leaves it on anyway.

981
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,841
So many blank entries.

982
00:34:08,841 --> 00:34:10,081
Let me delete some.

983
00:34:10,361 --> 00:34:10,841
Okay.

984
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,240
I don't even know if my son

985
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:20,321
is dead or alive.

986
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:22,680
And you want to shut me up

987
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,401
with money already?

988
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,760
Huiquan is trying

989
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:28,960
to help you here.

990
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,720
A kind gesture
without any extra conditions.

991
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,960
Mr. Yin

992
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:35,720
just wants to help you.

993
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,601
So why

994
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:37,480
are you asking me

995
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,601
to sign this paper?

996
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,760
I know nothing about laws

997
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,680
but I'm not dumb.

998
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,680
You

999
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,720
are planning something.

1000
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:47,881
You overthink this.

1001
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,720
Just sign this paper

1002
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,440
and you will receive

1003
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,161
one million yuan.

1004
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,121
No.

1005
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
Leave!

1006
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,601
Xiaoting?

1007
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,161
Did you free some memory space?

1008
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:00,680
Xiaoting?

1009
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:03,920

(Professor Luo already called me
and I must say,)

1051
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,161
(I agree with him.)

1052
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:41,920
Look at Xiao Mu'en.

1053
00:36:42,561 --> 00:36:43,960
When Zhang Xiaobei's debacle flared up,

1054
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,041
he delivered a sincere speech

1055
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,841
(during the press conference.)

1056
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:52,801
(He won the people's hearts,)

1057
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:55,760
(putting a stop to the rumors.)

1058
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,440
(You, in comparison,)

1059
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,480
look like a joke.

1060
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,440
A joke

1061
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:05,801
that costs me

1062
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,200
several investors already.

1063
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:09,440
(Zhao Jikai.)

1064
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,081
(If you can't fill your shoes,)

1065
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:13,601
(tender)

1066
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,720
your resignation.

1067
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:45,600
(Police)

1068
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:47,960
Yang Bao, this is your home?

1069
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes.

1070
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:51,240
Thank you for picking me up

1071
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,081
from the detention house.

1072
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,680
Days feel like years.

1073
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,401
I thought I would be locked up
till the Chinese New Year.

1074
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:57,801
Don't mention it.

1075
00:37:58,321 --> 00:37:59,720
Captain He told me

1076
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
to pick you up.

1077
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:02,920
I'm so lucky.

1078
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:03,641
I mean,

1079
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,440
I'm ashamed, thanks.

1080
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:05,561
Now,

1081
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,720
don't do that again.

1082
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,401
The law enforcers are cracking down

1083
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:11,081
telecom frauds now.

1084
00:38:11,361 --> 00:38:12,361
Don't do anything illegal.

1085
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,361
You hear me?

1086
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,520
Yes, yes.

1087
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,960
I won't do something illegal again.

1088
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:16,680
Oh,

1089
00:38:17,401 --> 00:38:18,601
should I call your family

1090
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,280
to give you some money?

1091
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:22,960
No need.

1092
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,641
I

1093
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,601
will meet some friends later.

1094
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,240
Okay.

1095
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:27,480
See you then.

1096
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,440
Thanks.

1097
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,480
Thanks, Kui.

1098
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,361
Thanks, sir.

1099
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,881
Drive safe.

1100
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,280
Eat.

1101
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:46,321
Let's eat.

1102
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,000
Bao.

1103
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:53,200
Now you know

1104
00:38:53,561 --> 00:38:55,000
who your true friends are.

1105
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,480
Your classmates

1106
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
all ditched you.

1107
00:39:01,401 --> 00:39:02,200
Come.

1108
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:05,321
Have some.

1109
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:07,440
I bet

1110
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:08,720
you didn't eat much in there.

1111
00:39:09,601 --> 00:39:10,520
Have some meat.

1112
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Get rid of your bad luck.

1113
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,280
Bao.

1114
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,680
Don't just eat. Say something.

1115
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:19,161
You aren't going back to school.

1116
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,641
What are you going to do?

1117
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,480
Nothing.

1118
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,041
I will find a job.

1119
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:27,321
Bao,

1120
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,841
that's not like you at all.

1121
00:39:29,121 --> 00:39:29,801
Why?

1122
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,440
A few days behind bars is enough

1123
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,520
to scare you?

1124
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:33,760
In our line of work,

1125
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:35,321
that is a rite of passage.

1126
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:36,680
A coming of age.

1127
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:37,841
You

1128
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,280
should work with us.

1129
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:44,240
What's wrong with you?

1130
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,081
You want to die?

1131
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:47,601
You haven't learned your lesson?

1132
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,601
Do you know how I was arrested?

1133
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,361
The anti-fraud operation.
Ever heard of it?

1134
00:39:52,321 --> 00:39:53,240
Bao,

1135
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:55,121
that operation

1136
00:39:55,161 --> 00:39:57,161
ruined our livelihood.

1137
00:39:57,841 --> 00:39:58,561
But

1138
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,561
look

1139
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:01,161
at the silver lining.

1140
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:01,641
All right?

1141
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,680
Do you know

1142
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,440
how much we scammed

1143
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,280
during those few days
you were down under?

1144
00:40:06,881 --> 00:40:07,520
1,500 yuan.

1145
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,680
1,500.

1146
00:40:10,401 --> 00:40:10,881
Bao,

1147
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,720
how much does an undergrad earn?

1148
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:14,920
4,000? 5,000?

1149
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,641
Steal a few cards

1150
00:40:16,641 --> 00:40:18,041
and you get the same income.

1151
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,401
And so what if you are arrested?

1152
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:23,321
You will be released after two days.

1153
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:27,520
Come.

1154
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,920
A toast to Bao.

1155
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,000
To Bao.

1156
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:30,440
Bao.

1157
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:30,960
To Bao.

1158
00:40:31,641 --> 00:40:32,321
Come, Bao.

1159
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:33,641
Come.

1160
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,680
Sorry.

1161
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,881
It's not possible.

1162
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:39,440
Why not?

1163
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,041
The system says you're not eligible.

1164
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,161
You think you're

1165
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,401
the only branch here?
