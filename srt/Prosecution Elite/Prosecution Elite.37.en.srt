15
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:41,370
It's you again, Xiao Mu'en.

16
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,889
Is there no end to this?

17
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,209
You're not welcome in this house.

18
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,370
Get out!

19
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:47,690
Tiancheng.

20
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:49,690
That's no way to talk.

21
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,289
Chairman Xiao and I
will be having a private conversation.

22
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,090
Go upstairs.

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,289
Dad, what's there to talk about
with this guy?

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:57,410
Go upstairs!

25
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,690
Tiancheng is already an adult,

26
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,410
yet, you're still so protective of him.

27
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,929
It's enviable.

28
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,929
Cut the nonsense.

29
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:12,849
Come inside if you want.

30
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,849
Han Xuan, I asked you to look into

31
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,489
all of Xiao Mu'en's assets and finances
within the country.

32
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,250
How's that coming along?

33
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:40,810
(Don't even get me started, Ni.)

34
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:42,090
I've checked everywhere I could.

35
00:02:42,289 --> 00:02:43,890
I can't even find anything
on Xiao Mu'en himself,

36
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,370
much less his finances and assets.

37
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,489
That's impossible.

38
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:47,730
How can we not find this person?

39
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,330
He's about to be the head of the Huiquan Group.

40
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:52,929
But I can't find anything about him
in the domestic database.

41
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,489
Never mind. Hang up.

42
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,970
I'll ask someone else.

43
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,010
(Hey, An Ni. What's up?)

44
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,810
Yonggang, I have a question.

45
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:15,209
Is Mr. Xiao, Xiao Mu'en,

46
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,450
Chinese Fujianese?

47
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,450
What brought that up?

48
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,010
I'm just trying
to get a better understanding.

49
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,049
Tell me honestly.

50
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,970
Is Xiao Mu'en Chinese?

51
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,090
Does he have Chinese nationality?

52
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,289
He has yellow skin and black eyes.

53
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,689
Of course, he's Chinese.

54
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,409
(But I don't know if he is Fujianese.)

55
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,409
But to be precise,

56
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:38,409
(he is a citizen
of the South Pacific Island Country now.)

57
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,090
So that's why…

58
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,769
That's why he couldn't even understand
such simple Fujianese.

59
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,049
Why didn't you
tell me about this sooner?

60
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,129
Well, you didn't ask.

61
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,409
(This isn't a subject that we just get into.)

62
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,489
(Besides, there are many expatriates
getting into the Internet business.)

63
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,129
(This is nothing new.)

64
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:02,530
But Green Broadcasting,

65
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,129
including the current Huiquan Group,

66
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,209
isn't foreign-owned.

67
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,170
This shouldn't be the case.

68
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:07,610
Proxy shareholding.

69
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:09,170
Nowadays, it's all about proxy agreements.

70
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,250
Domestic companies are still Chinese-owned.

71
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:14,409
(It makes shareholding much simpler.)

72
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,210
Well, then, do you know

73
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,890
anything about his foreign nationality

74
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:24,610
and what name he goes by overseas?

75
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,369
He takes care of the proxy agreements himself.

76
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:32,010
But I did happen to hear this once.

77
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,849
I think they called him Alex.

78
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:39,689
Okay. Got it.

79
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,129
The most dangerous place

80
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,529
is the safest place.

81
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:54,969
No wonder he hid himself in Huiquan.

82
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,809
He was right under our noses.

83
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:04,490
Ni.

84
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:05,770
Han Xuan,

85
00:05:07,369 --> 00:05:10,450
is it possible for a person to change his name

86
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,089
and return to the country
with a whole new identity?

87
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,129
Of course.

88
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,050
I read a story a while back about a Chinese guy

89
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:18,529
who received foreign citizenship.

90
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,689
He posted the entire process online.

91
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,289
(When he got his foreign citizenship,)

92
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,289
(he changed his Chinese name,)

93
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,450
(so it's impossible to find his Chinese domicile)

94
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,730
(through the name on his passport,)

95
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,529
(much less renouncing his citizenship.)

96
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,770
Xiao Mu'en.

97
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,490
Chairman,

98
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:41,890
I brought you a bottle of 1986 Bordeaux wine.

99
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,330
How about it?

100
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,490
Want to open it and savour it?

101
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,289
1986 Bordeaux wine.

102
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:51,490
That's good stuff.

103
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,010
But I'm not in the mood
to drink with you today.

104
00:05:59,369 --> 00:06:00,050
Pity.

105
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:01,730
I prepared this especially for you.

106
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:04,050
You're too kind.

107
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:09,170
I heard the shareholders passed the motion.

108
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:12,969
A press conference will be held tonight

109
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,289
to announce your official taking over
of the Huiquan Group.

110
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,650
I didn't even prepare anything

111
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,969
to celebrate your promotion.

112
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,689
Yet, you brought a bottle of fine wine
to visit this fallen,

113
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,010
out-of-touch old man.

114
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,210
Well…

115
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,770
This won't do at all.

116
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:43,289
Being able to share with you
my greatest moment of glory

117
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,969
is the best gift I could ask for.

118
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:51,689
Xiao Mu'en,

119
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:56,610
it's only the two of us now.

120
00:06:57,689 --> 00:06:59,569
You, the wolf of Zhongshan,

121
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,210
can stop pretending.

122
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,809
Aren't you tired of it?

123
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,010
I'm tired of playing Mr. Dongguo.

124
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,890
You say that I'm the wolf of Zhongshan?

125
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:13,809
Yes.

126
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:19,170
You don't think that you gave me

127
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,210
everything I have today, do you?

128
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:22,650
Hmph.

129
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:27,689
Indeed.

130
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,129
For someone like you,
who had always had all the resources

131
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:32,529
and stood high on the ladder,

132
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,490
people like us,
who had to work hard

133
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,650
to climb the ladder and work our way up,

134
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,129
are all circus monkeys.

135
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:41,129
However, today, it seems

136
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,289
that the one that has fallen is you.

137
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,849
Oh?

138
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:45,089
Well?

139
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,050
How does it feel to be kicked down by the monkey

140
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:51,809
you looked down upon
from the altar that is Huiquan

141
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:53,050
that you built?

142
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,490
How does it feel to be back-stabbed

143
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,689
by someone you trust?

144
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:00,129
And how does it feel to fall from grace

145
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,930
and be deserted by everyone?

146
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,650
Young man,

147
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,529
don't get too carried away.

148
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:15,610
Haha!

149
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,490
You still have a long road ahead.

150
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,930
You may be at the peak today,

151
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,089
but who knows where you'll be tomorrow?

152
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,890
Hm?

153
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:36,450
You went through a lot of trouble

154
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:39,249
to climb to the top.

155
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,129
But I have to tell you

156
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,890
that it's something
that you were born with

157
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:48,530
and can never be rid of,

158
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,569
your vulgar and lowbrow nature.

159
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:52,129
(Mom,)

160
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:53,330
(I don't want to go to school anymore.)

161
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,330
(All of them bully me.)

162
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,129
(You freak!)

163
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:58,290
What is fake can never be real.

164
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,929
Chairman Xiao.

165
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,169
Hmph.

166
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,569
If you're here to see a beaten dog,

167
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:12,689
then you can leave now.

168
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,129
I've seen you gloat as a victor.

169
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,049
But I'm of no value to you now.

170
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,809
Even if you trample on me again,

171
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:27,569
I doubt that would
bring you much satisfaction.

172
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:30,290
It's just as you said.

173
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,890
We're the only ones here now.

174
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,530
No need to put on airs anymore.

175
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:38,290
You've already let me in.

176
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,850
Why don't we have a nice chat?

177
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:41,410
Hm?

178
00:09:43,689 --> 00:09:44,729
You can't blame me

179
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:48,609
for all your failures today.

180
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,929
It was your ego and stubbornness
that put you here.

181
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,770
All of the members of the board betrayed you

182
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:59,569
because they were disappointed in you.

183
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,929
Xiao Mu'en.

184
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,729
You're not welcome here.

185
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,850
I'm telling you this now.

186
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,650
Get out of my house.

187
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:12,129
Get out.

188
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,530
Chairman, calm down.

189
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:20,689
We haven't even had the wine yet.

190
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,049
This is Bordeaux wine from 1986.

191
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,729
I don't care about the wine.

192
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,410
I repeat once more. Get out.

193
00:10:30,689 --> 00:10:33,090
1986 Bordeaux wine.

194
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:38,249
Do you remember what happened in 1986?

195
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:42,890
What?

196
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,809
Zhou Ling.

197
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,049
You…

198
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,249
Yes.

199
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,169
Me.

200
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,169
Don't touch me!

201
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,369
Stay away from me.

202
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,290
If you get too close,

203
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,049
I might actually kill you.

204
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:40,890
It is you.

205
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,330
From the moment you joined the company,

206
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:52,689
I've always felt
that you looked familiar,

207
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,970
despite the fact
that we don't look alike.

208
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,090
But the way you act,

209
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:02,890
the way you carry yourself,

210
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,609
and the ruthlessness you hide

211
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:08,770
behind your modesty,

212
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,489
I knew it.

213
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,569
That's…

214
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:16,129
Shh.

215
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,369
Don't say it.

216
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,129
Don't say it out loud.

217
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,729
A heartless, treacherous animal like you

218
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:28,850
does not deserve children

219
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,770
and certainly not a son as excellent as me!

220
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,369
Han Xuan, get everyone
from the special task force here.

221
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:38,369
What's going on, Ni?

222
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,729
It's about Xiao Mu'en.

223
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,129
We need to launch
an investigation immediately.

224
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:42,049
Hold on.

225
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,410
I can get all of them
to help with the investigation.

226
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,650
But you need to let us know

227
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,010
what's going on and where to start.

228
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,609
From the day Zhang Wanru was killed.

229
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,809
Prosecutor Guo is still in his office, right?

230
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,929
I'll report this to him.

231
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:52,129
Get all our colleagues for me.

232
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:56,929
We have a job. Gather the team. Quickly.

233
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:00,090
Overtime.

234
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:02,609
Prosecutor Guo.

235
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:04,090
Prosecutor Guo.

236
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,569
I can explain how the one that slipped
through the net, Zhou Siyue

237
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,770
from Operation 7·23 vanished from Europe.

238
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:10,210
Zhou Siyue.

239
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,489
He entered Europe
under the name Zhou Siyue,

240
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,129
but left as Xiao Mu'en.

241
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,850
Zhou Siyue is Xiao Mu'en.

242
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,129
Xiao Mu'en is A.

243
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:19,489
All right.

244
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,609
I will report this
to the higher-ups at once

245
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,729
and work
with the Public Security Organs.

246
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,609
We must find out

247
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,569
the whereabouts of this
South Pacific Island Country citizen

248
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,090
during Operation 7·23.

249
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,169
Looks like there will be no rest

250
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:35,210
for the special task force tonight.

251
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,049
Yes.

252
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,330
I've already called

253
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:38,049
the members
of the special task force to come back.

254
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,169
- We'll be working on it together.
- Hurry.

255
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:47,689
So how is your mother, Zhou Ling, now?

256
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:52,090
What do you think?

257
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,330
Everything I say now will ring hollow.

258
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,090
Back then, my parents,

259
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,369
your grandparents,

260
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,689
forcefully decided my life.

261
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,650
There was nothing I could do.

262
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,809
Because if they found out

263
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,210
about what I did,

264
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,609
everything would be over for me!

265
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:22,450
So…

266
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:29,290
So I was very weak and selfish.

267
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:31,770
So…

268
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:38,809
I've been living with the guilt all this time.

269
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,609
That's enough.

270
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:41,609
Shut up.

271
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,249
I'm going to get sick
if I hear any more.

272
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,049
Do you know why I brought this bottle of wine?

273
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:55,609
1986.

274
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:56,530
Yes.

275
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,729
The year I was born.

276
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,530
What else?

277
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:04,729
I guess you don't remember.

278
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,850
You gave Zhou Ling the exact same bottle of wine.

279
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,249
That was also the only thing

280
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,609
you left her.

281
00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:22,450
You never managed to convince your parents.

282
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:23,369
Rather,

283
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,369
you never intended to do so.

284
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,850
All in all, that year,

285
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:32,809
Zhou Ling waited from autumn to winter,

286
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,729
from winter to autumn of the following year.

287
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,369
She waited countless autumns and winters.

288
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,330
But she never heard another word from you.

289
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:47,049
And you completely disappeared.

290
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,450
I told them.

291
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:53,249
But it was useless.

292
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,369
Your grandmother threatened to take her life.

293
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,770
Your grandfather fell ill.

294
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,489
What could I do?

295
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,049
The family needed me.

296
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,770
I had no choice but to follow the path

297
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,369
your grandparents decided for me

298
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,090
and marry the woman they wanted me to marry.

299
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,929
By doing that, I could get their money

300
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:21,169
and gain their trust.

301
00:16:21,729 --> 00:16:23,770
That's the only way
I could take charge of the family.

302
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,770
Listen here.

303
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,090
I have no grandparents.

304
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,010
Yin Huiquan,

305
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,929
you said

306
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,450
you married that woman
to save your family.

307
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,049
But did you know this?

308
00:16:38,049 --> 00:16:41,450
You destroyed two mothers and children
with your own hands.

309
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,220
(The Spring of 1986, Jilin)

310
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:48,210
Look at you. Such a useless thing.

311
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:49,450
It would've been better
if you had just died out there.

312
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,689
Why come back?

313
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:55,450
The family gained nothing
in the years you were away.

314
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:57,689
Why come back to disgust me?

315
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:00,369
Sheesh.

316
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:08,930
Look at what you've done.

317
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,329
The entire village knows

318
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,089
that the father of your child
is not in the picture.

319
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,650
Other people's daughters
marry off in style.

320
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:17,530
But you?

321
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,570
Would anyone still want you, huh?

322
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:32,770
Listen here.

323
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,930
There's no place here for you and that baby.

324
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:39,849
Get out of this house
the minute you can.

325
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,290
You're an embarrassment.

326
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,050
Hmph.

327
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,770
Good grief…

328
00:18:04,969 --> 00:18:07,410
You abandoned a woman
with an illegitimate child

329
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:10,249
in that day and age.

330
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,369
That means

331
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:14,329
either you wanted to leave her to die,

332
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,609
or you want me to die with her.

333
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:19,410
No, no, no!

334
00:18:19,449 --> 00:18:20,410
I never wanted that!

335
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,290
Don't be too quick to defend yourself.

336
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,209
I'm not finished yet.

337
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,449
Do you think that was all?

338
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:24,849
Huh?

339
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,969
To you, maybe.

340
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:28,410
But for me,

341
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,089
that was just the beginning of my hellish life.

342
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,770
(The summer of 1994, Guangdong)
Mom, I don't want to go to school anymore!

343
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:34,930
(The summer of 1994, Guangdong)

344
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,170
(The summer of 1994, Guangdong)
They all bully me

345
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,930
and make fun of my face!

346
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,410
Good boy.

347
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,010
Don't blame me.

348
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:51,290
This isn't my fault.

349
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:53,410
Blame…

350
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,369
Blame the fact
that you're Yin Huiquan's son.

351
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,930
He did this to me!

352
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,489
He did this to us!

353
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:03,249
It's his fault!

354
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:04,050
It's all his fault!

355
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,329
(Then,)

356
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:07,369
(she went mad.)

357
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,489
Plus, there was a major layoff at the factory.

358
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:13,050
A woman with no background like her

359
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,890
was obviously the first to be let go.

360
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,890
The landlord kicked us out.

361
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,810
I experienced anything imaginable at that time

362
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,969
and met all kinds of people.

363
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:33,930
Yin Huiquan, you claim

364
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,050
that you've been tortured
by your guilt all these years.

365
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,170
Let me ask you this, then.

366
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,329
What do you think it's like

367
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,410
to spend every day alive

368
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,729
in a living hell, hm?

369
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:55,770
So what happened to your mother?

370
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:04,609
She could never bring herself

371
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,890
to drink the wine you gave her.

372
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:08,770
When she missed you too much,

373
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:13,050
she would take it out and take a sip.

374
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,369
But it was bound to run out eventually.

375
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:18,810
(Mom!)

376
00:20:20,129 --> 00:20:20,729
Mom!

377
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,089
(Siyue,)

378
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,890
(by the time you read this,)

379
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:48,609
(I will be gone.)

380
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:49,969
(Yes,)

381
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,570
(forever.)

382
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,209
(I know)

383
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,489
(you won't grieve for me.)

384
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,089
(I don't deserve it.)

385
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:10,010
(I failed as a woman and as a mother.)

386
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:15,770
(Yin Huiquan turned me
into a disgusting lunatic.)

387
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,570
(But you are innocent.)

388
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:21,369
(I shouldn't take it out on you,)

389
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,810
(and I can't keep dragging you down.)

390
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,570
(For years,)

391
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:29,810
(I was an alcoholic)

392
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:34,930
(until it destroyed me
physically and mentally.)

393
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:37,969
(But there was one bottle of wine)

394
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,249
(I could never finish.)

395
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:44,810
(I only took sips of it every time)

396
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,969
(because that was
the last bottle of wine)

397
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,249
(Yin Huiquan left me.)

398
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,770
(Little by little,)

399
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,969
(I savoured its bitterness)

400
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,209
(for over ten years.)

401
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:03,570
(Now,)

402
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,129
(the wine is all gone.)

403
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,849
(And now,)

404
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,770
(I can leave peacefully.)

405
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:19,209
(There is nothing left for me in this world.)

406
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,410
(At the end of my life,)

407
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,770
(apart from my endless hatred
for that man,)

408
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,489
(I only want to say sorry to my child.)

409
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,129
(I know)

410
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:38,369
(you won't forgive me,)

411
00:22:38,969 --> 00:22:40,570
(and you can't forgive me,)

412
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:44,890
(but I'm sorry.)

413
00:22:51,729 --> 00:22:54,410
It was me who killed her…

414
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,290
Of course, it was you!

415
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,930
I never expected this to happen…

416
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,089
I wronged your mother and you…

417
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:07,690
Oh, save it.

418
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,129
Put your hypocrisy away.

419
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:11,650
I'm not buying it,

420
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,089
no matter how hard you try to sell it.

421
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:15,690
Yin Huiquan,

422
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,530
don't you think this is a good ending?

423
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,010
Hm?

424
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,729
In a way, this is salvation for you, her, and me.

425
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:24,650
I sent them to search for you guys

426
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:29,770
in the village in the Northeast
but to no avail.

427
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,010
I tried to find a chance
to redeem myself.

428
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,329
I wouldn't have minded
even if it cost my life…

429
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:41,369
But…

430
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:43,890
You stepped foot into my house.

431
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,810
So I won't run away anymore.

432
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,650
You can do whatever you want,

433
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,930
but please,

434
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:57,089
I beg of you, spare my child.

435
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,969
Don't hurt him.

436
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,570
No matter what, he is your brother.

437
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,410
No…

438
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,609
You only have one son.

439
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:07,930
I'm nothing.

440
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,129
To you,

441
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,170
I might be even less than a dog.

442
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,729
(Huiquan computer system company)
Baby.

443
00:24:14,729 --> 00:24:15,329
(Huiquan computer system company)

444
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,449
(Huiquan computer system company)
Daddy is coming.

445
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,810
Daddy. Isn't that right?

446
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,930
Baby.

447
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:23,890
You're here.

448
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,209
Take a look.

449
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:27,209
Did you miss me?

450
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,930
He missed you.

451
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:30,449
Hahaha…

452
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:31,050
Let's go.

453
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:31,570
Okay.

454
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,770
Mom made dinner today.

455
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:39,530
Sir.

456
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,010
Are you Yin Huiquan?

457
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:43,770
Who are you?

458
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:44,930
Get out of here.

459
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,650
Where did you come from?

460
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:47,050
Move.

461
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:48,489
Did you hear me?

462
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,290
That's enough.

463
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:57,650
Leave.

464
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,410
Get out of here.

465
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:09,890
After that, I learned a lesson.

466
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,089
I wanted to keep living.

467
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,930
The only one

468
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:16,930
I can trust in this world is me.

469
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:21,010
Don't worry.

470
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,209
I'm not here to have a father-and-son reunion.

471
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,729
I never wanted anything from you, Yin Huiquan.

472
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,570
Even when

473
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,489
Zhou Ling lost all sense of herself
after becoming an alcoholic,

474
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,729
when the two of us were ostracised and kicked out

475
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,690
and became homeless.

476
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,969
Even when I was alone,

477
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,890
with no home to return to,

478
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,650
and had to sleep
under the skyway every night,

479
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,609
shivering in the cold,

480
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,209
and getting up early the next day to compete

481
00:25:52,449 --> 00:25:53,650
for a job that would include two meals

482
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,930
with the other menial workers,

483
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:02,449
I never wanted anything from you, Yin Huiquan.

484
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:09,890
Because I can get what I want myself.

485
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,810
Don't get the wrong idea.

486
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,209
Don't think I did all of this

487
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:20,369
just to take Huiquan Group from you.

488
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:25,010
I can tell you

489
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,770
that I have a great plan.

490
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:32,650
I need a large Internet company as a cover.

491
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:35,129
I only chose Huiquan Group

492
00:26:35,729 --> 00:26:37,729
because it made sense to do so.

493
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,849
Why not use this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

494
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,729
to take revenge on my mother's murderer?

495
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:49,329
So what do you want?

496
00:26:50,729 --> 00:26:51,810
Money, of course.

497
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:52,810
What else?

498
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,849
I, too, want to live in a big castle,

499
00:26:58,449 --> 00:26:59,570
and own luxury cars, mansions,

500
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,410
yachts, and private jets.

501
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,530
I want everything that you have

502
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,810
and everything that you don't.

503
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:10,410
I've been preparing

504
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,849
for 20 years for this moment.

505
00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:18,690
Zhou Siyue.

506
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:21,489
Is this you?

507
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:23,729
Yes.

508
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:26,410
All right.

509
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:27,410
You're hired.

510
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:28,650
Stick with me from now on.

511
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,369
Did you see my resume?

512
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,290
I don't know anything.

513
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,849
Are you sure you want me?

514
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,369
I just need a person for this job.

515
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:43,890
Here I have a telephone line and a computer.

516
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:44,489
See?

517
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,329
Then, I get someone to sit here,

518
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,089
and the money will come rolling in.

519
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,530
You're a fraud.

520
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,089
Listen.

521
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,369
This will be the most powerful thing
in the future.

522
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,570
In the future,
everyone will own a computer.

523
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,849
When that happens,
we'll type away on the keyboard,

524
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,089
and they'll send us the money.

525
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,690
We're using our brains.

526
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,410
What do you call this?

527
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,609
High-tech.

528
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,530
So you've been making money

529
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:14,609
with that high technology.

530
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,449
Money is good.

531
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,690
You can do anything with it.

532
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:23,290
I did three things with my first bucket of gold.

533
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:25,969
I got plastic surgery,

534
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,369
bought a fake nationality,

535
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:30,489
and I went to study.

536
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,369
My qualifications are the real deal.

537
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,810
I spent ten years studying.

538
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:38,609
First, I got a Bachelor's degree
in Computer Science,

539
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:42,530
then a Master's degree
in Information Security,

540
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,530
and finally a PhD in Statistics.

541
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:48,930
The entire upstream and downstream chain,
logic, and data algorithms.

542
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,249
All of this is in my brain.

543
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,810
Then, I began my plan.

544
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,729
So what have you done?

545
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:14,449
You'll find out soon.

546
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,570
Ever heard of Operation 7·23?

547
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,369
You…

548
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,930
You have to protect A.

549
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,690
You have to know

550
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,329
that if something happens to us,

551
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,890
he is our hope.

552
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,449
You have to trust A.

553
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:45,729
I don't trust him,

554
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:48,849
but I trust you.

555
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:05,249
You're here.

556
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,170
I can see he's very loyal to you.

557
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,170
Just like I am to you.

558
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:17,329
By the way,

559
00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:19,410
are you sure you don't want to meet him?

560
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:24,010
He's a very reliable and trustworthy man.

561
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:26,249
He's got a ruthless streak in him.

562
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,489
He'll be useful in the future.

563
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:32,249
It's better not to meet him yet.

564
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,050
I have other plans for him.

565
00:30:35,729 --> 00:30:38,489
Aunt Xin, I know you think highly of him.

566
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:40,930
But

567
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,530
having the courage to fight
and cut someone down

568
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,010
only proves he has brawns.

569
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,650
A man's ruthlessness

570
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:51,089
depends on his ability to do

571
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,489
the same thing consistently,

572
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:56,129
to do it well, and to learn from it.

573
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,810
You need to teach him more
in the future.

574
00:30:59,089 --> 00:30:59,650
I understand.

575
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:01,930
I'll have him do it.

576
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,849
Do you know why I gave you

577
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,930
such an important task?

578
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:12,810
Because I'm the person you trust most.

579
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:14,010
Yes.

580
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,050
You're the only one I trust.

581
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,410
My plan is to establish strongholds

582
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,170
in every corner of the world.

583
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,369
I'm going to start
from all over the world.

584
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:31,890
It's like putting eggs

585
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:32,930
in different baskets.

586
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,690
No matter which one goes wrong,

587
00:31:35,089 --> 00:31:37,890
the other will not be affected by it.

588
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,810
I'll leave you in charge

589
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,129
of the three
most important strong-points.

590
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:46,010
As for me,

591
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,570
I'll supervise from a distance.

592
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,449
Supervise from a distance?

593
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:49,849
Yes.

594
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,609
Are you staying in the country?

595
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:54,930
Yes.

596
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:56,650
I'm going back to start a business.

597
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,609
I've even thought
of the name for the new company.

598
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,010
Green Broadcasting.

599
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:01,890
What do you think?

600
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,010
Doesn't it sound healthy?

601
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:07,770
You planned this all along.

602
00:32:09,129 --> 00:32:10,930
From the minute
you founded Green Broadcasting,

603
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,410
you've had your eye on getting Huiquan Group

604
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,329
to take your poison

605
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,209
so that you can corrupt us
from the inside out

606
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,170
and turn us into your puppets and tools.

607
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:28,849
How vicious and despicable your intention is.

608
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:31,890
You say that
as if you had no hand in this.

609
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:34,290
Don't forget

610
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,770
you appointed Zhao Jikai yourself.

611
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,249
Over the years,

612
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:41,089
he has been helping me

613
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,129
to collect and filter user information,

614
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,650
allowing me to target everyone

615
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:49,570
I want to find with such accuracy.

616
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,410
Do you think you can get away with it?

617
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:03,729
Do you think you can escape the law?

618
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,129
Let me tell you something.

619
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,449
You will lose this game.

620
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,050
I will not.

621
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:16,329
You already have everything you want.

622
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,449
Why are you still here?

623
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:24,650
Do you want me to send you to prison myself?

624
00:33:26,249 --> 00:33:26,930
Prison?

625
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:27,570
Yes.

626
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:33,810
Have I not been in one my entire life?

627
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:36,729
The only difference is that

628
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:38,369
after tomorrow,

629
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:41,930
everyone will remember Xiao Mu'en,

630
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,570
and you, Yin Huiquan,

631
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,530
will rot in the past along

632
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,449
with Zhou Ling and Zhou Siyue.

633
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:52,050
Xiao Mu'en!

634
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:54,890
You brat!

635
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,010
Be grateful, Yin Huiquan.

636
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,570
Originally, I had planned

637
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,770
for you to join Zhou Ling
on the other side.

638
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:06,489
Sure.

639
00:34:08,169 --> 00:34:11,570
Now, just stay here in your castle

640
00:34:11,729 --> 00:34:13,729
and keep your eyes wide

641
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:17,530
and watch everything
you've fought for your entire life

642
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,290
be used by me.

643
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:20,530
Oh, right.

644
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,330
The Anti-Monopoly Bureau

645
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,209
and Municipal Administration
for Market Regulation

646
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,330
will be here to investigate Huiquan soon.

647
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:29,449
This is also the seed
I have carefully planted for you.

648
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:32,290
It's time to reap the harvest now.

649
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,649
Farewell, dear Chairman Yin Huiquan.

650
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:41,810
Stop.

651
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,489
Did you come all this way
to tell me all of that

652
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,330
just to satisfy your desire for revenge?

653
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,929
Aren't you afraid that I'll expose you

654
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,570
to the Procuratorate the moment you leave?

655
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:01,649
No.

656
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:05,169
Report me to the Procuratorate

657
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:07,649
or the Public Security Organs

658
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,489
if you want.

659
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:11,409
From the moment I dared to step inside
to tell you all of this,

660
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,570
I've been prepared to lose everything.

661
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:30,929
Sir.

662
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:31,649
He's out.

663
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,449
Captain He,

664
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,370
Xiao Mu'en has exited
Yin Huiquan's mansion.

665
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,370
(Copy.)

666
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:17,290
Dad.

667
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,130
Dad.

668
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,409
Dad!

669
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:25,929
What's wrong?

670
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:30,130
What did Xiao Mu'en say when he was here?

671
00:36:35,249 --> 00:36:36,209
Nothing.

672
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,209
I heard everything.

673
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,570
You did?

674
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:48,649
He said something about reporting him.

675
00:36:48,649 --> 00:36:49,649
What's that all about?

676
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:52,249
What's your relationship with him?

677
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,969
If you still consider me your son,

678
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,889
then tell me the truth about everything.

679
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:06,810
Ni, we found it.

680
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:08,850
We found Alex's full itinerary from two years ago.

681
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:10,130
Look.

682
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,570
It's exactly what we thought.

683
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:16,850
Xiao Mu'en did fly back to China
from abroad two years ago.

684
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,649
(Zhou Siyue)
And the time of Zhou Siyue's disappearance

685
00:37:18,649 --> 00:37:19,649
(Zhou Siyue)
and Xiao Mu'en's appearance

686
00:37:19,649 --> 00:37:20,850
matches up in time and place.

687
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:21,850
Zhou Siyue is Xiao Mu'en.

688
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:23,489
Xiao Mu'en is Zhou Siyue. It's a fact.

689
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,489
But this departure record alone
is not enough, is it?

690
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,290
Of course not.

691
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:31,570
Listen.

692
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,130
I found new information.

693
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,889
Han Xuan looked into

694
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:37,489
Xiao Mu'en's whereabouts
from two years ago.

695
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,889
I just found out

696
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,929
Xiao Mu'en's whereabouts
from a year ago.

697
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,010
Do you still remember?

698
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,249
When you guys
had an operation in Country F,

699
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,370
Xiao Mu'en secretly made a trip
back to Country F.

700
00:37:48,249 --> 00:37:49,770
We all know that.

701
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,570
Director Wang, have you been so busy
that you're confused?

702
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,130
I'm not finished.

703
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:53,850
An Ni.

704
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,050
Do you remember when Xiao Mu'en

705
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,649
came back from Country F?

706
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:01,689
I don't remember the exact date,

707
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:03,489
but it must've been late
in the evening that day.

708
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,889
He Luyuan sent him through the gate.

709
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:05,770
Yes.

710
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:07,570
And?

711
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,010
You don't know what happened
after that, do you?

712
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,570
Listen, after he went inside the gate,

713
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,130
he was supposed to be on the last flight
back to the country.

714
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:18,090
There was a long time in between,

715
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,010
and who did he meet during that time?

716
00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:22,689
I bet it's Qian Tianxin.

717
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,010
But Director Wang,

718
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:28,290
even if we can prove
that he went to see Qian Tianxin,

719
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:30,130
it can't prove he is Zhou Siyue.

720
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:35,370
He Luyuan, go ahead.

721
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:38,130
Lawyer Wu
gave me a piece of information.

722
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,050
(When he tried to get his legal fees from Gomez,)

723
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,010
(Gomez told him that someone else
would wire him the money.)

724
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,169
(We contacted Country F's police)

725
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,969
(to investigate that transaction.)

726
00:38:50,409 --> 00:38:51,770
(The one who wired him the money)

727
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,449
(was your Alex guy, Xiao Mu'en.)

728
00:38:56,929 --> 00:38:57,729
Xiao Mu'en.

729
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,090
(Looks like Mr. Xiao)

730
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:02,090
(won't be able to explain
his way out of this.)

731
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:02,530
Okay.

732
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:04,090
Got it. I'll call you back.

733
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,209
Hang on.

734
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,249
Don't celebrate yet.

735
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,050
Even if we want to arrest Mu Xiao'en,

736
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:13,770
we still lack a key piece of evidence

737
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:16,090
that proves he is Zhou Siyue.

738
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,649
Here they are.

739
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,130
With the assistance
of foreign judicial authorities,

740
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:20,969
this is the new information we received.

741
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,010
This is the plastic surgery

742
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,689
Xiao Mu'en underwent
after leaving the country.

743
00:39:24,689 --> 00:39:26,010
It was at a private hospital.

744
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:27,610
So he registered

745
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,729
under his identity as Zhou Siyue?

746
00:39:30,689 --> 00:39:31,850
Of course not.

747
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:34,209
He must have registered
under a false identity.

748
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:35,969
But he overlooked one thing.

749
00:39:35,969 --> 00:39:37,810
All hospitals and medical facilities

750
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,489
must keep patient records.

751
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:41,209
He missed that.

752
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,370
So Xiao Mu'en is Zhou Siyue.

753
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:55,249
Heaven's vengeance is slow but sure.

754
00:39:55,649 --> 00:39:56,610
This time,

755
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,729
there's no escape for him.

756
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:00,929
Tiancheng,

757
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:06,449
I used to be very hard on you.

758
00:40:06,889 --> 00:40:08,090
I wanted you

759
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:10,489
to be the child I wanted you to be.

760
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,249
But the tougher I was,

761
00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:15,290
the more rebellious you became.

762
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:17,729
Now that I think about it,

763
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:21,409
I was wrong.

764
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:25,689
I am a bad father.

765
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,610
But I dare tell everyone

766
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:31,810
that I care very much about my son.

767
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,290
Like you and me right now,

768
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,449
sitting here face to face.

769
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,290
How many times have we done this?

770
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,370
We spend the whole afternoon and evening

771
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,649
talking to each other.

772
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:47,649
I use my decades of experience

773
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,850
to guide you and caution you

774
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,969
in the hopes
that you will take fewer wrong turns

775
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:57,810
and become successful sooner.

776
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:00,810
Frankly,

777
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,449
every time I talk to you,

778
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:06,169
I have to prepare in advance.

779
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,729
It's way more trouble than any board meeting

780
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:12,209
I've ever had.

781
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:15,130
I've told you so much,

782
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:20,090
but there's one thing I've never said to you.

783
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,409
Tiancheng,

784
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,169
you are a good child.

785
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:46,169
I love you very much.

786
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,370
(This isn't my fault.)

787
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:11,489
(Blame the fact
that you're Yin Huiquan's son.)

788
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:11,969
(Why did he)

789
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,850
(leave me with a burden like you?)

790
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,169
(Freak!)

791
00:42:15,169 --> 00:42:15,929
(Get out!)

792
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,969
(Both of you ruined my life!)

793
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:19,810
(You ruined everything!)

794
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,810
(Do you know that?)
