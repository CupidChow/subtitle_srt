(Country A, Barcelona)

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:57,960
Hello.

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,520
Hi.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,280
What would you like to order?

19
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,600
Coffee, please.

20
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,441
Okay.

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,081
It's already passed the appointed time.

22
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,361
Did something happen to Agent Cuckoo?

23
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
I've contacted Jinyang.

24
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,081
He did everything he could.

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,881
Maybe we underestimated the situation.

26
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:20,680
I suggest going back immediately

27
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,280
to confirm with the headquarters.

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,321
Give it another five minutes.

29
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:26,200
Another five minutes.

30
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,120
(I know her very well.)

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,760
(She'll definitely deliver the evidence.)

32
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,721
She's here.

33
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:03,200
I spot her.

34
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,760
(Someone's tailing her.)

35
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:35,601
Sorry. I'm sorry.

36
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,521
What the heck?

37
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:37,961
Are you blind?

39
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,540
- Sorry.
- Oh heck, man.

40
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,280
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:42,120
Are you blind?

00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,200

Prosecutor Guo.

(An Ni)

48
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,041
(Prosecutor, Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)
Chief Bai, you're here too.

49
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:54,761
Good day, Chief Bai.

50
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,800
It's been a while.

51
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:56,441
Indeed.

52
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,201
(Guo Hongjiang, Prosecutor-General,)
She's always this highly driven

53
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)
and more impatient than I am.

54
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,400
(Bai Zhaoxi, Bureau Chief)
I have one word

55
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,881
(Bai Zhaoxi, Bureau Chief
of Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau)

56
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:03,360
(of Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau)
to describe our city's top ten,

57
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:05,280
"Impressive."

58
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,120
Thank you for the compliment, Sir.

59
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:07,601
An Ni,

60
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:08,921
I asked to see you

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,800
because

62
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,240
we have one important mission
to assign to you.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,481
Sir, please tell.

64
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,601
Have a seat first.

65
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,161
Sit.

66
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,240
Sir, please sit with us.

67
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,680
Okay.

68
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:20,120
Chief Bai and the bureau

69
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
are...

70
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,921
Sit down.

71
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:24,680
The Municipal Public Security Bureau
transferred

72
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:25,601
a case

73
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,080
regarding online fraud to us
for review and prosecution

74
00:05:28,201 --> 00:05:29,360
before this.

75
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,560
Behind it,

76
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,080
there's a large-scale
telecom fraud syndicate.

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,201
And it's different

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,321
from the syndicates

79
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,921
we had previously investigated.

80
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,201
The organizational structure
of this syndicate

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
is highly secretive,

82
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,800
with independent control
in different regions.

83
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:45,280
It's completely
through a single line of command.

84
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:46,800
In other words,

85
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,881
there's minimal interaction

86
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:49,520
between different departments
in their organization.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
Their target population

88
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:53,161
is the vast majority of people

89
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
in the southeastern
and southwestern regions.

90
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,441
I think

91
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,161
in just over a year,

92
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,481
this syndicate has caused
over 500 million yuan

93
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:03,120
of economic losses.

94
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,360
Losses of over 500 million yuan?

95
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:07,321
That means

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,721
this is the most serious case
we have dealt with

97
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,240
among all the telecom fraud cases.

98
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,960
Precisely.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,840
This criminal syndicate

100
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,001
is very cunning.

101
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,680
And their internal structure

102
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,481
is tightly knit.

103
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,400
Also, most of their criminal operations

104
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,001
are based in Europe.

105
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,001
So it's causing us a lot of
unexpected difficulties in our work

106
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:29,360
of gathering evidence
and conducting investigations.

107
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,280
In fact,

108
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,201
after we discovered this lead,

109
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,601
the provincial authorities
took it very seriously

110
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
and reported it to the Public Security
and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

111
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,441
Special instructions were given

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,161
where

113
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,881
Jiangcheng City Bureau,
together with the local procuratorate,

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,721
formed a task force

115
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,080
called "Operation 7·23".

116
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,321
Bai and I were appointed

117
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,441
as the lead investigators
from our respective departments.

118
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:50,881
Six months ago,

119
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,120
our bureau carried out a meticulous
and thorough deployment.

120
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:56,280
We successfully infiltrated
one of our colleagues

121
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,761
from the Criminal Investigation Department

122
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:00,161
into their organization.

123
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
(The undercover agent
has now gained their trust.)

124
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,321
(Starting from a low-level
telephone operator,)

125
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,960
(our colleague has gradually penetrated)

126
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,520
(into the higher ranks
of the syndicate.)

127
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,321
(As a result,)

128
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:10,161
(she has acquired
a substantial amount of evidence.)

129
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
(This evidence)

130
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,680
(is stored in a miniature USB drive)

131
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:14,921
(hidden on her person.)

132
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,761
(But the data volume
is extremely large)

133
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
(and it would take a long time)

134
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:20,800
(to transmit it)

135
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,120
(through our encrypted network.)

136
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:23,441
(She has been unable)

137
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:25,161
(to find a suitable opportunity
until now.)

138
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:26,921
(That's why we need)

139
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,120
(to send someone)

140
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,321
(to meet her in person)

141
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,641
(and retrieve this evidence.)

142
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:33,761
(The International Cooperation Bureau
of the Supreme People's Procuratorate)

143
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,161
(communicated
with the judicial authorities)

144
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:36,761
(and police in Country A.)

145
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,881
(Only when we obtain this evidence)

146
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:41,641
(can we uproot)

147
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,080
(this large-scale transnational
criminal syndicate.)

148
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,601
I see.

149
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:45,960
As an undercover agent,

150
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,481
the transfer of information
can be extremely challenging.

151
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:50,721
Sirs, do you have any instructions?

152
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,041
Chief Bai, you're up.

153
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,601
At first,

154
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,641
we considered

155
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,721
several candidates for this mission.

156
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,120
After careful consideration,

157
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:02,800
everyone believes

158
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:03,800
that you possess

159
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:05,921
several distinct advantages over others.

160
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:07,161
For instance,

161
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,321
our undercover

162
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,520
has a deep personal connection with you.

163
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,041
Additionally,

164
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,161
you had an in-depth exchange experience

165
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,201
in Barcelona

166
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,761
when you were an undergraduate,

167
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:18,201
making you more familiar
with the situation there

168
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
compared to others.

169
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,441
Also,

170
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,240
we cannot be certain

171
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:27,041
whether they have conducted

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,041
thorough counter-surveillance

173
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,400
against our colleagues

174
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,401
during the prolonged struggle.

175
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,040
So,

176
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,401
to ensure the success of the mission,

177
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,560
and also consider

178
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,761
the safety of our undercover colleague

179
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,001
and yourself,

180
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:43,401
we've decided

181
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,201
to send a new face, which is you.

182
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,240
Our sole objective

183
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,800
is to take them down by surprise.

184
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:05,881
Quan.

185
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,240
I want you

186
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:12,841
to tell everyone

187
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,401
to stop their task at hand now

188
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:15,961
and gather in the meeting room

189
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,600
in 20 minutes.

190
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,761
Quan,

191
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,641
did anything happen?
Why are you so anxious?

192
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:24,560
The higher-ups

193
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:26,720
want everything discreet.

194
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:28,441
From now on,

195
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:30,240
no one is allowed to leave the premise.

196
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,281
This is between us, understand?

197
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,201
Don't worry.

198
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,040
Also,

199
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,281
after everyone has gathered,

200
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,120
take Wang Defa

201
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,240
and thoroughly search

202
00:09:45,521 --> 00:09:46,321
every person's computer and room.

203
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Don't

204
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,761
let anything suspicious slip through.

205
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,640
(Vice Captain Peng Ye,
Criminal Investigation Division)

206
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,961
Are you from home?

207
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:19,961
I'm Jinyang,

208
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,600
Zhongjiang Province's liaison officer
stationed in Country A.

209
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,040
Hello, I'm Xuelian.

210
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,201
Prosecutor Guo mentioned you to me.

211
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,001
Nice meeting you.

212
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,920
We'll be counting on you
for this operation.

213
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,521
This is my colleague, Shancha.

214
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:29,360
Hello.

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,401
Hello, I'm Shancha.

216
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,441
We apologize
for the inconvenience caused.

217
00:10:31,521 --> 00:10:32,720
We're in the same boat
so no need to feel bad.

218
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,881
Prosecutor Guo specifically told me

219
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,040
the importance of your mission

220
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:36,480
and to take care of security measures.

221
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,920
Let's go. We'll discuss this as we walk.

222
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,680
Okay.

223
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,680
First,

224
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,081
we need to greet them.

225
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,961
We must greet them with a grateful heart

226
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,961
and sincerity.

227
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:51,720
"Hello,

228
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,720
you must be Mr. Zhang.

229
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,720
I

230
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,680
am Wang.

231
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:57,560
As part of our company's
anniversary celebration,

232
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,040
we'd like to mail you
our member's magazine for free.

233
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,761
Shall we send it
to the address you registered?

234
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:03,401
Would that be okay?"

235
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,281
Sir,

236
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:05,841
what do we do

237
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,321
if he says he's not Mr. Zhang

238
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:08,680
when we ask if he's Mr. Zhang

239
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:10,360
during the first step?

240
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:14,600
Are you here to cause trouble?

241
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Are you looking for trouble here?

242
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,040
Can't you adapt on the spot?

243
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
Are you the one deceiving others,

244
00:11:20,761 --> 00:11:21,961
or are others deceiving you?

245
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:24,321
Can you learn to do it?

246
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,521
Tell me, can you master it?

247
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,641
If you can't do it,

248
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:30,800
I'll throw you into the sea
to feed the fish.

249
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:34,281
Who permitted you
to throw people into the sea?

250
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:35,841
Ms. Tina, you're here.

251
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,001
Are you the one throwing
or am I throwing?

252
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,961
Ms. Tina,

253
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,961
I... I was just too anxious.

254
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,040
These guys are too slow.

255
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,800
It's been a week

256
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,961
and they're still not familiar
with the basic script and dialogue.

257
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:49,081
How can they start working like this?

258
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,201
That's your problem.

259
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,920
I brought you here
to teach them the dialogue,

260
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,720
not a thug.

261
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,240
We'll test them in two days.
If they still fail to deliver,

262
00:11:58,321 --> 00:11:59,800
I'll find someone else to teach them.

263
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,401
Then

264
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,641
I can't guarantee

265
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,360
you won't be thrown into the sea.

266
00:12:14,521 --> 00:12:15,920
Don't just sit there!

267
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,720
Turn to the first page

268
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,841
of the dialogue manual!

269
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,350
(Sir, we've arrived at the hotel.
Everything is going smoothly,)

270
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,001
As I mentioned earlier,

271
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,800
he's suspected of intentional homicide
through negligence,

272
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:16,881
which refers

273
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:18,881
to a situation where someone,

274
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,160
who can easily fulfill their duty,

275
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,120
chooses not to rescue
a person in critical condition.

276
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:23,081
For example,

277
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,600
when he's patrolling the streets,

278
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:27,201
he witnesses someone severely injured
after being hit by a car.

279
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:28,961
Meanwhile, the public chooses not to help,

280
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:31,040
it can be considered unethical
for an ordinary citizen.

281
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,641
However, the "Black Cat Sheriff"

282
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,600
has a special duty to assist.

283
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,680
If he lets the victim bleed to death
without taking any action,

284
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,201
it constitutes a crime.

285
00:13:41,401 --> 00:13:42,841
Okay, that's all for today.

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
That is all

287
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,961
about "Black Cat Sheriff" today.

288
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,281
Your senior has something to attend to
in the afternoon.

289
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:51,841
Let us give her applause
to show our appreciation.

290
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:56,680
What is it that you wanted
to ask just now?

291
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,800
Wanru,

292
00:13:57,881 --> 00:13:58,600
I'd like to know

293
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:00,441
where did you buy your hair accessory.

294
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:01,480
It's so pretty.

295
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,920
Next time we meet,

296
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,680
I'll give you one as a gift.

297
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:05,800
Thank you, Wanru.

298
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,761
(Wanru,)

299
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,001
(is everything going smoothly
on your end?)

300
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:15,560
We only have an hour.

301
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,720
So search every room thoroughly.

302
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,680
Do you hear me?

303
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:19,920
Yeah, I know.

304
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:32,841
Search every corner.

305
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:42,120
During Wanru's last contact
with her family,

306
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:43,600
they arranged

307
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,040
to meet on August 24th, at 3 p.m. here,

308
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:46,401
which is tomorrow.

309
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,001
When was the last contact?

310
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,521
About nine days ago.

311
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:52,560
I wonder how things are going

312
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,841
on her side these days.

313
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,001
Could there have been any changes?

314
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,641
I've talked to Chief Bai.

315
00:14:57,641 --> 00:14:59,600
We'll wait for her here
for half an hour.

316
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
If she doesn't show up

317
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,600
within that time,

318
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,201
it means she's in trouble.

319
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,360
We may need to take the initiative

320
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:07,081
to save her when necessary.

321
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,720
Tina,

322
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:11,401
you've worked hard these past few days.

323
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:14,521
But we still need to keep it up.

324
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,521
We must get

325
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,521
the new batch of operators on duty

326
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,521
the day after tomorrow.

327
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,081
You see.

328
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,961
Our base in Huadu has been exposed.

329
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,961
The higher-ups instructed us

330
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,401
to transfer people from our side

331
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,201
to rebuild the network in Huadu.

332
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,040
All right.

333
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,081
I know what to do.

334
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:35,720
I checked on them just now.

335
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:36,961
They're almost ready.

336
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:38,560
Quan,

337
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,441
I remember the person in charge in Huadu

338
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,881
is Zhou, right?

339
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:45,240
How did the place got exposed
for no reason?

340
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:50,441
Could there be a mule in Huadu?

341
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:53,120
Well, I don't know about that.

342
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:55,641
I'm good as long as we don't have one.

343
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,120
Xuelian,

344
00:15:58,441 --> 00:15:59,441
I don't get it.

345
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:01,081
If Zhang Wanru

346
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,040
can pass the evidence,

347
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,360
why

348
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:05,240
doesn't she leave
with the evidence right away?

349
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,321
If she leaves with the evidence,

350
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:09,920
they will surely relocate
the criminal hideout

351
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,160
and all our efforts

352
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:12,120
will be in vain.

353
00:16:13,441 --> 00:16:13,920
I get it now.

354
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,240
Everything should be done discreetly.

355
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,240
I have strengthened

356
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,800
the monitoring and settings

357
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:21,240
for the external Ethernet

358
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:23,761
and internal LAN during working hours.

359
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,841
Everyone's issued phones

360
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,441
will be collected immediately
after work.

361
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,040
Is it that serious?

362
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,201
In all my time here,

363
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:34,201
it's the first time
I've encountered such a situation.

364
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:36,800
Unprecedented times

365
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:38,401
call for unprecedented measures.

366
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,201
That's all.

367
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,401
You can get back to work.

368
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,001
Okay,

369
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,600
by the way, Quan.

370
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,081
As usual,

371
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:46,160
it's my turn to keep an eye
on Chen and the guys

372
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,001
to purchase provisions
for the next half month tomorrow.

373
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,600
Should I go as usual?

374
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,480
Yes, go as usual.

375
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:58,521
We can't let people go hungry.

376
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,001
I remember you like preserved olives.

377
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,401
I'll buy some extra for you tomorrow.

378
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,961
Okay.

379
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,960
Tina,

380
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,200
I remember you mentioned

381
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,401
that you used to work

382
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,801
in the medical equipment industry
in China, right?

383
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,761
To put it bluntly,

384
00:17:18,001 --> 00:17:19,240
it was selling medicine and equipment

385
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,480
to major hospitals,

386
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:22,120
similar to real estate agents.

387
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,600
Have you always been in Shanghai?

388
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,641
After struggling for two years
as a migrant worker in Beijing,

389
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,840
I worked in Shanghai
for another two years.

390
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:33,200
So here I am after that.

391
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:35,960
Is there anything you need me to do?

392
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,281
Nothing much.

393
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,521
Just a casual question.

394
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,681
Mainly, I have a relative in Shanghai

395
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,480
who often gets sick.

396
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:45,161
Since my relative is not well,

397
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,440
I may need to trouble you in the future

398
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:47,681
to help me find a good hospital.

399
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:48,360
Of course.

400
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,320
You can ask me anytime
if you need any help.

401
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:51,480
I'll leave you to your matters then.

402
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:52,561
I won't be in your way anymore.

403
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,120
Xuelian,

404
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:03,480
you'll be waiting for Wanru here.

405
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
I'll be on standby near the coffeehouse
across the street,

406
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:07,881
maintaining a distance of 10 meters
from you at all times.

407
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,360
I've instructed Jinyang

408
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,041
to park the car not too far from you.

409
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:12,120
He'll stay in the car.

410
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,360
As soon as you retrieve the item,

411
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,921
we'll get in the car
and leave immediately.

412
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:16,360
All right.

413
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,521
You're the expert in this field
so I'll follow your lead.

414
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,281
By the way,

415
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,840
things in Country A
were never really peaceful.

416
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:25,401
Chief Bai said this syndicate

417
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,080
has been operating here
for several years.

418
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,240
I suspect

419
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,801
they have some connections

420
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:31,801
with the local gangs.

421
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:33,761
They might even pay a call
to local powerful figures.

422
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,240
We need to be prepared for the worst.

423
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:37,960
Yes,

424
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:39,281
you're right.

425
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:41,440
Over the years, these overseas telecom

426
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,720
and online fraud syndicates

427
00:18:42,881 --> 00:18:44,720
had a wide range of criminal methods,

428
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,840
especially when they have ties
with gangs.

429
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,401
They're capable of doing anything.

430
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,561
The more I say this,
the more nervous I get.

431
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,761
I hope everything goes smoothly

432
00:18:51,801 --> 00:18:52,921
for Wanru tomorrow.

433
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:14,720
Okay.

434
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,840
You can tell me now.

435
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:17,360
Yes.

436
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,041
I called for a meeting

437
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,681
and leaked some information.

438
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,120
Judging their reactions,

439
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:24,681
everything seems normal.

440
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,480
Tomorrow,

441
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,561
I'll make a sudden announcement
for a lockdown,

442
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,279
where no one is allowed to leave.

443
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,270
(BOSS)

444
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,840
We'll see

445
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,281
who can't stand staying in for one day

446
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:39,401
and insists on going out.

447
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,720
This person must be suspicious.

448
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,480
Don't worry.

449
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,960
Even if they know

450
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,480
it's a plot I'm setting up

451
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,921
and still go for it.

452
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,641
That's definitely something wrong.

453
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,240
But

454
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:54,881
I can't be certain

455
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,320
which one of those two is it yet.

456
00:20:21,681 --> 00:20:22,600
(The agreed time)

457
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,161
(is tomorrow afternoon
at three o'clock.)

458
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
(Who will be the one
to make contact with?)

459
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,881
(The situation
has drastically changed here.)

460
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,881
(Do the people from Home
who are now here know)

461
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,360
(about Li Quan's alertness
and sudden arrangements?)

462
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,041
(I don't have time
to think about that now.)

463
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,720
(I must proceed
with the regular rendezvous.)

464
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,320
(If everything goes smoothly,)

465
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:42,440
(people from Home)

466
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,600
(should be able
to raid this hideout quickly.)

467
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,200
(After tomorrow,)

468
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:48,360
(everything will be close to the end.)

469
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,001
(They probably don't know)

470
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,080
(I was the one)

471
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,080
(who tipped the authorities off
regarding Huadu.)

472
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,600
(After all, I'm in Country A)

473
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:56,921
(and I've never actively)

474
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,281
(contacted anyone from Huadu.)

475
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:00,720
(I simply provided some information
and the address)

476
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,801
(I happened to come across to Home,)

477
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:06,120
(assisting them
in locating the criminal hideouts.)

478
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:19,320
Mr. Chen.

479
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,120
Yes, Ms. Tina.

480
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,521
What are you doing here?

481
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:24,521
I've told you so many times

482
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:26,001
to stop calling me so formally.

483
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,041
You're almost my dad's age.

484
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,761
But you're our superior.

485
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,080
I have to address you properly.

486
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,921
Fine.

487
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,440
You can do

488
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,440
as you wish.

489
00:21:35,641 --> 00:21:36,600
It's not mealtime yet.

490
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:37,521
Why are you here?

491
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,360
Help me prepare something to eat.

492
00:21:39,401 --> 00:21:41,161
I want to feed that naughty cat.

493
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:41,801
All right.

494
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:42,921
I'll prepare it for you.

495
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,001
Ms. Tina.

496
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,320
Look,

497
00:21:46,521 --> 00:21:47,720
you have

498
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,960
such a good heart.

499
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,120
It's not hard to do.

500
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:54,600
The weather is getting cold
and the cat has nowhere to go.

501
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,600
It's fate for it

502
00:21:56,641 --> 00:21:57,761
to enter our place.

503
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:59,200
I can't watch it die.

504
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,521
By the way, Mr. Chen.

505
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:03,440
How about we shop
for the provisions together tomorrow?

506
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:05,200
Sure, no problem.

507
00:22:05,761 --> 00:22:07,080
Whenever I go out,

508
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,641
I always have people watching me.

509
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
You're more comfortable to be with
compared to the others.

510
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,960
We're just going through the formality.

511
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,360
I know you're a good person too.

512
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:19,480
You were the one

513
00:22:19,641 --> 00:22:21,120
who let this cat in here, right?

514
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:21,960
Oh, no. It wasn't me.

515
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,401
I have to thank...

516
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,681
Mr. Chen, don't worry.

517
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,840
No one is investigating it anymore.

518
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,840
By the way, Mr. Chen.

519
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,921
I remember you enjoy playing mahjong.

520
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,720
How about this?

521
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:33,561
Tomorrow, let's go out an hour earlier.

522
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
We'll buy the groceries quickly.
After we're done,

523
00:22:35,001 --> 00:22:36,200
I'll take you

524
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,521
to the mahjong parlor in Chinatown

525
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:38,801
to play for a couple of hours.

526
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:40,480
If you win, you can keep your winnings.

527
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,761
If you lose, I'll cover it for you.

528
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Oh, please don't do this.

529
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,320
You've already taken care of me enough.

530
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,360
No, please don't.

531
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:48,681
Whether I play mahjong or not,
it doesn't matter.

532
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,001
It would trouble you.

533
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:51,881
Don't say that.

534
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,320
We're all Chinese.

535
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,600
It's not easy to survive
in this unfamiliar place.

536
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:56,561
Just have some fun

537
00:22:56,681 --> 00:22:57,641
and relax.

538
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,681
- Ah, yes.
- You...

539
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,281
Find a phone and call your family.

540
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:05,041
Your son is back home in China, right?

541
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,360
Take this back first.

542
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,240
Ms. Tina,

543
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,881
I...

544
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,200
How am I supposed

545
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,641
to thank you? I won't say anything else.

546
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,440
I'll stop saying it.

547
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,960
No need to thank me.

548
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:15,720
I understand.

549
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,080
It's all in here.

550
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:18,801
All right then.

551
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,921
I'll see you at 12 tomorrow.

552
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:21,521
See you tomorrow.

553
00:23:24,561 --> 00:23:25,440
She's such a good person.

554
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:38,240
Meow.

555
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,401
Bai.

556
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:47,641
Meow.

557
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:50,200
Bai, come here.

558
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,440
Come here, kitty.

559
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,761
Eat something.

560
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,561
You must be hungry.

561
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,001
Why aren't you eating?

562
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:08,641
Aren't you hungry?

563
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:11,041
Are you sad?

564
00:24:11,281 --> 00:24:14,401
Are you feeling down like me?

565
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,080
Wang,

566
00:24:26,281 --> 00:24:28,161
get the car ready to leave.

567
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,120
Tina,

568
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,561
Quan just announced

569
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,041
that no one is allowed to leave.

570
00:24:32,161 --> 00:24:33,080
Why?

571
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,240
Why so sudden?

572
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,281
I'm going out to get groceries.

573
00:24:36,881 --> 00:24:37,600
If I don't go,

574
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:39,600
what will everyone eat and drink
if we don't go?

575
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,360
Tina,

576
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,041
it's Quan's decision.

577
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,440
I can't question it.

578
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:44,401
I think

579
00:24:44,521 --> 00:24:46,120
we'll just cancel for today.

580
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:46,960
No.

581
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:48,440
How about this?

582
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:49,761
Tell Chen to get in the car first

583
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:50,921
and I'll go and talk to Quan.

584
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
Okay.

585
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:55,120
Really?

586
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:57,360
He wants to meet me?

587
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,761
Where?

588
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,440
Santa Eulalia Cafe.

589
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,720
What time should I be there?

590
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:06,600
How do I make contact with him?

591
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:09,440
A woman?

592
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,801
Oh, nothing.

593
00:25:12,401 --> 00:25:16,281
I didn't think she was a woman.

594
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:18,521
Okay.

595
00:25:18,761 --> 00:25:21,801
Okay, I'll be there
at five o'clock this afternoon.

596
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:23,881
Who's there?

597
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,281
Quan, it's me.

598
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,440
How long
have you been standing out there?

599
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:33,681
How come even you forgot the rules?

600
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,561
I just arrived.

601
00:25:35,761 --> 00:25:37,681
I did hear you talking on the phone.

602
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,161
But it didn't seem
like anything important.

603
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,840
I could hear but couldn't understand.

604
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,921
Why do you want to see me?

605
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
I was about to go out

606
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:48,881
to do groceries with Chen.

607
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,480
I consulted with you yesterday,

608
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:51,600
and you agreed.

609
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,881
But the driver

610
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,080
refused to drive us out.

611
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:57,881
He said you just informed him.

612
00:25:58,681 --> 00:25:59,681
Yes, I did inform him.

613
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,681
After thinking about it,

614
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,240
let's all tighten our belts
and endure it for now

615
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,641
until

616
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:11,681
the situation in Huadu settles down.

617
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:14,200
Then I'll ask for permission from above.

618
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,001
If everything is safe,

619
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,440
everything will return to normal.

620
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:19,681
Tina,

621
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:22,561
just stay for today.

622
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,840
Don't get yourself into trouble.

623
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:26,921
Okay,

624
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,041
since you've said so.

625
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:29,440
You can go ahead with your work.

626
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,840
Okay.

627
00:26:56,001 --> 00:26:56,840
I'm in position.

628
00:26:57,561 --> 00:26:58,561
(Xuelian, remember this.)

629
00:26:58,761 --> 00:26:59,840
(No matter what happens)

630
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,200
(during the contact,)

631
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,761
(don't act recklessly.)

632
00:27:03,161 --> 00:27:04,281
(Our mission)

633
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:05,281
(is to retrieve the item)

634
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,440
(and bring it back safely to our country.)

635
00:27:06,761 --> 00:27:07,561
(Over.)

636
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,480
If they don't allow us to go out,

637
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,120
what are we going to eat tonight?

638
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,921
Let's endure it for now.

639
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,281
I wonder why this is happening.

640
00:27:23,921 --> 00:27:26,360
We shouldn't ask what we shouldn't ask.

641
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,161
But...

642
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:30,161
Could it be...

643
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:34,200
Forget it, I'll stop here.

644
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,440
What's wrong?

645
00:27:41,801 --> 00:27:42,600
Yesterday,

646
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,720
I heard Quan mention

647
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:46,921
someone's name to Qiang

648
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
when I delivered his meal.

649
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:50,320
What's the name?

650
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,080
It's...

651
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,320
It's called...

652
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:54,681
It's...

653
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:00,281
Why doesn't Quan let me go out?

654
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,921
Why is he being secretive?

655
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:05,521
I've been a loyal friend to him
for many years.

656
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,720
This is so disheartening.

657
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:10,681
Quan has his own plans.

658
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,921
Let's just follow them.

659
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:14,200
Besides,

660
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:16,561
you're not the only one.

661
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,360
No one can leave.

662
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm not like you.

663
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,641
You're quick-witted and sharp-minded.

664
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:24,840
Quan likes that about you.

665
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,641
Does he not like you too?

666
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,641
Aren't we a golden duo?

667
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:32,401
Both of us are his right-hand men.

668
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,320
All right.

669
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,921
I have to drive him out
to meet someone later.

670
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:39,561
Meet someone?

671
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,080
Who's that?

672
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:42,561
No idea.

673
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Maybe someone important.

674
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,921
But definitely a big shot.

675
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:00,120
Quan,

676
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,801
I've delivered the message.

677
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:04,320
But I don't think it's him.

678
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:06,001
Hopefully not.

679
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,080
I don't believe it's him either.

680
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,801
But he and Tina are the most suspicious.

681
00:29:12,281 --> 00:29:12,960
After all, the only ones allowed

682
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,881
to go out for procurement

683
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,041
are he and Tina.

684
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,281
(He's suddenly not letting us go out.)

685
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,080
(It should be related to the woman)

686
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,761
(who will meet Li Quan.)

687
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,881
(Is she the person that Chen mentioned?)

688
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,080
(They'll meet at 5 o'clock.)

689
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:32,440
(Li Quan should leave at 4 o'clock.)

690
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,120
(This is an opportunity for me.)

691
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,041
She's not here yet.

692
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,281
If she's still not here,

693
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,281
it means something is up on her end.

694
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,840
(Judging from the current situation,)

695
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:51,360
she must be feeling helpless

696
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,041
as she couldn't find a way
to contact us.

697
00:29:53,281 --> 00:29:55,401
But as long as we can confirm
her safety,

698
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:56,720
she'll definitely come,

699
00:29:56,881 --> 00:29:57,840
no matter how late.

700
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,720
Money.

701
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,960
Everyone is interested in money,

702
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:24,641
right?

703
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,801
- Everyone is interested in money...
- Wu.

704
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:27,600
Wu.

705
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,440
Yes, Ms. Tina.

706
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,161
Come here.

707
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,240
Study the materials yourselves.

708
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,840
What's wrong, Ms. Tina?
Why don't you come in?

709
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:36,960
The cat is missing.

710
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,200
It's gone, so be it.

711
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,281
It's just an animal.

712
00:30:40,561 --> 00:30:42,120
I've grown attached to it
after feeding it.

713
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,080
I've always treated it like a child.

714
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,881
Well, how about this?

715
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,561
You and Chen accompany me to find it.

716
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,521
Do I have to go?

717
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,561
You must.

718
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:52,521
Okay.

719
00:30:53,041 --> 00:30:53,561
You'll

720
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,720
take Chen and go.

721
00:30:55,041 --> 00:30:55,761
I'll watch this place

722
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,200
and help them study.

723
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:00,080
Quan gave this task to me.

724
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,881
Okay, thanks.

725
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,720
Mr. Chen,

726
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:20,440
why don't you go and have some fun?

727
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:21,521
I'll come back and pick you up.

728
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,161
Aren't we supposed to look for the cat?

729
00:31:25,681 --> 00:31:26,600
We've searched everywhere.

730
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:27,921
I don't think there's any hope.

731
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,681
Quan doesn't allow us
to do the groceries.

732
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,080
Since we're out here,

733
00:31:31,281 --> 00:31:32,120
let's relax for a bit.

734
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,480
Don't be so tense.

735
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:34,881
Well,

736
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,641
I'll go to a foot massage parlor
for a foot massage

737
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,681
and buy Quan

738
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,080
some of his favorite pickled olives.

739
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:39,921
Okay.

740
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,521
Ms. Tina,

741
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:41,600
then

742
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:43,240
you can go ahead
and don't worry about me.

743
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,200
Have a good time.

744
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,001
See you later.

745
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,440
Okay.

746
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,521
Ms. Tina.

747
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,240
What's the matter?

748
00:31:53,281 --> 00:31:54,801
Nothing.

749
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:57,080
Be careful on your way there.

750
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,761
Sorry about this.

751
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,840
Wu, it's me.

752
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:18,480
(Hello, Quan.)

753
00:32:19,161 --> 00:32:21,360
(Tina and Chen
have gone their separate ways.)

754
00:32:21,761 --> 00:32:23,080
(They stopped looking for the cat.)

755
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,120
(She said she's going for a foot massage)

756
00:32:26,761 --> 00:32:28,281
(and told Chen to wait for her outside.)

757
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:29,521
(If you ask me,)

758
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
(we can just grab her back, right?)

759
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:32,761
It's really her.

760
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,960
Use your brain, will you?

761
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,521
(We want what she has in her hands.)

762
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:39,681
And

763
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,320
we must catch her red-handed.

764
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:45,881
What if we can also catch
another target with her?

765
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,840
It's useless to grab her now.

766
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,761
First, let's confirm
what she has in her hands

767
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,761
and her identity.

768
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,480
Qiang,

769
00:32:56,401 --> 00:32:58,440
let the guys continue trailing her.

770
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:01,801
If they see her meeting anyone,

771
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,600
take immediate action

772
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,041
and bring both of them back,

773
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,840
along with whatever they exchange.

774
00:33:08,001 --> 00:33:08,801
Remember.

775
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:11,480
I want them alive.

776
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,080
As for how to handle her,

777
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:16,641
that person
will naturally take care of it.

778
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,041
We can't control it.

779
00:34:11,081 --> 00:34:11,561
Xuelian,

780
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:12,321
don't be impulsive.

781
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,860
(Two years later)

782
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,841
Time flies,

783
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,200
Wanru.

784
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:01,640
(Tomb of Martyr Zhang Wanru)
It's been two years already.

785
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,940
(Tomb of Martyr Zhang Wanru)

786
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:05,480
I miss you.

787
00:35:09,081 --> 00:35:09,960
So I wanted to come over

788
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,561
and talk to you.

789
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:14,880
In these past two years,

790
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,281
I have investigated
and prosecuted 15 cases

791
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:21,680
involving international telecom
and online fraud syndicate,

792
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,121
and the criminals

793
00:35:24,601 --> 00:35:26,521
who help hide their ill-gotten gains.

794
00:35:28,521 --> 00:35:30,121
I've investigated how money
from victims of telecom fraud

795
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,761
is transferred in over 20 provinces.

796
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,480
Every day has been busy for me.

797
00:35:39,841 --> 00:35:42,240
We've gathered
a significant amount of information,

798
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,960
and soon

799
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,801
you'll see the truth.

800
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:51,761
(Tomb of Martyr Zhang Wanru)
Then you can rest in peace.

801
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:52,740
(Tomb of Martyr Zhang Wanru)

802
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,730
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

803
00:36:05,761 --> 00:36:07,321
An Ni, I've reported

804
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,121
to the provincial prosecutor's office

805
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,081
the information you compiled and briefed
during the meeting.

806
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,561
The provincial prosecutor's superior
took it seriously

807
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:16,240
and immediately went to Beijing

808
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:18,801
to personally report
to the Supreme Procuratorate.

809
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,640
In the past two years,
the Supreme Procuratorate

810
00:36:21,841 --> 00:36:24,761
has been working with other countries
legal systems to gather evidence.

811
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,720
All the current evidence

812
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:29,041
points to Case 7·23 indicating

813
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:30,521
that

814
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:32,801
the true mastermind behind the case

815
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,281
is still at large.

816
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:35,640
Case 7·23

817
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,440
is a typical cybercrime.

818
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:39,361
The evidence is weak
and difficult to establish.

819
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:41,361
If the prosecution intervenes

820
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,761
in the investigation early on,

821
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,240
it may yield better results.

822
00:36:45,801 --> 00:36:46,640
On one hand,

823
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,960
it can improve the chain of evidence,

824
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,640
and on the other hand,

825
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:50,440
it can ensure

826
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,761
the normal progress of litigation
within the time limit.

827
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,001
Also,

828
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:56,400
the Supreme Procuratorate
has always encouraged us

829
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,001
not to stick to conventions

830
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:00,041
and to ensure

831
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:01,480
the firsthand experience of prosecutors.

832
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,561
To sum it all up,

833
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,801
after careful consideration
and deliberation,

834
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,521
the Supreme Procuratorate

835
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:11,321
and the Ministry of Public Security

836
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:13,960
have decided

837
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:16,041
to revive the 7·23 task force today

838
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,841
to continue the investigation
and gather solid evidence.

839
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,001
It's crucial

840
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,801
to apprehend the true mastermind

841
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,041
and all key members.

842
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:25,880
Currently,

843
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,720
Chief Bai

844
00:37:27,841 --> 00:37:29,200
and I will continue

845
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,001
to lead the task force.

846
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:32,680
An Ni.

847
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,521
Yes, sir.

848
00:37:34,281 --> 00:37:36,240
You've been selected
as a member of the task force.

849
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,041
Later this afternoon,

850
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:38,920
you'll accompany me
to attend the first briefing.

851
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:39,601
Yes, sir.

852
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:42,121
I've been waiting for this day
to come for two years.

853
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,790
(Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau)

854
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,230
(Captain He Luyuan,
Criminal Investigation Division)

855
00:37:58,521 --> 00:37:59,521
All right, my comrades.

856
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,440
Let's begin.

857
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,761
As most of you know,

858
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,880
two years ago,

859
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,281
we lost

860
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,281
a highly respected and beloved comrade.

861
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,240
(Heroic deeds last for eternity,)

862
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,960
(martyrs' legacy spreads for of thousands years.)
(Today marks the second anniversary)

863
00:38:11,561 --> 00:38:13,200
(of Comrade Zhang Wanru's sacrifice.)

864
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,200
(On this special day,)

865
00:38:15,801 --> 00:38:17,200
(the prosecution and the police)

866
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:19,041
(jointly hold)

867
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,121
(a meeting.)

868
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,321
(Back then,)

869
00:38:23,081 --> 00:38:24,240
(after Comrade Zhang Wanru)

870
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:27,561
(obtained the evidence)

871
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,920
(against a criminal syndicate
of Case 7·23 in Country A,)

872
00:38:29,081 --> 00:38:31,841
(she took the initiative
to contact us at home.)

873
00:38:32,361 --> 00:38:34,081
(But at that time, we were unaware)

874
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:37,601
(that the syndicate of Case 7·23)

875
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,440
(had already)

876
00:38:39,841 --> 00:38:40,920
(become suspicious.)

877
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:42,521
(They suspected)

878
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:44,200
(someone had infiltrated their ranks.)

879
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:46,480
(But they were uncertain
of who it was.)

880
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,880
(Under such a situation,)

881
00:38:48,001 --> 00:38:48,920
(Comrade Zhang Wanru)

882
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,440
(made a decisive decision)

883
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,720
(to sacrifice herself)

884
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,880
(to ensure the evidence was delivered)

885
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,160
(because she knew)

886
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,041
(we could only demand full support)

887
00:38:57,361 --> 00:38:58,761
(from the police of Country A)

888
00:38:58,841 --> 00:38:59,960
(in our arrest operation)

889
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:01,680
(if we had irrefutable evidence.)

890
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:04,001
I couldn't bring her home.

891
00:39:09,321 --> 00:39:10,680
(We have been speculating and reviewing)

892
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:11,920
(the incident repeatedly)

893
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:14,601
because we don't believe

894
00:39:14,841 --> 00:39:17,041
that Comrade Zhang Wanru really died
in a car accident.

895
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:19,440
But

896
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,041
we have no evidence.

897
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,160
Moreover,

898
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,880
the incident happened overseas.

899
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,281
At that time, the Barcelona court

900
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,240
had already sentenced the driver, Paul,

901
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,440
for drunk driving

902
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,281
and involuntary manslaughter.

903
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,081
In other words,

904
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,041
Paul

905
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,001
had successfully evaded
the accusation of murder

906
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:44,801
by using the pretext of drunk driving.

907
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:47,281
But we never gave up

908
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:48,680
our pursuit of the truth.

909
00:39:49,801 --> 00:39:51,801
However, it happened
in a foreign country.

910
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,400
Also, Country A
has a unique circumstance

911
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,281
and a complex legal system.

912
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:00,920
If we can't provide strong evidence,

913
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:02,281
it'll be difficult

914
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,920
for them to invest more effort into

915
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:05,640
what they considered to be an accident.

916
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,801
Nonetheless,

917
00:40:07,041 --> 00:40:07,960
justice

918
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:09,160
always prevails.

919
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,081
These are the relevant evidence
and materials.

920
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:23,680
We hope this will be helpful.

921
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:24,321
Thank you.

Intermediate People's Court
of Jiangcheng

923

per Article 266

924
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,281
of the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China,

925
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,121
hereby renders the following judgment...

926
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,740
(The defendant, Li Quan,
is convicted of the crime of fraud)

927
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,370
(and sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment,)

(along with a fine of six million yuan.)

(The defendant, Zhang Qiang,
is convicted of the crime of fraud)

00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,440
(and sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment,)

931
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,520
(along with a fine
of three million yuan.)

932
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:02,160
Comrade An Ni,

933
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,920
leading an excellent team,

934
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:06,200
has dedicated
over two years of relentless efforts.

935
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,160
(Finally, among)

937
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:11,601
(and complex information,)

938
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:14,240
they've identified
a highly valuable clue.

939
00:41:14,361 --> 00:41:15,121
Li Quan,

940
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,081
who was later brought back

941
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:19,160
to our country through extradition

942
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:20,841
had transferred 50,000 euros
to the driver,

943
00:41:21,121 --> 00:41:22,720
Paul's personal account

944
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,521
during the time of the crime.

945
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,321
Two years ago,

946
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,361
there were noticeable fluctuations

947
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,960
in Li Quan's financial account.

948
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:32,761
Each time the lower-level runners

949
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:34,080
(Direct funds from these accounts)
of the telecom fraud syndicate

950
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:35,281
(to higher-level accounts.)
dispersed money,

951
00:41:35,321 --> 00:41:36,321
they would transfer
a significant amount of money

952
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:38,160
in a scattered manner
to the upper-level accounts.

953
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
When funds from the upper levels
are centralized

954
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
and funneled

955
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:43,200
to the domestic illegal
money-laundering operation,

956
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,240
(Telecom Fraud Group Fund Flow Chart)
Li Quan's account would increase

957
00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:46,521
(Li Quan's Transfer Record)
by a proportional amount of euros.

958
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,321
As we traced it to its source

959
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,281
and continue to investigate
Li Quan's account,

960
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:52,321
we made a significant discovery.

961
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,880
Two years ago today,

962
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:57,200
Li Quan made several transfers

963
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:58,440
totaling 50,000 euros

964
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:00,321
to a driver named Tony Paul's account.

965
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:01,321
This clue

966
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:04,041
further confirms our initial suspicion

967
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,801
that Li Quan is highly likely

968
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,160
to have hired the driver Paul

969
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,321
to commit a premeditated murder
disguised as drunk driving

970
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:16,960
against Comrade Zhang Wanru.

971
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,960
Based on this,

972
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:18,680
Comrade An Ni conducted

973
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:20,561
an unannounced interrogation of Li Quan.

974
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,400
(Faced with irrefutable evidence,)

975
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,281
(Li Quan eventually confessed.)

976
00:42:26,561 --> 00:42:27,960
(However, our colleagues
in the prosecutor's office)

977
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,281
(did not stop there.)

978
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,601
(Instead,)

979
00:42:33,041 --> 00:42:35,720
(they conducted surprise interrogations)

980
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,640
(on all the prisoners involved
in Case 7·23.)

981
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:40,521
(And from that,)

982
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:42,041
(they obtained a crucial lead)

983
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,720
that Li Quan

984
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,521
is not

985
00:42:46,321 --> 00:42:47,960
the top leader

986
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:49,121
of Case 7·23's criminal syndicate
in Country A.

987
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:51,321
The mastermind

988
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,720
is someone else.

989
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:54,240
I only concealed

990
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:57,240
one person's name.

991
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:58,561
Give me the name.

992
00:42:59,200 --> 00:42:59,801
It's...

993
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:01,160
