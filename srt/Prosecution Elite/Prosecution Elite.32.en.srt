15
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:41,207
From a corporate
compliance perspective,

16
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:42,886
there are significant risks involved.

17
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:45,127
Professor Luo, I know all that you said.

18
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:46,926
But now I'm in a difficult situation.

19
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,286
Although I am the CEO of the company,

20
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:51,727
I can't make decisions
on such a big matter.

21
00:01:52,006 --> 00:01:52,487
Accept his proposal.

22
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,207
Go to this investor now

23
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:58,366
and tell him that we'll adjust
the internal algorithm

24
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,447
and set the entry threshold.

25
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:02,087
Mr. Yin.

26
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:05,847
Luo, I have considered

27
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,047
this matter many times.

28
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:12,886
This should not be a criminal offence,

29
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:16,166
but at most a fine for an infringement.

30
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,487
But this is something
that will come later

31
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,407
as not many people
know the internal algorithm.

32
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:26,647
If we get our way in the future,

33
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,847
then the number of
customers and the efficiency

34
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:31,686
will increase greatly.

35
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:35,207
A fine is nothing.

36
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:39,573
So I think this is a very good deal.

37
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,847
Isn't there a Chinese saying

38
00:02:44,007 --> 00:02:45,966
that you can't shoot a golden phoenix

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,007
without using golden bullets?

40
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:50,127
That's how the market works.

41
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:51,767
Opportunities come and go.

42
00:02:52,246 --> 00:02:54,806
If you lack decisiveness in the market,

43
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:56,767
you will get nowhere.

44
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,047
Therefore, I would like to ask you both

45
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,127
not to disclose the contents

46
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:04,847
of today's meeting to anyone else.

47
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:13,246
Mu'en, you're a smart guy.

48
00:03:14,287 --> 00:03:19,007
You know how to get your subordinates
to do their jobs without

49
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,927
letting them know what we're up to.

50
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:26,726
Mr. Yin, are you sure
you don't want to reconsider?

51
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:27,367
I think...

52
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,647
You don't have to worry so much.

53
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:34,606
I've reviewed and decided on this.

54
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,686
All you need to do is execute it.

55
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:41,567
I got it.

56
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,767
What brings you here again?

57
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,047
There is something tricky

58
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:59,287
that I have to come
and talk to you about.

59
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,047
What is it?

60
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:04,166
One of your friends,

61
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:05,606
Zhao Jikai...

62
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:06,927
He isn't my friend.

63
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,007
Who told you he's my friend?

64
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:11,367
Alright then.

65
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:16,527
Anyway, I was told that Zhao Jikai...

66
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:23,126
What?

67
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,767
How is this possible?

68
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:27,927
What happened?

69
00:04:28,807 --> 00:04:29,927
I don't know about the rest.

70
00:04:31,126 --> 00:04:33,326
I just know that he turned himself in

71
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:35,527
like a moth to a flame.

72
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:39,006
I also know that he went to see someone
before he turned himself in.

73
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:40,606
It must be the meeting

74
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,326
that made him make
such a sudden decision.

75
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:50,647
Lawyer Wu,

76
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:54,367
who asked you to tell me this?

77
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:57,846
A beautiful lawyer surnamed Li.

78
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:00,087
Her?

79
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,527
I didn't expect her to come to me.

80
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:12,326
It looks like he told her everything.

81
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:13,566
Alright.

82
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,807
What exactly did she want you
to come to me for?

83
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:24,326
Lawyer Li said
she knew from the beginning

84
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:26,967
that you're the only person
in Mr. Zhao's heart

85
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:31,047
and that he's only been
around you his whole life.

86
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:33,527
You should know Mr. Zhao well.

87
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,446
Hit someone where it hurts.

88
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,927
The reason he was
so willing to turn himself in

89
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:40,286
must have been because someone

90
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:42,606
was using you as leverage

91
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:46,487
and you must have known that person.

92
00:05:48,367 --> 00:05:52,606
She said that if you still have any

93
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,166
feelings and love for Mr. Zhao,

94
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,726
please say what you have to say

95
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:01,166
for Mr. Zhao, even if it's just once.

96
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:08,006
I want to know what makes you

97
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:10,047
and the Lawyer Li behind you

98
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,566
think you can convince me?

99
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:18,566
Madam Qian,
I know it's hard to convince you.

100
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:23,687
But as your lawyer,
I have to do my best

101
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:25,846
to fight for your best interests.

102
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,207
I must give it a try.

103
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:33,527
And I must show your
true position among them.

104
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:36,967
I want to stop you
from getting sentimental and being used.

105
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:44,606
It's really providential.

106
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:50,126
I haven't met her but I can feel

107
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:52,087
that she must love him.

108
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:54,927
They are actually quite similar.

109
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,967
They're the kind of people
who are sentimental,

110
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,967
who would do anything

111
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:03,527
for the unseen and untouchable love.

112
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:06,807
They are too silly.

113
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:08,527
They are really silly.

114
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:12,367
Every second of freedom lost

115
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:16,767
in this prison is a torment.

116
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:22,286
I know he can't stand
the suffering at all.

117
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:24,566
Sorry to interrupt you, Madam Qian.

118
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:29,726
Since you know it, just tell the truth.

119
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:32,606
Don't let him take the fall for others.

120
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:38,606
You're going to let me sell that man
out for his freedom?

121
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:42,566
I will tell you I can't do that.

122
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,247
As expected.

123
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:01,047
What do you mean by that?

124
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:02,807
Lawyer Li guessed it all.

125
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,326
She said that Mr. Zhao
has always been living

126
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:08,606
a beautiful dream that he has woven,

127
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,566
a dream that has always
revolved around you.

128
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:14,047
He even thinks about
taking you away with him

129
00:08:14,087 --> 00:08:15,807
when it's all over.

130
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:21,166
Do you know that Lawyer Li
is very envious of you?

131
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:25,487
Because she has never been
in this dream and you

132
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:28,406
have got what she could
never achieve in her life

133
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,406
without any effort.

134
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:32,006
But you don't care about him,

135
00:08:32,047 --> 00:08:32,846
you don't cherish him.

136
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,286
Even though he is now behind bars

137
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:36,807
and has no freedom.

138
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,887
Who said I don't care about him?

139
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:39,887
But just because I care about him

140
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,447
doesn't mean I have to
sell out another person to protect him.

141
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:42,927
Alright.

142
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,606
Then say something you think you can say.

143
00:08:45,887 --> 00:08:48,726
Don't make Mr Zhao's dedication
look like a joke.

144
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,247
I didn't expect this to happen to him.

145
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,007
What can I do?

146
00:08:57,206 --> 00:08:58,206
Let me think about it.

147
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,127
I don't want to be indebted to anyone.

148
00:09:07,487 --> 00:09:09,127
(You have long cast off your old self.)

149
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:13,726
(Let those old day stay in the past.)

150
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:18,487
All this may be providential.

151
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:20,567
What can I say?

152
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,206
Alright.

153
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,646
Since she has sent you here,

154
00:09:29,606 --> 00:09:33,367
I will give her a chance to know

155
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,726
what it means to be at the mercy of God

156
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:36,807
and to completely lose hope.

157
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:38,887
I have an address here

158
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,966
for you to pass on to her,
without missing a word.

159
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:44,807
Please say it.

160
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:50,526
And tell her to not get her hopes up.

161
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,286
How did you choose this place?

162
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:10,927
Lawyer Wu,

163
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,526
You spend your time in either a
detention centre, prison,

164
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,406
court or police station.

165
00:10:16,526 --> 00:10:18,447
I picked this place especially for you

166
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,567
to cleanse and purify our minds

167
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,487
so that we can remember
that we are still human.

168
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:27,646
She just gave an address.

169
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:37,447
This is it?

170
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,206
So, you really want to quit Huiquan?

171
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:47,966
I have a feeling

172
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,047
that something bad is going
to happen with the company

173
00:10:51,247 --> 00:10:53,406
and I don't want to get into trouble.

174
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,846
Then trust your hunch.

175
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:58,766
Just quit. I support you.

176
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,166
I've always told you

177
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,247
that if you're happy doing this job,

178
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:04,646
you can go ahead and if you're not,

179
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:06,406
you might as well come home

180
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,927
and do what you love.

181
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:15,286
Right, I haven't told you

182
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,807
that An Ni asked me
to meet her the other day.

183
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,687
She said there's a problem with Huiquan,

184
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:26,526
but she didn't make it clear.

185
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,526
An Ni is highly principled.

186
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:32,206
She couldn't have told
anyone about cases.

187
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:38,166
But I got the hint from her attitude

188
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:41,206
that something's wrong with Huiquan.

189
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,526
Quit immediately then.

190
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:49,247
Even if there are any problems
affecting you in the future,

191
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:51,487
you still have me.

192
00:11:53,007 --> 00:11:56,406
I can't let my personal problems
affect your future.

193
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:58,927
You definitely have

194
00:11:59,447 --> 00:12:01,327
room and opportunity
to take the next step.

195
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,007
Luo, At our age,

196
00:12:05,526 --> 00:12:07,166
we can't do things that we will regret.

197
00:12:09,526 --> 00:12:11,406
I've been thinking a lot lately.

198
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:16,887
Xiaoting still has no idea
of our relationship.

199
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:19,766
Why don't we get a chance

200
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:20,966
to talk to her about it?

201
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:21,927
Make it public.

202
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:35,766
Xiaoting, you're back.

203
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,807
I finally remember who you are.

204
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,086
Xiaoting, call her Aunt Xu.

205
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:07,846
I know you saw the picture in the book.

206
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:11,367
You didn't ask and I didn't tell.

207
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:18,127
Yes, she's the one in the picture.

208
00:13:21,247 --> 00:13:25,047
Xiaoting,
let's get to know each other officially.

209
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:26,086
How about this?

210
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,487
Come on, let's shake hands.

211
00:13:36,646 --> 00:13:38,447
Xiaoting, what's wrong with you?

212
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:40,286
Why are you so rude?

213
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:42,406
Standing here and listening to you

214
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,687
is the last courtesy I can show.

215
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:46,487
Dad, you've never been

216
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,166
so mean to me because of an outsider.

217
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,487
I will let you have this home.

218
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:54,846
Xiaoting!

219
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:04,487
Hello, Xiaoting.

220
00:14:04,606 --> 00:14:05,127
What's wrong?

221
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,327
An Ni, my dad just

222
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:09,927
had a date with a woman at home.

223
00:14:10,927 --> 00:14:13,406
(And he scolded me
in order to defend her.)

224
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:18,726
So that's the case.

225
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:21,367
You cried so loudly

226
00:14:21,406 --> 00:14:23,327
and I thought you were suffering
from something else.

227
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:29,606
Xiaoting, I've known all about this

228
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:30,687
for quite some time.

229
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:32,487
(It's like this.)

230
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:34,846
(Calm down and listen to me.)

231
00:14:34,966 --> 00:14:37,567
(I know it's hard for you
to accept this now.)

232
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:42,487
But Professor Luo
has to live his own life too.

233
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:45,247
After all,
your mum has been gone for years.

234
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:48,047
Furthermore, from a legal point of view,

235
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:52,286
Professor Luo is
an independent individual and a widower.

236
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:53,846
He has nothing in his way.

237
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:57,447
You must listen to me well on this point.

238
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,247
Think about it.

239
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:00,966
In the future, if you get married

240
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:02,726
and Professor Luo is at home by himself,

241
00:15:02,846 --> 00:15:04,807
you will surely worry about
whether he has eaten,

242
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:06,726
whether he is healthy

243
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:09,286
and whether anyone
will know if he is sick, right?

244
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:12,766
So, Xiaoting,

245
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,526
Regarding this matter
with Professor Luo,

246
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:20,567
I would advise you
not to take it too hard.

247
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:22,047
Take your time to accept it.

248
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:26,927
But Ni,
I really can't accept it right now.

249
00:15:27,646 --> 00:15:31,166
Xiaoting, I know it takes

250
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,206
a bit of time to accept this.

251
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:34,887
No rush. Just take your time.

252
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,846
But think about it, there are always

253
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,166
friends around us

254
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:43,286
who like to impose their ideas on others.

255
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,286
(Do you like this kind of friend?)

256
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:46,887
No.

257
00:15:47,526 --> 00:15:52,086
Our parents are just
as equal as our friends,

258
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:52,687
aren't they?

259
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,966
But Ni, I...

260
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,487
I can actually accept that

261
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:00,367
but it's just too sudden.

262
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,406
I'm just mad at him
for keeping it from me.

263
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:07,327
I knew you're a sensible girl.

264
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:08,526
You're all grown up.

265
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:11,327
Where are you now?

266
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,007
I'm in the park.

267
00:16:13,887 --> 00:16:16,687
I just got upset with him
and I ran out on my own.

268
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:17,966
Go home now.

269
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:18,966
Professor Luo must be
very worried about you.

270
00:16:19,007 --> 00:16:19,846
It's late now.

271
00:16:20,127 --> 00:16:21,047
Ni, don't worry.

272
00:16:22,127 --> 00:16:23,646
I just need some alone time.

273
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:26,447
Xiaoting, how about this?

274
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,927
I have some urgent work at the moment.

275
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:30,487
I'll ask for leave and
I'll come and send you home.

276
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:31,606
Send me your location.

277
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:33,367
It's Luo Xiaoting, right?

278
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:34,567
Pass the phone to me.

279
00:16:34,646 --> 00:16:35,127
Let me talk to her.

280
00:16:37,966 --> 00:16:40,007
Xiaoting, I'm He.

281
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:41,567
How about this?

282
00:16:41,606 --> 00:16:44,966
I'll ask Zhang Xiaobei to go find you
and send you home.

283
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:47,766
Okay.

284
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,927
Then I'll send my location
to An Ni later.

285
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:54,927
When a woman is upset,

286
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:56,086
a man should be there to coax her.

287
00:16:57,606 --> 00:16:59,086
It's called everything
has its vanquisher.

288
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:07,607
He thinks he's amazing, huh?

289
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,727
I heard you had a problem.

290
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,687
It's about my dad.

291
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,886
I'd say you're spoiled.

292
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:49,447
Actually, Xiaoting,

293
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:50,607
You have a happy life.

294
00:17:50,646 --> 00:17:52,047
I really envy you.

295
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:53,646
Look at me.

296
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,766
My dad had been ill
for so many years,

297
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:58,087
my mum died early,

298
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:00,886
and then my sister was killed.

299
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:02,927
You have no idea what life was like

300
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:04,607
for me and my dad.

301
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:07,246
There were only two men in the house.

302
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:10,166
A home is not a home without a woman.

303
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,646
So we've been getting by all these years.

304
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:17,607
If my dad were still alive,

305
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,006
I'd be very happy for him if he did

306
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:23,687
find his own happiness. I mean it.

307
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,807
Look at us young people,

308
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:29,166
our parents have worked hard
all their lives for us.

309
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:32,087
But when they get old,
we restrain them.

310
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,886
I think that's a bit selfish.

311
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:43,406
Xiaobei, I think you've changed.

312
00:18:45,607 --> 00:18:46,366
Have I?

313
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:48,286
Yes.

314
00:18:51,126 --> 00:18:52,286
We have our own matters to attend to.

315
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:54,366
I've been preparing for
my auxiliary police exams.

316
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:56,687
You're going to be
an auxiliary police officer?

317
00:18:58,366 --> 00:19:00,207
With all the bad things
I've done before,

318
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:01,727
it might be a bit unrealistic for me

319
00:19:02,927 --> 00:19:04,646
to become a cop straight away.

320
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:06,607
So I wanted to start as
an auxiliary police officer

321
00:19:07,327 --> 00:19:08,766
to at least be close to my sister.

322
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:10,847
One more thing,

323
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:12,526
do you remember Liang Ying?

324
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,807
I spoke to her on the phone yesterday.

325
00:19:17,526 --> 00:19:19,727
I told her that I have

326
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:21,327
found the right path in my life

327
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:23,486
and she said she has found

328
00:19:23,526 --> 00:19:24,687
a place that suits her

329
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,006
and is doing something meaningful.

330
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:33,807
That's great. I would also like to
wish her all the best.

331
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:39,727
I hope she can forget
all her past misfortunes and start afresh.

332
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,727
Don't you want to wish me a fresh start?

333
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,447
Xiaoting, sit down.

334
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:48,087
I was out of line. I apologize.

335
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:54,406
Dad, let me ask you,

336
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:58,006
when did you start dating Xu Ailin?

337
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,246
Was it when my mum was still alive?

338
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:03,727
Before your mum passed away,

339
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:05,006
your Aunt Xu and I

340
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,486
didn't do anything wrong to her.

341
00:21:07,847 --> 00:21:12,207
I can swear to you on
the name of your mum on this point.

342
00:21:18,366 --> 00:21:21,886
Your Aunt Xu also said she could quit

343
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:24,807
if you couldn't accept our relationship.

344
00:21:25,526 --> 00:21:27,047
She means it.

345
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:32,727
Dad, that's okay.

346
00:21:34,687 --> 00:21:36,687
If you two really want to be together,

347
00:21:37,406 --> 00:21:38,967
invite her over for dinner.

348
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:42,246
We'll get to know each other officially

349
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,087
and I'll apologize to her.

350
00:21:49,166 --> 00:21:52,126
An Ni and Xiaobei
have talked to me earlier.

351
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:55,807
I think they're right so I'm back.

352
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,967
It's me who should apologize.

353
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:09,927
Thank you for your understanding
and tolerance.

354
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:23,286
Dad, you haven't eaten, have you?

355
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:24,727
I'll cook you some dumplings.

356
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:27,047
Okay.

357
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:46,126
Xiaoting, I want to ask you something.

358
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:46,847
Go ahead.

359
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:49,807
You and Zhang Xiaobei...

360
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:51,526
It's certainly not the same
as you and Mayor Xu.

361
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:53,886
But who knows what the future holds?

362
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,607
Let's work hard together.

363
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,166
Why did you suddenly come back earlier?

364
00:23:03,766 --> 00:23:05,567
Today, someone sent me a private message

365
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:09,006
saying that there was
a gas leak in our house so I rushed home.

366
00:23:10,126 --> 00:23:11,006
Private message?

367
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:12,286
Who sent it?

368
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:13,927
I don't know.

369
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:17,126
It's an unknown account
but it's now deleted.

370
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,607
I even sent this account to An Ni

371
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:21,286
to ask her to help me check it out.

372
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:23,327
But An Ni didn't agree,

373
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:25,406
saying she couldn't check
the account with the platform

374
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:27,006
for her own personal reasons

375
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,126
and that there was no evidence

376
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:30,366
that anyone was suspected
of breaking the law,

377
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:33,166
so now it can only
be treated as a prank.

378
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:37,366
I got it.

379
00:23:39,286 --> 00:23:41,366
Dad, Please don't mind me saying this.

380
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,567
You are still in Huiquan,
and Aunt Xu's identity

381
00:23:46,607 --> 00:23:47,807
is a bit sensitive after all.

382
00:23:49,207 --> 00:23:50,327
Do you think you...

383
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,447
I know what you're trying to say.

384
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:54,766
Don't worry. I know what to do.

385
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:58,006
Actually, before you came back,

386
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,166
your Aunt Xu and I

387
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:01,807
were discussing
how I could quit Huiquan.

388
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:03,807
That's good then.

389
00:24:10,914 --> 00:24:12,937
(Xu Ailin)

390
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:17,366
Ailin.

391
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,006
I'm on my way to an event.

392
00:24:20,447 --> 00:24:21,807
How is Xiaoting?

393
00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:23,447
She's fine.

394
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,047
She's home now.

395
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:29,126
She no longer objects to
our relationship.

396
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,406
Xiaoting is a good girl.

397
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:33,366
You shouldn't have
treated her like that.

398
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:36,166
I'm calling you to tell you

399
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,886
that Xiaoting suddenly came back today

400
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,166
because she received a message

401
00:24:41,406 --> 00:24:43,006
saying that there was a problem
with the gas in the house.

402
00:24:43,286 --> 00:24:45,406
The more I think about it,
the more uneasy I get.

403
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:49,406
I had this feeling before and
it was very accurate.

404
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:54,286
Luo, are you overthinking it?

405
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,406
No, you don't understand.

406
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,567
I would like to quit Huiquan immediately.

407
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:04,126
I want to get out of this mess.

408
00:25:05,607 --> 00:25:09,166
Luo, we have already discussed
this matter today.

409
00:25:10,006 --> 00:25:12,886
I will support you in
whatever decision you make.

410
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:17,847
All I want from now on

411
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:20,166
is for you and Xiaoting to be good.

412
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:22,286
(Nothing else matters.)

413
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:24,286
I heard it.

414
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:25,486
Okay.

415
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:27,406
Okay, I'll hang up now.

416
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:33,694
(Huiquan Corporation)

417
00:25:34,646 --> 00:25:36,047
(Letter of resignation)
(Dear Mr. Yin,)

418
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:39,207
(I am sorry that I have to resign)

419
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:41,607
(from the company
at this point in time.)

420
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,286
(I am submitting
this letter of resignation)

421
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:46,567
(with a mixed feeling.)

422
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:49,126
(The situation in the company now)

423
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,006
(needs everyone to do their best.)

424
00:25:51,886 --> 00:25:54,807
(Due to my poor condition
and personal matters,)

425
00:25:55,047 --> 00:25:57,006
(my work has been affected)

426
00:25:57,886 --> 00:25:58,766
(and I feel)

427
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:01,886
(that I am unable to contribute
to the company accordingly.)

428
00:26:01,886 --> 00:26:02,607
(Letter of resignation,
Huiquan Corporation)

429
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:05,126
(So would like to ask
for permission to leave.)

430
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,286
(I hope you will
approve my resignation.)

431
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:11,967
(I am very grateful
for your appreciation of me.)

432
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:14,406
(Lastly, I wish Huiquan)

433
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,406
(to be what you want it to be)

434
00:26:16,687 --> 00:26:19,366
(and I hope that Huiquan will be able
to overcome the obstacles)

435
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:20,847
(and embrace a bright future.)

436
00:26:22,853 --> 00:26:25,883
(A city on the southern coast)

437
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:02,567
Hello.

438
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:05,927
Where are the others?

439
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:07,366
They went to have lunch.

440
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:08,246
Why didn't you join them?

441
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:09,207
I'm waiting for you.

442
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,286
You're waiting for me?

443
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,087
I'm waiting for you to tell me

444
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:16,766
what Jia told you on the phone.

445
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:21,406
How's it?

446
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:22,646
What did Jia say?

447
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:25,886
Guess what Zhou Siyue's mother's
surname is.

448
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:27,447
Zhou.

449
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:28,766
Am I being a bit silly

450
00:27:28,766 --> 00:27:29,847
in asking this question?

451
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:31,766
His mother's surname is Zhou

452
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:32,526
and her full name is Zhou Ling.

453
00:27:32,807 --> 00:27:34,967
She was very beautiful
when she was young.

454
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:37,847
After graduating from
nursing school in Changchun,

455
00:27:37,927 --> 00:27:38,927
she went to Fujian.

456
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,246
After a few years, she went back
to Fujian with a baby in her belly,

457
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:44,286
and she wouldn't say anything
when asked by her family.

458
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:46,646
Then, it's all about what Jia said.

459
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:53,607
What are you drawing?

460
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:53,860
(Zhou Ling)

461
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,126
Divergent thinking.

462
00:27:55,766 --> 00:27:57,006
I like to use this way of thinking

463
00:27:57,047 --> 00:27:58,727
when I think about things.

464
00:27:59,087 --> 00:28:01,646
For example,
from suspicion to clues to evidence.

465
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:04,166
It helps my thinking process.

466
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,540
(Fujian)

467
00:28:05,847 --> 00:28:09,607
I guess Zhou Ling worked as a nurse

468
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,567
in Fujian when she was young,

469
00:28:12,047 --> 00:28:13,967
and then by chance

470
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,526
she met Zhou Siyue's father.

471
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:16,886
Zhou Siyue's father

472
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:18,366
was attracted to
Zhou Ling's youth and beauty,

473
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:20,927
so gradually Zhou Ling was conquered.

474
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:23,727
But later, for some reason,

475
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:25,286
Zhou Ling was dumped,

476
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:27,607
or perhaps she fell out of love.

477
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:30,366
Then, she went back her hometown alone.

478
00:28:31,286 --> 00:28:32,607
And things got worse

479
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,006
And things got worse
when the baby was born.

480
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:38,847
So the mother and son left
the town without a trace.

481
00:28:39,807 --> 00:28:41,286
That should be the case.

482
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:44,327
But it was so hard to be
a single mother in those days.

483
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,820
(After giving birth)

484
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,327
Did Jia say anything else,

485
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:49,847
like where they stayed?

486
00:28:50,927 --> 00:28:53,406
Zhou Ling had no contact with
her family since then.

487
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:56,006
And there was no big data
like there is now.

488
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,327
It's caused a bit of a disconnect.

489
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:01,687
Let's go out for lunch.

490
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:04,607
You go ahead. I don't have an appetite.

491
00:29:06,727 --> 00:29:07,847
How's Li Yitang and you?

492
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:12,727
She has blacklisted me.

493
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:46,687
Anyone home?

494
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:54,967
Anyone home?

495
00:29:57,886 --> 00:29:58,687
Who are you?

496
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:00,526
How did you get to our house?

497
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,567
Why did you come in on your own?

498
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,047
Hello. I'm from out of town, Madam.

499
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,006
I just knocked on the door

500
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:08,967
and there was no response

501
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,447
so I pushed the door in myself.

502
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:11,607
So who are you?

503
00:30:11,646 --> 00:30:12,366
What are you doing here?

504
00:30:12,847 --> 00:30:13,646
Here's the case.

505
00:30:13,766 --> 00:30:14,886
I'm here to find someone.

506
00:30:14,967 --> 00:30:16,366
This is the address she gave me.

507
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:19,166
All I know is that his nickname is A.

508
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:20,406
Do you know him?

509
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,207
What A?

510
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:24,166
Listen, I have

511
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:26,607
lived alone in this place for decades.

512
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,207
There isn't any A.

513
00:30:28,286 --> 00:30:29,486
You've come to the wrong place.

514
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:30,526
Get out now.

515
00:30:30,526 --> 00:30:31,006
Get out.

516
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:32,126
Get out. You've come to the wrong place.

517
00:30:32,126 --> 00:30:32,687
No, Madam.

518
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:33,286
It's like this.

519
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,486
You said you've lived here for decades,

520
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,006
but where is your family?

521
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:40,847
Why do you talk like that?

522
00:30:41,246 --> 00:30:42,406
You have so many questions.

523
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,006
Are you trying to do something bad?

524
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:45,967
I'm going to call the police
if you don't leave now.

525
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:47,286
No, Madam. You have misunderstood.

526
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:48,286
I'm not a bad person.

527
00:30:51,567 --> 00:30:53,567
This is a fee for your help.

528
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:55,447
I just want to ask you something.

529
00:30:58,847 --> 00:31:01,607
I see. What do you want to ask about?

530
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:04,766
You said you have lived here for decades,

531
00:31:04,807 --> 00:31:06,207
how many years is that?

532
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:08,486
About twenty years.

533
00:31:11,047 --> 00:31:15,166
I've just asked you about your family

534
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:16,847
and I can see you're not happy.

535
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,406
Did I offend you?

536
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:20,727
They're all dead.

537
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:23,886
Sorry, Madam.

538
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:25,727
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

539
00:31:26,727 --> 00:31:28,047
What else do you want to ask?

540
00:31:28,087 --> 00:31:28,727
Please ask now.

541
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,126
Or I'm going to cook.

542
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:31,567
It's like this, Madam.

543
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:33,366
Well, have you lived

544
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:35,006
in this house for decades?

545
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,006
Are you the landlord?

546
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:37,087
Yes.

547
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:39,766
I've lived here for decades.

548
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:42,847
Back then, I had a full house of tenants.

549
00:31:42,927 --> 00:31:44,646
Don't look at this shabby look now,

550
00:31:45,126 --> 00:31:46,807
but it was a lively place back then.

551
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,967
Do you know a tenant called Qian Tianxin?

552
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,366
Qian Tianxin?

553
00:31:55,927 --> 00:31:56,727
I don't know her.

554
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:58,447
Think about it carefully.

555
00:31:58,526 --> 00:32:00,166
She's beautiful.

556
00:32:03,927 --> 00:32:06,847
There was a very pretty girl
who worked at the factory,

557
00:32:07,646 --> 00:32:09,646
but we didn't know her name,

558
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:11,727
we just knew her as Xin.

559
00:32:12,286 --> 00:32:16,246
She stayed for a short time
and then left.

560
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:22,886
Did she get along with anyone
during the time she lived here?

561
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:26,207
She did.

562
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:27,847
Because she was pretty,

563
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,646
a lot of men came to her,

564
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:33,047
but I don't know
if you're talking about her.

565
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:38,327
Then she went to Hong Kong, China and
Macau, China to make a fortune.

566
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:39,886
I don't know what happened
to her after that.

567
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:41,886
whether she's dead or alive.

568
00:32:44,807 --> 00:32:48,166
Was there a man called A among them,

569
00:32:48,207 --> 00:32:49,447
the one I just mentioned?

570
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,087
There's another one called Zhao Jikai.

571
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:51,967
Kai.

572
00:32:52,246 --> 00:32:52,886
Kai?

573
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:54,006
Zhao Jikai?

574
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:57,126
No. I have never heard of him.

575
00:32:59,327 --> 00:33:02,246
Wait, can you think about it carefully?

576
00:33:03,286 --> 00:33:07,526
I may be old, but I'm known

577
00:33:07,727 --> 00:33:09,087
to have a good memory.

578
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:11,607
I can remember exactly how many eggs

579
00:33:11,687 --> 00:33:15,286
and kilogram of rice
people borrowed from me.

580
00:33:15,687 --> 00:33:17,847
So those people you just told me about,

581
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,727
I don't know them and I have no idea.

582
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:24,927
What else do you want to ask?

583
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:27,766
Ask quickly. I'm going to cook.

584
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:33,526
Madam, do you know
a man called Yin Huiquan?

585
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:35,727
Yin Huiquan?

586
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,166
Yes.

587
00:33:36,526 --> 00:33:37,687
Yin Huiquan.

588
00:33:38,366 --> 00:33:39,166
Huiquan?

589
00:33:39,567 --> 00:33:40,447
Huiquan.

590
00:33:41,006 --> 00:33:41,567
Huiquan.

591
00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:43,567
Why didn't you ask about this earlier?

592
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,886
I don't know Huiquan,

593
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:49,366
but my previous tenant, Zhou Ling, does.

594
00:33:49,646 --> 00:33:53,886
She was crazy all day long
chanting Huiquan.

595
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,607
She was working here with
a child at the time.

596
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,967
That child was so pitiful.

597
00:34:00,087 --> 00:34:01,807
She beat him every day.

598
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,087
But that boy didn't say a word.

599
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:06,087
It was a poor boy.

600
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:13,167
So Zhou Ling is Yin Huiquan's woman,

601
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:15,246
and Zhou Siyue is Yin Huiquan's child.

602
00:34:16,807 --> 00:34:19,567
Madam, do you have the contact details
of the mother and son?

603
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:21,567
No.

604
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:25,047
At that time, they lived there for
less than two years before moving out.

605
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:27,567
Then the boy told me that his mother

606
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:32,647
moved to a new place every two years.

607
00:34:33,526 --> 00:34:35,807
Then, I didn't hear from them anymore.

608
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:42,047
Madam, can you please think

609
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:46,246
of any important bits or clues

610
00:34:46,286 --> 00:34:48,087
that can be used to reach them?

611
00:34:48,766 --> 00:34:51,087
There were so many people
coming and going.

612
00:34:51,206 --> 00:34:52,966
It's good enough that I can remember.

613
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:54,647
I've told you everything I know.

614
00:34:54,686 --> 00:34:56,167
What other clues can I give you?

615
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:00,686
You've asked what you need to ask,

616
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:02,887
and I've told you what I know.

617
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:04,567
You didn't spend this money for nothing.

618
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:05,966
What else do you want?

619
00:35:06,047 --> 00:35:08,167
Ask quickly. I'm really going to cook.

620
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:09,926
How about this, Madam?

621
00:35:10,327 --> 00:35:13,127
I will stay here for another day or two.

622
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:16,766
Call me if you think of anything,

623
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:21,367
and this will be all yours.

624
00:35:25,327 --> 00:35:26,726
Li Yitang.

625
00:35:28,246 --> 00:35:29,567
Lawyer Li.

626
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:30,327
Yes.

627
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:32,446
Okay.

628
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:35,006
I will contact you according
to this business card.

629
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:35,926
Okay.

630
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,327
I'll get going now.

631
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:38,926
Sorry to disturb you, Madam.

632
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:40,807
Take care.

633
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:41,526
Okay.

634
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:43,726
Bye.

635
00:35:46,286 --> 00:35:46,887
Qian Tianxin.

636
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:48,726
We're from Jiangcheng
People's Procuratorate.

637
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:50,206
In accordance with the law,
we're going to...

638
00:35:50,286 --> 00:35:50,926
Enough.

639
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:53,607
I've got the cliche memorized.

640
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:55,686
You're not robots.

641
00:35:56,006 --> 00:35:56,847
Can you please stop

642
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:58,926
opening with the same line every time?

643
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:02,966
No, why are you the only one
with so many opinions?

644
00:36:03,526 --> 00:36:04,327
According to the rules,

645
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:05,926
we have to make this clear.

646
00:36:05,966 --> 00:36:07,206
Each of your interrogations

647
00:36:07,246 --> 00:36:08,647
is audio and video recorded.

648
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:12,047
Looks like you're in a bad mood today.

649
00:36:12,686 --> 00:36:14,367
Since we are already old acquaintances,

650
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:15,766
we will avoid the procedure if we can.

651
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:19,127
Qian Tianxin,
your case is about to be heard.

652
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:20,367
How do you feel?

653
00:36:20,847 --> 00:36:21,486
Are you nervous?

654
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:24,047
Nervous?

655
00:36:26,006 --> 00:36:28,286
What's there to be nervous
about at this point?

656
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:31,567
It's just a word. Die.

657
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:36,167
You really are a man
who has seen the world.

658
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:38,926
I have enjoyed what I had to enjoy

659
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:43,407
and have no regrets. I don't mind.

660
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:48,087
Indeed, I did see you squander
your money on pleasure.

661
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,167
However, you are now in detention.

662
00:36:51,006 --> 00:36:52,446
I intended to advise you

663
00:36:52,726 --> 00:36:54,486
to explain the whereabouts
of the stolen money

664
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:55,567
and to return the money,

665
00:36:56,206 --> 00:36:57,766
which could help reduce your sentence.

666
00:36:58,726 --> 00:37:00,127
But I can see your attitude.

667
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:02,286
You're not even afraid to die.

668
00:37:04,087 --> 00:37:05,407
So why are you asking?

669
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:07,807
Because I'm curious.

670
00:37:08,686 --> 00:37:10,486
I'm curious if money is really

671
00:37:10,526 --> 00:37:12,167
that important to you.

672
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:13,526
You won't be able to

673
00:37:13,526 --> 00:37:14,847
take this money with you if you die.

674
00:37:15,726 --> 00:37:17,807
And you will not be able to use it
for the benefit of mankind.

675
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:19,526
The only thing that will happen

676
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:20,847
is that someone on the outside
will spend it for you

677
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,607
and enjoy it all for you, right?

678
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,807
What are you trying to say?

679
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:33,526
You're not A.

680
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,486
The money is not with you.

681
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,367
The volume of your scams

682
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:48,286
and the amount of money
your victims have paid

683
00:37:48,327 --> 00:37:50,006
is astronomically large.

684
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,686
I've done the maths for you.

685
00:37:52,766 --> 00:37:54,006
After your spending,

686
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:54,847
the rest of the money

687
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:56,327
is still totally disproportionate.

688
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,047
Qian Tianxin, don't tell me

689
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:01,486
you spent all that money.

690
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,047
That would be ridiculous.

691
00:38:03,206 --> 00:38:04,647
Refusing to explain
the whereabouts of the money,

692
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:07,446
not pleading guilty or
accepting the penalty, I've noted it all.

693
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,127
I have dealt with
too many cases similar to yours.

694
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:13,966
Some of the ringleaders

695
00:38:14,006 --> 00:38:15,286
were really profligate.

696
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,047
When they were caught,

697
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:18,887
there was very little money left

698
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:20,407
to recover for the victims.

699
00:38:21,286 --> 00:38:23,006
But they used it on themselves,

700
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,567
or gave it to their families
to improve their lives.

701
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:28,286
But it's the opposite in your case.

702
00:38:29,327 --> 00:38:32,526
First of all, you should know very well
what kind of situation

703
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:34,407
your foreign husband is in.

704
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:37,087
We also investigated through
the local police

705
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:38,847
that he didn't have much money.

706
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:43,127
Secondly, the money isn't traceable.

707
00:38:43,807 --> 00:38:45,246
Even if you spent all the money,

708
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:47,087
there can't be no trace of it.

709
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:52,047
Moreover,
your attitude is obviously not right.

710
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,407
Who would ever think
they've lived long enough?

711
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:58,327
Lastly, according to our analysis,

712
00:38:58,486 --> 00:38:59,726
there have been some problems

713
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,686
within your organization
since the case of Hu Dewang.

714
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,607
To put it bluntly,
your goals are not on the same page.

715
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:06,807
Otherwise, there wouldn't have been

716
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:07,766
that hilarious scene in court.

717
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:14,807
Qian Tianxin,
do you really not expect your punishment

718
00:39:14,966 --> 00:39:16,127
to be more lenient?

719
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:22,766
Prosecutor An Ni, I'm already a prisoner.

720
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:28,607
You are a very experienced veteran.

721
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:30,726
You know that the illegal gains

722
00:39:30,766 --> 00:39:32,006
are not easily recovered.

723
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:35,286
You're sure that with
all the money split up

724
00:39:35,327 --> 00:39:37,526
and diverted to overseas accounts,

725
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:41,647
there's nothing we can do about you and
the experts behind you, right?

726
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:51,006
Qian Tianxin, this is your last chance.

727
00:39:51,327 --> 00:39:53,327
If you refuse to tell us
the whereabouts of the money,

728
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:55,407
it is not a guilty plea

729
00:39:56,206 --> 00:39:58,006
and it will affect your sentence.

730
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:01,647
I've said it all, and now

731
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:03,567
you're still not willing

732
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:05,006
to tell us the whereabouts of the money?

733
00:40:07,999 --> 00:40:10,912
(Year 2000, Guangdong)

734
00:40:25,327 --> 00:40:25,966
Who are you?

735
00:40:26,567 --> 00:40:27,407
What do you want?

736
00:40:27,486 --> 00:40:28,127
Get out!

737
00:40:28,607 --> 00:40:29,286
Get out!

738
00:40:31,526 --> 00:40:32,647
What are you shouting for?

739
00:40:33,686 --> 00:40:35,127
You've had so many boyfriends,

740
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,887
so why can't I sleep with you?

741
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:39,407
Help!

742
00:40:40,446 --> 00:40:41,006
Help!

743
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:42,607
Let go of me!

744
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:43,526
Stop it!

745
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:44,407
Stop it!

746
00:40:45,087 --> 00:40:45,766
Stop it!

747
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:46,407
Stop it!

748
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:48,686
Ling.

749
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:49,486
Don't come any closer!

750
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,246
Listen, I've called for someone.

751
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:52,486
Who are you trying to scare?

752
00:40:53,486 --> 00:40:55,206
Who would be out at this time of night?

753
00:40:55,966 --> 00:40:57,766
People around here have seen this a lot.

754
00:41:00,006 --> 00:41:00,486
Ling.

755
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:02,246
Ling!

756
00:41:02,686 --> 00:41:03,847
Stop shouting. Get out!

757
00:41:08,607 --> 00:41:09,407
Help!

758
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:10,726
Ling!

759
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:11,847
Open the door!

760
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:16,167
Ling!

761
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:17,206
Ling!

762
00:41:18,486 --> 00:41:19,407
Open the door!

763
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:21,567
Help!

764
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:23,807
Help!

765
00:41:24,327 --> 00:41:25,327
Help!

766
00:41:25,847 --> 00:41:27,206
Help!

767
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:29,206
Help!

768
00:41:29,607 --> 00:41:30,526
Anyone home?

769
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:31,686
Help!

770
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:34,887
Anyone home?

771
00:41:35,446 --> 00:41:37,127
Anyone home? Help!

772
00:41:39,446 --> 00:41:40,526
Help!

773
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,407
Anyone home?

774
00:41:42,567 --> 00:41:43,647
Help!

775
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:17,206
I'm sorry.

776
00:42:18,486 --> 00:42:20,286
I'm sorry.

777
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:26,047
There's no hope for me.

778
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:29,367
You are different.

779
00:42:32,966 --> 00:42:34,966
If I hadn't gotten drunk,

780
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,407
if I hadn't dressed up so attractively,

781
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:42,486
I wouldn't have been
targeted by the bad guy,

782
00:42:45,526 --> 00:42:47,766
and you wouldn't be in this state.

783
00:42:55,887 --> 00:42:58,047
Everything is destined to be.
