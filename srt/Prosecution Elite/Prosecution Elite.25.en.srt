Answer this question.

16
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:43,680
If one day,

17
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,479
it's either me or him,

18
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,000
(who will you pick?)

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,640
A.

20
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,640
(Zhao Jikai)
We funded their popularity

21
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,199
(Zhao Jikai)
with our money and flows.

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,599
To implement a safer and efficient system,

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,119
we research, develop, and upgrade.

24
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,040
They cost money.

25
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,360
Of course,

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,959
Huibo is already the forerunner of its peers

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,199
but if this carries on,

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,839
we won't be able to have the monopoly

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,919
and our company might implode.

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,199
Zhao Jikai.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
I agree with the chairman.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Since we have decided

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,800
to focus on our streaming platform,

34
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,039
we should continue to pursue this direction.

35
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:48,360
Like what the chairman said,

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,520
once we become the best,

37
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,919
more investment will come.

38
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,240
The gaming division will fully support Mr. Xiao.

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,720
I have what I have now

40
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,080
because I follow the law of two.

41
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,080
To nurture a company,

42
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,959
you need two things.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Proactivity

44
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,199
and exclusivity.

45
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,199
Due to the advent of the Internet,

46
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:25,240
we all don't have any secrets left.

47
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,000
And we have to overtake

48
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,679
and act fast.

49
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:32,479
I believe

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,280
we should double down.

51
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:35,800
Luo,

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,720
what do you think?

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,039
Chairman Yin,

54
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,000
when it comes to commercial mechanism,
business model

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,479
and business value,

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,919
anyone here has more experience than me.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,160
I can only share my perspective

58
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,880
from PR's side.

59
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,360
Mr. Xiao mentioned

60
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,720
that marketing spent a lot of money.

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,919
It is true.

62
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:10,080
I believe we should allocate more resources

63
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,240
on what makes this brand successful.

64
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,039
We should use our resources efficiently.

65
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,040
However, I do not have a concrete plan

66
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
to operate it

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,959
so perhaps we can all toss some ideas around.

68
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,440
Xiao Mu'en.

69
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,679
You're an expert in the live streaming.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,519
What do you think?

71
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,399
Chairman Yin.

72
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,280
I suggest

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,480
we combine gaming and streaming

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,679
to increase the number of streamers.

75
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,559
On one hand,

76
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,320
we can market our new products.

77
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,399
On the other hand,

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,760
we can diversify.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,959
We are using our own platform to promote

80
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,079
our own games.

81
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,480
It can never go wrong.

82
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
In addition,

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,600
I was inspired

84
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,720
by Qian Tianxin's case.

85
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,320
We can hire Zhang Xiaobei

86
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,959
to be a game streamer.

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
We will pay him

88
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,799
to be one of our ambassadors

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,839
to promote our brand.

90
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:16,880
It won't be expensive.

91
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:21,160
We can use his current popularity

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
and topics the media interested in

93
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,320
to garner good press and popularity.

94
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,440
It will attract investors.

95
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,639
Okay.

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,519
I like that idea.

97
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,839
Let's do that.

98
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:36,880
Luo.

99
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,200
You will be in charge of it.

100
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:40,920
All right?

101
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,079
Because you were Zhang Wanru's mentor.

102
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,559
Zhang Xiaobei is more likely to trust you.

103
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,040
Do you agree?

104
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,600
Okay.

105
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,940

107

to delete this message? Delete)

108
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,720
(You don't need to know who I am.)

109

(I don't own this phone)

110
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,160
(and I'm using a vendor's phone.)

111
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,799
(Also, she gave me your number.)

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
(She wants me to tell you)

113
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
(that she is well and happy.)

114
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,600
(She wants you to take care of yourself.)

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,519
(She isn't available)

116
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:50,079
(so the game is not fun.)

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
(Don't play your card haphazardly.)

118
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,280
(A only plays his trump card
in the last round.)

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,760
(She likes this card and she hopes you like it too.)

120
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:05,040
Mr. Zhao?

121
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,399
Are you going down?

122
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,280
Sorry.

123
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,920
Kai.

124
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,399
What's so urgent

125
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:18,839
that you have to see me now?

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Are we safe here?

127
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,559
We're screwed.

128
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,359
Many are busted.

129
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,760
But don't worry,

130
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,280
she won't snitch on us.

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,920
I see.

132
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,679
What do you want me to do?

133
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,040
Continue.

134
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,839
Don't stop.

135
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,679
We make it messy.

136
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,359
Okay.

137
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:50,519
Understood.

138
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,679
Prosecutor An came to pick me up.

139
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,480
What's the occasion?

140
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,519
Oh, come on.

141
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:12,239
Where's Zhao Jikai?

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,200
He didn't come out with you?

143
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:14,359
He will let me have you?

144
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,799
Please. I don't hang out with him 24/7.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,079
Besides, I won't let him stop me.

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,959
True.

147
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,239
You won't.

148
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,839
We're way too close anyway.

149
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,639
Where is Xiaojiao? Did you call her?

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,320
She's waiting in the restaurant.

151
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,359
She is always willing to have dinner with us.

152
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,759
Some algae?

153
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,879
I want this.

154
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,199
What's that?

155
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:39,040
Chicken gizzard.

156
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,959
I need to use the toilet.

157
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
You barely ate!

158
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,079
I can't bear her.

159
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,800
Yitang, can I ask you something?

160
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,800
Do you know Attorney Jin?

161
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,600
The one who defended

162
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,280
Hu Dewang in Qian Tianxin's trial.

163
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,079
I do.

164
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,519
You know him?

165
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,120
He's very famous.

166
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:03,480
Oh.

167
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,560
But he doesn't know me.

168
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,040
I thought you two knew each other.

169
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,399
No.

170
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,480
I deal with corporate laws

171
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,199
while he deals with criminal laws.

172
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,999
I haven't worked
as a lawyer for a while now

173
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,759
but his name is everywhere.

174
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:19,720
Why?

175
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,199
You need his service?

176
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,079
Oh, nothing.

177
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,399
I just want to ask him something.

178
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,280
It's okay.

179
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:27,959
Forget about work.

180
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:29,999
Try this.

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,240
It's cooked.

182
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:31,879
Okay.

183
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,639
It's hot.

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:32,959
Okay.

185
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,759
Mr. Hu Dewang.

186
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,199
Hi.

187
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,959
Your spouse hired me to be your lawyer.

188
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,759
Let's talk about your situation.

189
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,820
(Zhang Xiaobei jumped into the river
and took his own life while live-streaming.)

190
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,400
(This behavior was suspected
of disrupting public order,)

191
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,990
(causing a negative social impact.)

192
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,170
(He was released after administrative detention
by the Public Security Organs for five days)

193
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,360
(in accordance with Article 25, Item 1)

194
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,140
(of the People's Republic of China
PSA Punishment Law.)

195
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,319
(Huiquan is a technology company)

196
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,399
(and we take cybercrime very seriously.)

197
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,199
(We try to learn how these criminals)

198
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,560
(abused the Internet)

199
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,399
(so that we can take)

200
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,879
(necessary preventative measures.)

201
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,920
(This event has taught us)

202
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:36,879
(the importance of a stronger firewall)

203
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,480
(in our products.)

204
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
(We are all common citizens.)

205
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,959
(We do not condone)

206
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,839
Xiaobei.

207
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,280
It's me, An Ni.

208
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:50,319
(what Qian Tianxin has done.)

209
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,399
(We support the judgment
delivered by the court.)

210
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:56,879
An Ni.

211
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,439
Why are you here?

212
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,439
(What do you think)

213
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,560
(of Zhang Xiaobei's decision to testify
against Qian Tianxin?)

214
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,040
Are you going to invite me inside?

215
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,199
Come in.

216
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,240
(Regarding Zhang Xiaobei, we...)

217
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,680
Have a seat.

218
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,480
(We would like)

219
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
(to reaffirm our stand on...)

220
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,280
Not bad.

221
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,959
I thought it would be messy here.

222
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,360
I can tolerate this.

223
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,600
You were very emotional that day.

224
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
I should have come to you after the trial

225
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,600
but I was caught up in my work.

226
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:36,839
How do you feel?

227
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,600
I'm fine.

228
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,360
I know you're busy.

229
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,759
I'm doing fine.

230
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,240
Good.

231
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,639
Take this.

232
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,199
I know you won't accept cash from me.

233
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,439
And if I buy you food,

234
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,959
you will just let them rot.

235
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,360
This is a grocery prepaid card
from the supermarket downstairs.

236
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,639
Buy what you need.

237
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,439
Come.

238
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,040
I can't accept this.

239
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,120
Why? I'm not your friend now?

240
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,920
No, I...

241
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,839
Will you take it if I say it's a gift
from your sister?

242
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,680
You will gladly take it, won't you?

243
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,800
I can never be like your older sister

244
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:29,240
but I want to help her look after you.

245
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,240
Take it.

246
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,680
For my sake.

247
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,639
Thanks.

248
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,360
What's your next plan?

249
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,920
I don't know.

250
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,439
But I won't do anything stupid again.

251
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,040
I won't let Dad or Wanru down.

252
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,720
You have become wiser.

253
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,439
Take your time to find

254
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,920
what you want to do.

255
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,120
Come to me if you need help.

256
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,480
You can trust He Luyuan and me.

257
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,680
Just don't do anything reckless.

258
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,360
The law will help you solve problems.

259
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,480
The officer has lectured me about that.

260
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,600
Luo Xiaoting.

261
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,480
Do you remember her?

262
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,720
She is a kind woman

263
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,519
with a good moral compass.

264
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,759
You should befriend her.

265
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,439
Don't stay indoors all the time.

266
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,839
Go out.

267
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,079
I know she is a kind woman.

268
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,639
Or I wouldn't have talked to her

269
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
before I streamed my suicide.

270
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,680
But I want to keep a distance from my past.

271
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,879
When they come to me, it's trouble.

272
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
I can tell that Xiaoting

273
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,480
didn't come to you because of that.

274
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,480
She is the daughter of my mentor.

275
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,199
If you can hang out with her more,

276
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,560
it'll put my mind to rest.

277
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:15,079
Okay.

278
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,519
All right.

279
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,920
Let me tidy this place up.

280
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:20,600
No need.

281
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,879
It's okay.

282
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,839
I was planning to cook for you

283
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,160
but I agreed to meet a friend

284
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,079
so I'll leave
after I tidy this place up.

285
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:28,879
I can do it.

286
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,920
Come to my place to have dinner someday.

287
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,160
My parents would love to meet new people.

288
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,879
Have you eaten?

289
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:38,680
Yes.

290
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:39,680
Okay.

291
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,120
I've read some of the comments.

292
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,199
Many of you asked what I think of Jiangcheng

293
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,439
since I have worked as a journalist and an editor.

294
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,439
Well, I think this is a rather unfriendly city.

295
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,839
No one smiles.

296
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,399
People are cold.

297
00:14:59,399 --> 00:14:59,839
All right.

298
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,560
That's all for today's stream.

299
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,160
I'll talk to you once I get back.

300
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:03,959
See you.

301
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,560
I'm so done with the haters.

302
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,399
You say the same thing all the time.

303
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,199
Stop echoing others.

304
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,439
Is it that hard to acknowledge
that I'm better than you?

305
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,600
This is my opinion.
I have the right to express it.

306
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,319
Bye.

307
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,759
Stupid haters.

308
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,360
They ruin my day, those jerks.

309
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,560
Useless jerks.

310
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:37,280
Hi.

311
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,120
Don't move.

312
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,999
Stay.

313
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,639
Relax.

314
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,199
I'm here for a chit-chat.

315
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,040
Who are you?

316
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,120
Why are you in my car?

317
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,560
Do you know who I am?

318
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,280
You're Bian Qiuqiu,

319
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,079
an influencer.

320
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,959
You have 2.5 million followers

321
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,079
and you fancy yourself a critique.

322
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,680
You claim that you're bold enough

323
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,720
to speak the truth.

324
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,759
You are frank. I give you that.

325
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,079
I watched all your videos last night.

326
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,160
You called out celebrities

327
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,240
and criticized big corporations.

328
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,120
I must say you are definitely sharp-tongued.

329
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,319
That's why I'm here.

330
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:34,439
Xiaoting.

331
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:36,720
Can I speak with you?

332
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,720
I know you care a lot about Zhang Xiaobei.

333
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,759
My company would like to offer him

334
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,959
something so I went to see him.

335
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,839
You're his age so maybe you can reach him.

336
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,800
Tell him to seize the opportunity.

337
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Dad.

338
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:57,839
I already don't like your decision
to work for Huiquan.

339
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,480
Why would I ask him
to work for Huiquan too?

340
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:01,480
Don't worry.

341
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,959
Even if I get into trouble,

342
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,960
he will be safe.

343
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,320
Let me explain.

344
00:17:08,879 --> 00:17:11,239
You see, this could be an opportunity.

345
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,879
Dad.

346
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:15,920
Wanru.

347
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,759
An Ni came to visit me yesterday.

348
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,560
She brought me something.

349
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,999
I'm doing fine now,

350
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:23,879
so don't worry about me.

351
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,160
Hello.

352
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,719
You can't just barge in.

353
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,440
You just touched me.

354
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,200
Who's ruder?

355
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:42,800
Fine.

356
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,560
What do you want?

357
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,440
Zhang Xiaobei.

358
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,840
You asked me to help you

359
00:17:49,879 --> 00:17:50,920
when you were trying

360
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,719
to take your own life.

361
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,599
Now that you don't need me,

362
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:55,440
you throw me away?

363
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:57,320
All right.

364
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,040
Tell me.

365
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,200
What do you want?

366
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,560
Stop pestering me to work for Huiquan.

367
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,639
Zhang Xiaobei.

368
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,719
Are we friends?

369
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:09,399
You can say so.

370
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,200
Why?

371
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:11,280
It's important.

372
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,920
If you think I'm not your friend,

373
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,800
I don't know why I brought myself here.

374
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,719
If I'm your friend,

375
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,160
I will help you.

376
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,080
An Ni told me that you're different.

377
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,280
How so?

378
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,239
Everyone is concerned about you.

379
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,359
I know.

380
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,479
You're reading too much into this.

381
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,680
I am not affiliated with Huiquan.

382
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,239
I even criticized Huiquan

383
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
in my works.

384
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:40,999
You know

385
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,399
my dad works

386
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,519
as a PR consultant in Huiquan.

387
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,440
And we argue often because of that.

388
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,359
So why are you asking me

389
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,999
to work for Huiquan?

390
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
Did I cross you?

391
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,200
I told you that I want to leave

392
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:56,560
everything behind.

393
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:57,479
Why won't anyone let me?

394
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,800
No one is stopping you.

395
00:18:58,879 --> 00:18:59,920
We just think that...

396
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:07,440
Just pretend that others

397
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,639
are like An Ni or me.

398
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,320
We want you to start living again.

399
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,479
You are talented.

400
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,519
You are smart,

401
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:19,280
eloquent,

402
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,759
and good at video games.

403
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
Use your talent

404
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,920
to earn respect for yourself.

405
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,280
Isn't that what you should do?

406
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,359
I know Huiquan is a touchy subject.

407
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,479
Even if you won't believe me,

408
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,879
will you doubt An Ni too?

409
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,440
The PSB and the procuratorate

410
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,280
have vouched for Huiquan.

411
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,759
Why do you hold prejudice still
against them?

412
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:49,040
To be frank,

413
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,399
I let my emotion get the better of me.

414
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,479
I pinned Xiaohu's death on Huiquan.

415
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,719
I thought they caused his death.

416
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,999
I have watched Yin Huiquan's interview.

417
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,080
And that day,

418
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,479
he led his employees

419
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:04,320
to attend Qian Tianxin's trial.

420
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,280
He treated me with kindness

421
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,160
and apologized to me.

422
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,080
He started a fund

423
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:11,800
and conducted an internal review.

424
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,999
He also gave Madam Zhan

425
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,479
Xiaohu's game account.

426
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:18,040
I think their gesture is sincere enough.

427
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,800
See? You can face your own shortcomings.

428
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,639
It's nothing.

429
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,519
I have been doing a lot of thinking lately.

430
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,519
Right or wrong,

431
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,320
you cannot escape from your responsibility.

432
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,840
I took Xiaohu's death badly

433
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:36,519
so I have to face the consequences.

434
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,639
You just owned up to your mistake.

435
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,999
What can Huiquan do to you?

436
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,639
Right?

437
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
In its simplest form,

438
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,560
Huibo just wants

439
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,320
to work with a talented streamer.

440
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,479
And you're one.

441
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:01,359
I said that many times

442
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,599
because I want you

443
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,239
to live properly.

444
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,599
I don't care if you'll work

445
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,479
for Huiquan or other companies.

446
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,599
It doesn't matter.

447
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,200
If you like the job, you stay.

448
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,639
If you don't like it, you leave.

449
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,599
I'll support you.

450
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:18,960
Look.

451
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,639
I can play games

452
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,119
but I know nothing about streaming.

453
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,119
Gaming live? That's uncharted territory.

454
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,960
What if I did poorly?

455
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,879
How hard is it?

456
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:29,359
You streamed your suicide.

457
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,479
I was joking.

458
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,519
We have faith in you.

459
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,519
Me and An Ni.

460
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:45,719
I know I said I only trust An Ni

461
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,200
but in fact, I trust you too.

462
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:53,800
Good.

463
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,639
Thanks.

464
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,560
My bowl is full now.

465
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,719
Oh.

466
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,399
How's your arm injury?

467
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,519
I've been meaning to ask.

468
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,200
Couldn't be better.

469
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:13,040
The stitches are already removed.

470
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,840
Or I wouldn't be having hot pot here.

471
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,320
Right.

472
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,440
An Ni.

473
00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:30,320
Can I tell you something?

474
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,519
My company wants to work with Zhang Xiaobei.

475
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,800
We hope that he can become
a video game streamer.

476
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,280
As in he'll play our games
live on stream

477
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:44,080
and promote them.

478
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,160
You see.

479
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,759
I know he is free now.

480
00:22:48,879 --> 00:22:51,719
If he wants to turn his hobby into a job,

481
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:54,599
e-sports is his best option.

482
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,479
It's the future trend

483
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,200
and the current generation loves it.

484
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,320
Of course,

485
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,639
people still have prejudices

486
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:05,999
against gaming in general.

487
00:23:06,639 --> 00:23:08,119
They think

488
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,999
video games

489
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,080
are like drugs or worse.

490
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,800
But we can turn this around.

491
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,639
What do you think?

492
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,399
I like the idea.

493
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,879
You don't have to explain
everything to me.

494
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,080
I think it's a great idea.

495
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
The National Bureau of Statistics

496
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:35,080
now recognizes e-sports.

497
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,960
If you win any international competition,

498
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:37,920
you'll make the country proud.

499
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,119
If the video game itself is legit

500
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,519
and regulated,

501
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:46,200
it can train the players' mentality.

502
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:49,440
Some games even have group battles,

503
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:52,399
so they teach you teamwork.

504
00:23:53,479 --> 00:23:54,999
Given Zhang Xiaobei's situation,

505
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:01,080
I think your offer might just

506
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,080
save him.

507
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:04,759
I like your analysis.

508
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,440
Impressive.

509
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,080
You know a lot about e-sports.

510
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,280
Don't you mock me.

511
00:24:09,399 --> 00:24:10,840
I have to study it because it's my job.

512
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,200
New cases appear as our society evolves.

513
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,359
It is my job to be curious,

514
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:17,119
to stay abreast.

515
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,800
And I was so worried

516
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,800
that you would frown at the mention

517
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,479
of games or Huiquan.

518
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,719
Now this is a prejudice.

519
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,800
I am fine with Huiquan and their games.

520
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,280
On the contrary,

521
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,719
as long as the games are educational,

522
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,040
that they do not intend to harm their players,

523
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,759
I quite welcome
this new mode of entertainment.

524
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,639
Either way,

525
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,879
I will support Zhang Xiaobei's decision.

526
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,160
I see.

527
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,560
I know what to do now.

528
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,040
Don't worry.

529
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,479
Oh.

530
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,320
Don't tell Zhang Xiaobei that I know.

531
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,399
Why?

532
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,239
Because he wants me to know,

533
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,359
he'll tell me.

534
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:02,800
Okay.

535
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,280
(Football, basketball, financial betting, tennis)
This will decide my comeback.

536
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:31,040
Darling?

537
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,359
Xiaojiao, I...

538
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:52,840
Darling?

539
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,599
Xiaojiao, are you all right?

540
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,399
Xiaojiao?

541
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:57,840
Don't touch me.

542
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,320
Leave.

543
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,599
Go away!

544
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,440
Blood.

545
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,200
Xiaojiao,

546
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:06,719
I'll take you to the hospital.

547
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:08,440
Come.

548
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,719
I'll take you to the hospital.

549
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,920
Don't worry.

550
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,999
The baby is fine.

551
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,080
I gave her some medicine.

552
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,639
She needs to rest now.

553
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,719
Do not upset her

554
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,479
or the baby will be in danger.

555
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,280
Okay.

556
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,759
I'm glad she's fine.

557
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,719
Darling, I'm here.

558
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,440
Let me know what you want.

559
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,840
Leave.

560
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:32,960
Huh?

561
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,359
Leave.

562
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:36,560
I want you to leave.

563
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:38,999
Don't show your face here.

564
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,560
I don't want to see you.

565
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,879
What did I just say?

566
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,999
Do not upset her.

567
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,960
Please leave this ward
until she calms down.

568
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:48,599
Okay.

569
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:50,239
Xiaojiao.

570
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,119
I'll buy you some food.

571
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,759
Doctor.

572
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,800
Yes?

573
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,080
I want to abort this baby.

574
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,759
Calm down.

575
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,399
Do you know what you just said?

576
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,599
Yes.

577
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,359
I want to have an abortion.

578
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,920
You're nearly six-month pregnant.

579
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,840
An abortion at this stage

580
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:27,840
is very dangerous.

581
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,599
I have made up my mind.

582
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,560
A labor induction now is too risky.

583
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,239
I will need your family's consent too

584
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,759
before I can operate on you.

585
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,840
Think it through and give me your confirmation.

586
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,239
Hello?

587
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,200
An Ni.

588
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,560
Can you come to the hospital?

589
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,800
Professor Luo.

590
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,519
You managed to convince Zhang Xiaobei. Well done.

591
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:39,920
Have you shown him the contract?

592
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,440
Yes, sir.

593
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,440
The legal department has run it through.

594
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,879
To show our sincerity,

595
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:54,560
we signed it before we gave it to him.

596
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:58,960
We just need his signature now.

597
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:06,800
Your work always reassures me.

598
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:12,320
Unlike someone I know who always looks lost

599
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,639
and who never reports to me

600
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,639
even though he leaves to find investors.

601
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,719
Humph.

602
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:23,639
Don't screw up your part now.

603
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,399
Noted.

604
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,440
Also,

605
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,879
I gave Zhang Xiaobei the game
we plan to launch soon.

606
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,759
I asked him to give it a try in private

607
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,479
and I took the liberty
to contact several media agencies

608
00:29:43,879 --> 00:29:46,879
so that they could promote our visibility.

609
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,999
Yes, we have to be relentless.

610
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,599
Mu'en and you should also organize some

611
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:58,080
collab streams with the government.

612
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,800
Even a short interview will do.

613
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:05,719
Solving the local taxation issues

614
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,080
will help the government and us.

615
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,639
You will have to communicate

616
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,080
with the government in this regard.

617
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,200
Hi, may I know Wang Xiaojiao's ward?

618
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,080
Ward 3.

619
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,599
Thanks.

620
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,040
You must be her kin.

621
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:33,800
I need your signature.

622
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,080
No, I'm her friend.

623
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,840
What is this for?

624
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:36,999
Her friend cannot sign this.

625
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
We need her relatives.

626
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,160
She wants to abort her child,

627
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,399
so please notify her family.

628
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,359
Bring the necessary documents too.

629
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:43,800
She's getting an abortion?

630
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,840
Okay. Thanks.

631
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:55,200
An Ni.

632
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,639
I'm at the hospital.

633
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,719
I'm here. Wait.

634
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:05,119
You did it again, didn't you?

635
00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:06,280
Huh?

636
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:07,800
Come here.

637
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,999
Why did you gamble again?

638
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,840
Yonggang, what happened?

639
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,560
Xiaojiao trusted you.

640
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:16,800
You said you would quit gambling

641
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,719
and we trusted you.

642
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:19,800
Is it fun to betray us now?

643
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,599
I have been under a lot of stress.

644
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:24,800
Excuses!

645
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,800
A gambler always finds an excuse to wager.

646
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
You can't quit
because you don't love yourself.

647
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:32,160
If you cherish what you have now,

648
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,080
will you gamble it away?

649
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:36,280
Why? You want to wait
till you lose everything?

650
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,399
In my line of work,

651
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,960
I have seen many scammers.

652
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,519
They exploit your weakness

653
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,599
and milk you till you're all dry.

654
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,119
Yonggang.

655
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,359
I have told you many times, haven't I?

656
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,840
When will you learn your lesson?

657
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,399
When will you stop gambling?

658
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,519
Tell me.

659
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,359
When was the last time you cared
about Xiaojiao?

660
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,040
Do you know

661
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,639
she's getting an abortion?

662
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,080
What?

663
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,759
She told you that?

664
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,479
Xiaojiao...

665
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,759
I'll talk to him later.

666
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:29,960
Hey.

667
00:32:29,999 --> 00:32:30,639
Calm down.

668
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:37,639
Bei.

669
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:39,359
This game is awesome.

670
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,639
It's fun and interactive too.

671
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:49,840
Bei.

672
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:51,999
Don't top up.

673
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,040
Stop it.

674
00:32:53,719 --> 00:32:55,960
Don't worry. I won't repeat
my past mistake.

675
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,320
Huiquan is sponsoring me.

676
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,680
I'm in the late game now

677
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,840
and it's getting difficult.

678
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,200
This new game comes

679
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,599
with a lot of security measures.

680
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,639
Bei.

681
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,200
When will you be done?

682
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,840
I'm kind of...

683
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:13,359
Hungry?

684
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,680
Go get something to eat then.

685
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,719
I still need some time.

686
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,680
Come.

687
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:19,599
Let's go.

688
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,399
It's just a game.

689
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,160
It's my job now.

690
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,440
I'll be a streamer soon
so I have to be professional.

691
00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:25,840
I need to be good at this game.

692
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,200
What's the point of tuning into my stream

693
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,239
if the audience can't learn anything?

694
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:29,960
Right?

695
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:30,879
Okay.

696
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:32,800
I'll get you some food.

697
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,359
Thanks.

698
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:33,960
Go.

699
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,759
Attack.

700
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:39,519
Hurry!

701
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,560
Mr. Xiao.

702
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,399
Fire me.

703
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,759
Or hit me.

704
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,080
I'm not your father.

705
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,999
It's not my job to educate you.

706
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,679
Whether you gamble or take drugs,

707
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,600
it's your decision.

708
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,640
You're an adult,

709
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,880
so you have to face the consequences.

710
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,239
Performance wise,

711
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,959
everyone knows

712
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,840
that you do your job well.

713
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
As long as you do not violate
the company regulations,

714
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,280
I will not fire you.

715
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,919
Yonggang.

716
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,759
I merely feel sorry for you.

717
00:34:50,959 --> 00:34:52,239
You have a wonderful wife,

718
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,679
a wonderful family.

719
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,800
You should have cherished them.

720
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,120
Mr. Xiao.

721
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,679
I am too ashamed to work for you.

722
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,880
You have helped me so many times.

723
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,040
Mr. Xiao.

724
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,280
You lied to everyone in the office for me.

725
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,199
I am so ashamed of myself.

726
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,239
An Ni and I will talk to Xiaojiao.

727
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
You decide

728
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,239
what you want to do next.

729
00:35:30,439 --> 00:35:31,280
I failed you, Mr. Xiao.

730
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:33,719
I failed An Ni.

731
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,080
I failed Xiaojiao.

732
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:39,400
I failed my child.

733
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,360
Xiaojiao is six-month pregnant now,

734
00:35:46,759 --> 00:35:48,759
but she wants to get an abortion.

735
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Mr. Xiao.

736
00:35:54,759 --> 00:35:56,360
Can you do me a favor?

737
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,199
Go ahead.

738
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,040
If you won't fire me,

739
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,519
can you send my wage

740
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:11,400
to Xiaojiao's bank account then?

741
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,679
Take away my credit cards and my IC.

742
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,999
I'm scared of falling
for the temptation.

743
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,840
I don't want to be like this again.

744
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,959
Look carefully now.

745
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:34,159
Zhang Wanru.

746
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,020
(Jiangqiu Cultural Media)

747
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,239
She is our target this time.

748
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,439
I might be too harsh here

749
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,719
because she was my ex-classmate.

750
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:46,800
However, she's dead now.

751
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,800
So we're targeting someone
who's already dead?

752
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:52,239
Our client sure holds grudges.

753
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Perhaps they were enemies?

754
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,479
Don't ask questions.

755
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,800
It's our rule.

756
00:36:57,959 --> 00:36:59,400
Curiosity kills the cat.

757
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,999
Right.

758
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,959
Zhang Wanru has a younger brother, Zhang Xiaobei.

759
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,640
He's on the news lately.

760
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,320
It's not really our fault

761
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,360
that her younger brother

762
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,519
proves to be quite the troublemaker.

763
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,239
His name is everywhere

764
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,560
these past few months.

765
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:23,919
We will use this to attack him.

766
00:37:24,919 --> 00:37:26,360
But how?

767
00:37:27,439 --> 00:37:30,280
How do we change the public perception

768
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,400
of someone who doesn't have any dirt

769
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,640
on him?

770
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,519
We can either talk about his character

771
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:43,320
or his background.

772
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,600
Netizens don't know
and will not spend the effort

773
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,880
to cross-check the facts

774
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,800
so we can fabricate anything we want.

775
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,959
If that doesn't work,

776
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,560
we target his family.

777
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,239
Find out if his family

778
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,759
ever did something illegal.

779
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,239
Even if it's just a minor offense,

780
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:08,280
it is enough to ruin his reputation.

781
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
Zhang Wanru's younger brother

782
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,439
is embroiled in many controversies.

783
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,439
We now have the best material

784
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,959
to work with.

785
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,719
You're awake.

786
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,199
Go home.

787
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,320
Don't spend a night here.

788
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,600
I appreciate your company.

789
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,560
I'm fine, Bei.

790
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,239
Danan.

791
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,560
Why don't we work together?

792
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,800
We can be streamers

793
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
who coach other players.

794
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,800
More passive income.

795
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:57,519
Bei.

796
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,040
Yes?

797
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,840
Who keeps messaging you?

798
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,439
The girl again?

799
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:04,519
Impossible.

800
00:39:04,999 --> 00:39:06,080
Can you check my phone?

801
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
My hands are busy.

802
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,080
(Luo Xiaoting, where are you?)
Luo Xiaoting.

803
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,199
(Where are you?
Why aren't you replying to messages?)

804
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,600
She is asking why you won't reply to her.

805
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,479
Tell her I'm practicing in the cybercafe

806
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
and I'm busy.

807
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,060
(I'm gaming at an internet cafe.)

808
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:26,760
(Dear loan customer,)

809
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,540
(I can provide you with an exclusive
credit consumer loan of up to 200,000 yuan)

812
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,360
Bei.

813
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:32,759
Yeah?

814
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,239
What did you do?

815
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:34,919
What's the matter?

816
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,959
People are asking if you need loans.

817
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:40,860
(Specially designed
for students and young people)

818
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,060
(The annual interest rate
can be as low as 4.8%)

819
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:44,320
What?

820
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:46,479
I got this SIM card

821
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,560
by using my real identity
as Zhang Xiaobei.

822
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,600
How can this be?

823
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,620
(Invitation for a loan. A 31-day interest-free voucher has been sent to your account)

(Invitation for a loan. Your loan information

00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:00,919
Xiaobei.

826
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,080
(I have something to report)
Zhang Xiaobei.

827
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,439
(I'll call you at the Procuratorate. See you)

828
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:04,600
You're here.

829
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:07,080
I went to your place but I couldn't find you.

830
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,439
I knew I would find you
around the cybercafe.

831
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,439
How can I help?

832
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
You know how you'll start streaming soon?

833
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,880
I have a pre-debut idea

834
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,040
and I want to discuss with you.

835
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,560
Now that you mention it,

836
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:16,999
I'm quitting.

837
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,600
You're quitting?

838
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:19,800
What do you mean?

839
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,600
I mean it literally.

840
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:23,400
I won't play games by Huiquan

841
00:40:23,439 --> 00:40:25,080
and I won't be a streamer.

842
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,719
Kiss all those endorsements goodbye.

843
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:27,800
Zhang Xiaobei.

844
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,800
You can't just quit frivolously.

845
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,360
This is a serious business.

846
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,640
You're being irresponsible here.

847
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:33,400
Irrespon...

848
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,280
Never mind.

849
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,280
Think what you want of it.

850
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:37,640
Stop.

851
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,840
Let's settle this today.

852
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,999
Everyone is doing their best

853
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,360
to give you the best stage

854
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,640
so that your talent can shine.

855
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,719
Can you stop throwing a tantrum?

856
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,519
Luo Xiaoting.

857
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:49,519
I know you came to me
with good intentions

858
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:52,360
but you have no idea what Huiquan has done.

859
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,280
Or you wouldn't
have tried to persuade me back then.

860
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,159
As a friend,

861
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:57,439
my advice is that you
should get your father

862
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,800
out of Huiquan as soon as possible.

863
00:40:58,959 --> 00:40:59,919
Huiquan is shady.

864
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,759
My accusation was right.

865
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,999
You played their game for a few days.

866
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,759
How did this happen?

867
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,600
Is there a problem with Huiquan Games?

868
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,040
An Ni.

869
00:41:13,479 --> 00:41:14,120
Yes, I'll be there.

870
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,759
See you in the procuratorate.

871
00:41:18,439 --> 00:41:18,840
Xiaobei!

872
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:25,640
Hi, Mr. Wang

873
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,120
and everyone present here.

874
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,840
On behalf of Huiquan Corporation,

875
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,280
allow me to say a toast.

876
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:34,719
First and foremost,

877
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,120
thank you for coming.

878
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:40,600
I hope our charity streams

879
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:46,400
will deliver a satisfactory performance.

880
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,080
A toast to it.

881
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,080
Come.

882
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:50,919
Good.

883
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:52,940
(Daughter)

884
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,600
Secondly,

885
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:58,959
it's about an apology.

886
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,600
Mr. Xiao was supposed to be here,

887
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
but he is caught up in his work,

888
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,640
so he has to take a rain check today.

889
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:08,280
I will say an apologetic toast

890
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
on his behalf.

891
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,040
Mr. Wang.

892
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,439
Come.

893
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,660
(Daughter)

894
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,840
Mr. Luo.

895
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:17,840
You can answer the phone.

896
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,840
It has been buzzing non-stop.

897
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
It's fine.

898
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:25,759
Luo.

899
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:27,040
Just answer it.

900
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:28,840
What if it's an emergency?

901
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
Okay.

902
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,719
Pardon me.

903
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,159
I have to take this call.

904
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:34,560
You know what?

905
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,080
Once I'm back,
I'll chug three shots to apologize.

906
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,519
Please enjoy the meal.

907
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,120
Come.

908
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,199
A toast on behalf of Professor Luo.

909
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,360
(Dad, why didn't you pick up your phone?)

910
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,719
(Is there an issue within Huiquan Games?)

911
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
(Zhang Xiaobei quit all of a sudden.)
