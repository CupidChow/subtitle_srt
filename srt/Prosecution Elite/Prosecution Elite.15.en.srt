15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,201
They are all here?

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,080
Let me see.

17
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:04,400
What the...

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,320
I told you

19
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:10,960
not to hit her face.

20
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,001
Madam.

21
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:13,721
We didn't hit her.

22
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:16,641
She's already like this when she came.

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,001
It's an old bruise.

24
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,921
Her boyfriend did it, I bet.

25
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,121
What a shame.

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,921
All of you coming from country

27
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,361
keep saying

28
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:38,600
that I conned you into coming here.

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,641
I'll have you know

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,121
that I run a proper company.

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,921
You know how it is to run a company.

32
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,441
If you do well, we reward you.

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,481
If you do badly, we punish you.

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,921
Today,

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,001
we have a fresh batch

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,441
of cute girls.

37
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:03,121
They will keep you company.

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Take this as your reward.

39
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,520
All right.

40
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,600
They are here.

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,561
Pick whoever you fancy.

42
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:17,680
Move aside.

43
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
Who are you?

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Why are you here?

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
I fled here.

46
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,960
I used to be obsessed
with a female streamer.

47
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,281
I kept making donations to her

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,201
till I got myself into debt.

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,240
In the end,

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,520
I had to take out loans

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,921
to repay my debt and the cycle continued.

52
00:03:58,441 --> 00:03:59,760
I tried to jump into a river,

53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,040
but not because I wanted to die.

54
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,160
Because the female streamer
and I promised

55
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,001
to flee together.

56
00:04:06,921 --> 00:04:07,441
However,

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,160
we lost contacts.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,760
I don't know

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,121
how long I've been here.

60
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,281
But I found her
among many female streamers again,

61
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,601
in this place.

62
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:25,400
Zhang Xiaobei?

63
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,240
We are meant

64
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:35,761
to meet, aren't we?

65
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,800
It's fated.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,640
But I will not stay in the same place for long.

67
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,281
I will escape.

68
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,601
With you.

69
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,080
Mr. Raphael.

70
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,200
Forgive the sudden visitation.

71
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:55,200
To be frank,

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,561
from the moment we landed

73
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:59,561
till we checked into a hotel,

74
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,441
someone has been watching our moves.

75
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:05,480
Our hotel rooms are even bugged.

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,800
I think

77
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,080
they are getting desperate

78
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:12,080
and they want to strike preemptively.

79
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,321
I want to hear your input.

80
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:17,640
Prosecutor Guo?

81
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:18,640
Look.

82
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,680
Isn't that Prosecutor Guo?

83
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,601
That photo?

84
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,441
China was having a training program
with the prosecutors

85
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
from East Alliance.

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,721
I was the Prosecutor-General of Country F.

87
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:30,881
I took the photo with Prosecutor Guo

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,640
during the program.

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,080
He was one of the speakers

90
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,920
and he told us about the history

91
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,080
of Chinese judiciary system.

92
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,680
It inspired us.

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,121
I would even say

94
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,841
that he isn't just my mentor,

95
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,321
but also my confidant from China.

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,520
Prosecutor Guo told us the same.

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,680
He emphasized how close you two are.

98
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:55,721
Mr. Raphael, I'm sure you are aware

99
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,281
how serious we are

100
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,881
regarding this crackdown on cybercrime.

101
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,601
Unfortunately, we do not

102
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,881
have the necessary clearance

103
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,721
for our operation.

104
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,161
Prosecutor Guo told us

105
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,200
that we could trust you

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,480
and turn to you

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,680
if we needed help.

108
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,680
I am honored.

109
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,161
Personally,

110
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
I value the bond

111
00:06:21,161 --> 00:06:23,640
we have with China.

112
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:25,121
And I'd love

113
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,721
to help you to my best capacity.

114
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,001
At the moment,

115
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,520
the help I can provide

116
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,080
won't be substantial.

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
But...

118
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,080
I mean.

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Mr. Raphael.

120
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:42,400
They follow us as soon

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,601
as we left the plane.

122
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,360
And that's my concern.

123
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,721
Master,

124
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,240
aren't we supposed
to draw their attention?

125
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,400
Is it all right to walk in the public

126
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,321
like this?

127
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,601
The bigger the scene we make,

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,761
the safer An Ni will be.

129
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:19,800
Those motorcyclists

130
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,001
have been following us.

131
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:21,800
Not to mention

132
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,561
those two from the restaurant

133
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,960
to my left.

134
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,240
They came prepared.

135
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,721
Hop in.

136
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:33,601
Okay.

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,960
Mr. Raphael.

138
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,721
I understand that your hands are tied.

139
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,680
We're not here
to make your job difficult.

140
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:01,520
We just want your support

141
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,441
during our preliminary investigation.

142
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,920
I would love

143
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,441
to provide more support

144
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,281
but it's challenging.

145
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:14,680
Let me put it this way.

146
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,920
There are people

147
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,640
within the government who aren't

148
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,601
too thrilled
about this transnational operation.

149
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:24,080
They argue

150
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,920
that the current system

151
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,200
hasn't received any reports
regarding online casinos

152
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,441
or illegal adult websites.

153
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,840
The police have not

154
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,961
been notified at all.

155
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:37,521
That's because

156
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,521
the victims are all Chinese.

157
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,641
They aren't going

158
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,720
to call the police here.

159
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:44,680
Exactly.

160
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,840
That's what they said.

161
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,521
They are against

162
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,401
handling this case because it is
too challenging.

163
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:52,961
In addition,

164
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,920
it is not easy to establish a case

165
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,240
between two nations.

166
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,280
Identifying

167
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,121
the culprit will be tough.

168
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,920
Not to mention

169
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,720
you also need

170
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,001
the internet service providers
to cooperate.

171
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:07,961
It's almost implausible.

172
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Miss An Ni.

173
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,081
The suspect you mentioned

174
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:14,240
paid her taxes,

175
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,600
donated to charity,

176
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,121
and helped build the local infrastructure.

177
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
She has done many things
for local development.

178
00:09:24,201 --> 00:09:26,081
I want to help you

179
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:31,201
but please understand the situation I'm in.

180
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,201
Mr. Raphael.

181
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,121
To fight crimes,

182
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
everyone has to work together.

183
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,201
They...

184
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,920
I understand

185
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,881
the conflict of interest at hands

186
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,521
and I understand your concerns.

187
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,280
However, allow us

188
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,920
to show you some photos.

189
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
Why are we so hellbent

190
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,680
on dismantling the criminal syndicate?

191
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
The boy in the first photo

192
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:00,600
is Shi Xiaohu.

193
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:02,561
At his age,

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,720
he was supposed

195
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,401
to enjoy his wonderful university years.

196
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,761
But he killed himself

197
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:09,761
because of predatory online loans.

198
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:12,360
The boy in the second photo

199
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:14,081
is Zhang Xiaobei.

200
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:15,761
His sister lost her life

201
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:18,081
in a foreign operation
to arrest online fraudsters.

202
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,121
And he had to flee
because he fell victim

203
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:21,121
to online loans too.

204
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:22,720
He is currently missing.

205
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,081
These photos are kids

206
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:29,961
whose families are broken

207
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,081
because of this criminal syndicate

208
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,641
who plagues the society

209
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,920
like a parasite.

210
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,680
It uses people's life

211
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,840
to grow stronger.

212
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:39,360
Although they are happy now

213
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:40,680
thanks to the illusion of power

214
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,240
the success brought them,

215
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,800
sooner or later,

216
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,401
they will start

217
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,800
to kill someone.

218
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,680
Mr. Raphael.

219
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,280
Miss An Ni.

220
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,680
I am aware

221
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:56,201
of what's at stake.

222
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,401
We have the same problem here

223
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,201
and I know the urgency

224
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:04,680
of the matter.

225
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,480
However,

226
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,480
our judiciary system isn't as developed as yours.

227
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,081
Please understand

228
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,881
our shortcomings

229
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,401
and our huge stress.

230
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:27,680
Maybe

231
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:31,401
this is the last thing I can do for you.

232
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,800
I went through all documents

233
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,881
of our procuratorate

234
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,680
and asked around for anything relevant

235
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
for this case.

236
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:42,280
According to the mutual assistance
treaty we signed,

237
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:46,201
I have compiled a list

238
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:47,961
of relevant personnel.

239
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,480
Their contact numbers, identities,

240
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:51,561
and addresses are here.

241
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:52,881
Oh.

242
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:56,441
Please return this document

243
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:57,800
when you no longer need it.

244
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,800
If you wish to interrogate any of them,

245
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,401
you'll have to inform us first.

246
00:12:04,521 --> 00:12:06,001
We'll arrange the venue

247
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,360
and the date for you.

248
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:08,160
Noted.

249
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,040
Mr. Raphael,

250
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:12,600
I thank you on behalf

251
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,081
of the victims.

252
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,920
Mr. Raphael.

253
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:20,881
No need to walk us off.

254
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,561
Okay.

255
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,720
Miss An Ni.

256
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,680
Do stay safe.

257
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,961
Dangers lurk

258
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,600
in many areas here.

259
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:31,480
Besides,

260
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,001
you're not familiar

261
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,201
with this area.

262
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,160
Be vigilant.

263
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,321
Mr. Raphael.

264
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,600
Mr. Jose

265
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,280
told us the same thing
when he drove us to the hotel.

266
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:43,201
Jose?

267
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,480
He drove you?

268
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:46,840
Is there a problem,

269
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:47,800
Mr. Raphael?

270
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,121
No.

271
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,401
But I heard

272
00:12:51,401 --> 00:12:54,680
that Jose is a very stubborn person.

273
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,881
He crossed many people.

274
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,401
But

275
00:12:58,881 --> 00:13:00,081
I think

276
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,201
that is what you need
at the moment, isn't it?

277
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,521
You know what?

278
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,081
If you ever find yourself in an emergency,

279
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,081
you can call him.

280
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Noted,

281
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:11,561
Mr. Raphael.

282
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,961
Be safe.

283
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,641
Thanks, Mr. Raphael.

284
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:16,521
See you.

285
00:13:20,881 --> 00:13:21,280
Ni.

286
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,121
Raphael is such a nice guy.

287
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,121
Indeed.

288
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,240
We'll gain a lot

289
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,680
from the list.

290
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,240
Yes.

291
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,201
It makes things easier for us.

292
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,401
My bag!

293
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:35,240
Hurry.

294
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,040
Get a cab.

295
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,160
The list is in the cab.

296
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
The motorbike in front.

297
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,121
Follow it.

298
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,441
Follow the motorbike.

299
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:44,561
Hurry.

300
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,121
Go.

301
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:47,160
No.

302
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:48,881
Come out.

303
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:51,121
No.

304
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:51,920
Come out.

305
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:53,521
Come out.

306
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,600
Come out.

307
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:55,840
Come out.

308
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:56,480
Come out.

309
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:57,881
What is going on?

310
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:05,521
I don't think anyone here will help us.

311
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:07,961
But Ni,

312
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,521
the list is in the bag.

313
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,441
What do we do?

314
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
I took pictures of it already.

315
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,201
Don't worry.

316
00:14:13,081 --> 00:14:15,001
But if they have the list,

317
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:16,720
it will complicate many things.

318
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:20,280
Anything important in your bag?

319
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,201
No.

320
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:23,761
All right.

321
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:25,920
Let's head back.

322
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:32,680
Aww.

323
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,360
You're so mean.

324
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,121
Hmpf.

325
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,081
I won't talk to you anymore.

326
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,360
You're

327
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,720
so gutter-minded.

328
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,401
Come on.

329
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
You're making me blush.

330
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:53,321
I know another interesting website.

331
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:56,480
Come play with me before you sleep.

332
00:14:57,201 --> 00:14:57,881
No.

333
00:14:58,001 --> 00:14:59,201
It's very easy.

334
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:01,800
You can even win some money.

335
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,280
Please.

336
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,201
Please.

337
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:06,480
I know

338
00:15:07,121 --> 00:15:09,121
you're a kind person.

339
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,280
But I'm now next

340
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,321
to my mother in the hospital.

341
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,561
The doctor said

342
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,720
she needs to be operated on immediately.

343
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,081
I told her

344
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,040
that I'd marry anyone who could help her.

345
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,321
(Your avatar suggests
that you're a young girl.)

346
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,201
(Why are you asking everyone to gamble?)

347
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,081
(Wang: I miss you. What are you doing?)
(It's not a good thing.)

348
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:33,561
(Wang: I miss you. What are you doing?)

349
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,600
(It's an addiction.)

350
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
(Listen to me.)

351
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:36,840
(Don't do this.)

352
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:38,001
(You can do better.)

353
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,401
Sir.

354
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
What?

355
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,480
Toilet break, please.

356
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,001
Just enter the casino interface...

357
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,040
Excuses.

358
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,441
How many toilet breaks have you had?

359
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,840
Are you done with your work

360
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:00,360
or do you want a beating?

361
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,040
I'll beat you up.

362
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,480
Pick it up.

363
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,140
(Namelist)

364
00:16:22,001 --> 00:16:22,800
What are you staring at?

365
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:24,201
Go back to work.

366
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,001
Back to work.

367
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,521
Blood.

368
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,401
Blood!

369
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:03,001
Sir.

370
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:03,600
Blood.

371
00:17:04,001 --> 00:17:04,600
Disgusting.

372
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,200
Guys,

373
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,320
take him away.

374
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,121
Okay.

375
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,001
Get up.

376
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:12,681
Move aside.

377
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,401
Stop gawking.

378
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:15,281
Work!

379
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:25,001
Stay here.

380
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,681
The doctor will be here.

381
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:27,480
Once you're treated,

382
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,281
ask him to call me
via the walkie-talkie.

383
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,801
I'll pick you up.

384
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,001
What a mess.

385
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,281
13.

386
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,281
15.

387
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,080
16.

388
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,121
17.

389
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,521
Turn.

390
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:43,681
24.

391
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:44,681
25.

392
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:45,161
Turn.

393
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:05,801
Stay right there.

394
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,281
Where are you going?

395
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:10,401
To take the boss's blood pressure.

396
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
How many times have I told you?

397
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,080
Are you deaf?

398
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,801
The third floor is for the loans.

399
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:17,881
The fourth floor is for the broadcast.

400
00:19:17,921 --> 00:19:19,401
The fifth floor is where Boss works.

401
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Understood?

402
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,521
Yes, sir.

403
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:23,240
Go now.

404
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,560
(Thank you, Liu,
for being the top donor.)

405
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:51,401
(Do message me later.)

406
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,080
I will prepare

407
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:54,641
more show for you,

408
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:55,881
Liu,

409
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:57,801
to thank you for all

410
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,080
your support so far.

411
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,080
I will not forget you.

412
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,480
(Welcome, everyone.)

413
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,080
(Top up and donate so that I
can become the most viewed streamer.)

414
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,600
(Top donors)

415
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,480
(will receive a one-on-one show
with me.)

416
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:14,681
(I will perform)

417
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,001
(for you in private.)

418
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:18,720
(Go, guys.)

419
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,521
(Top up.)

420
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:24,440
(Thank you, Long, for the donation.)

421
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,320
(PM me later.)

422
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,200
(Come on, guys.)

423
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,401
(Go, go, go.)

424
00:20:31,401 --> 00:20:32,001
(Bei donated one rocket)
(We're so close.)

425
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,960
(Bei? Bei is the top donor now.)

426
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
(Thank you for your support, Bei.)

427
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:39,480
(I will give you a performance later.)

428
00:20:40,001 --> 00:20:42,641
(Thank you for the donation.)

429
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:46,480
Who's there?

430
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:48,921
What are you doing?

431
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:49,600
Relax.

432
00:20:50,281 --> 00:20:51,080
It's me.

433
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:53,281
How did you come here?

434
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,001
I...

435
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Why did you go offline?

436
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,401
What's going on?

437
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,521
My computer forced a shutdown.

438
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,881
Let me reboot it.

439
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,921
Hurry up then.

440
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Finish your mission

441
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,881
or I'll beat you up.

442
00:21:06,121 --> 00:21:06,921
Okay.

443
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:10,801
How did you come here?

444
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,281
It's a long story.

445
00:21:13,801 --> 00:21:15,480
If you believe in me,

446
00:21:15,921 --> 00:21:17,200
tonight, 11 p.m.

447
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:18,881
we'll meet on the first floor.

448
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:20,080
We'll escape together.

449
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:31,801
I want you

450
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,881
to be the witness.

451
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:34,801
Don't worry.

452
00:21:34,801 --> 00:21:36,521
We will protect you.

453
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,200
Mister,

454
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,480
you changed your mind three times.

455
00:21:38,521 --> 00:21:39,401
What is bothering you?

456
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,360
Can we meet?

457
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:40,840
Yes.

458
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320
You will choose where we meet up.

459
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:42,720
Yes.

460
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,200
Just let me know what you want.

461
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:45,200
We will try to give it to you.

462
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,720
Okay.

463
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:46,681
I'll wait for your call.

464
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:47,761
But I...

465
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:48,681
Hello?

466
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:49,401
Hello?

467
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,641
Did you even call anyone?

468
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:06,281
We have a list to go through.

469
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,480
Chop chop.

470
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,001
Ni.

471
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,840
They keep saying that I got
the wrong number.

472
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,681
Perhaps the list is wrong?

473
00:22:13,921 --> 00:22:15,761
We're here to investigate the fraud

474
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:16,200
but everyone thinks

475
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,560
we are the scammers.

476
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:20,161
Go laze around then.

477
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,960
Don't give me excuses.

478
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,440
Go through the list

479
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,360
and I'm sure

480
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:24,801
someone is willing to meet with us.

481
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,801
An Ni.

482
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,440
We can't go on like this.

483
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:29,881
Nothing's wrong with the list.

484
00:22:30,001 --> 00:22:31,360
It's just that no one is willing

485
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:32,281
to testify against Xin.

486
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,600
Xin has a lot of influence here.

487
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,041
Of course,

488
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:38,881
no one wants to reach out to us
when she's here.

489
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,681
I bet they have photos of us too.

490
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,041
Anyone who approaches us
will be punished.

491
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,080
That explains why they are not willing to testify.

492
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:47,641
Unless we can convince

493
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,161
everyone that we will arrest

494
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Xin for real this time,

495
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,121
or else,

496
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:54,281
they won't

497
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,521
come to us at all.

498
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,320
If they won't come to us,

499
00:22:58,401 --> 00:22:59,720
we'll go to them.

500
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,641
I'm just worried

501
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:01,960
that they might be erasing
all evidence as we speak.

502
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
The longer we dally here,

503
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,560
the more disadvantageous
the situation is for us.

504
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,600
Forget about safety.

505
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,121
Let's continue.

506
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
(Li Yitang)

507
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,881
Why didn't you pick it up?

508
00:23:21,281 --> 00:23:22,761
What if it was someone
who missed your call

509
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:23,600
and decided to call back?

510
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:24,080
No.

511
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,041
It was from Li Yitang.

512
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:27,320
I'm on duty now

513
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,240
so I can't answer her call.

514
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,600
She can just text me.

515
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
How long have you two known each other?

516
00:23:33,801 --> 00:23:34,840
How long have you two known each other?

517
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,281
We have been very close since we met
at university.

518
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:40,761
That's a long time ago.

519
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,281
Hi.

520
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:51,161
I am a prosecutor from China.

521
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,121
It's different this time.

522
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,001
Stop thinking

523
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,600
that you're useless.

524
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:04,360
You did very well these few years.

525
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,440
In a small place, to boot.

526
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:09,281
Compared to national interest,

527
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,840
your little trick is nothing.

528
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:14,761
Tell me.

529
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,560
Who else in this world cares about you

530
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:17,801
other than me?

531
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:20,240
Who do you trust completely?

532
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,881
Can't you see it?

533
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,041
He is using you.

534
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:28,401
He has been using you.

535
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,401
The government is stepping in

536
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,240
to stop what you're doing.

537
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,200
Listen to me,

538
00:24:32,401 --> 00:24:33,560
stop everything now

539
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,360
and scram.

540
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,560
I already bought you a plane ticket.

541
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:37,881
If you won't leave,

542
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,881
I'll come and drag you with me.

543
00:24:46,921 --> 00:24:47,600
What's the matter?

544
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,801
Why are you so mad?

545
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,480
The department head

546
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,281
gets on my nerves again.

547
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:55,281
You have to whip him into shape.

548
00:24:56,521 --> 00:24:57,881
That's what a leader does.

549
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,080
It's exhausting.

550
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,761
It's like I'm his babysitter.

551
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,681
Oh, come on.

552
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,761
You're not the real leader anyway.

553
00:25:05,001 --> 00:25:05,320
Wait.

554
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,001
What are you implying?

555
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm not the leader?

556
00:25:09,681 --> 00:25:10,881
You're not.

557
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:13,440
Mr. Yin is your superior, isn't he?

558
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:15,121
Huh?

559
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:16,080
Right.

560
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:18,121
Wherever I go,

561
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:18,881
I have to be reminded

562
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,560
that the almighty chairman
looms behind me.

563
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,281
Anyway,

564
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,360
I have a lot of work lately

565
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:26,600
and I need to go on a business trip.

566
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:29,521
Why is everyone
on a business trip lately?

567
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:30,320
Everyone? Who?

568
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,281
An Ni.

569
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,761
We agreed to have dinner at Xiaojiao's,

570
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:35,921
but An Ni bailed at the last minute
because of work.

571
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,080
Can you believe it?

572
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,001
What a coincidence then.

573
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,240
Come. Let's eat.

574
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:40,080
Okay.

575
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,001
You are Guoxun?

576
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,560
Yes.

577
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,121
And you have a younger brother

578
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,360
called Guoquan?

579
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:56,801
The two of you

580
00:25:57,121 --> 00:25:59,801
helped me build the entire server.

581
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,881
Why would you leave

582
00:26:03,881 --> 00:26:05,600
when I haven't even paid you yet?

583
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,200
It makes me feel guilty.

584
00:26:10,121 --> 00:26:12,041
They say law practitioners are smart.

585
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,960
Fortunately for me, an underling of mine

586
00:26:15,001 --> 00:26:17,921
got this from a prosecutor.

587
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,161
Otherwise,

588
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:22,240
I wouldn't even know where you live.

589
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:24,080
And we would never

590
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,360
ever cross paths again.

591
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:34,560
Where's Guoquan?

592
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,600
He went home.

593
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,041
You see, programmers

594
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,521
are so bad at lying.

595
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:44,161
You two did something back home

596
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,521
so you have to seek refuge here.

597
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:47,041
If he did go back,

598
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,720
why are you here?

599
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:51,401
I guess,

600
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,761
a certain lady contacted you, didn't she?

601
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:58,401
She wanted to meet you.

602
00:26:59,001 --> 00:26:59,720
No. Not at all.

603
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,681
She called and asked if I am Guoxun.

604
00:27:04,281 --> 00:27:06,681
She also asked if I knew you.

605
00:27:06,681 --> 00:27:08,080
I denied everything

606
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:11,681
and hung up.

607
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
What a terrible liar.

608
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,121
A woman invited you to a meal

609
00:27:17,121 --> 00:27:18,600
and you hung up?

610
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:19,480
That's rude.

611
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,281
Give him his phone.

612
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:23,080
No, please.

613
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:24,681
Take it.

614
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:29,761
Now, listen carefully.

615
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,560
Call back

616
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,840
and tell her you're free

617
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,921
tomorrow at 10 in the morning.

618
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:36,521
Tell her to meet you

619
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,600
at Sichuan Hot Pot Restaurant
in Chinatown.

620
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,660
(Jewelry Stores)

621
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:50,600
Ni.

622
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:52,681
Isn't this suspicious?

623
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:55,041
He hung up on us

624
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,840
all the time.

625
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:57,121
And suddenly, he agreed to meet up?

626
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,281
It's too fishy.

627
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:00,641
Or perhaps

628
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,200
he wasn't available to speak

629
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,560
but he found a safe space

630
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,281
to do so.

631
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,881
That's way too convenient.

632
00:28:07,881 --> 00:28:08,161
Ni.

633
00:28:08,161 --> 00:28:09,720
Let's head back.

634
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,080
The weather isn't great today.

635
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,881
Let's wait until the backup arrives.

636
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:15,801
Prosecutor Guo said

637
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:17,080
we shouldn't act on our lonesome.

638
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,801
No.

639
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:19,720
The list given to us by Raphael
was stolen.

640
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:22,161
That list might become a hit list.

641
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,041
The criminal syndicate

642
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,480
might kill them in an act of revenge.

643
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,600
Besides,

644
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:28,681
they risked their lives to get in touch.

645
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:29,921
We shouldn't leave them hanging

646
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,001
because we're scared.

647
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,281
Relax.

648
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,801
I took precautions.

649
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:39,440
I already notified Captain He,

650
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:40,881
so he will lead the local police

651
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:42,121
and protect us in secret.

652
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,720
Once we send a distress signal,

653
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:45,480
they will intervene.

654
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:47,921
You should have told me earlier!

655
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,600
Let's go.

656
00:29:14,521 --> 00:29:15,121
Wei.

657
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,041
They are here.

658
00:29:18,681 --> 00:29:20,161
Be quick later.

659
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,600
Impersonate the local mafia

660
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:23,881
and rob the Chinese.

661
00:29:24,281 --> 00:29:25,281
Once you're done,

662
00:29:25,921 --> 00:29:27,200
leave everything

663
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,080
in the mafia's territory.

664
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:30,281
Noted.

665
00:29:36,881 --> 00:29:38,480
Sichuan Hot Pot.

666
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:40,480
This is the place.

667
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:41,801
Han Xuan.

668
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,041
Don't get in first.

669
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,600
I'll go in and check
if the informant is here.

670
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:45,480
If he is,

671
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,161
I'll ask you to join me.

672
00:29:46,921 --> 00:29:47,240
Okay.

673
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,121
Be safe.

674
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:48,521
Okay.

675
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,480
Don't run, thief!

676
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,041
Han Xuan!

677
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,801
Wei.

678
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,960
They are gone.

679
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:11,921
Cancel the plan.

680
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,001
We retreat.

681
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,641
Thief.

682
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,001
Come back.

683
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,001
Han Xuan!

684
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,521
Han Xuan!

685
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,001
Stop chasing.

686
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,521
Stay right there!

687
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:41,681
Stop running!

688
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,060
(Les Amis)

689
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,200
(Les Amis)
Hi.

690
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,600
(Les Amis)

691
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,001
(Les Amis)
Did you see a young man just now?

692
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,080
Hi, Miss An Ni.

693
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,560
My uncle would like
to have some tea with you.

694
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,940
(Les Amis)

695
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Prosecutor An Ni.

696
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,600
How do you know my name?

697
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,080
Your name

698
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:41,960
has been circulated around

699
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,401
here since yesterday.

700
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:47,521
Someone even distributed

701
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,801
photos of you two within the network,

702
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:52,921
saying that you're here

703
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,480
to arrest someone.

704
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:57,080
But they didn't say who

705
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,080
or for what case.

706
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,200
Now,

707
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
drug traffickers,

708
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,480
human traffickers,

709
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:07,881
online fraudsters,

710
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:09,761
all think that you're here

711
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:12,960
to arrest them.

712
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
Prosecutor An.

713
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:20,681
I can't help but be concerned

714
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:22,281
about your safety.

715
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,080
I'm sorry,

716
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,801
but who are you?

717
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,840
I'm Wang.

718
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,881
You called me yesterday.

719
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,320
And you leaked my address

720
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,360
to basically everyone.

721
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:37,881
Fortunately,

722
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:40,600
I already moved.

723
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,801
I knew

724
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:45,881
you would walk

725
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:48,881
into their trap.

726
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,681
So I have my people follow you

727
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:54,080
since yesterday.

728
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,801
Fortunately, I made it in time.

729
00:32:59,881 --> 00:33:01,401
So you're President Wang.

730
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
Nice to meet you.

731
00:33:02,921 --> 00:33:05,320
But why are you here?

732
00:33:05,921 --> 00:33:07,121
I'm not proud of what I'm about to say.

733
00:33:08,881 --> 00:33:10,881
Three years ago, a friend of me

734
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:13,320
invited me to gamble online.

735
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,600
I have always

736
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:17,681
been addicted to gambling.

737
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:20,960
An online casino was a novelty to me.

738
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,720
You might not believe me

739
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,761
but even though an online casino

740
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,881
isn't as comfortable as a real casino,

741
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:38,401
the expected thrill it offers

742
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,881
goes even farther than.

743
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:42,360
Back then,

744
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:45,480
it was legal to gamble online.

745
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:49,401
I thought it was just a quick game

746
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:54,001
and that's how I fell victim

747
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:56,161
to it.

748
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:00,080
We have heard similar

749
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:01,161
stories before.

750
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,440
Well,

751
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,881
I bet no one lost as much money

752
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:11,760
as I did.

753
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:13,401
One night,

754
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:15,441
within one single night,

755
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:20,000
I lost 450 million yuan.

756
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,040
450 million?

757
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
In a single night?

758
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,760
That's crazy.

759
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,040
And then?

760
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:30,921
And then,

761
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,401
my friend told me to use my company
as a leverage

762
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,441
to take out

763
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:40,681
an online loan.

764
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:43,721
It was supposed to be my comeback,

765
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:46,080
but you can already guess
the rest of the story.

766
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,360
It wasn't until much later
that I found out

767
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,481
it was all a scheme.

768
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:53,560
That online casino belongs to her.

769
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,280
The loan agency belongs to her.

770
00:34:57,241 --> 00:35:00,280
Everything I owned belongs to her.

771
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,881
She rebranded my company

772
00:35:05,641 --> 00:35:06,921
and recruited more people

773
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:10,600
so that she could exploit more victims.

774
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:14,161
President Wang.

775
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:16,121
Is your friend

776
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:18,600
Qian Tianxin?

777
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,681
Isn't it obvious?

778
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,961
But

779
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,080
I have been thinking

780
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,760
that she has an accomplice.

781
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:30,961
When I was with her,

782
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:32,560
the people around her

783
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,961
used to refer to someone

784
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,681
with a code name.

785
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,000
And that code name is quite peculiar.

786
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,161
What code name?

787
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,040
A.

788
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,161
All representatives are here.

789
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:05,201
Let's begin now.

790
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:07,280
Prosecutor-General Guo Hongjiang,

791
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:11,161
you may deliver your speech.

792
00:36:18,241 --> 00:36:21,161
Fellow representatives,

793
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:24,600
I am honored to be here

794
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,000
for this Corporate
Social Responsibility Conference.

795
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,121
First and foremost,

796
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:30,641
I would like to share with you

797
00:36:30,641 --> 00:36:32,241
our latest work

798
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,961
regarding the cybercrime crackdown operation

799
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,121
and other relevant projects.

800
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:39,080
In the past six months,

801
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,441
we follow the recommendations issued
by the Supreme People's Procuratorate

802
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,280
and maintain a hardened position
to tackle all cybercrimes.

803
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,800
We have established a special task force

804
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:51,520
to carry out all investigations.

805
00:36:51,921 --> 00:36:52,760
During the six-month period,

806
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:57,000
we have solved 34 cyber frauds,

807
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,161
prosecuted 213 persons,

808
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:02,441
(Zhao Jikai)
indicted 195 persons,

809
00:37:03,161 --> 00:37:05,961
(Zhao Jikai)
and recovered 135 million yuan.

810
00:37:07,881 --> 00:37:09,641
Organized the documents for me.

811
00:37:11,641 --> 00:37:12,121
Prosecutor Guo.

812
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:13,000
Professor Luo.

813
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,280
Long time no see.

814
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,560
Indeed.

815
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:17,000
You still look as good as ever.

816
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:20,641
You delivered an inspiring speech just now.

817
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,161
You're exaggerating.

818
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,201
He's from Huiquan.

819
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:24,721
Mr. Zhao.

820
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:25,481
Yes.

821
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:29,840
A young and successful entrepreneur.

822
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,560
He is now a representative too.

823
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,040
Congratulations.

824
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,760
Thanks, sir.

825
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
It's all thanks to the support

826
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,840
from the government.

827
00:37:39,441 --> 00:37:40,360
You're too courteous.

828
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,641
I am always of the opinion

829
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,241
that no company
should be afraid of laws.

830
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:47,600
We have punished companies

831
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,600
that violated the laws in recent years

832
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,721
but we also support those
who observe disciplines and obey laws.

833
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:58,040
Including Huiquan Corporation.

834
00:37:58,641 --> 00:37:58,840
That's right.

835
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,840
Worry not, sir.

836
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,641
Huiquan will abide

837
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:04,921
by the laws.

838
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,921
We will do our best to contribute
to the national economy.

839
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:09,961
I can't wait.

840
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,641
My car is here.

841
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,320
I have a flight later.

842
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,441
Should the occasion arise,

843
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,080
I would like to invite all of you to a meal.

844
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,401
Sure.

845
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:21,961
Thanks.

846
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:22,641
I'll get going then.

847
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:22,760
Okay.

848
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:22,961
All right.

849
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
See you.

850
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:25,800
Okay.

851
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:27,360
See you.

852
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,681
All right.

853
00:38:30,721 --> 00:38:31,040
The car's here.

854
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:37,121
I forgot.

855
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:21,840
Hush.

856
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,840
Did someone see you?

857
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,280
No.

858
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,121
Everyone's sleeping now.

859
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:30,040
Four minutes till they do the rounds.

860
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:31,040
Okay.

861
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,641
Qian Tianxin's people are out there.

862
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,840
Let's head to the second floor.

863
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,401
Come.

864
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,280
25.

865
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:42,441
26.

866
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:43,921
27.

867
00:39:44,121 --> 00:39:45,121
28.

868
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,121
Go.

869
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:00,800
Go.

870
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:09,600
Over here.

871
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,080
Careful.

872
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:11,441
Run.

873
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:12,760
Ah!

874
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,360
Ah!

875
00:40:13,641 --> 00:40:13,961
Ah!

876
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,600
Get up.

877
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:16,481
Come.

878
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,320
Are you all right?

879
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,641
Let's go.

880
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,360
Okay. Sit down.

881
00:40:24,401 --> 00:40:24,721
Watch out.

882
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,401
Let me see.

883
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,241
You sprained your ankle.

884
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,280
Let me see.

885
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:36,520
They aren't here.

886
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,161
Let's rest here.

887
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:41,641
I can't believe

888
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,441
this is the situation we're in
when I finally have the chance

889
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,721
to talk to you properly.

890
00:40:49,401 --> 00:40:53,161
I was in a similar situation too

891
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,000
when I first met you.

892
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:01,401
I'm sorry, Xiaobei.

893
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:03,800
I should have listened to you.

894
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,241
I thought there would be more
opportunities abroad

895
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,280
but I was scammed
into doing the same thing again.

896
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,000
Back home, he would hit me every day

897
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,840
but at least, I could breathe freely.

898
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:17,881
But here?

899
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:20,401
Freedom is a luxury.

900
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,201
I dragged you into this.

901
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:28,241
I made the choice

902
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,961
to jump into the river.

903
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:31,161
I created this mess.

904
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:32,241
It has nothing to do with you.

905
00:41:32,641 --> 00:41:33,360
Besides,

906
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,441
I'm numb

907
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,840
to all my problems now.

908
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:38,201
I won't be able to repay

909
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:39,641
my debts anyway,

910
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,881
be it 10,000 yuan

911
00:41:40,921 --> 00:41:42,040
or a million yuan.

912
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:45,840
What do we do then?

913
00:41:46,201 --> 00:41:48,800
My passport and my IC are confiscated.

914
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,721
I can't return to China.

915
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:54,560
Even if I escape from here,

916
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,201
I can only be a paperless vagrant.

917
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:58,241
I don't plan to go back.

918
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:00,800
My home is no more.

919
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,721
But you're different.

920
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:05,520
You still have a home.

921
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,280
Tomorrow morning,

922
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,681
I'll take you to the Chinese embassy
in Harbour City.

923
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,241
They will take you to safety.

924
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,080
Okay?

925
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:26,721
Come.
