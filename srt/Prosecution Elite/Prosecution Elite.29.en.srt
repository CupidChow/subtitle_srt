(Just like I said, I'm not worth it.)

21
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,754
I never expected

22
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,875
we would meet again in such circumstances,

23
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:55,955
Zhao Jikai.

24
00:03:58,515 --> 00:03:59,315
Yeah.

25
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,315
I never saw this coming too.

26
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:03,274
If possible,

27
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:07,194
I would have chosen
a more romantic setting.

28
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:12,194
That's right.

29
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,795
I'm the person you've been searching for.

30
00:04:16,834 --> 00:04:20,074
I've been undercover
within the Huiquan Corporation,

31
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:23,274
providing data to Qian Tianxin.

32
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:25,875
Indeed, it's related
to Qian Tianxin again.

33
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,274
So tell me.

34
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:30,875
How did you embed the program code

35
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,514
into the update package?

36
00:04:34,715 --> 00:04:36,114
It's a long story.

37
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:38,514
How should I begin this?

38
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:44,715
Let's start with Zhang Xiaobei
stirring up the case of Shi Xiaohu.

39
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:47,755
At that time, Huiquan Corporation

40
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,435
had just acquired Green Broadcasting,

41
00:04:50,514 --> 00:04:52,315
known as Huibo now.

42
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,915
The corporation had already spent
a large sum of money.

43
00:04:55,354 --> 00:04:56,715
And Zhang Xiaobei's actions

44
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:58,674
undoubtedly added fuel to the fire.

45
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,995
Yin Huiquan wanted to secure financing
from overseas.

46
00:05:01,995 --> 00:05:03,475
But for a long time,

47
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:04,554
it didn't materialize.

48
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:07,155
As Huibo expanded,

49
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,475
the financial condition of Huiquan Group

50
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,794
was also affected.

51
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:14,475
So Yin Huiquan thought of reducing expenses

52
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,114
and cutting budgets from various aspects.

53
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:21,274
Then increasing investment
in the live broadcasting sector.

54
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:22,715
At that time,

55
00:05:22,995 --> 00:05:26,195
I suggested to him to cut off

56
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:29,875
those seemingly useless and costly projects,

57
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:33,315
such as adjusting the monitoring

58
00:05:33,435 --> 00:05:35,035
to a seven-day retention period.

59
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,595
Yin Huiquan agreed to it.

60
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:40,274
He always thought of himself as cunning.

61
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:42,635
But his cleverness backfired.

62
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:45,155
In the end, he was a step behind.

63
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,514
So you had already set up
the trap long ago.

64
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,755
After Zhang Xiaobei's incident,

65
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:54,114
Yin Huiquan became quite disappointed in me

66
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:56,155
and took away many of my powers.

67
00:05:56,514 --> 00:06:00,475
At that time, I realized
that it'd become increasingly difficult

68
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,794
to obtain personal information in the future.

69
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,755
So I started thinking

70
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:07,514
about a more advanced

71
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,315
and secretive method.

72
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,674
That was when the idea of the two-way
communication program emerged.

73
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:14,915
Yes,

74
00:06:15,514 --> 00:06:16,715
it was my doing.

75
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:18,354
I wrote the program.

76
00:06:19,354 --> 00:06:20,315
I lied to you

77
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:22,915
about not understanding technology.

78
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,114
That was all false.

79
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:28,155
The truth is, I started studying computers

80
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,715
independently a long time ago.

81
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:33,114
People like Shi Xiaohu are
the typical "double high" group,

82
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:35,155
someone who spent a long time on games

83
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,915
and high reloads amounts.

84
00:06:38,114 --> 00:06:39,475
I could easily select

85
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:42,475
the people I wanted from the data

86
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:43,915
and provide them to Qian Tianxin.

87
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:47,794
But why did the program need
an update after that?

88
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:49,354
Later, it was tightly controlled.

89
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:51,595
I couldn't act recklessly.

90
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,315
All business operations were suspended.

91
00:06:53,394 --> 00:06:56,794
So I had to rely on the most primitive methods
from Country F

92
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:59,155
to select potential user lists.

93
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:01,354
Like Guo Jing'an,

94
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:05,514
or the artificial intelligence
network nodes you disconnected.

95
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:08,114
Speaking of which,

96
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,715
I have to thank Zhang Xiaobei.

97
00:07:10,915 --> 00:07:12,074
Without him,

98
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:14,354
the prerequisite for my later plans
wouldn't have been met.

99
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:16,514
Because of Zhang Xiaobei's incident,

100
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:18,514
Yin Huiquan was furious.

101
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:21,195
He ordered the entire company

102
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:23,394
to update all the games.

103
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:26,274
So I wondered if I could include

104
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,794
a mini program under his command.

105
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:30,794
I thought it was flawlessly done.

106
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:32,715
And no one would discover it.

107
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:34,995
But as they say,

108
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,475
what comes around goes around.

109
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,915
Zhang Xiaobei appeared again this time,

110
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:44,514
saying he found an issue with Huiquan Game.

111
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:47,595
People who meddle in other people's affairs

112
00:07:47,794 --> 00:07:49,274
and can't control their own mouths

113
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:51,674
will eventually pay the price
for their words and actions.

114
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,074
So it was you
who kidnapped Zhang Xiaobei?

115
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:58,195
Why would I kidnap
an insignificant person?

116
00:07:58,674 --> 00:08:00,475
It wasn't me.

117
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:03,035
I only leaked the information
to Bian Qiuqiu

118
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,794
to create a scandal
involving Zhang Wanru,

119
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:09,875
making Zhang Xiaobei distressed
and unable to focus.

120
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:20,234
And what happened afterward?

121
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,394
How did you cover up everything

122
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:24,794
and evade Bao Meiguo's actions?

123
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,715
This person is quite interesting.

124
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:31,315
I have observed him for a long time.

125
00:08:31,834 --> 00:08:32,995
He has a habit.

126
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:34,275
When he's working overtime at night,

127
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,354
he likes eating while working.

128
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:38,315
Or else he would easily fall asleep.

129
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,075
I may have lost my power.

130
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:42,474
But it actually helped me.

131
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:45,674
It's because our chairman is a busybody

132
00:08:45,914 --> 00:08:46,995
and eager to take the blame.

133
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,275
Since Xiao Mu'en joined our company,

134
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:53,794
the old man started favoring him
and treating me poorly.

135
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:55,794
He made things difficult
for me all the time.

136
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:56,794
I lost face.

137
00:08:58,474 --> 00:09:00,955
So I no longer directly confronted him.

138
00:09:01,594 --> 00:09:02,515
I took preventive measures.

139
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:03,315
It was already enough.

140
00:09:04,714 --> 00:09:05,714
I was the CEO

141
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,354
who was in charge of personnel.

142
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:09,315
I only casually gave a hint.

143
00:09:09,755 --> 00:09:10,635
Then Bao Meiguo

144
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:12,195
took responsibility
for the game updates.

145
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,875
I chose 3 a.m. as the time

146
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,075
for the updates too,

147
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,714
because at that time,

148
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,474
apart from the security guards,

149
00:09:20,474 --> 00:09:21,955
no one else in the company
was working overtime.

150
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:24,995
At 3 a.m. It is also the time

151
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:26,755
when the brain is most relaxed.

152
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,594
I knew before each overtime,

153
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,955
he would go downstairs
15 minutes early to buy food.

154
00:09:31,995 --> 00:09:33,354
So I created my alibi

155
00:09:33,594 --> 00:09:35,794
in the convenience store

156
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:38,114
and timed my return to the office

157
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:39,755
I replaced the update package
on the server

158
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,914
with a prepared hard drive.

159
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:43,354
The size of my update package

160
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:46,914
was only 252 megabytes,

161
00:09:47,835 --> 00:09:50,034
just a small program of a few kilobytes.

162
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:53,474
It was like a needle in a haystack,

163
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:55,714
never to be discovered.

164
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:58,955
In theory,

165
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:01,474
people would suspect

166
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:02,635
that only someone
with comprehensive privileges

167
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,794
like Yin Huiquan could do this.

168
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,195
No one would think

169
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:08,755
it was you hiding
behind Huiquan Corporation,

170
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:09,955
deceiving everyone,

171
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,275
and taking advantage of the situation.

172
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:17,354
So did you do all of this yourself?

173
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,354
Yes, I did everything by myself.

174
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:23,315
What about Qian Tianxin?

175
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,114
Tell me about your relationship with her.

176
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:29,515
I provided her with data for her scams.

177
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,075
Is that all?

178
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,955
That's all related to this case.

179
00:10:37,835 --> 00:10:39,195
I don't wish to say anything

180
00:10:40,234 --> 00:10:41,354
that's not related to the case.

181
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:43,114
It's a private matter.

182
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:54,554
Do you know A?

183
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,315
Everyone knows A.

184
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:01,674
Would you believe me

185
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:03,474
if I said I'm A?

186
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:05,395
Didn't Qian Tianxin

187
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,674
confess that she's A before?

188
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:18,395
Do you have any personal gain from this data?

189
00:11:18,794 --> 00:11:21,674
I mean besides providing it to Qian Tianxin.

190
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:24,635
Did you use it for illegal online loans
or any other purposes?

191
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:35,714
Qian Tianxin

192
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:39,354
never involved me in her scams.

193
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:41,794
I know she was protecting me.

194
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,794
The online lending company
was my own doing.

195
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:47,315
Nobody knew about it,

196
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:49,395
not even Qian Tianxin.

197
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:51,755
I come from a humble background

198
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:53,755
and I'm used to being poor.

199
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:55,635
That's why I like money.

200
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,995
I like having a lot of money.

201
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:01,075
Only then can I feel secure.

202
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:02,955
The concept of loans

203
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:05,755
is something I learned
when I followed Qian Tianxin.

204
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:07,594
It's too easy.

205
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,835
One makes ten.

206
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:09,794
Ten makes hundreds.

207
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:13,714
All I did was integrate it into the internet.

208
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:18,674
With your salaries,

209
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:20,395
you can't imagine

210
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:23,315
how substantial that amount is.

211
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,195
We previously arrested someone

212
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:30,034
related to Shi Xiaohu
and Zhang Xiaobei's case.

213
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,794
He used to work at Huiquan Corporation

214
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,554
but left after a short period.

215
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:35,114
Do you know this person?

216
00:12:35,234 --> 00:12:36,275
Is he related to you?

217
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:38,114
I know this person.

218
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,515
He used to work at Huiquan but was fired

219
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:45,154
when the company discovered

220
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,474
that he copied users' personal data
without permission.

221
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,435
But this person has no connection to us.

222
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,195
It's purely a coincidence.

223
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:55,154
So is Shi Xiaohu's case related to you?

224
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:56,875
How do I put this?

225
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:00,275
It's related, but also unrelated.

226
00:13:01,154 --> 00:13:02,554
It's related to the game.

227
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,755
But unrelated to me

228
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,435
because there are many criminals like us

229
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,714
watching him and waiting for an opportunity.

230
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:16,315
We have gathered almost
all the evidence related to this case.

231
00:13:16,315 --> 00:13:17,554
If you need it,

232
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:19,275
I can show it to you one by one.

233
00:13:19,594 --> 00:13:23,114
But if you're willing
to confess everything you know

234
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,995
to us truthfully, honestly,
and voluntarily,

235
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:27,794
it would be a good opportunity
for you to redeem yourself.

236
00:13:29,114 --> 00:13:30,474
I'm already here.

237
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,474
I have nothing to hide anymore.

238
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,075
But unfortunately,

239
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:37,075
I can't provide any evidence for you

240
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,955
because the rule in our line of work

241
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,154
is "burn after reading."

242
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,594
Does Li Yitang know
that you have come to surrender?

243
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:01,515
Is it necessary to inform a specific person?

244
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:03,714
If there's no need,

245
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:07,714
I would rather go alone
without any attachments.

246
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:12,755
Have you contacted Captain He?

247
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:14,075
I did.

248
00:14:14,075 --> 00:14:15,154
They're on the way here.

249
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:19,955
Let him come and take Zhao Jikai
to the police station

250
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,315
to complete the necessary procedures.

251
00:14:23,275 --> 00:14:24,075
Okay.

252
00:14:46,154 --> 00:14:46,955
Mr. Yin.

253
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:54,674
Everyone is here.

254
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:56,955
Everything is fine.

255
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,395
So get back to work.

256
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:09,474
Get back to what you're doing.

257
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,520
(Huiquan Corporation)

258
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:18,435
Have some water.

259
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:25,674
Stop looking around aimlessly

260
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:26,714
and behave yourself.

261
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,955
I have a stiff neck.
I need to move my neck a bit.

262
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,315
Zhao Jikai has confessed everything.

263
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:50,674
Long,

264
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,875
show him the video of Zhao Jikai.

265
00:15:53,315 --> 00:15:54,315
No need.

266
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:56,755
I've thought about it.

267
00:15:57,234 --> 00:15:58,635
It doesn't matter if he said anything.

268
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,075
I'll confess everything.

269
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,554
I'm Zhao Jikai's old friend

270
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,154
and a hacker he hired.

271
00:16:07,914 --> 00:16:09,315
I was responsible for monitoring

272
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:13,234
the online lending platforms
for him and helped him

273
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:17,554
send the selected personal information overseas.

274
00:16:19,075 --> 00:16:19,914
What else?

275
00:16:20,714 --> 00:16:23,075
What about the server
when we arrested you earlier?

276
00:16:24,315 --> 00:16:25,914
Also and tell me

277
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:27,955
about the embedded two-way
communication program in Huiquan Game.

278
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:32,755
I wrote  that two-way
communication program as well.

279
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:34,195
What else?

280
00:16:34,554 --> 00:16:35,354
And...

281
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:37,354
What else could there be?

282
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,275
About Zhang Xiaobei.

283
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:44,075
Oh, that.

284
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,114
I hired two people to kidnap him.

285
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,474
I couldn't stand someone
like Zhang Xiaobei

286
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:55,714
who always caused trouble
and created conflicts.

287
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,714
But that guy is too cunning

288
00:16:58,315 --> 00:16:59,354
and he managed to escape.

289
00:16:59,674 --> 00:17:01,114
About slandering his sister,

290
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,594
I contacted Bian Qiuqiu
through a virtual identity

291
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,314
and provided her with specific content.

292
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:11,635
Does Zhao Jikai know about this?

293
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,720
(Zhao Jikai)

294
00:17:30,795 --> 00:17:31,594
Hello?

295
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:32,354
Hello?

296
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,114
Why are you still sleeping?

297
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,395
(Oh, it's you, Jikai.)

298
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:37,395
(Are you calling me at this time)

299
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:38,954
(because there's urgent work?)

300
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,434
According to reliable information,

301
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:43,155
Zhang Xiaobei is causing trouble again.

302
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:45,954
That guy is like wet dough

303
00:17:46,035 --> 00:17:47,074
that you can't shake off.

304
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:48,594
(He's really disgusting.)

305
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:52,995
But that scoundrel is just a small fry.

306
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:55,434
Why bother with him?

307
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:56,755
I don't know what he did.

308
00:17:57,155 --> 00:17:59,515
But he found out about what we did in the game.

309
00:18:00,074 --> 00:18:02,234
He's probably on his way
to the prosecutor's office

310
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,594
to find An Ni.

311
00:18:05,675 --> 00:18:06,474
What?

312
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:09,114
What do you need me to do?

313
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,395
Find two people who are daring enough

314
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,395
and tarnish Zhang Wanru's reputation.

315
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,635
Remember, the dirtier, the better.

316
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:18,234
But Kai,

317
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:21,354
isn't Zhang Wanru already dead?

318
00:18:21,594 --> 00:18:25,155
(Can we stop that brat by tarnishing her?)

319
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:26,675
Don't you know
what Zhang Xiaobei is like?

320
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,995
He's sentimental and impulsive.

321
00:18:30,354 --> 00:18:32,275
That's why he caused so much trouble in the past.

322
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:35,155
(Now that Zhang Xiaobei
has no one else in this world,)

323
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:37,875
(Zhang Wanru is his only emotional support)

324
00:18:37,915 --> 00:18:39,114
in this world.

325
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:42,194
If he finds out that someone is tarnishing
his sister's name,

326
00:18:42,515 --> 00:18:45,114
guess what Zhang Xiaobei would do?

327
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:48,755
(Will he have time to meddle
in our affairs?)

328
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,995
Kai, I'm worried that this might backfire.

329
00:18:53,114 --> 00:18:54,035
When that happens,

330
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:56,074
the focus will be shifted to us.

331
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:57,795
Don't worry about it.

332
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,395
Just do as I say.

333
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:01,555
Remember.

334
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,834
Do it cleanly without leaving any clues.

335
00:19:05,474 --> 00:19:09,035
Ambiguous articles like this spread quickly.

336
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,954
(Once we achieve our goal)

337
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,555
(and trigger nationwide discussions,)

338
00:19:13,074 --> 00:19:14,275
Zhang Xiaobei and An Ni

339
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,234
will divert their focus elsewhere.

340
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:17,074
Okay.

341
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:20,035
I'll leave the rest to you.

342
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:24,834
People like Zhang Xiaobei

343
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:26,834
won't learn their lesson

344
00:19:27,594 --> 00:19:29,234
unless you teach them.

345
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:30,995
He's like a hidden mine,

346
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:32,875
ready to explode at any moment.

347
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,795
I acted myself

348
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:37,675
because I felt
that time was running out.

349
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:40,194
I couldn't afford to hesitate.

350
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:41,354
So I took the liberty

351
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:46,155
and hired two men
with criminal records to help me.

352
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:51,834
How did you transmit data to Qian Tianxin?

353
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:54,834
I transmitted it
through remote data encryption.

354
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:56,635
I'm not trying to brag.

355
00:19:56,675 --> 00:20:01,234
But I have a talent for the internet.

356
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:03,035
There are few people
in the internet world

357
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,275
who can match me.

358
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,074
If you're so skilled,

359
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:07,635
why did you end up here?

360
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:09,995
It was a twist of fate.

361
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:11,834
Bad luck.

362
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:14,234
Do you think you have bad luck?

363
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:15,555
Listen to this.

364
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:16,474
Don't reach out your hand,

365
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,954
or you'll get caught.

366
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:20,755
Enough about that.

367
00:20:20,795 --> 00:20:23,434
Tell me about  Zhao Jikai's illegal online lending operation.

368
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:24,875
How do you operate it?

369
00:20:24,954 --> 00:20:28,555
Zhao Jikai highly valued the spenders
in the game.

370
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,234
These targets are very young.

371
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:35,074
They have a promising future and value future,

372
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,155
Time and life

373
00:20:37,354 --> 00:20:39,675
is a higher level of assurance
to loan repayment.

374
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:41,395
This is what we focus on.

375
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,275
Once we identify gamers

376
00:20:45,314 --> 00:20:46,234
who spend real money on games,

377
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:49,194
we would send them mass messages

378
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:52,234
through various companies
and online platforms.

379
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:54,474
Those who have such a need

380
00:20:54,714 --> 00:20:58,074
will naturally contact
at least one of our companies.

381
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:02,474
We have also carefully studied those

382
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,675
who are willing to borrow money
for game top-ups.

383
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:06,555
They tend to have lavish spending habits

384
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,474
in their daily lives.

385
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:12,434
These individuals will continue
to demand such loans

386
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:14,834
and constantly find ways
to cover their expenses.

387
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:17,114
So they'll always remain

388
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:18,635
in our predatory system.

389
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:19,954
Of course,

390
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:23,354
we also target some general users

391
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:24,395
through non-gaming channels.

392
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,234
Is this under your management?

393
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:27,675
I don't handle the money.

394
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:29,675
Zhao Jikai and I have different roles.

395
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:31,594
He handles the money.

396
00:21:33,434 --> 00:21:34,834
How did you guys know each other?

397
00:21:35,515 --> 00:21:37,155
Despite having
a middle school education,

398
00:21:37,675 --> 00:21:40,594
I have had

399
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,755
a natural talent for cybersecurity

400
00:21:42,795 --> 00:21:43,795
since I was young.

401
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:44,675
At that time,

402
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:46,675
I exploited a vulnerability
on a networking platform

403
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:49,194
to conduct continuous
money transfers and withdrawals.

404
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:50,635
But I got caught

405
00:21:51,594 --> 00:21:52,594
and was convicted of theft.

406
00:21:54,234 --> 00:21:55,275
Zhao Jikai and I

407
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,194
were imprisoned in the same place.

408
00:21:58,515 --> 00:21:59,314
You can say

409
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:01,275
we both suffered from the same hardship

410
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,074
and support each other.

411
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:04,795
I was scrawny back then.

412
00:22:05,114 --> 00:22:07,555
So I was bullied a lot then.

413
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,275
It was Zhao Jikai who helped me.

414
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,275
He genuinely helped me.

415
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:11,474
He risked his life for me.

416
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:14,555
So my life

417
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:16,194
also belongs to him.

418
00:22:25,314 --> 00:22:26,675
Ms. Li.

419
00:22:27,114 --> 00:22:28,275
Where are you going?

420
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:33,234
I've resigned.

421
00:22:34,915 --> 00:22:35,755
Who approved it?

422
00:22:35,915 --> 00:22:37,314
Don't you know?

423
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,635
Mr. Zhao turned himself in.

424
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,675
I heard he has been officially arrested.

425
00:22:43,954 --> 00:22:46,234
So I can't work here anymore.

426
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,434
It's more dignified to resign voluntarily.

427
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:50,834
Well, Ms. Li.

428
00:22:51,474 --> 00:22:52,474
I want to thank you and Mr. Zhao

429
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,074
for taking good care of me.

430
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:55,594
I should get going now.

431
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:58,354
Goodbye.

432
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,114
Yitang.

433
00:23:06,234 --> 00:23:07,314
If...

434
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,434
I said, "If."

435
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,114
If they found me...

436
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:15,875
Let them come at me.

437
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:19,675
You can't do that.

438
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,035
We're different.

439
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,714
You have a career, family, and friends.

440
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,395
You shouldn't give up everything for me.

441
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:31,714
You better not get involved
in my affairs.

442
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:35,875
I don't want to hear these anymore.

443
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:38,234
I'm tired of it.

444
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,515
Then why don't we just leave this place?

445
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,074
Forget everything here.

446
00:23:47,515 --> 00:23:48,915
Find a random island

447
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,194
and do nothing all day.

448
00:23:52,155 --> 00:23:53,675
We could gaze at the sea

449
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:55,515
where there are only

450
00:23:56,074 --> 00:23:57,635
the two of us in this world.

451
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:05,995
Are you serious about what you said?

452
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:09,314
Are you really willing
to leave this place and leave her?

453
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:13,714
It's no longer important

454
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:14,995
whether we can let go or not.

455
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,714
Instead of living
in constant fear and anxiety,

456
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,194
it's better to leave this place

457
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,275
and seek a world
that belongs to the two of us.

458
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:28,915
Jikai,

459
00:24:29,795 --> 00:24:31,434
it's a deal then.

460
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,714
I'll go wherever you go.

461
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:37,234
You can't abandon me again in this life.

462
00:24:43,434 --> 00:24:44,395
Why don't you think

463
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,074
about where we should go?

464
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,515
Mauritius?

465
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:48,714
Fiji?

466
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:51,675
Oh.

467
00:24:52,795 --> 00:24:54,114
Keep this card with you.

468
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,635
All my money is in it

469
00:24:55,635 --> 00:24:57,834
and the password
is on the back of the card.

470
00:24:58,354 --> 00:24:59,834
I have money.

471
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:01,074
I know you have money too.

472
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:02,515
Your money belongs to you.

473
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,954
My money will be yours too.

474
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:07,354
You can decide how to spend it.

475
00:25:09,314 --> 00:25:09,875
Take it.

476
00:25:24,194 --> 00:25:26,035
You've been lying to me all this while.

477
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,155
You can run.

478
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,434
At least, you're free.

479
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:40,594
(Resignation Letter)
Mr. Yin,

480
00:25:40,594 --> 00:25:40,915
(Resignation Letter)

481
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,954
(Resignation Letter)
thank you for your care all this time.

482
00:25:43,915 --> 00:25:45,314
I remember when I first joined Huiquan,

483
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:47,155
you were the one who interviewed me.

484
00:25:47,555 --> 00:25:48,954
Time really flies.

485
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:51,875
I know it's not the right time
for me to resign,

486
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:55,035
especially when Huiquan needs everyone
to stand united

487
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:56,714
and move forward together.

488
00:25:57,314 --> 00:25:58,555
But I'm sure you're aware

489
00:25:58,594 --> 00:25:59,795
of my relationship with Zhao Jikai.

490
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:01,515
He's in trouble now.

491
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:04,354
I have no reason to stay at Huiquan anymore.

492
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,555
You don't have to leave.

493
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:12,035
I know what you're thinking.

494
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:13,594
Actually, you've been performing

495
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:14,915
really well in your job.

496
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:19,035
Everyone at the company admires you.

497
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:21,834
Besides, Huiquan Corporation

498
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:23,555
has faced all sorts of ordeals recently.

499
00:26:23,594 --> 00:26:24,395
It's all thanks to your efforts

500
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,515
and your team's hard work

501
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:30,234
that the company overcomes so many risks.

502
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:34,755
You and Zhao Jikai aren't husband and wife.

503
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:37,275
So legally,

504
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:38,915
you're not considered a married couple.

505
00:26:38,995 --> 00:26:41,434
At least, you're an independent person.

506
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:43,354
To me,

507
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:45,915
you're a very typical representative

508
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:47,555
of a professional woman.

509
00:26:48,594 --> 00:26:52,114
I believe you can handle all this

510
00:26:52,474 --> 00:26:53,675
and make reasonable arrangements

511
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,594
for your work and personal life.

512
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:57,795
Mr. Yin,

513
00:26:58,434 --> 00:27:00,834
your words make me
feel even more remorseful.

514
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:01,875
To put it bluntly,

515
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:03,755
the position of the Director of Legal Affairs

516
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:04,675
is to ensure the company operates

517
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:06,635
in compliance with the law.

518
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:08,675
But looking at the results,

519
00:27:08,954 --> 00:27:10,515
I haven't done a good job.

520
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:12,234
Maybe many employees at Huiquan

521
00:27:12,234 --> 00:27:14,635
still suspect me,
just like they suspect Zhao Jikai.

522
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:16,555
Nevertheless,

523
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,635
I'm truly grateful for your trust

524
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:19,834
and efforts to keep me here.

525
00:27:20,194 --> 00:27:22,155
I believe with your excellence

526
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:23,635
and the excellence
of Huiquan Corporation,

527
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:24,995
it'll definitely attract

528
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:27,275
more outstanding talents
to join the company.

529
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:33,875
Are you sure about this?

530
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:36,755
Yes.

531
00:27:37,354 --> 00:27:38,755
I want to be willful once.

532
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:42,635
I sincerely wish Huiquan to flourish.

533
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:44,275
All right.

534
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:47,354
Until we meet again.

535
00:27:47,635 --> 00:27:48,434
Of course.

536
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:57,434
(I just love your carefree spirit.)

537
00:28:57,995 --> 00:28:58,714
(I'm serious.)

538
00:28:58,875 --> 00:28:59,915
(The more you're like this,)

539
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:01,234
(the more fascinated I become.)

540
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:23,474
Hello?

541
00:29:23,515 --> 00:29:24,354
(Lawyer Li,)

542
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,714
you told me

543
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:27,875
you would resign
as the Director of Legal Affairs.

544
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,114
(Have you taken care of it?)

545
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:30,434
Mr. Wang,

546
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:31,555
it's all done.

547
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:33,155
I can't believe you.

548
00:29:33,275 --> 00:29:34,155
If I were you,

549
00:29:34,194 --> 00:29:36,795
I would definitely choose
a large company like Huiquan.

550
00:29:36,954 --> 00:29:37,755
(It's a stable organization.)

551
00:29:38,954 --> 00:29:40,515
(You don't even want the position)

552
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:41,954
(of the Director of Legal Affairs
at Huiquan.)

553
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,714
(I really don't understand
what you were thinking.)

554
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:44,755
Mr. Wang,

555
00:29:45,155 --> 00:29:47,555
I still want to return
to a dedicated lawyer team.

556
00:29:47,714 --> 00:29:49,354
Advocating for clients in court

557
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,074
is the feeling I enjoy the most.

558
00:29:51,555 --> 00:29:52,275
I hope you can understand.

559
00:29:52,275 --> 00:29:52,995
(Of course.)

560
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,714
(Your return will certainly enhance)

561
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,395
(our law firm's professional team)

562
00:29:57,594 --> 00:29:58,594
(and achieve
even greater accomplishments.)

563
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:00,275
(To be honest,)

564
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:01,675
(your professional level is excellent,)

565
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:03,074
(and you can choose
whichever path you want.)

566
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:06,234
Apparently,
everything has been predetermined.

567
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:07,594
What?

568
00:30:08,915 --> 00:30:09,834
Nothing.

569
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,275
Thank you for your understanding.

570
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:14,915
(Before you had big clients like Huiquan,)

571
00:30:15,155 --> 00:30:17,555
and Zhao Jikai supported you from behind.

572
00:30:17,714 --> 00:30:20,314
But now you have
to start everything anew.

573
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:24,834
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

574
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:25,954
Goodbye.

575
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:41,915
(Management Weekly Meeting)
During my absence,

576
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,155
I'd like to thank
all of you present here

577
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:47,114
for leading your departments

578
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:48,714
and continuing your work

579
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,915
to ensure the company's operation

580
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:52,714
steadily moves forward.

581
00:30:53,755 --> 00:30:56,434
I'm grateful to all of you.

582
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,000
(Xiao Mu'en)

583
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,434
Today, I am feeling emotional.

584
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:14,155
After this turmoil,

585
00:31:15,675 --> 00:31:16,915
I want to stand up

586
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:20,275
and speak to everyone from my heart.

587
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:29,555
The chair behind me

588
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,275
(Yin Huiquan)

589
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:33,114
(Yin Huiquan)
appears glamorous.

590
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:35,035
You may think

591
00:31:36,114 --> 00:31:40,155
this represents power, dignity, and wealth.

592
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,834
But what you all don't know

593
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:46,635
is that there's a furnace
under the chair

594
00:31:48,275 --> 00:31:51,954
continuously burning the person sitting on it.

595
00:31:52,555 --> 00:31:56,074
Every second, every moment,

596
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:58,234
I feel a sense of crisis.

597
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:03,354
Many of you sitting here

598
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,515
may not feel it.

599
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:08,875
Because you're not in the position,

600
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:10,954
not involved in the decision-making,

601
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,275
not experiencing the situation,

602
00:32:14,314 --> 00:32:15,875
and not understanding the pain.

603
00:32:16,555 --> 00:32:18,915
I haven't been knocked down
by outsiders,

604
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:21,755
nor have I been brought down

605
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:23,194
by the covert attacks of competitors.

606
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:26,954
I did not succumb to the rapid pace
of the evolving era.

607
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:30,875
I fell into the hands of my own people.

608
00:32:34,275 --> 00:32:35,074
I don't need to tell you

609
00:32:35,755 --> 00:32:37,834
about what Zhao Jikai did.

610
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:42,354
It's already widespread in society.

611
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:44,035
(Wu Junhui)
We're in the internet industry.

612
00:32:44,954 --> 00:32:46,474
Once we are involved in this industry,

613
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:49,515
there are no secrets that can't be uncovered.

614
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:51,954
Let alone our current work,

615
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:54,354
which is closely monitored by the media.

616
00:32:54,795 --> 00:32:56,834
But I still don't understand

617
00:32:57,915 --> 00:33:00,675
the time it takes for anything
we do to escalate

618
00:33:01,995 --> 00:33:04,714
is actually faster than I imagined.

619
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:07,234
I even wonder

620
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:08,954
why our internal decisions

621
00:33:08,995 --> 00:33:10,234
and confidential matters

622
00:33:10,314 --> 00:33:12,875
are always leaked to the outside world
in the shortest possible time.

623
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:23,915
I consider Huiquan as my home.

624
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:26,995
But I cannot demand

625
00:33:27,314 --> 00:33:30,314
that all of you treat Huiquan as your home too.

626
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:35,714
So I bow to all of you here.

627
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:38,074
Mr. Yin.

628
00:33:38,155 --> 00:33:42,434
I hope all of you love this home.

629
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,594
Don't let it fall.

630
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:50,635
As the legal representative of Huiquan,

631
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:53,995
I take responsibility

632
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:56,714
for everything related to Huiquan.

633
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:58,194
About Zhao Jikai,

634
00:33:58,834 --> 00:34:01,035
I made a mistake in assessing
and employing people.

635
00:34:01,474 --> 00:34:04,275
I was too subjective and appointed

636
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:06,395
a manager who is not progressive

637
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:09,275
and let him sit in the position of CEO

638
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:10,674
for such a long time.

639
00:34:12,914 --> 00:34:14,714
It has caused losses to the company.

640
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,355
Because of my mistake,

641
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:19,874
I apologize to everyone.

642
00:34:21,275 --> 00:34:22,394
Mr. Yin, don't do this.

643
00:34:22,995 --> 00:34:25,075
We feel ashamed.

644
00:34:28,234 --> 00:34:31,355
I want to express
my heartfelt gratitude to Xiao Mu'en.

645
00:34:32,194 --> 00:34:34,315
Through your reports
in the past few days,

646
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:37,835
I've seen Xiao Mu'en's contributions
to the company

647
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:42,115
and the hope for Huiquan's future development.

648
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:45,194
So I want to announce something to all of you.

649
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:46,355
That is,

650
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:50,315
I'll transfer 5% of my personal shares in Huiquan

651
00:34:50,515 --> 00:34:54,674
to Mr. Xiao without condition as encouragement.

652
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:58,714
My fellow comrades,

653
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:02,035
there's no problem
with Huiquan's original intention.

654
00:35:02,115 --> 00:35:05,115
Everything about Huiquan is also fine.

655
00:35:05,315 --> 00:35:08,035
As long as we have firm confidence and unity,

656
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:10,515
we'll definitely achieve great success.

657
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,914
Thank you, everyone.

658
00:35:15,434 --> 00:35:17,154
Zhao Jikai has turned himself in.

659
00:35:17,275 --> 00:35:18,674
So when it comes
to the prosecution phase,

660
00:35:18,755 --> 00:35:20,634
I'll suggest lenient handling.

661
00:35:22,434 --> 00:35:24,154
You're not trying to go easy

662
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:25,595
on your best friend, are you?

663
00:35:27,035 --> 00:35:27,835
He Luyuan,

664
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:30,075
I don't joke about legal matters.

665
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:31,674
I'll need to hang up now.

666
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:33,995
Yitang,

667
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:37,914
what's wrong with you?

668
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:39,275
Have you been crying?

669
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,154
Your eyes are swollen.

670
00:35:42,595 --> 00:35:43,355
Don't look at me

671
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:45,154
with that sympathetic look.

672
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:48,115
Do you really think I would cry?

673
00:35:48,394 --> 00:35:49,555
It's just conjunctivitis.

674
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:52,555
You scared me.

675
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:53,914
I knew my free-spirited best friend

676
00:35:53,954 --> 00:35:55,394
won't be discouraged because of a man.

677
00:35:55,595 --> 00:35:55,914
Come.

678
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:56,595
Let's go inside.

679
00:35:58,634 --> 00:35:59,434
An Ni,

680
00:36:01,555 --> 00:36:04,914
have you been hoping for this day

681
00:36:05,474 --> 00:36:07,115
to come since you first met Zhao Jikai?

682
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:09,674
Since day one,

683
00:36:09,755 --> 00:36:11,515
you've been looking at him
with prejudice,

684
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:13,234
as if you were interrogating a criminal.

685
00:36:16,154 --> 00:36:17,914
I don't understand what you're saying.

686
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:19,755
When you and Zhao Jikai were together,

687
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:21,315
he treated you exceptionally well.

688
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:24,035
So I never interfered in your affairs.

689
00:36:24,275 --> 00:36:24,995
Why do you accuse me

690
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:26,914
of being prejudiced toward him?

691
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:31,075
Even if you didn't come
and see me today,

692
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:31,914
I would have come to you.

693
00:36:31,954 --> 00:36:33,075
Why do you want to see me?

694
00:36:33,474 --> 00:36:34,595
Are you afraid I'll break down

695
00:36:34,595 --> 00:36:35,714
and need comforting?

696
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:38,434
Or are you unable to face me?

697
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:43,115
Yitang,

698
00:36:46,914 --> 00:36:47,434
Zhao Jikai...

699
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:48,914
I know what you want to say.

700
00:36:52,115 --> 00:36:53,954
Emotional infidelity is an attempt

701
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:56,555
while physical infidelity
is a completed act.

702
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,115
But I don't want to discuss that now.

703
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,634
Since you already know about it,

704
00:37:03,194 --> 00:37:04,795
you should stay calm

705
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:06,355
and not let emotions cloud
your judgment.

706
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:09,035
I'm really curious.

707
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:10,115
An Ni,

708
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:12,474
are we best friends?

709
00:37:12,954 --> 00:37:13,954
Of course, we are.

710
00:37:14,194 --> 00:37:14,995
Then tell me

711
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:16,714
about the current status
of Zhao Jikai's case.

712
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:22,035
Yitang, you also study law.

713
00:37:22,154 --> 00:37:25,115
I would never cross the legal line.

714
00:37:25,315 --> 00:37:27,115
Look at you.

715
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:28,275
I just asked a question

716
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:30,434
and you're taking it to another level.

717
00:37:30,434 --> 00:37:32,874
I don't think we're best friends at all.

718
00:37:33,154 --> 00:37:33,995
Isn't "plastic sisters"
[*superficial friendship]

719
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:36,115
popular now?

720
00:37:36,394 --> 00:37:39,154
I think this term best describes

721
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:39,914
our friendship.

722
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:47,394
Enough, Yitang.

723
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:50,315
I can comfort you if you're unhappy.

724
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,315
It's okay
even if you can't control your emotions.

725
00:37:52,515 --> 00:37:54,275
But don't use such an attitude...

726
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:55,914
An Ni,

727
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:58,714
you're being hypocritical.

728
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:01,515
Do you really need to speak to me
in such a pretentious manner?

729
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:06,874
It seems whatever I say today
will upset you.

730
00:38:09,474 --> 00:38:10,874
You've actually guessed it right.

731
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,434
You do know me very well.

732
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:17,515
So you know that I love him too.

733
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:22,474
I simply want to find someone at my age

734
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:25,835
whom I could love to settle down with

735
00:38:26,154 --> 00:38:27,755
and live a peaceful
and happy life together.

736
00:38:32,234 --> 00:38:33,154
But he's not worth it.

737
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:34,434
I'm serious.

738
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:36,954
Since you know everything,

739
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:38,515
it's better to end it now.

740
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,515
Otherwise, he would implicate you.

741
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:42,234
I knew it.

742
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:44,674
This is what you are.

743
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,434
You pretend to act in my best interest

744
00:38:46,434 --> 00:38:50,474
as you cover up the pain you caused me.

745
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:52,674
Do you know

746
00:38:52,674 --> 00:38:54,035
how much I've sacrificed
in this relationship?

747
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:54,995
I know.

748
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:55,874
No, you don't.

749
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,634
You have no idea how much I loved him.

750
00:38:59,555 --> 00:39:00,954
I fantasized about marrying him.

751
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:02,795
I envisioned a future

752
00:39:02,795 --> 00:39:04,595
where we were married.

753
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:06,154
I've even considered

754
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,515
becoming a full-time housewife for him.

755
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:09,914
I have imagined thousands
of possibilities of happiness.

756
00:39:09,954 --> 00:39:12,075
But none of them turned out
to be like it is now.

757
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:16,075
But as my best friend,

758
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,555
you relentlessly pursued
and focused on Huiquan.

759
00:39:20,595 --> 00:39:21,234
No, that's not it.

760
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:22,595
To be precise,

761
00:39:23,474 --> 00:39:25,995
I should say you targeted Zhao Jikai.

762
00:39:26,555 --> 00:39:29,835
You brought him down without hesitation

763
00:39:29,995 --> 00:39:32,035
and personally shattered
my dreams and illusions.

764
00:39:32,194 --> 00:39:33,874
Zhang Wanru was your senior.

765
00:39:34,234 --> 00:39:35,555
So was mine.

766
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:36,714
But can your relationship with her

767
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:38,075
be compared to ours?

768
00:39:39,194 --> 00:39:40,674
I'm the best friend

769
00:39:40,714 --> 00:39:42,355
you've been telling everyone.

770
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:43,835
I understand you.

771
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:46,394
I know by doing this,

772
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:48,995
you may gain better recognition
than being in the top ten.

773
00:39:49,275 --> 00:39:50,555
Anything about your best friend

774
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:51,595
or your best friend's happiness

775
00:39:51,634 --> 00:39:53,115
meant nothing to you.

776
00:39:53,194 --> 00:39:54,674
Li Yitang, you're stabbing my heart

777
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:56,515
when you say these.

778
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:58,515
What benefit do you gain
from hurting me like this?

779
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:02,275
How about we play a game

780
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,474
we used to love playing
at the university,

781
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:04,714
"Truth or Dare?"

782
00:40:09,515 --> 00:40:10,714
It won't be troublesome.

783
00:40:10,954 --> 00:40:12,595
Just make a choice.

784
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,674
After all, you're the only one who can choose now.

785
00:40:19,075 --> 00:40:19,434
Fine.

786
00:40:19,515 --> 00:40:20,555
I'll play.

787
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,474
I know Zhao Jikai
has confessed to his crime.

788
00:40:26,115 --> 00:40:27,075
He's not the kind of person

789
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:29,674
who would commit any major offenses.

790
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:31,795
At most, he'll get a few years
and then be released from prison.

791
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,394
I just want to know,

792
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,914
since he turned himself in until now,

793
00:40:35,954 --> 00:40:37,634
you should have detained him, right?

794
00:40:38,154 --> 00:40:39,795
Given his current situation,

795
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:41,634
can you arrange for his release on bail?

796
00:40:41,634 --> 00:40:42,995
We will ensure a fair handling
of the case.

797
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:44,154
Just as I expected,

798
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:45,995
you never disappoint.

799
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,355
I, Li Yitang, am worthless

800
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:54,835
in front of your work
and the law you believe in.

801
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:56,394
What's the point of this?

802
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:57,355
There's a point in this.

803
00:40:57,434 --> 00:40:58,914
How can there not be?

804
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:01,835
It's like the two of us
always walking the same path

805
00:41:01,874 --> 00:41:04,315
like the two of us having only one option.

806
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:05,674
You always choose the truth

807
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,234
while I always choose to take risks.

808
00:41:08,714 --> 00:41:09,914
It's quite ironic

809
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,154
as if everything was predestined.

810
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:15,954
Back when we were in university,

811
00:41:16,394 --> 00:41:17,355
I fantasized about a day

812
00:41:17,355 --> 00:41:18,714
when we would face each other

813
00:41:18,714 --> 00:41:20,555
in court for real,

814
00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:22,315
who would win in the end?

815
00:41:23,115 --> 00:41:24,835
Today, I came here to tell you

816
00:41:25,595 --> 00:41:28,954
that I have taken up Zhao Jikai's defense.

817
00:41:31,154 --> 00:41:35,194
We can forget about our friendship.

818
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:41,434
An Ni,

819
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,595
I used to care about you a lot.

820
00:41:49,154 --> 00:41:50,555
But now,

821
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:53,434
I hate you even more.

822
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:14,874
Hello?

823
00:42:14,995 --> 00:42:15,874
(Hello, Ni.)

824
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:17,154
Can you come back to the office?

825
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,115
I have something to tell you.

826
00:42:19,234 --> 00:42:20,555
I just arrived home.

827
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:21,795
If it's not something urgent,

828
00:42:21,795 --> 00:42:22,595
we can talk tomorrow.

829
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:24,355
Tomorrow will be too late.

830
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:24,914
I'm serious.

831
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:26,035
I'm not messing around with you.

832
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:27,234
This is a matter of great importance.
