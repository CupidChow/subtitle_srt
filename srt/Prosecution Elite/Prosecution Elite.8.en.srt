15
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:41,124
Everyone knows what's after that.

16
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:43,283
There are tons of media interviews
and articles about him online.

17
00:01:45,764 --> 00:01:47,684
That's pretty impressive.

18
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:50,243
He went from being a casual worker

19
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,684
to establishing his own studio

20
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:52,523
and now becoming

21
00:01:52,523 --> 00:01:54,523
the CEO of the Huiquan Corporation.

22
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:56,324
Remarkable, isn't he?

23
00:01:57,203 --> 00:01:58,803
He's indeed capable. It's no wonder

24
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:00,883
your eyes light up
whenever you talk about him.

25
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:04,203
Oh, stop teasing me.

26
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:07,444
I want a boyfriend

27
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:10,284
who I can look up to.

28
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:11,603
Not someone equal

29
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,523
or beneath me.

30
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:14,684
Indeed,

31
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:18,044
all your ex-boyfriends were impressive,
one after another.

32
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:20,844
You're mocking me again, aren't you?

33
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,243
I'm not like you

34
00:02:22,243 --> 00:02:24,083
who's completely focused on work
and studies.

35
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,243
You never had a serious relationship.

36
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:28,044
Listen to me.

37
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:32,044
Yes, it's important
for a woman to be independent.

38
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:34,643
But you can't neglect
your romantic life.

39
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,684
Women are like water.

40
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:38,603
They need the nourishment of love.

41
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:40,924
I can't do that. I can't imagine

42
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:43,243
myself dating as you do.

43
00:02:46,764 --> 00:02:49,443
So what do you know about Xiao Mu'en?

44
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:50,484
(Darling,)

45
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:52,603
(dissolve Xiao Mu'en's team quickly)

46
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:53,564
(and put him on the sideline.)

47
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:56,083
Are you serious?

48
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,443
I'm asking about Xiao Mu'en,
and you're thinking about Zhao Jikai?

49
00:02:58,643 --> 00:03:01,044
No, I wasn't.

50
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:02,443
Why?

51
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:07,083
Are you interested
in this young entrepreneur?

52
00:03:07,204 --> 00:03:08,284
That's not the reason.

53
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,044
Mainly, it's because he's...

54
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:14,044
I can't quite put it into words.
But he's pretty mysterious.

55
00:03:14,324 --> 00:03:16,443
Besides, he's been very nice to me.

56
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,484
Listen here.

57
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:22,603
As far as I know,

58
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,883
Xiao Mu'en grew up in Zhejiang.

59
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:27,243
That place is known
for producing talented individuals.

60
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:29,803
And he was a top student
since childhood.

61
00:03:29,924 --> 00:03:32,204
He's even more successful
after studying abroad.

62
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:35,484
He's truly a rare young talent.

63
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:36,684
Why don't you

64
00:03:37,443 --> 00:03:38,324
give it a go?

65
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,044
I better not.

66
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,484
Do you feel better now after talking?

67
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:52,603
If you are,
you can wash up and go to bed.

68
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:56,883
After all that crying,

69
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,803
your eyes are swollen now.

70
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:00,324
You won't look pretty tomorrow.

71
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:07,324
You're home?

72
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:07,684
Yes.

73
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,723
Dad, you just got back too?

74
00:04:09,723 --> 00:04:10,844
I'll cook something for you.

75
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:12,803
Thanks. I can do it myself.

76
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:16,523
Sleep early, and don't stay up too late.

77
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:21,884
Dad.

78
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,483
If it's not important,
we can discuss it tomorrow.

79
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:25,684
Dad,

80
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,844
I still want
to persuade you one more time.

81
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:31,844
Why don't you quit your job at Huiquan?

82
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:36,043
You're a renowned retired academician
with great accomplishments.

83
00:04:36,444 --> 00:04:38,684
Why do you have to go and work
for this controversial company

84
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:40,523
and earn dirty money?

85
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,284
Why won't you heed my advice

86
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:43,844
after I said this many times?

87
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:46,724
I've also been telling you

88
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,323
to stop making me worry about you.

89
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:54,523
If you can handle everything yourself,

90
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:56,243
do I still need

91
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:58,284
to work so hard at this age?

92
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:00,724
Dirty money?

93
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:02,243
Go and earn it for me then.

94
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:03,083
Listen here.

95
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,643
Only with this money

96
00:05:04,884 --> 00:05:06,523
can I buy you a house.

97
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:09,243
So I can rest in peace when I die

98
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:12,323
and face your mom.

99
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:14,404
Dad,

100
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:17,284
I've been doing this job
for several years.

101
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:18,604
Since mom passed away,

102
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,083
we have no secrets between us.

103
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,284
You know exactly

104
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,124
how much money I've made.

105
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:26,684
It's enough to support
a young girl like me.

106
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,164
Don't you think your reasoning just now

107
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,284
was a bit far-fetched?

108
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:36,564
I admit.

109
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,323
You've been making money
to support yourself

110
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:42,164
by becoming an internet celebrity
for these two years.

111
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:44,404
But is this

112
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,284
a legitimate and stable career?

113
00:05:47,444 --> 00:05:48,444
You're already 26.

114
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:50,363
Can you keep doing this until you're 46

115
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:51,284
or 56?

116
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:53,923
If the internet trends change one day

117
00:05:54,164 --> 00:05:55,404
and people like you
are no longer popular,

118
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:56,243
what will you do then?

119
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,724
I hope you'll think it through

120
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:02,203
and figure out what you really want

121
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:04,284
and what you want to do.

122
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:07,124
You need to have a long-term plan
for yourself.

123
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,083
Dad,

124
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,004
I can do it until I'm 46

125
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:11,483
and even 56

126
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,124
because this is what you taught me.

127
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:17,004
I only want justice.

128
00:06:17,564 --> 00:06:19,124
I'll cover issues
where justice is not met,

129
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:20,164
like Shi Xiaohu

130
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:21,483
and Zhang Xiaobei.

131
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:24,844
Zhang Xiaobei?

132
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:28,444
Zhang Xiaobei had caused you
so much trouble.

133
00:06:29,164 --> 00:06:30,604
Shi Xiaohu is already dead

134
00:06:30,604 --> 00:06:32,844
and the court has concluded the trial.

135
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,564
Why are you still hanging on it?

136
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:35,884
Dad,

137
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:38,643
You're a renowned legal expert.

138
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:40,483
So tell me now.

139
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:42,243
Did Shi Xiaohu and Zhang Xiaobei,

140
00:06:42,363 --> 00:06:44,483
these two individuals
truly receive justice?

141
00:06:44,763 --> 00:06:45,363
You...

142
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,124
You're out of control!

143
00:06:49,604 --> 00:06:50,483
Who determines what is lawful

144
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:52,363
and who is god?

145
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:55,203
I'm going to bed, Dad.

146
00:06:56,564 --> 00:06:57,164
You...

147
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:02,404
(Huiquan Corporation)
(Recently,)

148
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,203
(the highly publicized
personal injury compensation case)

149
00:07:05,363 --> 00:07:08,043
(between Huiquan Technology
and Shi Xiaohu in Jiangcheng)

150
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:09,643
(has finally come to a close today.)

151
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:10,604
Mr. Zhao,

152
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,323
Li Yitang...

153
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,243
- has already...
- (A settlement was reached on the spot)

154
00:07:14,363 --> 00:07:15,243
(between the plaintiff Zhan Mei
and the defendant.)

155
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,083
(This also means)

156
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:17,363
(their usual uncompromising approach...)

157
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:17,844
Professor Luo,

158
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:19,724
calm down for now.

159
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:20,564
Take a seat and tell me about it.

160
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:22,680
(Huiquan Corporation which is
facing legal disputes, has its head down.)

161
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:28,643
This matter

162
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:29,964
is extremely serious.

163
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:31,884
Although reaching a settlement
is a small issue,

164
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:33,803
the negative factors

165
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,523
it brings to public opinion

166
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,564
will cascade like an avalanche.

167
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:39,243
It's like a domino effect.

168
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:40,284
When one falls

169
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:41,844
and the next one follows,

170
00:07:41,884 --> 00:07:44,083
creating a series of chain reactions.

171
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:45,643
This unfavorable public opinion

172
00:07:45,724 --> 00:07:46,483
will develop

173
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,844
in the direction that we least desire.

174
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,004
I understand what you mean.

175
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:52,724
You're referring to Zhang Xiaobei.

176
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:54,043
About Zhang Xiaobei,

177
00:07:54,124 --> 00:07:54,564
we don't know

178
00:07:55,203 --> 00:07:56,923
if he's dead or alive now.

179
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:00,363
But the public assumes
that he's already dead.

180
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:01,763
After some time passes,

181
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:04,444
people will gradually forget
about Zhang Xiaobei.

182
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:05,523
However, today's incident

183
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,243
has once again pushed Huiquan

184
00:08:07,483 --> 00:08:09,164
into the face of the public.

185
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,564
This matter

186
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:12,923
will make people think

187
00:08:13,444 --> 00:08:15,923
that Huiquan Group is backing down

188
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,724
and think

189
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,724
that we're feeling guilty.

190
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:21,164
Professor Luo,

191
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:24,284
we'll discuss Li Yitang's matter later.

192
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:26,483
I believe she has her reasons.

193
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:30,164
Professor Luo,

194
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:32,323
please share your thoughts.

195
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:34,924
What should we do next?

196
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:40,523
Resolving legal disputes

197
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:44,284
can often be simplified

198
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:45,643
and minimize losses

199
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:48,044
through financial settlements.

200
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:50,044
The media

201
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,883
will quickly bring up
Zhang Xiaobei's past.

202
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:56,083
So we must stay ahead of them

203
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:58,844
and reach an agreement
with Zhang Xiaobei's father

204
00:08:59,044 --> 00:09:01,724
and have him provide a written document

205
00:09:01,763 --> 00:09:03,724
proving that Zhang Xiaobei's death

206
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,164
was caused by himself and his family

207
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:09,203
and had nothing to do with any products

208
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,643
under Huiquan Corporation.

209
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:13,244
We can shift to being proactive
than getting our hands tied this way.

210
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:16,323
I don't think it's easy

211
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:18,443
to deal with Zhang Xiaobei's father.

212
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,044
He won't simply provide us

213
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,683
with a written agreement.

214
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:23,044
Zhang Xiaobei's father resides

215
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:24,683
in the hospital all year round.

216
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:26,964
Their family is in great need of money.

217
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:27,563
Yes,

218
00:09:27,844 --> 00:09:29,763
it's precisely because he needs money

219
00:09:29,844 --> 00:09:31,443
that he keeps coming back for more.

220
00:09:31,643 --> 00:09:33,164
It's like an endless pit.

221
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:37,443
Professor Luo,

222
00:09:37,964 --> 00:09:40,083
you're an expert in law.

223
00:09:40,883 --> 00:09:42,284
Is there any way

224
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:44,164
where we can give him money

225
00:09:44,404 --> 00:09:46,083
and ensure that Zhang Xiaobei's father

226
00:09:46,284 --> 00:09:47,883
never troubles us again?

227
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:51,123
Is there any?

228
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,060
(Certain coastal town)

229
00:10:11,364 --> 00:10:12,563
Big Dog recommended me here.

230
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:23,763
Don't flash that torch at me, pal.

231
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:25,724
We're on the same side.
Big Dog told me about this place.

232
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:27,123
He told me to come.

233
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:29,844
Yeah, Big Dog did mention that.

234
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,244
With the efforts of the prosecutors,

235
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:35,604
we have indeed identified

236
00:10:35,804 --> 00:10:37,604
several game accounts highly suspected
to belong to Zhang Xiaobei

237
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:38,804
through Shi Xiaohu's gaming account.

238
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:41,763
These accounts have accumulated
a high amount of spending in the game.

239
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:42,964
We've also discovered

240
00:10:43,123 --> 00:10:44,323
that all the real names registered
behind these accounts

241
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:46,404
are university students.

242
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:48,323
What's even stranger is

243
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:49,443
these university students

244
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,364
all come from the same university,

245
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:52,443
which is Jiangcheng University.

246
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:54,523
Is it possible to quickly locate

247
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:55,683
these university students

248
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:56,643
and investigate

249
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:58,364
the source of their funds for spending?

250
00:10:58,724 --> 00:10:59,844
All right, I understand.

251
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,244
One more thing,

252
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,083
we don't rule out the possibility

253
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:05,844
that these funds are mostly
from illegal online loans,

254
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,924
and it may have even spread
to Jiangcheng University.

255
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:11,203
If our speculation is true,

256
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,604
we must get root out

257
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:13,724
this cancerous tumor thoroughly.

258
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,364
Or else the consequences
will be unimaginable.

259
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,364
Moreover, the nature of this case

260
00:11:17,563 --> 00:11:18,404
is not simply

261
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:19,964
about illegal online lending.

262
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:21,523
This time,

263
00:11:21,563 --> 00:11:23,683
we're collaborating
with the prosecutors,

264
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:25,563
and I hope we can work together

265
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:27,724
to turn this case into a solid
and successful one.

266
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,763
Now, let's hear from Prosecutor An

267
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:32,364
where she'll share the information
that the prosecution has obtained.

268
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:34,443
Han Xuan.

269
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,427
(Investigation Supervision
and Coordination Office)

270
00:11:39,443 --> 00:11:41,844
Firstly, these illegal online lending
organizations

271
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:44,523
(Establish Project)
will first establish a project

272
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,323
and then purchase personal information

273
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:48,484
through illegal channels,
reaching countless individuals.

274
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:51,044
Some are even professionals
in their field of work.

275
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,763
Then they would use
more special channels

276
00:11:53,804 --> 00:11:56,044
to obtain
more precise personal information.

277
00:11:56,484 --> 00:11:58,203
This way, they achieve
a high success rate

278
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,123
without leaving any loose ends.

279
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:01,123
So the key focus
of our investigation this time

280
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:02,244
is to trace the sources

281
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,003
of this personal information
from top to bottom.

282
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:04,924
Other than that,

283
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:07,203
they would arrange
for some customer service personnel

284
00:12:07,323 --> 00:12:08,964
to communicate with the customers.

285
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:11,123
However, based on their habit

286
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:12,643
of evading the law
and avoiding investigation,

287
00:12:12,844 --> 00:12:15,804
they would minimize their traces
and lure customers

288
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:18,284
who are hooked on specific Apps
to other platforms

289
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:19,724
where they could provide loans.

290
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:21,364
This means they will choose

291
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:24,643
to conduct these illegal activities

292
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:26,164
in a local network or private network.

293
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,563
So if a stranger wants to apply
for a loan,

294
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:30,083
they must have a referral
from someone they know.

295
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:32,443
This is the general situation so far.

296
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,323
Not bad.

297
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:39,523
This chart is well-made.

298
00:12:39,643 --> 00:12:40,683
Teach me later.

299
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:41,763
It's a piece of cake.

300
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,083
This is called a visual chart.

301
00:12:43,123 --> 00:12:43,804
I need to go out for a while.

302
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:45,484
It's a required course

303
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,083
for young prosecutors

304
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:47,643
and a basic skill requirement.

305
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,323
When An Ni handles complex cases,

306
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:50,523
especially

307
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:51,683
those involving multiple individuals,

308
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:52,844
extensive financial transactions,

309
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,443
and complex organizational relationships,

310
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:56,443
she would require us
to use visual charts.

311
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:58,284
It's not only useful for our prosecution

312
00:12:58,404 --> 00:13:00,563
but also provides a clear overview
during analysis.

313
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:01,964
If you have to read the case files,

314
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:02,883
you have to flip through the pages.

315
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,044
Just as you remember the current point,

316
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,244
you forget the previous one

317
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:06,683
and you have to go back and look again.

318
00:13:06,763 --> 00:13:07,763
It's so troublesome.

319
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:18,044
An Ni.

320
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:19,604
Mr. Xiao,

321
00:13:20,523 --> 00:13:21,883
why are you here?

322
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,844
Xiaojiao said she was waiting for me
at the entrance.

323
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,044
I asked Xiaojiao a favor to text you

324
00:13:27,044 --> 00:13:27,883
asking you to come down.

325
00:13:28,044 --> 00:13:29,443
I wanted to ask you out for dinner.

326
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:31,323
But she said
you're working overtime tonight.

327
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:33,643
So I thought of bringing you
some takeaway.

328
00:13:34,284 --> 00:13:35,364
You don't have to do this.

329
00:13:35,724 --> 00:13:38,044
Who could be looking for An Ni
at this hour?

330
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:39,404
See that guy?

331
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,643
That's Mr. Xiao from Huibo.

332
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:42,364
He's obviously pursuing An Ni.

333
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:44,003
This is the biggest news

334
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:45,563
I've heard recently.

335
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:46,683
Has he succeeded?

336
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:47,924
Almost, more or less.

337
00:13:48,003 --> 00:13:49,563
Anyway, I think
it's just a matter of time.

338
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,804
They're both good-looking

339
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:53,964
and seem like a perfect match.

340
00:13:54,044 --> 00:13:55,643
Han Xuan, stop gossiping.

341
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:57,244
Go and help An Ni carry the things.

342
00:13:58,164 --> 00:13:59,044
Okay.

343
00:14:07,123 --> 00:14:07,804
Here's the soup

344
00:14:07,844 --> 00:14:08,804
and some other things.

345
00:14:08,924 --> 00:14:10,203
I don't know what you guys like to eat.

346
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:11,244
So I just randomly bought some.

347
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:11,964
Wait, it's...

348
00:14:13,683 --> 00:14:14,323
Thank you.

349
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:15,563
All right, then.

350
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,404
I won't get in the way of your work now.

351
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:18,604
We'll go out some other day.

352
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:19,203
Okay.

353
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:20,244
See you.

354
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:25,044
Ms. Xiao, thank you for the food.

355
00:14:25,683 --> 00:14:26,284
No, thank you.

356
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,404
Why did you come down here?

357
00:14:36,123 --> 00:14:37,724
Captain He told me to come and help out.

358
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,763
You're pretty quick
when it comes to food.

359
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:44,203
You were never this fast when it comes
to reviewing the documents.

360
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:46,203
Where did Captain He see us?

361
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:48,203
Why did he even let you come down here?

362
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:49,484
He looked through the window

363
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,203
and slacked off.

364
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:53,563
Oh, God.

365
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:58,523
Time to enjoy some hot meals.

366
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,364
It smells good.

367
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:02,763
I heard

368
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:04,804
we get to enjoy this meal

369
00:15:04,964 --> 00:15:06,244
because of An Ni.

370
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:08,844
Han Xuan,
what nonsense did you tell them?

371
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:10,964
Not bad.

372
00:15:10,964 --> 00:15:11,844
There's soup too.

373
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,244
My master happens
to have a stomach problem.

374
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:14,484
Can you give him a bowl?

375
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,523
This one is specially prepared.

376
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,404
An Ni, have some soup.

377
00:15:20,844 --> 00:15:22,244
Where's Captain He?

378
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:23,563
He went out to make a call.

379
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,164
Come in.

380
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:40,083
Professor Luo, you're back.

381
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,643
Have you met Zhang Xiaobei's father?

382
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:46,123
Yeah.

383
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:51,883
Don't tell me he didn't sign.

384
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,044
He told me

385
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:56,284
to drop dead.

386
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,044
I didn't expect

387
00:16:00,724 --> 00:16:03,523
there's still someone
who would choose death

388
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:05,804
over money.

389
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:07,604
Professor Luo,

390
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:10,523
what did he say to you?

391
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:13,883
Sigh.

392
00:16:14,484 --> 00:16:15,284
Mr. Zhao,

393
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,244
listen to this.

394
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:20,804
(Huiquan Corporation
Humanitarian Compensation Agreement)

395
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:23,364
(You don't need to put on a show here.)

396
00:16:23,563 --> 00:16:26,763
Right now, I don't even know
if my son is alive or dead,

397
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:28,563
and you're rushing me

398
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:30,523
to use my son's life
to exchange for money.

399
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:33,244
For goodness sake,

400
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:35,164
you've misunderstood our intention.

401
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:37,003
Huiquan Corporation

402
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:40,203
is providing
humanitarian assistance to you

403
00:16:40,244 --> 00:16:42,123
without any additional conditions.

404
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:45,364
This is our chairman,

405
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:47,164
Mr. Yin's good intentions.

406
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:48,964
- Don't worry.
- Oh, cut it out.

407
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:51,244
If there are no conditions,

408
00:16:51,404 --> 00:16:52,404
so why do you want me

409
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,443
to sign this contract?

410
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:56,643
I may not understand the law.

411
00:16:57,203 --> 00:16:58,604
But I'm not blind.

412
00:16:59,523 --> 00:17:00,604
I can see

413
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:02,763
that you have ulterior motives.

414
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:04,964
Why do you always

415
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:06,323
treat us

416
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:08,563
with this prejudiced attitude?

417
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,163
It's actually very simple.

418
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:12,364
You just need to sign here.

419
00:17:12,644 --> 00:17:13,764
Then this one million yuan cash

420
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:14,484
will quickly

421
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:15,244
be deposited into your account.

422
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:17,524
But it clearly states on your contract

423
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:19,403
that it's compensation requested

424
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:20,803
by me.

425
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:23,524
When did I ask
for compensation from you?

426
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:28,163
This is just a legal term.

427
00:17:28,364 --> 00:17:28,923
Get lost.

428
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:30,923
(Leave now.)

429
00:17:34,524 --> 00:17:35,803
I didn't expect

430
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:37,443
it's hard to deal with this old man.

431
00:17:39,364 --> 00:17:39,764
Professor Luo,

432
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,283
what do you think

433
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:43,964
we should do next?

434
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:47,323
I just reported

435
00:17:47,683 --> 00:17:50,043
this matter to Mr. Yin.

436
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:52,323
He didn't give a clear answer.

437
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:54,004
He only said

438
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:55,524
he'll give us a call later.

439
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:07,683
Hello, Mr. Yin.

440
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:09,163
Ah, yes.

441
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,724
Professor Luo is with me.

442
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:12,604
Okay.

443
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:17,364
Mr. Yin, you can start now.

444
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,604
Professor Luo,

445
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:22,124
we went with a sincere heart.

446
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:24,083
Even if the negotiation
didn't turn out well,

447
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,563
there's no need to end it
in such an embarrassment.

448
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,004
What exactly did you say

449
00:18:29,563 --> 00:18:31,163
to Zhang Xiaobei's father

450
00:18:31,604 --> 00:18:33,364
that made him so angry?

451
00:18:34,604 --> 00:18:35,964
Mr. Yin,

452
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:38,244
our initial communication

453
00:18:38,403 --> 00:18:39,644
went very smoothly.

454
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:41,923
It's because of that contract.

455
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:43,043
- It...
- Contract?

456
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:44,764
What contract?

457
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,323
Mr. Yin,

458
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:47,484
it's nothing.

459
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:48,923
It's just

460
00:18:49,203 --> 00:18:50,644
It's just a compensation agreement.

461
00:18:50,803 --> 00:18:52,443
He signs it, and we give him money.

462
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:53,484
(It's that simple.)

463
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:55,644
I was talking to Professor Luo.

464
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:58,964
(Professor Luo,)

465
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:00,163
(does that mean)

466
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:01,803
(you drafted that contract?)

467
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:03,083
Yes,

468
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,163
I personally drafted it.

469
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:05,884
(But)

470
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,163
(Zhang Xiaobei's father refused)

471
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,484
(our request)

472
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:11,283
(for humanitarian compensation)

473
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:13,964
and refused to sign the contract.

474
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:15,403
(That's strange.)

475
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:19,163
Who would refuse free money?

476
00:19:21,004 --> 00:19:22,524
(Tell me the truth.)

477
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,484
(What did you do)

478
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:25,563
(with the contract?)

479
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:29,443
Mr. Yin, you see,

480
00:19:29,683 --> 00:19:31,524
we think

481
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,923
that simply giving money as compensation

482
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:35,844
is not a long-term solution.

483
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:37,764
(He wants money this time.)

484
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:38,604
Who knows

485
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:40,203
what demands he'll make next time?

486
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:42,043
It's like an endless pit.

487
00:19:42,443 --> 00:19:43,244
So Professor Luo

488
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:46,644
made some minor adjustments

489
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:48,124
within the limits of the law.

490
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:48,964
First,

491
00:19:48,964 --> 00:19:49,644
we made the reason

492
00:19:49,683 --> 00:19:53,004
for providing compensation vague.

493
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:54,524
At the same time,

494
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:56,283
we also added a clause

495
00:19:56,484 --> 00:19:59,043
to compensate
according to the other party's demands.

496
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,364
We also offered a price

497
00:20:01,364 --> 00:20:03,803
that far exceeds the normal range.

498
00:20:03,884 --> 00:20:04,323
So

499
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:06,124
once he signs it,

500
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:08,644
it'll be considered extortion.

501
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,043
Then we'll have a legal reason

502
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,443
to send him to jail.

503
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:12,604
Outrageous!

504
00:20:13,283 --> 00:20:16,163
Do you know
the nature of what you're doing?

505
00:20:16,203 --> 00:20:17,403
It's murder!

506
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:19,844
(Who allowed you)

507
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,923
(to use the law to take lives
into your own hands?)

508
00:20:24,203 --> 00:20:26,724
Do you realize

509
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:27,323
the consequences Huiquan Corporation

510
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:28,803
and I will face

511
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:31,203
once this matter is exposed?

512
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:34,484
Mr. Yin,

513
00:20:35,923 --> 00:20:37,323
please don't be upset.

514
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:38,764
Let me explain.

515
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:40,884
(Please believe)

516
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,563
(in my integrity as a legal professional.)

517
00:20:43,803 --> 00:20:45,203
We definitely won't do

518
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:47,604
such despicable things.

519
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,644
Even if it doesn't violate the law,

520
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:51,803
we would never do it.

521
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:54,443
Our original intention

522
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,004
was to give the money.

523
00:20:57,683 --> 00:20:58,524
But

524
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,364
Mr. Zhao's concerns are also valid.

525
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,043
If the other party is an endless pit,

526
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:05,163
it would be very detrimental

527
00:21:05,283 --> 00:21:06,764
to Huiquan's future.

528
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:08,244
So we took

529
00:21:08,443 --> 00:21:11,004
extra precautions
to ensure additional protection.

530
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:12,644
Mr. Yin,

531
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:14,923
if that old man takes the money

532
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:17,244
and does what he's supposed to do,

533
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,163
we won't send him to jail.

534
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:19,884
Am I right?

535
00:21:19,964 --> 00:21:22,403
But if he causes any trouble,

536
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:24,724
then this agreement

537
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:26,644
becomes a means of control for him.

538
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,244
For Professor Luo to think of this

539
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:30,563
is also for the sake of Huiquan.

540
00:21:30,604 --> 00:21:31,524
(Enough!)

541
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:34,604
I've heard enough.

542
00:21:35,644 --> 00:21:36,644
(Remember this.)

543
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:40,364
From now on, I don't want such things
to happen again.

544
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:43,644
Also, no one in the company

545
00:21:43,884 --> 00:21:47,124
is allowed to contact these people
without my permission.

546
00:21:47,124 --> 00:21:49,923
Since they have refused
our compensation,

547
00:21:50,244 --> 00:21:52,563
let's put an end to this matter

548
00:21:53,443 --> 00:21:55,644
and handle the remaining issues
thoroughly

549
00:21:55,964 --> 00:21:57,323
without any loose ends.

550
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:05,163
This midnight snack is delicious.

551
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:07,724
It's especially delicious.

552
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:09,724
Better than the food at our cafeteria.

553
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:10,884
What's the matter, Chief Bai?

554
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:11,563
Thank you, Ms. An.

555
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:13,124
Thank you, Ms. An.

556
00:22:13,163 --> 00:22:14,163
I'll be hanging up now, sir.

557
00:22:14,604 --> 00:22:15,004
Captain He,

558
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,644
are you hungry?
Do you want to eat anything?

559
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:17,764
We'll talk about that later.

560
00:22:18,364 --> 00:22:19,203
You guys can enjoy your food

561
00:22:19,244 --> 00:22:20,203
while I make an announcement.

562
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:22,604
I just consulted Chief Bai.

563
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:25,724
We need to send two colleagues
to Jiangcheng University

564
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:27,043
To investigate the involvement
of the students

565
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,844
in illegal online lending.

566
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,043
To avoid causing panic
among the students,

567
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,443
we need to send two young colleagues.

568
00:22:33,964 --> 00:22:36,403
So An Ni and I will go.

569
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:38,443
Wait a minute.

570
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:39,484
What did you just say?

571
00:22:39,844 --> 00:22:40,964
Young colleagues?

572
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:45,484
Come on, look at your face.
Is your skin still producing collagen?

573
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:46,964
Look at me.

574
00:22:47,043 --> 00:22:48,004
When Ni and I are together,

575
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,764
now that's youth and sunshine.

576
00:22:50,964 --> 00:22:52,203
If I'm with her,

577
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:54,203
won't it highlight her youth
and radiance even more?

578
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:55,124
Oh, cut it out.

579
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,524
You guys talk too much.

580
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:57,803
Go and eat your food.

581
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,043
Here, have some soup.

582
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,644
Soup is good for your stomach.

583
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:01,803
Thank you.

584
00:23:01,803 --> 00:23:02,604
Ni,

585
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:05,163
why does Captain He
get to enjoy the soup?

586
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,563
Is the food in your hand
not enough for you?

587
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:09,124
You can have this then.

588
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:12,524
Oh, never mind.
You can just save it for Captain He.

589
00:23:13,964 --> 00:23:15,124
What's your problem?

590
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:18,844
Go back and revise it.

591
00:23:18,844 --> 00:23:20,124
Work hard in revising it.

592
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:21,724
Hello, sir.

593
00:23:21,724 --> 00:23:22,764
Hi, guys.

594
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,323
I'd like to know if anyone

595
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,964
from this university applied for loans.

596
00:23:26,644 --> 00:23:27,124
- Yes.
- There are.

597
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:27,403
Quite a number of them.

598
00:23:27,563 --> 00:23:28,964
Can I record our conversation?

599
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:30,244
I want to collect information.

600
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,724
Do you consent?

601
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:34,203
- Sure.
- Yeah.

602
00:23:34,244 --> 00:23:35,283
All right, thank you.

603
00:23:35,964 --> 00:23:37,604
You mentioned that there are students
who borrowed loans.

604
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:38,803
There are a lot of them in our class.

605
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:39,524
As long as you have a mobile phone,

606
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:40,964
you can use it like this.

607
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,683
Are you collecting bank cards?

608
00:23:45,443 --> 00:23:47,203
I study
at Jiangcheng University's branch.

609
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:49,844
I have two cards with me, bro.

610
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:51,124
Can you give me more money?

611
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,004
I'm in urgent need of money.

612
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,604
(Credit Lending)

613
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:54,844
(Credit Lending)
My university classmates

614
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:56,124
all have bank cards.

615
00:23:56,163 --> 00:23:57,403
I can introduce them to you later.

616
00:23:57,923 --> 00:23:59,403
Just give me more money, bro.

617
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:00,844
I really need
to use the money urgently.

618
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:04,443
You can trust my university classmates.

619
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,083
If you need cards,
I have plenty of them.

620
00:24:07,124 --> 00:24:07,683
Teacher,

621
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:08,923
excuse me.

622
00:24:09,043 --> 00:24:11,083
I'm Prosecutor An Ni
from Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

623
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:13,283
I'd like to inquire about the situation
of university students

624
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:15,683
in this city regarding online loans.

625
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:17,364
Sorry to interrupt, teacher.

626
00:24:17,364 --> 00:24:18,524
Can I record our conversation?

627
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,244
Sure, you can.

628
00:24:19,244 --> 00:24:19,923
Thank you.

629
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,923
You mentioned the situation
of online loans.

630
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:22,923
It's quite common.

631
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:23,803
How much did you reload

632
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:25,563
to get this blade?

633
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,683
About four to five thousand.

634
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:28,683
Four to five thousand?

635
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,443
You're lucky.

636
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:32,163
I guess so.

637
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:33,923
Some didn't get it even
after reloading seven to eight thousand.

638
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:35,083
I reloaded more

639
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,124
than five thousand.

640
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:37,203
Not over six thousand.

641
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:38,644
You're pretty lucky too.

642
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,283
You could say that.

643
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:40,043
But not as lucky as you.

644
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:41,283
Here you go, guys.

645
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:42,203
You can leave it here.

646
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:43,403
- Thanks, man.
- Thanks.

647
00:24:44,403 --> 00:24:45,163
Excuse me.

648
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:46,563
Hello.

649
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:49,403
I'm Prosecutor An Ni
from Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

650
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:50,803
I want to ask

651
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:52,964
if you're familiar with campus loans.

652
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:55,644
How much money
do you spend on gaming in a month?

653
00:24:55,923 --> 00:24:58,644
We spend about seven to eight thousand.

654
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:00,203
Seven to eight thousand?

655
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:02,364
What does your family do?

656
00:25:02,403 --> 00:25:03,923
How much pocket money
do you receive in a month?

657
00:25:04,403 --> 00:25:06,443
The money from home is not enough.

658
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:08,203
But now there are online loans.

659
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:09,323
Many of them have taken out loans.

660
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:10,403
Just our class alone,

661
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:12,803
there are four to five students
who took out a loan.

662
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:13,764
One of my students

663
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,403
had to drop out
because of the online loan.

664
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:19,163
Have all of you received
these kinds of text messages?

665
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:20,004
I've received them too.

666
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:20,844
Me too.

667
00:25:20,844 --> 00:25:21,644
Have all of you received them too?

668
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:24,563
Did you buy your equipment
with an online loan?

669
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:25,484
Yeah.

670
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,323
Do you know any channels?

671
00:25:28,364 --> 00:25:30,083
Can you recommend me
one online lending platform?

672
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:31,724
Look at this card.

673
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:33,364
You can just download it directly.

674
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,724
I never said I won't.

675
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,644
I asked if I can pay in installments.

676
00:25:49,683 --> 00:25:51,964
I'll pay you back the money
for this equipment in three months.

677
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:55,004
I bought so much equipment from you.

678
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:56,203
Don't you trust me at all?

679
00:25:56,244 --> 00:25:56,844
I just can't

680
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:58,364
take out so much money now.

681
00:26:01,163 --> 00:26:02,443
Can I pay in three months?

682
00:26:03,964 --> 00:26:06,043
I don't have that much money now.

683
00:26:08,043 --> 00:26:08,724
Hey, pal.

684
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,683
You can take out an online loan
if you don't have money.

685
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,604
Hang on a second.
I'll talk to you in a bit.

686
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:19,364
So do you know
any reliable online lending platforms?

687
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,484
Do I need a guarantor

688
00:26:21,524 --> 00:26:22,484
or anything to mortgage?

689
00:26:22,484 --> 00:26:23,283
No, you don't need any of those.

690
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:24,604
This is the one.

691
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:25,524
Have you used it before?

692
00:26:25,724 --> 00:26:26,923
Of course.

693
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,520
(Mother's Taste)

694
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:38,443
Is it too spicy?

695
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,283
I thought you were good with spicy food.

696
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,764
How did you know
I'm good with spicy food?

697
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,563
Han told me.

698
00:27:03,644 --> 00:27:05,004
You asked him about this?

699
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:12,083
Let's talk about the case.

700
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:12,484
Okay.

701
00:27:12,484 --> 00:27:13,443
How did it go on your side?

702
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:15,964
Well, this is what I found out.

703
00:27:15,964 --> 00:27:17,203
Those who are involved
in illegal online lending

704
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:17,884
are mostly male students

705
00:27:17,884 --> 00:27:19,644
who enjoy playing games.

706
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:21,683
Once they enter the game,

707
00:27:21,884 --> 00:27:23,203
other players

708
00:27:23,203 --> 00:27:25,163
would send them advertisements
for online loans,

709
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:27,043
claiming fast approval

710
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:27,884
and no guarantor required.

711
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:29,884
Some of them also upload advertisements

712
00:27:30,403 --> 00:27:32,163
for adult live streaming
within the game.

713
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:35,244
Some male students end up entering
these adult live streams.

714
00:27:35,443 --> 00:27:38,163
There, they are further exposed
to advertisements for online loans.

715
00:27:38,884 --> 00:27:39,923
But so far, no direct connection
has been found

716
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,323
between the popular game and Huiquan.

717
00:27:41,724 --> 00:27:43,203
Today, they recommended me

718
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:44,443
a particular online lending App.

719
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:46,844
I plan to register
with someone else's mobile number

720
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,043
to try it out

721
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:48,923
and see what results I can obtain.

722
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:50,683
Have you made any progress?

723
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:53,004
I've basically talked to everyone
in my area

724
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:54,604
and everything adds up.

725
00:27:54,764 --> 00:27:55,964
They all appear introverted,

726
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:57,443
quiet, and honest.

727
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:00,004
They also admit

728
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:01,163
to being involved
in illegal online lending

729
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:02,604
at some point in their lives,
or even currently.

730
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:04,283
Some of them were able
to repay the loans

731
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:05,884
with the help of their parents.

732
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:06,604
While others fell into

733
00:28:06,604 --> 00:28:08,644
a cycle of borrowing
and struggled to break free.

734
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:09,803
Some

735
00:28:10,604 --> 00:28:12,083
felt embarrassed

736
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:13,923
and took up part-time jobs
to temporarily cover the gaps.

737
00:28:14,283 --> 00:28:14,764
There's even one person

738
00:28:14,764 --> 00:28:15,484
who has no idea

739
00:28:15,524 --> 00:28:16,884
about their involvement
in illegal online lending.

740
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:18,124
I suspect
that their personal information

741
00:28:18,124 --> 00:28:18,803
was stolen
and used without their knowledge.

742
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:20,803
However, I'm still investigating

743
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:21,803
if it was an act.

744
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:24,644
There's one piece of information
that's particularly crucial.

745
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:26,043
According to these students' feedback,

746
00:28:26,203 --> 00:28:28,604
there's one classmate who was actively
recruiting people for online lending,

747
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:30,244
and he has already dropped out of school.

748
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,524
I believe

749
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:33,484
this person was earning commissions by recruiting borrowers,

750
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:34,524
and perhaps they used the money

751
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,244
to repay their own online loans.

752
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:37,724
Where's this person?

753
00:28:38,443 --> 00:28:38,964
No idea.

754
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:40,283
He dropped out for some time now.

755
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:41,124
Besides,

756
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:42,803
the students haven't seen him
for a while.

757
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:44,884
All they know his name is Yang Bao.

758
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:46,163
Yang Bao?

759
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:52,004
Yang Bao sure knows where
to pick a place to stay.

760
00:28:52,323 --> 00:28:54,964
About 80% of retirees are living here.

761
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:57,043
I guess he thinks it's safe here.

762
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:58,964
Well, I think he thinks

763
00:28:58,964 --> 00:28:59,923
the rental is cheaper here.

764
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,004
Look how rundown this building is.

765
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,563
Do you want to bet?

766
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:06,323
The loser must do something
for the winner.

767
00:29:06,604 --> 00:29:08,163
You're too old to be making a bet.

768
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:15,283
The location said it's here.

769
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:16,884
This is the place.

770
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:18,803
Unit 3, Block 4.

771
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:20,964
Which one is it?

772
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:23,604
Follow me.

773
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:26,844
Do you know where you're going?

774
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,380
(Block 4)

775
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:45,683
(Unit 3)

776
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:46,923
Look at the electricity meter
over there.

777
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:48,484
Is there anything unusual
about its speed?

778
00:29:55,524 --> 00:29:56,323
It seems normal.

779
00:30:06,484 --> 00:30:07,283
Look,

780
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:08,524
it's broad daylight.

781
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:10,004
Why are they using so much electricity?

782
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:36,683
Open the door.

783
00:30:38,764 --> 00:30:39,764
Who is it?

784
00:30:39,803 --> 00:30:42,083
Your house is leaking
and it's flooding ours.

785
00:30:42,964 --> 00:30:44,364
Our house isn't leaking.

786
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,083
Are you going to open the door or not?

787
00:30:46,964 --> 00:30:48,083
I'm going to call the police.

788
00:31:05,283 --> 00:31:06,083
Don't run!

789
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:07,484
Police on duty.

790
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:11,604
You have nowhere to escape.

791
00:31:11,724 --> 00:31:12,083
Come here!

792
00:31:14,443 --> 00:31:15,443
Are you Yang Bao?

793
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,244
Can police arrest anyone without reason?

794
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:19,124
I'm sure you know what you did.

795
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:21,764
What's your name?

796
00:31:23,764 --> 00:31:24,563
Yang...

797
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:25,524
Yang Bao.

798
00:31:44,443 --> 00:31:46,604
I'm Prosecutor An Ni
from Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

799
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:52,563
Do you know why we want to see you?

800
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:58,004
Isn't this just a small matter?

801
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,083
A small matter?

802
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:03,004
Do you realize how many years in prison
for this "small matter?"

803
00:32:07,043 --> 00:32:07,844
Officer,

804
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:10,043
I really don't know anything else.

805
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:10,884
You were doing well as a student

806
00:32:10,923 --> 00:32:13,683
at Jiangcheng University.
Why did you drop out?

807
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:15,283
No reason.

808
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,163
I don't want to spend more money on it.

809
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:19,244
I'll graduate sooner or later

810
00:32:19,403 --> 00:32:20,443
and find a job.

811
00:32:21,203 --> 00:32:22,403
It's better to find one earlier.

812
00:32:24,163 --> 00:32:25,563
Are these your schoolmates?

813
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:28,083
You're even targeting your course mates.

814
00:32:28,724 --> 00:32:30,244
How can you be so untrustworthy?

815
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:33,484
Officer,

816
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:35,604
we're just ordinary university students

817
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:38,764
who happened to be involved
in this matter.

818
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:40,683
Can you please spare me?

819
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,683
That depends
if you'll cooperate with us.

820
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:44,443
As long as you can do that,

821
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:46,563
the punishment can be reduced.

822
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:51,884
Why don't I give you a brief explanation

823
00:32:51,923 --> 00:32:53,163
and you'll choose?

824
00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:54,524
When dealing with suspects,

825
00:32:54,604 --> 00:32:56,004
we have three different attitudes.

826
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:57,364
Based on these attitudes,

827
00:32:57,563 --> 00:32:58,403
there will be a significant difference

828
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,563
during the final sentencing.

829
00:33:00,323 --> 00:33:02,004
It's considered surrendering oneself,

830
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,724
which can lead to a lighter
or reduced punishment.

831
00:33:04,364 --> 00:33:05,683
The consequences are evident

832
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:07,203
for those who refuse to confess.

833
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:11,524
I'll talk.

834
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:13,403
I'll tell you everything.

835
00:33:14,764 --> 00:33:16,604
I'll tell you

836
00:33:16,964 --> 00:33:18,043
everything you want to know.

837
00:33:18,524 --> 00:33:19,124
But

838
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:21,403
if what I say is the truth,

839
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:22,604
does it count as merit?

840
00:33:23,484 --> 00:33:25,083
It depends on what you say.

841
00:33:26,323 --> 00:33:27,644
Do you know Shi Xiaohu?

842
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:28,524
No, I don't know him.

843
00:33:29,203 --> 00:33:30,683
With your attitude,
do you really think you can earn merits?

844
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:32,764
That's called refusing to confess.

845
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:35,604
But I don't know

846
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:38,484
who's Shi Xiaohu.

847
00:33:39,004 --> 00:33:41,083
I really don't remember such a person.

848
00:33:41,283 --> 00:33:42,323
What about Zhang Xiaobei?

849
00:33:42,724 --> 00:33:43,524
I know him.

850
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:45,083
I got to know him just recently.

851
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,724
Can you make sense when you speak?

852
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:48,524
What do you mean
by "got to know him recently?"

853
00:33:49,443 --> 00:33:51,443
His incident of jumping
into the river went viral.

854
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:52,403
I only found out recently

855
00:33:52,443 --> 00:33:53,484
that his name is Zhang Xiaobei.

856
00:33:53,884 --> 00:33:55,683
When we first met,

857
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:57,203
he was called Zhang Xiaoguang.

858
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:01,644
How did you two meet?

859
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,920
(One year ago)

860
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:12,683
He won because his equipment
was better than mine.

861
00:34:14,484 --> 00:34:15,484
What are you looking at?

862
00:34:17,084 --> 00:34:19,203
Hey, pal.

863
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:21,643
I've seen you many times.

864
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:24,363
Your skills are good.
But your equipment is lacking.

865
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:27,443
If you had better equipment,
you would be invincible.

866
00:34:27,443 --> 00:34:29,244
The speed of equipment upgrades
is so fast

867
00:34:29,284 --> 00:34:30,484
that even if I sold blood,
I couldn't keep up.

868
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:31,484
What can I exchange it with?

869
00:34:32,324 --> 00:34:33,603
You're outdated.

870
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:36,244
Nowadays, we take money
from other people's pockets.

871
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:38,284
There's such a good thing?

872
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:39,564
Definitely.

873
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:40,964
Let's go

874
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:42,603
and have a drink.

875
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:44,004
We'll drink and talk.

876
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:49,363
Hmm,

877
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:52,923
do you know how I managed to do it?

878
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:54,564
How did you do it?

879
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:55,643
Let me give you a tip.

880
00:35:02,363 --> 00:35:04,363
I obtain money for my equipment
from this source.

881
00:35:10,643 --> 00:35:12,244
Not bad.

882
00:35:20,764 --> 00:35:21,564
Not bad.

883
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:27,564
Do you have

884
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:29,123
Zhang Xiaobei's gaming account?

885
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,084
This guy is quite talented

886
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:33,683
and skilled.

887
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:35,484
But he doesn't have his own account.

888
00:35:35,923 --> 00:35:37,163
He helps others level up.

889
00:35:38,203 --> 00:35:40,203
So that means Zhang Xiaobei
is a gaming prodigy.

890
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:41,964
Wait a minute.

891
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,284
He earns money
by helping others level up.

892
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:46,004
Then why does he still need
to borrow money?

893
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:48,084
How did he accumulate so much debt?

894
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:51,484
He often gives a girl gifts
and helps increase her ranking.

895
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:53,403
Later, he added her
on private messaging

896
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,084
and frequently sends her money.

897
00:35:55,363 --> 00:35:57,084
He spends all his money on that woman.

898
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:58,363
He relies on

899
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:00,564
helping others to level up.

900
00:36:00,764 --> 00:36:01,764
So

901
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:03,764
the income and expenses
must be imbalanced.

902
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:06,964
Anything else?

903
00:36:08,004 --> 00:36:08,923
Is there?

904
00:36:14,203 --> 00:36:15,603
This person is actually not bad.

905
00:36:17,084 --> 00:36:18,084
He talks tough. But he has a kind heart.

906
00:36:18,203 --> 00:36:20,203
You can tell at first glance

907
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:22,004
that he's someone with a story,

908
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:23,203
someone who has been hurt.

909
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:25,683
But he didn't tell me
these things himself.

910
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,964
I could see that he was tormented
by online loans every day,

911
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:30,524
feeling anxious and restless.

912
00:36:31,683 --> 00:36:33,284
So I took him as my subordinate.

913
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:35,804
Every time he could find someone
to take out an online loan,

914
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:37,084
I would settle the debt for him.

915
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:39,883
Do you have the list of clients
he brought in?

916
00:36:40,123 --> 00:36:41,324
I don't have a client list.

917
00:36:42,883 --> 00:36:45,203
The App automatically
collects that information.

918
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,004
As long as someone fills in
the introducer's referral code,

919
00:36:48,443 --> 00:36:49,564
the system will automatically

920
00:36:49,804 --> 00:36:51,203
pay us commissions.

921
00:36:53,324 --> 00:36:54,524
He's not telling the truth.

922
00:36:55,484 --> 00:36:56,524
How did you become friends

923
00:36:56,643 --> 00:36:58,203
with Shi Xiaohu's game account?

924
00:36:58,284 --> 00:37:00,403
Didn't you say
you don't know him earlier?

925
00:37:01,603 --> 00:37:02,363
I really don't know

926
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:04,724
the Xiaohu guy.

927
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:08,324
My game account eventually
belonged to Zhang Xiaobei.

928
00:37:08,363 --> 00:37:11,403
Zhang Xiaobei said a high-level account
is good for expanding connections.

929
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:13,284
Later, I figured out

930
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:16,403
that this guy was pretty ruthless

931
00:37:17,284 --> 00:37:18,564
and highly cautious.

932
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:19,964
He just didn't want

933
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:21,964
any flaws in the entire operation.

934
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:24,964
How many did he introduce?

935
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:28,764
Not many.

936
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:30,484
Less than five people.

937
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,284
Later, he quit

938
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:34,804
because he thinks
this brings a lot of harm to others.

939
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:36,484
Now,

940
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,443
he lives under a lot of torment.

941
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:39,524
He doesn't want

942
00:37:40,044 --> 00:37:40,964
more people

943
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:43,284
to suffer a living hell.

944
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:46,564
Why didn't you have such awareness then?

945
00:37:50,724 --> 00:37:52,804
It is highly possible that Zhang Xiaobei

946
00:37:52,843 --> 00:37:54,683
is using Shi Xiaohu to grow his network.

947
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,004
So, does that make you
one of the higher-ups?

948
00:37:59,084 --> 00:37:59,284
Me?

949
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:00,163
No, I'm not.

950
00:38:00,203 --> 00:38:01,603
I'm just a small player
to find more clients.

951
00:38:01,843 --> 00:38:03,484
Even small players can be formidable.

952
00:38:03,564 --> 00:38:05,203
What is your upline like?

953
00:38:06,004 --> 00:38:07,363
Who's your upline?

954
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:08,284
How do guys keep in touch?

955
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:10,324
I have no idea who my upline is.

956
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:12,524
I don't even know
if they're male or female.

957
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,724
I think it's probably a woman.

958
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:18,923
They delete their accounts sporadically.

959
00:38:19,284 --> 00:38:20,804
But whenever they create new ones,

960
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,044
they would reach out to me proactively.

961
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,993
(Confirm friend request)

962
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,736
(Do you need a loan? We have benefits
for new Apps.)

963
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:16,564
Do you still use WeChat?

964
00:39:17,163 --> 00:39:18,363
I deleted the previous one.

965
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:19,123
But I have a new one.

966
00:39:19,163 --> 00:39:20,163
Which one is it?

967
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:23,203
The second phone, the one nearer to me.

968
00:39:28,683 --> 00:39:30,764
So, you used to be involved
in online lending as well?

969
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:31,964
Yes,

970
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:33,843
I got deeper and deeper into it.

971
00:40:19,004 --> 00:40:20,004
Hey, bro.

972
00:40:21,484 --> 00:40:23,044
Can you give me some more time?

973
00:40:23,044 --> 00:40:23,363
I...

974
00:40:23,363 --> 00:40:24,764
I can't repay the interest right now.

975
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:27,004
I'm living in an internet cafe
and I'm running out of money.

976
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:30,484
It's not like that.

977
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:31,964
Gosh.

978
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,044
Bro,

979
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:35,203
how about this?

980
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:37,804
I'll get more clients.
Can that cover the interest?

981
00:40:38,764 --> 00:40:40,764
To be honest, my family is not rich.

982
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:43,883
My classmates

983
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:48,443
always look down on me.

984
00:40:48,564 --> 00:40:50,004
So

985
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,843
I started skipping classes
to numb myself.

986
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:54,603
However,

987
00:40:54,764 --> 00:40:57,603
I came across Huiquan's game

988
00:40:57,804 --> 00:40:59,804
and thought it was great.

989
00:41:00,163 --> 00:41:00,964
When I was in the game,

990
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:03,044
it helped me regain
my confidence and self-esteem.

991
00:41:03,603 --> 00:41:04,284
Now,

992
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:06,244
I'm the boss of the whole district.

993
00:41:06,643 --> 00:41:09,004
Every time I log in,

994
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:12,203
I have many followers calling me
"Big Brother" and greeting me.

995
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:14,724
Aren't you just buying the position
of a boss with borrowed money?

996
00:41:18,403 --> 00:41:19,363
Officers,

997
00:41:20,284 --> 00:41:22,564
I have a question for you.

998
00:41:22,843 --> 00:41:24,443
I want to know

999
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:26,764
who has a higher rank between you two.

1000
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:31,603
For heaven's sake,
you're a university student.

1001
00:41:31,643 --> 00:41:33,363
Asking who has a higher rank,

1002
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:36,403
the police or the prosecutor

1003
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:37,683
is like asking

1004
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:38,804
if the Chinese teacher is better

1005
00:41:38,804 --> 00:41:40,403
or the Math teacher is better.

1006
00:41:40,524 --> 00:41:41,764
Can you compare them?

1007
00:41:45,123 --> 00:41:49,084
So what does the prosecutor
primarily decide?

1008
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:51,603
Whether to arrest you

1009
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:52,683
or prosecute you.

1010
00:41:52,964 --> 00:41:54,324
The prosecutor's office
has the final say.

1011
00:41:54,964 --> 00:41:55,764
I guess we're almost done.

1012
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:56,324
Yeah.

1013
00:41:58,804 --> 00:41:59,683
Wait.

1014
00:42:00,964 --> 00:42:02,084
I have one more question for you.

1015
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:05,484
Why did you rent this place?

1016
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:19,764
Mr. Wang!

1017
00:42:20,643 --> 00:42:22,363
- You scared me.
- I missed you so much.

1018
00:42:22,403 --> 00:42:23,603
Okay, now let go of me.

1019
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:24,244
I'm not letting go.

1020
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:26,044
This doesn't look appropriate.

1021
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:27,923
I just miss you so much.

1022
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:28,764
I'm going to express however I want.

1023
00:42:28,764 --> 00:42:29,363
I don't care what they say.

1024
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:30,163
Then you've marked me.

1025
00:42:30,203 --> 00:42:31,403
I didn't see anything.

1026
00:42:31,403 --> 00:42:32,244
What?

1027
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:33,484
You obviously saw everything.

1028
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:34,643
You're back.

1029
00:42:34,643 --> 00:42:35,123
Mr. Wang.

1030
00:42:35,163 --> 00:42:36,044
By the way,

1031
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:37,603
you haven't had breakfast, right?

1032
00:42:38,363 --> 00:42:39,524
One person each.

1033
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:39,964
Everyone has one.

1034
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:42,564
There's enough for everyone.

1035
00:42:42,683 --> 00:42:43,843
This is yours.

1036
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:45,324
Yes.

1037
00:42:45,804 --> 00:42:47,200
This truly feels like you're back.
