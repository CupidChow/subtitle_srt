=Episode 28=

15
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:41,967
The main reason we're in such a hurry
to get everyone here

16
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,727
is because An Ni and Han Xuan

17
00:01:44,886 --> 00:01:46,647
have found the key evidence we need

18
00:01:47,127 --> 00:01:49,767
in the massive amount of data.

19
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,767
They discovered Huiquan's secrets

20
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,806
in just fifteen hours.

21
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:57,647
At the same time,

22
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,447
we've carefully reviewed the confessions
of Yin Huiquan and Zhao Jikai

23
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:05,486
in the initial interrogation by
our comrades of the municipal bureau.

24
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:08,967
We've also learned about
the Huiquan Games'

25
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:10,287
ways of committing crimes.

26
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,567
Next, I hope that Chief Bai

27
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:15,207
and our comrades in
the Public Security Bureau

28
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:17,207
will conduct interrogations quickly

29
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,366
to find out the mastermind
behind the crime.

30
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:22,366
The higher-ups attach
great importance to this case.

31
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:24,567
We are under a lot of pressure too.

32
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:29,006
If it's true that Huiquan,
as we believe,

33
00:02:29,246 --> 00:02:32,446
has been in cahoots with

34
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,687
cybercrime gangs like Qian Tianxin,

35
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:38,927
then we've really found the source

36
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:41,606
of the data outflow this time.

37
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:43,366
This is very important to us.

38
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:48,927
Prosecutor Guo, This time, we really

39
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:52,047
have to compliment our comrades
in the procuratorate

40
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,287
for their efficiency and professionalism

41
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,487
in handling the case.

42
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,767
Chief Bai, thank you
for your endorsement.

43
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:02,287
An Ni,
tell us about the outcome you've got.

44
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:02,886
Okay.

45
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:04,606
We found

46
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:06,166
that there was a new program
that had been implanted into

47
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,086
the package of several different games

48
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:11,006
that were newly launched by Huiquan.

49
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:13,047
Let's call this program

50
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,567
a two-way channel for the time being.

51
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:18,166
The memory size of this program

52
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:20,006
does not take up any space

53
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:22,086
in the entire critical update package.

54
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:26,006
Normally, no one would have noticed it.

55
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,166
And this program

56
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:30,047
is linked to the monitoring program
of the players' gaming behaviour

57
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,646
that is to be crucially updated.

58
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,047
This monitoring program is mainly

59
00:03:35,487 --> 00:03:37,487
dependent on the user's ID

60
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:42,166
such as top-up games, game duration,

61
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:46,006
and level selection games.

62
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:48,006
It will serve a monitoring purpose.

63
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:51,047
We call it the main program.

64
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:53,487
And this time, the problematic update

65
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,086
was identified in the main program.

66
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,366
It increases the monitoring of top-ups

67
00:03:57,407 --> 00:04:00,047
and duration in games for both adult

68
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:01,366
and underage players.

69
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,687
This two-way channel program is
like a parasite

70
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:08,847
that feeds on the main program
as the mother.

71
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:13,166
To put it simply,
the user IDs monitored are filtered

72
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,646
to identify those who meet
the pre-defined criteria.

73
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:17,766
This two-way channel program

74
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,486
is attached to the main program

75
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:24,366
and obtains information about
the user by adhesion.

76
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,766
I'm afraid you might not
be able to absorb it

77
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,007
if I say too much at once.

78
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:29,366
If you have any questions,

79
00:04:29,366 --> 00:04:30,407
please feel free to ask me.

80
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:50,127
Professor Luo,
we only have 24 hours left.

81
00:04:51,486 --> 00:04:53,086
There will be endless 24 hours

82
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:56,206
before the case is closed.

83
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:01,486
We really don't have much time left.

84
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:03,847
Have you ever thought about

85
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,486
what to do if Huiquan Corporation

86
00:05:06,727 --> 00:05:07,766
really has problems?

87
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,407
I'll just play it by ear.

88
00:05:18,086 --> 00:05:19,806
I believe in Yin Huiquan.

89
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:27,246
If someone has to
take responsibility for this,

90
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:29,167
I hope it's not Zhao Jikai.

91
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:32,127
To put it bluntly, he is just a worker.

92
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,887
They, you and I

93
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:39,046
must all look only at the facts.

94
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,206
Mr. Zhao has earned his share of money

95
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:47,127
and enjoyed his share of privileges,

96
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:50,447
so he must take
his share of responsibility.

97
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,926
Yitang, don't think so much about it.

98
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:59,086
What is meant to be will be meant to be.

99
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:06,967
I still hope that both the chairman
and Zhao Jikai will be fine.

100
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,486
An Ni, I would like to ask

101
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:16,926
what is the critical core.

102
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,246
Why must the implantation
be done by update?

103
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:20,967
Here's how it works.

104
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:24,447
Updates to games are generally divided
into critical core updates,

105
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:27,007
major updates and daily updates, etc.

106
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,646
The critical core

107
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:31,086
will not be replaced by
new package updates.

108
00:06:31,646 --> 00:06:34,887
Even if there are new updates
at a later stage,

109
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:36,366
it will still be there

110
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:38,766
and will be able to run
without downtime,

111
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,366
also known as hot maintenance.

112
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:42,646
The general meaning of
this maintenance is that

113
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:44,046
the server does not stop working.

114
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,766
In this way,
players will not even notice

115
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,167
that the update has been completed

116
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,887
during the game.

117
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:53,007
Once the fix is complete,
users who have never downloaded the game

118
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:55,206
will download
the updated version directly,

119
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:58,206
so they won't notice any difference

120
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,287
from the old version.

121
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:03,486
If the program
is implanted through an update,

122
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:06,127
it can be done unnoticeably.

123
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:10,046
What is the two-way channel program?

124
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:14,287
On one hand,
it collects the filtered user IDs,

125
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,167
on the other hand, it sends them
to external private servers

126
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:18,127
and makes phone calls

127
00:07:18,127 --> 00:07:20,206
or sends text messages to the victims.

128
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,007
I have a question for you then.

129
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,926
I'm curious as it's such a

130
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:28,967
professional game company,
they must have

131
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,646
very professional maintenance staff,

132
00:07:30,646 --> 00:07:32,687
how could they not find this program?

133
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,847
It's because
this two-way channel program

134
00:07:35,887 --> 00:07:36,486
has escaped

135
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:38,806
the eyes of the error monitoring
and collection program.

136
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:40,567
Error monitoring and collection programs

137
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,086
are generally developed in-house

138
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,687
by large companies,
and have their own set of logic.

139
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,206
It is mainly used to monitor situations

140
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:49,287
such as data loss, operation errors,

141
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,967
non-compliance with
the logic of some operations

142
00:07:52,086 --> 00:07:54,206
or virus invasion, etc.

143
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:55,766
In the event of any of the above,

144
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,007
it will deal with the situation urgently
and automatically raise an alert.

145
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,687
This two-way channel program

146
00:07:59,727 --> 00:08:03,206
is logical for error monitoring
and collection program

147
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:05,167
and is also able to
avoid detection by it.

148
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:06,127
So...

149
00:08:06,806 --> 00:08:07,967
Let me put it this way.

150
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:11,086
This two-way channel program is able

151
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:12,967
to co-exist with

152
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:13,887
the error monitoring
and collection program

153
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,646
and will not be detected as a dissident.

154
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,167
It seems that the process
of handling cases

155
00:08:20,646 --> 00:08:22,086
is also a learning process for us.

156
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:24,567
Another point is that

157
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:25,687
the two-way channel program

158
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:27,046
is only a few kilobytes in size.

159
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:28,407
None of the critical update packages

160
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,567
we checked are less than

161
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,326
252 megabytes in size.

162
00:08:32,526 --> 00:08:34,927
This means that the technical staff

163
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,247
would never have found out

164
00:08:36,287 --> 00:08:38,126
that such a new program had
been implanted during the update.

165
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,047
The next step is
to focus on interrogating

166
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:43,086
those who have the motive and
conditions to commit the crime.

167
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,167
The people who have access
to the update package

168
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:47,047
are Zhao Jikai and Yin Huiquan,

169
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,126
in addition to
the technical staff on duty.

170
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,847
In particular, Yin Huiquan
directly approved

171
00:08:52,006 --> 00:08:53,807
the bulk game update plan.

172
00:08:54,487 --> 00:08:55,287
That's all.

173
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:57,967
Let's do it like this.

174
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:00,446
If there is anything
you don't understand,

175
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,367
we can talk to each other in private

176
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:04,126
after the meeting. Okay?

177
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:06,047
Chief Bai.

178
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:09,686
He Luyuan, you can interrogate
some relevant personnel

179
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,646
of Huiquan Corporation overnight

180
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,126
to clarify their criminal process
as soon as possible.

181
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,367
And see if you can further substantiate

182
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:17,686
the chain of evidence

183
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,566
between them and cybercrime gangs
like Qian Tianxin.

184
00:09:21,086 --> 00:09:22,927
Do a thorough check to see

185
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:24,247
how many more criminals
have slipped through the cracks.

186
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:25,126
Yes.

Sir and madam,

189
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:32,407
you've been questioning me
for half a day now

190
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:34,367
and I really have nothing to say.

191
00:09:34,487 --> 00:09:38,086
Once again, I am a professional manager.

192

Mr. Zhao.

193

- Here you go.
- Thank you.

195
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,167
You're indeed a professional manager.

196

But you're also the president of Huiquan,

the head of the Gaming Division.

198
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,566
Your game has such a big issue

199
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:01,167
and you don't know anything about it?

200
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:07,967
Yes. I'm the head of the Gaming Division.

201
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,766
But I am not from
a technical background.

202
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,967
Everyone in the company knows this.

203
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:16,607
I'm just interested in
the market demand for games

204
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:18,886
and the preferences of players.

205

including writing code.

208
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:25,686
Let me put it this way.

209
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,167
I have only a rudimentary
knowledge of technology.

210
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:30,566
You're right.

211
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,607
I am the head of the company

212
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:33,886
and I am responsible for

213

the operation and
management of the market.

214

He Luyuan, ask him

215
00:10:38,047 --> 00:10:40,487
how he can explain the fact

216
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,247
that all of Huiquan's games
have illegal programs

217
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:43,686
in their update packages.

218
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:44,927
You are in charge of the management?

Yes.

220
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,886
Updates to the games

221
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:49,967
require your signature, right?

222
00:10:50,047 --> 00:10:51,847
Ni, why didn't Captain He
ask him about that?

223
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:52,487
Don't worry.

224

He has his own pace.

225
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:57,487
Illegal programs were inserted

226

into your games during
the update process,

227

and not just in one game,

228

but in all of them.

229
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:04,646
How can you explain this?

230
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,086
First of all,
I'm sorry for what has happened

231
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:12,086
in our company.

232
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,727
I accept any punishment

233
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:17,766
that may be imposed as a result of

234

my negligence at work.

235
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,086
But I'd like to clarify the update

236
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:26,967
you just mentioned.

237
00:11:27,326 --> 00:11:30,126
For everything that happens in Huiquan,

238
00:11:30,287 --> 00:11:32,287
whether it's a massive change

239
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:36,487

he gave the order and I carried it out.

243
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,367
The recent plunge in the number of users

244
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:53,326
is the result of your smart-alecky,

not to be so narrow-minded.

You just wouldn't listen.

252
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:11,886
Why didn't you consider setting a cap

on top-ups and the rights of users

254

Now, there's big trouble.

The mistake you made in the first place

257
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,326
is going to bring down
the entire Huiquan.

258
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:28,686
Mr. Yin, you know

259
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,686
I don't know anything about game design.

260
00:12:32,646 --> 00:12:34,006
I am responsible for only
two aspects of the business.

First, new users and existing users.

Two, revenue and cash flow.

our group's financial reports

appear better.

What bad intentions
could I possibly have?

270

It's just that no one expected

have come to this point.

with the top-up itself.

00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:44,367
Are you working late tonight

332
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:45,526
to prepare for the game update?

333
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:46,566
Yes.

334
00:15:47,006 --> 00:15:49,047
It's a hard night's work for you.

335
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:50,247
It just so happens

336
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,247
that I've bought some food.

337
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:52,047
Take it.

338
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:54,927
Mr. Zhao, this is my job.

339
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:55,607
This is what I should do.

340
00:15:55,607 --> 00:15:57,126
I can't take your stuff.

341
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,167
It's hard to work overtime,
so you must take care of yourself.

342
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:02,086
How about this?
Get whatever you want to eat,

343
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:02,686
I'll pay for it.

344
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:05,247
Mr. Zhao, it's late now.

345
00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:06,206
When you are done buying,

346
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,526
you should go back and rest.

347
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:09,287
I'm shy to buy anything
when you're here.

348
00:16:09,326 --> 00:16:09,766
Okay.

349
00:16:09,766 --> 00:16:10,526
I'll get going now then.

350
00:16:10,526 --> 00:16:11,287
Okay.

351
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,446
I remembered him

352
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:18,686
because his name is special.

353
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:19,487
It's as simple as that.

354
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:21,287
He Luyuan, ask him

355
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,727
how he knows that the update

356
00:16:22,727 --> 00:16:23,727
done by Bao Meiguo

357
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:25,086
is the one you are talking about.

358
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:26,566
One more question.

359
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:29,086
How do you know that
the day you met Bao Meiguo

360
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:31,006
was the day he implanted the program?

361
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,686
I didn't say that.

362
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,766
It's just that you asked me
and I remembered, so I told you.

363
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,487
I don't know if he was

364
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:40,407
involved in the way you described.

365
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:42,086
I don't know if anyone else
was involved either.

366
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:43,847
Anyway, every update

367
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,646
from the game company
is scheduled at night

368
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:47,686
or in the midnight

369
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:50,247
to avoid heavy user traffic.

370
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,886
And then I happened to meet him,

371
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,646
so I gave you a clue.

372
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:58,126
I'm not sure if
he was involved or not.

373
00:16:58,247 --> 00:17:00,566
Anyway, he showed up
at work at night for an update,

374
00:17:00,847 --> 00:17:02,646
so the odds are it's probably him.

375
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:03,287
Of course it...

376
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:04,086
It would be up to you

377
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:05,647
police to investigate.

378
00:17:08,566 --> 00:17:09,727
Fine, let's not waste time on him.

379
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,926
Let's question Bao Meiguo right away.

380
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:21,326
Bao Meiguo, do you know why you
were asked to come here?

381
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:23,727
Sir, I know.

382
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,127
They have told me about it.

383
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,887
You need to find out
about updating actions

384
00:17:26,887 --> 00:17:28,367
for suspected illegal issues.

385
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,286
You suspect me of doing it.

386
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,046
This is the submission
and signature you made

387
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,967
in your company system.

388
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:40,926
Why was an illegal program

389
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,247
implanted in your game

390
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:44,326
during the update process?

391
00:17:45,487 --> 00:17:47,326
I don't know what's going on.

392
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,367
I'll tell you the whole story

393
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,086
of each update.

394
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:57,127
Can you also help me to analyze

395
00:17:57,527 --> 00:18:00,527
how the illegal program implanted
in the update package

396
00:18:01,326 --> 00:18:02,566
that was already uploaded?

397
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:04,286
Okay.

398
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:06,527
Our company usually performs game update

399
00:18:06,527 --> 00:18:08,487
at around 3:00 AM.

400
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:12,487
Firstly, to avoid disruption
to users and players,

401
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:15,166
and secondly,
to complete urgent bug fixes

402
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:16,647
without involving the underlying files.

403
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:19,847
Sometimes, we have to change

404
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:20,926
some cheat codes.

405
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,206
I upload the approved update package

406
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:26,647
that has been created

407
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:27,967
to the server from

408
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,046
the internal LAN storage each time

409
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:33,166
and wait for it to update automatically.

410
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:36,127
To put it bluntly, I'm just

411
00:18:36,847 --> 00:18:39,527
double-checking, doing it manually,
keeping an eye on it.

412
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:41,686
(He Luyuan, ask him about this.)

413
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,166
(He downloaded the update package from)

414
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:45,446
the internal LAN storage.

415
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:47,566
If he hadn't even left
the server room at the time...

416
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,887
(According to you, you were the only one)

417
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,286
(who did all these things,)

418
00:18:52,286 --> 00:18:54,367
(and if there was no one else
in the server room,)

419
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:56,926
then wasn't it you

420
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:58,367
who implanted the illegal program?

421
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,926
No, it wasn't me. You both think alike.

422
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,487
It's not like I was there to
keep an eye on it all the time.

423
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:05,887
I have a habit of going downstairs

424
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:07,247
to get late night snacks
when I'm working late.

425
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:10,967
I usually go downstairs to
buy something to eat

426
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:13,046
because I easily get hungry
when I work late at night.

427
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,566
I usually go downstairs to get some food

428
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:16,527
at around 2:45 AM

429
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:20,727
and get back to
the office at around 2:58 AM.

430
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:31,286
So there was no one
in the server room for 13 minutes?

431
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:32,367
Yes.

432
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,286
Long, Get someone

433
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:49,806
to check the CCTV footage
of their server room

434
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:51,686
and the CCTV footage of
the convenience store downstairs.

435
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:52,647
Okay.

436
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,046
Just as we expected,

437
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:06,686
there is something wrong
with Yin Huiquan.

438
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,166
Through Zhao Jikai's testimony

439
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:10,326
and the entire set of
approval documents collected,

440
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:12,247
he is indeed the one most suspected.

441
00:20:12,446 --> 00:20:13,527
Long went to check about it.

442
00:20:13,607 --> 00:20:15,446
Bao Meiguo did not lie.

443
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,046
But the CCTV footage
of their server room

444
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,487
is only kept for seven days

445
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:21,166
so nothing can be seen now.

446
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,647
It's likely that someone

447
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,566
tampered with it while Bao Meiguo

448
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:25,926
was out buying food.

449
00:20:26,046 --> 00:20:27,566
But we can't confirm

450
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,887
who this person is at the moment.

451
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:32,686
Besides, it will take us some time

452
00:20:32,926 --> 00:20:34,446
to find out the address

453
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,247
of the external server

454
00:20:36,247 --> 00:20:37,046
for the two-way channel program.

455
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:38,487
How long do you need?

456
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:40,487
Long said the technical team

457
00:20:40,647 --> 00:20:42,286
needs at least three days.

458
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:43,247
Three days?

459
00:20:43,806 --> 00:20:45,727
That's long.

460
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,686
You have to release them in 48 hours.

461
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,127
They said whoever wrote the program

462
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:50,086
was an expert.

463
00:20:50,446 --> 00:20:51,727
It was anti-tracking and encrypted.

464
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:00,086
Ni, we don't have a strong chain
of evidence here.

465
00:21:00,247 --> 00:21:02,286
What if they make a collusion
when they are released?

466
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:03,487
If they cut off the external server

467
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:04,887
when they are released

468
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:06,086
and transfer some data away,

469
00:21:06,086 --> 00:21:07,046
then we will...

470
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:15,367
The last thing a big dot-com company

471
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,206
should have is servers and memory.

472
00:21:17,446 --> 00:21:19,046
But they keep the CCTV footage
for a shorter time

473
00:21:19,046 --> 00:21:20,367
than a supermarket down the street.

474
00:21:21,127 --> 00:21:22,967
This is very abnormal.
There must be something wrong with it.

475
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:25,727
What you just said makes sense.

476
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:26,487
There's a possibility

477
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,967
of them making a collusion
when they are released.

478
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,326
But in order to allow
the company to run normally

479
00:21:30,326 --> 00:21:31,847
and in accordance with
the requirements of the law,

480
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:33,166
Zhao Jikai and Bao Meiguo

481
00:21:33,286 --> 00:21:34,446
have to be released

482
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:35,046
since they have been interrogated

483
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,527
and have no problems.

484
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,647
Next, it's up to
the statement from Yin Huiquan.

485
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:43,566
We must get a full chain of evidence.

486
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:46,767
Matters relating to computer science

487
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:48,887
may be mentioned in the later
interrogation of Yin Huiquan.

488
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,247
We have prepared some notes for you

489
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,527
to see if they are of any use to you
as a reference.

490
00:21:57,527 --> 00:21:59,166
Mr. Yin. Have some water.

491
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:00,166
Thank you.

492
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,847
I'm sorry to bring you,

493
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:05,566
one of the city's leading
private entrepreneurs,

494
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:06,527
here at this late hour.

495
00:22:06,686 --> 00:22:08,686
We asked you to come because

496
00:22:09,086 --> 00:22:11,166
we found some problems with your company

497
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,647
and we need to talk to you about them.

498
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,887
As a well-known private entrepreneur,

499
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,086
it's not surprising for me
to receive visits

500
00:22:22,086 --> 00:22:23,487
from provincial and
municipal officials.

501
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:26,247
But this is the first time in my life

502
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:27,967
that I've stayed overnight

503
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,086
at the Public Security Bureau.

504
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:35,967
Whoever comes to us is a citizen of

505
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:38,367
the People's Republic of China
and is obliged

506
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:39,727
to cooperate with our investigation.

507
00:22:39,887 --> 00:22:41,406
Our procedures are legal

508
00:22:41,406 --> 00:22:42,286
and fully documented.

509
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:45,086
You are here because

510
00:22:45,286 --> 00:22:46,566
our initial investigation

511
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,686
has revealed that there is an

512
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,887
illegal program in Huiquan Games

513
00:22:49,967 --> 00:22:50,926
that is suspected of being a fraud.

514
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:52,767
That's impossible.

515
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:55,847
You must have got it wrong.

516
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,847
I know all about Huiquan.

517
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:01,286
Brick by brick, I have worked

518
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:04,206
tirelessly day and night

519
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:07,127
to make Huiquan Corporation
what it is today.

520
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:08,527
To be frank,

521
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:12,406
I really want Huiquan to remain well.

522
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,406
In a big way,

523
00:23:14,487 --> 00:23:16,487
it's more important than my children.

524
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:19,206
So do you think I can tolerate others

525
00:23:19,326 --> 00:23:21,767
and even myself ruining my own children?

526
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,527
This is worse than killing me.

527
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,727
We believe all that you said.

528
00:23:26,926 --> 00:23:27,767
We asked you to come here

529
00:23:27,767 --> 00:23:28,926
to solve the problem

530
00:23:29,086 --> 00:23:30,686
and for the good of the company.

531
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:33,686
But why was this two-way channel program

532
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:36,166
implanted in your games?

533
00:23:40,406 --> 00:23:43,767
Yes. It was me who gave the order.

534
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:47,086
A program to monitor
the duration of playtime

535
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:51,647
has been added to the program that
monitors users' gaming behaviour.

536
00:23:53,086 --> 00:23:55,967
But I have no idea about

537
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:58,127
the two-way channel program

538
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:00,527
that you have discovered.

539
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:03,926
He Luyuan, ask him directly

540
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:06,007
about permission settings.

541
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:09,647
You wanted this update, didn't you?

542
00:24:09,727 --> 00:24:10,926
You authorized it, didn't you?

543
00:24:11,046 --> 00:24:11,767
Yes.

544
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:12,887
So why

545
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:16,367
was this two-way channel program
implanted at the same time as the update

546
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:19,607
and your error monitoring program
didn't detect it?

547
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:28,247
To put it bluntly, I don't know anything

548
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:31,767
about technology and I don't need to

549
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,166
know about it.

550
00:24:33,887 --> 00:24:35,367
The pending documents that are submitted

551
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:40,446
must have been strictly approved

552
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:41,686
by several departments

553
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,247
before they can reach me.

554
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:46,527
I just clicked yes on the application.

555
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:50,847
As a chairman,
do I still need to learn about

556
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:54,127
technical issues and
study them thoroughly?

557
00:24:58,286 --> 00:25:01,487
Mr. Yin, do you know Qian Tianxin?

558
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:05,247
Qian Tianxin?

559
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:08,847
Isn't she the criminal fraud leader

560
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:13,046
you brought back from Country F?

561
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:13,847
Yes.

562
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:18,127
How could I know such a lawless person?

563
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,887
The customer information that
Qian Tian Xin's fraudulent gang obtained

564
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,487
was from the two-way channel program

565
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,647
of Huiquan Games.

566
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:27,647
I don't know anything about that.

567
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:32,527
Captain He, ask him

568
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,046
why the CCTV footage of Huiquan Games

569
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:35,166
is only kept for seven days.

570
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:37,887
Let me ask another question.

571
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:42,847
Why is your company's CCTV footage
only kept for seven days?

572
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:47,046
Well, let me explain.

573
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:50,487
Since we completed the acquisition,

574
00:25:51,247 --> 00:25:53,487
Huibo has been constantly expanding.

575
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:55,566
Due to the public outcry,

576
00:25:55,647 --> 00:25:57,847
Huiquan Corporation's capital

577
00:25:57,887 --> 00:26:00,326
is no longer in growth.

578
00:26:00,686 --> 00:26:02,686
Money is needed everywhere.

579
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:05,887
So how many cameras
would Huiquan need

580
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:09,046
up and down, inside and out,

581
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,926
alongside a large amount of

582
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:13,527
surveillance hard drives?

583
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,847
This is no small sum.

584
00:26:17,166 --> 00:26:20,367
I think seven days is
more than enough time

585
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:23,527
for something that serves as decoration.

586
00:26:23,566 --> 00:26:25,887
So I adjusted my budget

587
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,566
and cut down on equipment.

588
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,607
You've cut down something essential.

589
00:26:31,446 --> 00:26:32,446
Given that your business

590
00:26:32,446 --> 00:26:33,647
is in such trouble,

591
00:26:34,086 --> 00:26:35,127
is there anything else

592
00:26:35,206 --> 00:26:37,166
you would like to tell us
as the chairman?

593
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:42,446
I have nothing to say.

594
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:47,686
My business is in such trouble now,

595
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:51,367
any explanation is futile.

596
00:26:51,446 --> 00:26:53,007
But what I want to say is that

597
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,326
I will never deny what I did,

598
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:57,887
and I will never admit

599
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,086
what I didn't do.

600
00:27:01,326 --> 00:27:02,647
We need your help urgently

601
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:04,767
to capture the bad apple

602
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:07,286
that is harming Huiquan.

603
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:11,127
Officer He, I've listened

604
00:27:11,286 --> 00:27:12,887
to everything you've just said.

605
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:14,647
Thank you.

606
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:20,086
My business needs your protection.

607
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:23,887
I will also actively cooperate with
your investigation

608
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,046
so that the issue can be
clarified as soon as possible

609
00:27:26,046 --> 00:27:28,647
and to clear the name of Huiquan
and me.

610
00:27:30,647 --> 00:27:31,487
Thank you, Mr. Yin.

611
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,680
(Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau)

612
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:49,647
You haven't gone home yet?

613
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:51,406
Captain He.

614
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,647
Please pass this to Han Shou.

615
00:27:53,686 --> 00:27:54,487
Okay.

616
00:27:54,967 --> 00:27:55,686
Are you going home?

617
00:27:55,686 --> 00:27:56,487
Let me give you a lift.

618
00:27:56,647 --> 00:27:57,487
I'm not going home.

619
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:58,686
I'll have to go and see
how they're getting on

620
00:27:58,727 --> 00:27:59,527
with the tracing of IP address.

621
00:28:00,286 --> 00:28:01,926
You've been up all night.
Don't you want to get some rest?

622
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:03,686
I can't help it.

623
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:04,767
I don't feel at ease

624
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,847
if I don't keep an eye on it myself.

625
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:10,967
I'll get going then.

626
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:22,767
An Ni, I've always given in to you
since college.

627
00:28:23,566 --> 00:28:25,607
But you shouldn't have
crossed my bottom line,

628
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:26,286
and

629
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:27,926
you shouldn't have picked on Zhao Jikai.

630
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:29,487
He's released because

631
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:31,847
he's innocent and not because

632
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:32,926
you've shown him any mercy.

633
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,806
Yitang, as the president of Huiquan,

634
00:28:36,926 --> 00:28:38,206
Zhao Jikai should have
cooperated with the investigation

635
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:39,487
when there's a problem with the company.

636
00:28:39,647 --> 00:28:40,487
You're a law student,

637
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:42,286
you should know this.

638
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,686
Speaking of the law,

639
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,166
don't you know how to recuse yourself?

640
00:28:45,286 --> 00:28:47,446
Why did you have to take this case
in the first place,

641
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:49,166
and cause a no-win situation?

642
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:52,046
Let me be frank with you.

643
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,046
I've gone through

644
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:54,086
all the procedures for recusal.

645
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:55,607
I didn't pick this case specifically.

646
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:58,446
I am not picking on
Zhao Jikai or Huiquan.

647
00:28:58,647 --> 00:28:59,647
It's because all the evidence

648
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:00,926
leads to Huiquan Games.

649
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,206
It's the law that tells us

650
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:03,487
that Huiquan is guilty.

651
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:06,127
As the head of the Gaming Division,

652
00:29:06,127 --> 00:29:08,086
shouldn't Zhao Jikai
cooperate with the investigation?

653
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,926
Moreover,
there is no conclusion to this case yet.

654
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:14,367
I also hope that Zhao Jikai is innocent.

655
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:16,046
Water that is too clear has few fish,

656
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:19,046
and one who is too critical
has few friends.

657
00:29:26,647 --> 00:29:28,007
Ridiculous.

658
00:29:38,686 --> 00:29:41,166
Zhao Jikai, you can go home now.

659
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:43,086
But the case is not yet closed.

660
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,086
Keep your phone on.

661
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:47,046
We may call you over at any time.

662
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:48,007
Got it?

663
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,086
Okay.

664
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:50,487
Bye.

665
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:54,566
Jikai.

666
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:05,727
Don't worry.

667
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:06,887
I'm fine.

668
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,086
I'm glad you're fine.

669
00:30:09,527 --> 00:30:10,727
I'm glad you're fine.

670
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:12,086
Has Mr. Yin

671
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:13,206
been released?

672
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,367
I don't know.

673
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:15,727
I haven't heard anything about him.

674
00:30:15,967 --> 00:30:18,406
They could have insisted on
a 24-hour interrogation of him.

675
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:19,686
What about you?

676
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,046
What did they ask you?

677
00:30:25,527 --> 00:30:26,406
Let's talk about it when we get back.

678
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:26,847
Let's go.

679
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:30,686
Keep the red packet

680
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:32,086
and use it to buy formula for yourself.

681
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:32,847
An Ni.

682
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,286
How could you do this to me?

683
00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:39,487
Do you even think of me
as your best friend?

684
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:41,527
You informed me after the delivery.

685
00:30:42,887 --> 00:30:45,286
He was in too much of
a hurry to come into the world.

686
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:47,086
It's half a month early.

687
00:30:47,286 --> 00:30:48,326
I informed you right after

688
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:49,767
I was discharged
from the hospital today.

689
00:30:51,086 --> 00:30:52,046
Don't blame me.

690
00:30:52,566 --> 00:30:54,367
Tang can't come either.

691
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,286
You're so cute.

692
00:31:03,566 --> 00:31:05,367
So cute.

693
00:31:07,566 --> 00:31:08,847
Have you thought of a name for him?

694
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:10,086
An Ning.

695
00:31:10,767 --> 00:31:13,566
I just hope he can live a peaceful

696
00:31:13,727 --> 00:31:17,686
and quiet life and that he can

697
00:31:17,686 --> 00:31:19,086
bring peace to our family.

698
00:31:24,446 --> 00:31:25,767
You have decided to forgive him?

699
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:31,487
I really didn't want to forgive him.

700
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:34,247
But when I was giving birth to him,

701
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:36,727
Yonggang was kneeling at the door.

702
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:38,686
I held back and didn't go soft.

703
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:40,286
I haven't let him see the baby too.

704
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,647
I didn't even ask
his opinion on the name.

705
00:31:44,926 --> 00:31:47,926
But Mr. Xiao has been telling me

706
00:31:48,046 --> 00:31:49,686
that he has really changed a lot,

707
00:31:50,247 --> 00:31:52,086
not like how he used to swear

708
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:53,046
and pay lip service,

709
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:55,247
but he has changed for real.

710
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,367
I feel like he's serious this time.

711
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:02,086
So I think about forgiving him again.

712
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:09,847
I believe he can really change

713
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,086
and be a good father this time.

714
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:19,367
Do you understand what your mother said?

715
00:32:19,446 --> 00:32:20,446
Oh dear.

716
00:32:20,527 --> 00:32:22,046
Did you get it?

717
00:32:23,686 --> 00:32:25,566
You're smiling so much.

718
00:32:25,566 --> 00:32:26,326
Oh dear.

719
00:32:28,727 --> 00:32:32,767
Yitang, you'd better leave me.

720
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:36,527
Why are you talking about this again?

721
00:32:36,686 --> 00:32:38,727
Didn't we promise not to talk about this?

722
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:43,847
I have a bad feeling about this. Really.

723
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:46,286
I used to get a feeling

724
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:47,887
every time something happened,

725
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:49,847
and this time too.

726
00:32:53,527 --> 00:32:55,046
Although Yin Huiquan

727
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:56,967
has been targeted for the time being,

728
00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:02,166
they will find out
about me sooner or later.

729
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:08,166
I like challenges.

730
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,566
The harder it is, the more I like it.

731
00:33:10,887 --> 00:33:12,206
You can't convince me.

732
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:14,086
Now that you're out,

733
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:17,527
I can then give it a go

734
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:18,847
without any worries.

735
00:33:19,367 --> 00:33:20,887
Since everyone is now focusing

736
00:33:20,926 --> 00:33:25,206
on Yin Huiquan, let's just make it real.

737
00:33:25,446 --> 00:33:27,007
Destroy all evidence

738
00:33:27,326 --> 00:33:30,086
and sever all ties.

739
00:33:30,247 --> 00:33:31,686
She will never turn you in.

740
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,086
You two got in touch without
anyone else being involved.

741
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:35,926
So we're safe.

742
00:33:36,286 --> 00:33:37,767
Nothing has gotten out of hand yet.

743
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:43,206
I've confirmed what
was searched in the company.

744
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:47,007
No one knows about the user data

745
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,446
you filtered in the usual way,

746
00:33:48,686 --> 00:33:49,686
and the less you have to worry about

747
00:33:49,686 --> 00:33:51,446
the tampering in the new games.

748
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,887
There are no physical evidence
and witnesses.

749
00:33:56,686 --> 00:33:58,647
By the way, Jikai, I remember

750
00:33:59,326 --> 00:34:01,367
you weren't good at programming.

751
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:04,086
And was all this done remotely
with the help of her men

752
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:05,367
outside the country?

753
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:12,366
What if I said someone was
in the country to help me?

754
00:34:13,287 --> 00:34:15,287
Then this person must vanish,

755
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,087
and we must never let them find him.

756
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:24,287
I was joking. It's Qian Tianxin.

757
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:29,087
She got someone to operate it remotely.

758
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:30,846
That's great.

759
00:34:31,327 --> 00:34:34,327
I guess she has already thought of a plan

760
00:34:34,327 --> 00:34:36,366
to deal with those issues involving you.

761
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:38,487
and there's no evidence

762
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:40,087
against you in Country F.

763
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:42,727
Professor Luo of Huiquan Corporation

764
00:34:43,406 --> 00:34:44,567
is a smart person.

765
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,087
If confronted with
a more powerful person,

766
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,047
he will choose to play it safe

767
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,047
and turn a blind eye.

768
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:52,846
Therefore, in the entire group,

769
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:55,126
only Xiao Mu'en is now left
to be dealt with.

770
00:34:57,087 --> 00:34:57,886
Fine, let's not talk about him.

771
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:02,126
If you want to say something,
just say it.

772
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,846
You're going to find out
sooner or later anyway,

773
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:11,646
so I might as well just tell you.

774
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:16,686
After you and Mr. Yin were taken away,

775
00:35:16,926 --> 00:35:19,926
Professor Luo supported
Xiao Mu'en's rise to power.

776
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,206
He is now in temporary charge
of the Huiquan Corporation.

777
00:35:27,287 --> 00:35:31,007
A company will continue to operate

778
00:35:31,007 --> 00:35:32,087
regardless of who is absent.

779
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:37,047
You're the only one in the company

780
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:38,926
who's worried about
what happened to me this time,

781
00:35:39,727 --> 00:35:41,686
no one else cares whether I stay or go.

782
00:35:42,487 --> 00:35:45,886
Luo Jiangxiao is very cunning.

783
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,007
He follows Old Man

784
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:49,886
too closely all day.

785
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:52,126
Old Man likes Xiao Mu'en,

786
00:35:52,686 --> 00:35:54,287
so he goes along with him.

787
00:35:55,886 --> 00:35:58,686
Jikai, you can't say that.

788
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:00,487
Most of the employees at Huiquan

789
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,047
are in a difficult position.

790
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:04,087
And Xiao Mu'en

791
00:36:04,646 --> 00:36:06,727
is at best a situation solver
at the moment.

792
00:36:09,327 --> 00:36:09,886
Alright.

793
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:11,327
Let's not talk about them anymore.

794
00:36:11,527 --> 00:36:13,767
Go and cook me a bowl of dumplings.

795
00:36:13,926 --> 00:36:14,727
I'm hungry.

796
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:18,327
Okay.

797
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:58,087
Jikai, the dumplings are ready.

798
00:37:03,247 --> 00:37:04,047
Jikai.

799
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:04,487
A, I'm here.

800
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:16,886
So it's you.

801
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,460
(I'm leaving. Sorry, I lied to you
again. Like I said, I'm not worth it.)

802
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:11,621
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

803
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:13,406
Hello, it's me.

804
00:40:14,087 --> 00:40:16,767
Pack up now and leave immediately.

805
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:18,487
Leave those things behind.

806
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:19,287
Just leave them there.

807
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:20,327
Forget about them.

808
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:22,247
Listen to me.

809
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,247
Life is of the utmost importance.

810
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:26,287
You must leave at once.

811
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:33,247
Bro, I'm sorry.

812
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:39,967
(A few days ago,)

813
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:41,287
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

814
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:43,247
(arrested the blogger, Bian,)

815
00:40:43,527 --> 00:40:46,216
(on suspicion of infringement of
the reputation or honor of)

816
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:47,646
(a hero or a martyr.)

817
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,807
(It is reported that the suspect, Bian,)

818
00:40:49,886 --> 00:40:51,446
(posted slanderous and
derogatory comments)

819

(about the martyr
of public security model)

in overseas operation)

(through Huibo and
other social media platforms.)

822
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:00,686
What an ingrate.

823
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,206
Such people would have been killed
if they didn't live

824
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:04,646
in a society where
the rule of law prevails.

825
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:05,527
Yes.

826
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,380
(Police)

827
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,366
I think what you have just said
is very true.

828
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:20,166
