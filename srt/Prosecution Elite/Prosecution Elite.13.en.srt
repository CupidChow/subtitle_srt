15
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:39,851
Ms. An.

16
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,531
Ms. An is back.

17
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,052
You're finally back.

18
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:43,611
- Are you feeling better?
- Much better.

19
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:44,492
- Much better.
- Miss.

20
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:46,211
Are you recovering well?

21
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:46,891
Not bad.

22
00:01:46,971 --> 00:01:49,052
Why do you look fat now?

23
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:50,412
Go away!

24
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:52,092
You make me feel awkward.

25
00:01:52,172 --> 00:01:53,372
I'm taking the chance to be lazy!

26
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:55,372
Look at your dark circles.

27
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:57,291
Does Captain He
force you to work overtime?

28
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,492
We really volunteer to work overtime.

29
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:01,971
Listen,

30
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,291
am I leading well?

31
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:04,531
Miss.

32
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:05,452
You know what,

33
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:07,732
we hadn't gotten off work
on time these days without you.

34
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:10,452
She is supporting you, right?

35
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:12,651
You don't complain about him.

36
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,092
I need to thank him

37
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:14,851
for sending me to hospital

38
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,131
in a timely manner.

39
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:18,771
He even helped me to take
something from my house.

40
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,411
Right?

41
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:20,972
Took something from your house?

42
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:21,771
Took something.

43
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:23,131
Come on! Come on!

44
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:24,291
Continue our meeting!

45
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:25,372
Just now we stop at...

46
00:02:25,372 --> 00:02:26,092
Where do we stop?

47
00:02:26,252 --> 00:02:26,931
Took something.

48
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:29,291
What is that?

49
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:30,571
Well.

50
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:31,252
Yin Huiquan.

51
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,452
Yin Huiquan.

52
00:02:32,972 --> 00:02:34,051
There is no intersection between

53
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,732
Yin Huiquan and the juridical person

54
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:37,532
who involved in the illegal online lending.

55
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:40,372
Han Xuan has gone through the
big data research and judgment,

56
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,452
and his various social connections,

57
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:43,571
including Yin Huiquan's son

58
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,051
Yin Tiancheng,

59
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,172
have been thoroughly checked,

60
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:48,771
there is nothing special.

61
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:53,291
These money laundering and tax evasion crimes

62
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:54,851
are all means by which suspect

63
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:55,851
can sell stolen goods.

64
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,252
Do these have anything to do with

65
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:01,051
those illegal online lending accounts?

66
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:03,372
Didn't Yin Huiquan open an account overseas?

67
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,131
Is there any connection?

68
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:07,571
Well.

69
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:10,892
We can track accounts in China,

70
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:14,651
but it's hard to track any account overseas.

71
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:16,771
Hey dude.

72
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:18,252
It's not a big deal.

73
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:21,051
We have a hidden expert
in our prosecution system,

74
00:03:21,372 --> 00:03:22,372
a computer expert.

75
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:24,291
He's a low profile guy.

76
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,491
He hides his accomplishments and reputation.

77
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:29,651
Okay, okay.

78
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:30,372
I know you're that guy.

79
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:31,252
Don't prolong the agony.

80
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:31,771
Come to the point.

81
00:03:33,051 --> 00:03:33,651
Okay, okay, okay.

82
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:35,051
I will satisfy everyone.

83
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:36,211
Nowadays,

84
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,651
the internet has a memory,

85
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:40,812
this is the era of big data
where information is transparent.

86
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:44,972
I found out that a company
established in Hong Kong, China

87
00:03:44,972 --> 00:03:46,571
has financial relations
with Huiquan's company.

88
00:03:47,892 --> 00:03:48,892
But we don't have

89
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,372
the law enforcement power.

90
00:03:50,491 --> 00:03:53,131
We can only report this to our superiors

91
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:55,172
and ask them to contact
the Hong Kong police

92
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,851
to seek their assistance
in the investigation.

93
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,051
Anything else?

94
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,372
We have retrieved and analysed

95
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,892
Yin Huiquan's entry and exit records,

96
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:04,972
flight ticket information,

97
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,051
and his visa,

98
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:08,252
but we didn't find
that he has ever appeared,

99
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,372
or even transitioned into the Country A
we targeted.

100
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,332
But I had found out

101
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:14,851
that he has permanent residency status
in Hong Kong, China.

102
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,971
The rest of the situation is consistent
with the recuperation, family visits

103
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:20,612
and business activities we known before.

104
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:21,291
There is no problem.

105
00:04:21,892 --> 00:04:22,811
But the other thing is,

106
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:25,052
if he has another passport,

107
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,212
we will not be able
to track the information.

108
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:29,571
By the way,

109
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:33,052
you asked me to investigate
Li Quan's relatives

110
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,811
in Hong Kong, China last time, right?

111
00:04:34,851 --> 00:04:35,131
Yes.

112
00:04:35,332 --> 00:04:36,172
I also found out something.

113
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:40,091
Li Quan does have ties to Hong Kong, China.

114
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:43,052
His mother stays alone in Hong Kong, China

115
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:45,571
and Li Quan is an adopted child.

116
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,251
There are so many criminal forms of

117
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,411
telecom and online frauds,

118
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:50,971
they have even access
to the personal information

119
00:04:50,971 --> 00:04:52,371
of so many users.

120
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,452
We don't know
how large a criminal network

121
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:55,691
these criminal gangs

122
00:04:55,732 --> 00:04:56,492
have woven in China.

123
00:04:59,052 --> 00:04:59,411
By the way,

124
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:00,971
last time you said that the dead body

125
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:01,892
drag out from Qingshui River

126
00:05:01,932 --> 00:05:03,212
wasn't Zhang Xiaobei, who was it?

127
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,172
A man with some mental problems.

128
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:07,492
The mobile phone card found

129
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,892
was not issued by Zhang Xiaobei's ID card

130
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:11,772
or Zhang Xiaoguang's ID card.

131
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:13,851
It was a virtual copy card.

132
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:15,772
And most of the data inside

133
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:16,772
had been deleted,

134
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:19,172
leaving only one photo of Xiaobei

135
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,212
and some records of WeChat transfers.

136
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:25,131
On some special days, he transferred

137
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:27,851
amount like 521, 1314.

138
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:29,971
I wonder

139
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,172
if he's got a girlfriend.

140
00:05:41,452 --> 00:05:42,332
You lie.

141
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:45,411
My mother wouldn't do
what you say she did.

142
00:05:47,332 --> 00:05:49,411
Do you think
if you don't tell the truth,

143
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,492
your organisation will provide care

144
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:52,371
for your family?

145
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:54,971
Please don't treat me

146
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,811
in such a childish way.

147
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,131
All right.

148
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,291
I don't speak to you
in a childish way,

149
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:02,652
I'll just play you the recording of

150
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:04,652
your mother speaking to you.

151
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:06,091
(My son,)

152
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:09,131
(I know,)

153
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,652
(the money you gave me
every time, like they say,)

154
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:16,452
(is from a scam.)

155
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:20,251
(Even if I die of illness,)

156
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:23,332
(I won't take a penny from you.)

157
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:26,851
(No matter how poor we are,)

158
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:29,851
(we shouldn't do immoral things.)

159
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:36,291
Is there anything
you want to tell me today?

160
00:06:38,652 --> 00:06:39,131
I...

161
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:41,892
I think I've got it.

162
00:06:41,971 --> 00:06:42,732
If you've got it,

163
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:43,892
just tell me.

164
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,571
Zhang Wanru's death

165
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,732
wasn't an accident.

166
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:49,732
I indeed know

167
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:51,251
Paul.

168
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:53,091
Actually, even if you hadn't shown me

169
00:06:53,131 --> 00:06:54,851
that video last time,

170
00:06:55,492 --> 00:06:56,892
I'd been struggling.

171
00:06:57,892 --> 00:06:59,012
If he said it first,

172
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:01,052
something would happen to me.

173
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,732
If you want to know about Paul,

174
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:03,531
I can tell you.

175
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,131
Paul has been found
dead by the local police

176
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,371
due to drunk driving.

177
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:11,052
Nothing to do with intentional murder.

178
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,371
But a person like Paul

179
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:15,411
who was struggling to live in danger

180
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:17,851
was caught in another case,

181
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,371
and after being caught,

182
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:25,411
he was nervous and told the truth

183
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,571
that he was hired by A to create an accident.

184
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,131
In fact, I have also figured it out.

185
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,571
In this organisation,

186
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,851
I'm at most a senior worker

187
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,652
or a contractor in the larger sense.

188
00:07:39,212 --> 00:07:40,332
Now this isn't

189
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:43,251
as simple as I thought before.

190
00:07:43,612 --> 00:07:46,892
Telecom fraud involves murder

191
00:07:47,492 --> 00:07:49,131
and even the murder of a police.

192
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:51,492
I can't hold onto this matter.

193
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:53,411
If I take on this crime,

194
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,892
then someone lives freely
and happily out there.

195
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:59,012
Are you referring to A?

196
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:00,291
Yes.

197
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:04,012
Then why did you never
mention this from the time

198
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,131
you were extradited
to your country

199
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,012
until you were sentenced to prison?

200
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,172
I was afraid.

201
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,172
I was afraid they would find me

202
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,131
and take revenge on me.

203
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:14,971
Besides,

204
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:18,131
they gave me a settlement fee.

205
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:18,892
You know,

206
00:08:19,492 --> 00:08:20,612
the most taboo thing

207
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:22,971
in our field is betrayal.

208
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,452
People who expose the boss

209
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:27,691
basically don't end up well.

210
00:08:28,691 --> 00:08:29,332
But

211
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:34,772
I only know so little about him.

212
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:36,212
I thought

213
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:37,371
this little bit

214
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:39,452
doesn't help your case much,

215
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:41,452
so I'll just leave it.

216
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:42,491
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)
Besides,

217
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,092
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)

218
00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:44,452
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)
no matter what I say,

219
00:08:45,012 --> 00:08:46,292
you won't be able to catch him.

220
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:46,731
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)

221
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:48,731
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)
You said you haven't seen him before,

222
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:51,171
and you don't even know
where he comes from.

223
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:53,811
So why are you so certain that

224
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:54,811
we can't catch him?

225
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:56,571
Well.

226
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:01,131
I'll tell you all I know

227
00:09:01,772 --> 00:09:02,691
about him today.

228
00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:07,892
But whether you catch him or not,
you judge yourself.

229
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:10,251
Firstly,

230
00:09:10,852 --> 00:09:13,412
I don't know which country

231
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:14,611
he comes from.

232
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,131
I heard from my upline,

233
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:19,412
he seems to be Asian.

234
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:22,051
But I'm not sure if he is Chinese.

235
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:23,491
Secondly,

236
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,412
he has many strongpoints

237
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:28,332
in Europe, South East Asia and Japan.

238
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:31,731
He is impossible to
stay in one place for long.

239
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:32,931
Thirdly,

240
00:09:33,212 --> 00:09:36,171
he is different from other

241
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:36,811
online fraud gangs.

242
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:39,691
Heard that he has many properties,

243
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:42,931
including casinos in the Country F

244
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:46,491
and hotels in Europe.

245
00:09:48,012 --> 00:09:49,811
Is he too boring?

246
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:52,931
What is he doing with
so many properties?

247
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,571
Four,

248
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:01,491
the hierarchy and personnel of this gang

249
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:03,652
are much more complex than

250
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,972
the cases you have solved before.

251
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:07,652
I know this.

252
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,251
You're like the boss of

253
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:12,972
a local branch of a company,

254
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:15,171
and there's another level above you.

255
00:10:15,412 --> 00:10:18,491
And there's more than
one level between you and A,

256
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:19,131
right?

257
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:20,171
Yes.

258
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:25,452
I'm in charge of Country A,

259
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:26,892
but

260
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:30,892
there are many people like me,

261
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,292
we are at most a team leader.

262
00:10:33,412 --> 00:10:35,092
But above each of us,

263
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,131
there is a manager,

264
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:39,092
all on a single line.

265
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:41,092
The person in charge is only eligible

266
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:43,852
to contact A's spokesperson.

267
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:45,452
Well.

268
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:49,092
A's spokesperson is a female.

269
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,371
How do you know?

270
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:55,731
Once when my upline came to Country A,

271
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:58,972
I treated him eat and drink.

272
00:10:59,532 --> 00:11:01,972
You know we Chinese have got a big ego.

273
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:06,131
After drinking too much,
I took him to the red-light district

274
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:07,972
and selected a woman for him

275
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,092
to accompany him.

276
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,772
I'm not sure if he's drunk

277
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,491
or not interested,

278
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:18,772
but he told me that these European ladies

279
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:22,412
can't compare to Ms. Xin.

280
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:24,412
Ms. Xin?

281
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,972
Is Ms. Xin the spokesperson for A

282
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:28,731
you just mentioned?

283
00:11:29,852 --> 00:11:30,251
Yes.

284
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:31,292
I asked him

285
00:11:32,051 --> 00:11:33,212
who is Ms. Xin?

286
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:36,051
He said that in the team,

287
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:39,532
Ms. Xin was the only one
who could meet A.

288
00:11:40,412 --> 00:11:44,611
I just knew that Ms. Xin is a beautiful woman!

289
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:46,691
Okay, back to the point.

290
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,171
Who found Paul?

291
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:49,131
What's their deals?

292
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:52,931
It really has nothing to do with me.

293
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:56,412
Paul was introduced to my upline by me.

294
00:11:57,571 --> 00:12:01,731
He takes money and helps to defeat the scourge.

295
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:03,051
My upline passed me

296
00:12:03,452 --> 00:12:05,772
Zhang Wanru's information

297
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:07,892
and told me that I don't need

298
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,212
to handle this matter.

299
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:12,611
He said he would find a way to settle

300
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:15,332
Zhang Wanru on the way to Huadu.

301
00:12:15,892 --> 00:12:18,332
I don't think
this matter is my business.

302
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,251
It's none of my business

303
00:12:20,972 --> 00:12:22,491
what he wanted to do, right?

304
00:12:23,772 --> 00:12:25,371
Your upline Mr. Zhou

305
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,772
is listed on Interpol's red notice,

306
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:29,491
and it's only a matter
of time before he's caught.

307
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:39,051
This is the transcript

308
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:41,171
of your statement just now.

309
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:42,652
Please check it carefully.

310
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:45,332
If there are no omissions or errors,

311
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:47,251
please sign and fingerprint each page.

312
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,452
If that upline Mr. Zhou is caught,

313
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,731
you may have to confront him.

314
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:54,892
To be honest,

315
00:12:56,571 --> 00:13:00,580
it was quite sad for me to see

316
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:04,012
Zhang Wanru die like this.

317
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:07,811
Because we had worked together for so long

318
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,092
and we are both Chinese.

319
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:12,611
Okay.

320
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:14,491
Take it and confirm with him.

321
00:13:17,332 --> 00:13:18,292
Prosecutor An.

322
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:19,852
My mom...

323
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:20,611
No worries.

324
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:21,332
She's fine.

325
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:24,532
Since you're willing to
provide the information about Paul,

326
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:26,092
we'll definitely keep it on record,

327
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:27,452
which will help you in your sentencing.

328
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:28,892
Serve your sentence well.

329
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,012
Thanks to government.

330
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:31,652
Thank you.

331
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:33,931
Confirm before you
leave your hand print.

332
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:35,931
Sure.

333
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:44,532
Li Quan told everything,

334
00:13:44,652 --> 00:13:47,412
basically is similar with what we guess before.

335
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:51,212
What we now know is
that in this vast organisation,

336
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:54,611
A is the source,

337
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:56,452
and under him would be

338
00:13:56,611 --> 00:13:58,652
six to seven levels of criminal organisations,

339
00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,012
with A as the core.

340
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:01,532
Ms. Xin under him,

341
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:02,931
is the only spokesperson for A.

342
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,131
She liaises with each region,

343
00:14:05,251 --> 00:14:08,092
as well as the strongpoints,

344
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:09,731
and also disseminating information.

345
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:11,051
That means Ms. Xin holds

346
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:12,811
a high position in this organisation.

347
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,571
And each of these regions

348
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,571
has its own person in charge,

349
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,332
and each person in charge

350
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,652
has one way vertical
communication with Ms. Xin.

351
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:22,332
They seldom have
horizontal communication.

352
00:14:22,452 --> 00:14:23,171
This also ensures

353
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:25,452
the security and secrecy
of this criminal organisation.

354
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:27,571
I admire the hard work

355
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:30,452
of the staff in the public security system
during this period,

356
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,012
who had been able to sort out

357
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,652
these clues in such a short time.

358
00:14:34,131 --> 00:14:35,532
It also gave a big boost

359
00:14:35,532 --> 00:14:36,731
to our Operation 7.23.

360
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:38,652
But the real culprit, A,

361
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:39,811
is still out there.

362
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,332
We need to continue investigating

363
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:42,371
and work hard, everyone.

364
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:44,772
Prosecutor An,

365
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,452
according to your analysis,

366
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:48,972
every additional level
of their organisation

367
00:14:49,332 --> 00:14:51,731
makes it exponentially
more difficult for us to investigate.

368
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:52,171
Yes.

369
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,691
You're right.

370
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:55,251
But I'm not worried about that.

371
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,652
I'm worried about
no breakthrough for the case.

372
00:14:57,131 --> 00:14:59,171
But the clues that Li Quan provided are

373
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:00,051
all breakthrough.

374
00:15:00,772 --> 00:15:03,012
I believe that this is a tough battle.

375
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:05,212
We need to be more patient than A,

376
00:15:05,452 --> 00:15:06,371
so that we can beat him.

377
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:07,691
Prosecutor An.

378
00:15:07,852 --> 00:15:10,131
We confirmed with Interpol that

379
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,772
Li Quan's upline was named Zhou Siyue.

380
00:15:12,972 --> 00:15:14,811
I think it'll be better to find

381
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:15,852
clues from this man.

382
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:18,092
How many red notices

383
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:19,491
does Interpol issue in a year?

384
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:21,811
They can't catch people
by issuing red notices.

385
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:24,731
The information we currently have is that

386
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:27,652
he went from Spain to Portugal

387
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:29,491
and then from Portugal to Sweden,

388
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:30,811
and then we lost track of him.

389
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:34,371
But finally, we found out that

390
00:15:34,972 --> 00:15:37,092
Zhou Siyue's hometown is

391
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,251
in Changchun, Jilin.

392
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,292
So Jia,

393
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:40,611
Yes.

394
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:42,652
you lead the team
to Changchun tomorrow

395
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:45,212
to track his information in China.

396
00:15:45,251 --> 00:15:46,171
I want detail information like

397
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:47,772
when did he join the team
during primary school.

398
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,292
So detail?

399
00:15:50,652 --> 00:15:51,051
Captain He,

400
00:15:51,092 --> 00:15:52,012
how long do you give me?

401
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,171
One week.

402
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:54,652
One week later,

403
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,772
you need to explain his situation

404
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:57,811
like a book review.

405
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:58,691
Yes, sir!

406
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,652
I promise to get it done.

407
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:01,571
You get some works to do.

408
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:03,652
Don't gloat, Han Xuan.

409
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:04,731
From now on,

410
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,731
you sort out all the online crime information

411
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:07,652
in China.

412
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:10,051
Anyone who's been in contact with Ms. Xin,

413
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:11,051
investigate one by one,

414
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:12,972
new clues should be found soon.

415
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:15,292
Yes.

416
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:16,691
No problem.

417
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,710
(Chief Procurator's Office)

418
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,212
The more we know now,

419
00:16:21,251 --> 00:16:23,691
the more we can't get around Ms. Xin.

420
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,371
Not only the situation
that the suspect confessed before,

421
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,051
including the last telecom's case,

422
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:29,532
according to the investigation

423
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:31,332
by the public security organs,

424
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:32,571
the upstream of the illegal GOIP

425
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,171
had connection with Ms. Xin.

426
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:35,251
Prosecutor Guo,

427
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:37,051
look at these photos,

428
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:39,412
this woman has extensive powers in Country F,

429
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,171
and is said to be number one

430
00:16:41,212 --> 00:16:42,811
in the telecom and online frauds
in the Harbour City area,

431
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:46,051
especially in Zhongjiang Province.

432
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:55,532
It seems that we really need to meet Ms. Xin.

433
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,960
(Harbour city area, Sanjiang, Country F)

434
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:06,851
Thank you so much.

435
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:11,532
Chairman,

436
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:12,731
don't worry.

437
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,812
I have already contacted Li Yitang

438
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:18,012
and asked her to sue
the journalists and media immediately,

439
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:21,371
as they are suspected
of civil tort and defamation

440
00:18:21,532 --> 00:18:26,572
for digging into your personal privacy.

441
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:29,052
As for those who fabricate

442
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,692
rumours and extort you,

443
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:35,932
they are even more hateful.

444
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:38,172
I asked the person
under us to report the case,

445
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,652
they won't get off easily.

446
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:43,491
At the same time, I also complained to

447
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:45,091
the regulatory authorities,

448
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:46,731
asked them to immediately delete

449
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:48,131
any false reports about you.

450
00:18:48,772 --> 00:18:49,251
In addition,

451
00:18:50,892 --> 00:18:54,892
I also communicated with some authoritative media
and Internet celebrities,

452
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:58,052
asking them to
write about your hard work

453
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:00,532
and entrepreneurial history,

454
00:19:01,572 --> 00:19:05,131
as well as doing charity
and public welfare activities,

455
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:08,012
to lead the focus towards a positive topic.

456
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:08,491
That's good.

457
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:10,131
But,

458
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:11,652
Chairman,

459
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:12,692
I...

460
00:19:12,971 --> 00:19:15,012
There's something
I don't quite understand.

461
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:17,052
Sigh.

462
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:19,052
I know what you want to say.

463
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,091
You are very interested
in the source of this matter.

464
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,692
They described the
untrue things in detail.

465
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,731
Everything seems to be true,

466
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,052
including several incidents in Huiquan,

467
00:19:31,131 --> 00:19:32,851
and even very clear about

468
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:39,012
the time, content and way of the police
to investigate me this time.

469
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:41,572
This makes me to believe also.

470
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,412
True, false,

471
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,731
false, true.

472
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:48,491
But I think

473
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:51,572
these people have an ulterior motive.

474
00:19:51,932 --> 00:19:54,932
They're systematically targeting you

475
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:57,572
to get what they want.

476
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:02,052
It seems that they
really tracked me this time,

477
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,012
but it was their mistake

478
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:07,052
to simply disclose the matter to the public.

479
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:12,052
It's not that easy to dig into me.

480
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:16,652
Normal people can't conduct

481
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:19,731
a thorough investigation in my family.

482
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:24,692
Is it possible that the investigators

483
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,611
took advantage of their position

484
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,091
to acquire some critical information,

485
00:20:30,172 --> 00:20:31,371
then sold it to the media?

486
00:20:34,131 --> 00:20:35,131
This is possible too.

487
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:37,211
However, if national staffs

488
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,292
sell and provide information,

489
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,331
they must bear relevant
legal responsibilities.

490
00:20:45,091 --> 00:20:45,812
True.

491
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,611
Isn't Mayor Xu very concerned about

492
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:49,892
the development of our company?

493
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:52,731
Then we report to her

494
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:56,251
and ask her to reflect
the situation to the relevant authorities.

495
00:21:08,491 --> 00:21:10,812
Have you noticed that Prosecutor Guo is
in a bad mood recently?

496
00:21:11,251 --> 00:21:12,412
Prosecutor Guo

497
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:14,251
is currently suffering.

498
00:21:14,892 --> 00:21:16,012
What happened?

499
00:21:17,131 --> 00:21:18,692
Prosecutor Guo and Chief Bai were

500
00:21:19,052 --> 00:21:23,251
summoned by the Provincial Department
of Inspection to talk about

501
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:24,772
the matter of Huiquan.

502
00:21:26,932 --> 00:21:27,532
Were we wrong

503
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:30,172
for investigating Huiquan?

504
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,692
Ni, don't be so absolute.

505
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:35,451
Maybe leaders just
want to know the situation.

506
00:21:35,491 --> 00:21:35,932
Right?

507
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,932
The focus of the work of
the Supreme People's Procuratorate is

508
00:21:39,052 --> 00:21:42,371
to guide enterprises to
operate in accordance with the law

509
00:21:42,772 --> 00:21:45,412
and protect the private company.

510
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,292
This is also the requirement
of the central government

511
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,772
and the mission of
our procuratorial organs

512
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:52,172
to proactively perform their duties.

513
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,030
(Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau)

514
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:01,052
Report!

515
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:02,131
Come in.

516
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:04,731
Okay.

517
00:22:05,412 --> 00:22:05,812
Hurry.

518
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:06,932
Please come in.

519
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:09,692
Have a seat.

520
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:11,012
Have a seat.

521
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:12,611
Have a seat.

522
00:22:16,172 --> 00:22:16,971
Sir,

523
00:22:17,652 --> 00:22:18,731
we heard

524
00:22:19,012 --> 00:22:21,731
that you two took the brunt for us.

525
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:24,772
Thank you for trusting us

526
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:26,251
and giving support on our job.

527
00:22:26,932 --> 00:22:28,532
He is good in talking.

528
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,052
Well.

529
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:35,172
Given that cyber crime is now on a rapid rise,

530
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:37,371
the top management of the command center

531
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:39,012
takes this matter very seriously

532
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,772
and has issued the latest instructions,

533
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:42,611
concentrating all advantageous resources

534
00:22:43,131 --> 00:22:45,932
to escort this special operation.

535
00:22:46,371 --> 00:22:48,292
This time there are three troops,

536
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:50,611
one for each of the three
Southeast Asian countries.

537
00:22:51,292 --> 00:22:53,091
In addition,
due to the successful breakthrough

538
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:54,611
of the Operation 7·23

539
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,451
and all clues pointing to Country F,

540
00:22:58,012 --> 00:22:59,532
our superiors
have specifically instructed

541
00:22:59,652 --> 00:23:00,932
our Operation 7·23 team

542
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,451
to also participate in this operation,

543
00:23:02,731 --> 00:23:05,172
with the prosecutor in charge of
international judicial coordination.

544
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:07,131
The target is Country F.

545
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,052
The memories

546
00:23:08,131 --> 00:23:10,772
and lessons left by Wanru back then

547
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:12,611
are profound.

548
00:23:13,371 --> 00:23:14,251
So this time,

549
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:17,851
you must be very cautious.

550
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:21,052
Prosecutor Guo and I had discussed

551
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:23,052
you two will be in charge of

552
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:24,812
the overseas operation team.

553
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:26,251
As for the members,

554
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,052
you can negotiate
and decide on your own.

555
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:32,331
There are four points of work discipline.

556
00:23:34,052 --> 00:23:34,652
Firstly,

557
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,012
no matter what happens,

558
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:40,572
you must prioritise

559
00:23:40,572 --> 00:23:42,371
your own safety.

560
00:23:42,652 --> 00:23:45,532
I want each of you to come back safely.

561
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:46,532
Prosecutor Guo.

562
00:23:48,131 --> 00:23:48,572
Well.

563
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:51,012
I'll just emphasise two points.

564
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:54,412
Firstly, this is a
cross-border operation,

565
00:23:54,731 --> 00:23:56,731
so everything must
be legal and compliant.

566
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:58,012
Don't cause any problems.

567
00:23:58,451 --> 00:24:01,371
You two will be in charge of the details.

568
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:03,091
Another thing is

569
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:04,971
that you must make it clear

570
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:06,851
that you are just an advance team

571
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:09,572
and only need to complete your own work,

572
00:24:09,772 --> 00:24:11,971
collect evidence and target suspect.

573
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:14,211
As for arrest and repatriation,

574
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:15,211
the domestic command center

575
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:16,652
will communicate with

576
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:18,052
the local government.

577
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:19,572
The local law enforcement department

578
00:24:19,572 --> 00:24:20,572
will cooperate with your actions,

579
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:21,772
is that clear?

580
00:24:21,772 --> 00:24:22,292
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

581
00:24:24,371 --> 00:24:25,292
Don't worry.

582
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:26,652
We promise to get the job done.

583
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:32,091
Wishing you all good luck

584
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:33,251
and successful.

585
00:24:37,892 --> 00:24:39,971
We look forward to your triumph!

586
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,532
We'll synchronise the key points
of the Operation 7.23

587
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:50,692
with you again.

588
00:24:51,451 --> 00:24:54,371
Now, according to the people

589
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:56,812
serving sentences in the Operation 7.23,

590
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:58,491
there is such a person as A.

591
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:00,572
But they had never met A.

592
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,451
And they just heard about him from Ms. Xin.

593
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:05,371
All orders are also

594
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,812
delivered through Ms. Xin.

595
00:25:07,451 --> 00:25:08,971
Now we are highly suspicious,

596
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:10,652
is there a person as A or not?

597
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:11,932
Or are A and Ms. Xin

598
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:13,772
the same person?

599
00:25:14,172 --> 00:25:15,371
Because the intelligence of criminals

600
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:16,091
and the means to escape crime

601
00:25:16,172 --> 00:25:17,932
are also very excellent nowadays.

602
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:22,731
We don't know whether Ms. Xin is A or not.

603
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:26,652
But as for the series of online cases
we are currently investigating,

604
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,851
the masterminds are all point to Country F,

605
00:25:28,971 --> 00:25:31,251
Qian Tianxin of Country F.

606
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:33,172
But whether Qian Tianxin

607
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,532
is upline of Zhou Siyue, Ms. Xin or not,

608
00:25:36,652 --> 00:25:38,412
we need to further confirm.

609
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,812
Why is it Country F again?

610
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,772
Isn't the technology and equipment

611
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:43,932
there very old?

612
00:25:44,172 --> 00:25:45,292
How can they still commit

613
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:47,412
cyber crime aggressively in the China

614
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:49,211
and still succeed?

615
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:50,491
That's so crazy!

616
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:51,812
Well.

617
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:53,812
I had discussed with An Ni.

618
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,772
The four of us will be

619
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,572
the advance team for Country F.

620
00:25:58,812 --> 00:25:59,572
Wait a minute.

621
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,851
Who are the four?

622
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:03,772
He doesn't seem to want to go.

623
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:05,371
Go, go, go.

624
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,971
I can go abroad now.

625
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:08,451
All right.

626
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:10,611
You're right.

627
00:26:10,892 --> 00:26:11,892
Instead of technology,

628
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:13,572
these criminals are now relying on

629
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:15,851
legal differences between each country.

630
00:26:16,172 --> 00:26:18,692
They can brazenly and recklessly operate abroad

631
00:26:18,851 --> 00:26:21,371
is also because gambling is regulated

632
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:22,772
differently in each country.

633
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:25,491
This time we have to
work in a foreign country,

634
00:26:25,572 --> 00:26:27,971
besides adapting to some local laws,

635
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,652
we also need to find the exact

636
00:26:29,692 --> 00:26:30,812
criminal evidence of these suspect.

637
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:33,052
After proper and effective
judicial communication

638
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:33,772
between the two countries,

639
00:26:33,932 --> 00:26:35,971
these suspect will be
extradited to China.

640
00:26:36,652 --> 00:26:38,652
This is really a big challenge.

641
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,331
Let's go back to the 7·23 case.

642
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:43,371
Captain He had already
synchronized with me just now.

643
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:45,172
Jia is also be continuing to investigate.

644
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,091
What we know so far is that

645
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:49,572
Zhou Siyue had a very sad life,

646
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:51,052
his mother gave birth

647
00:26:51,091 --> 00:26:51,892
to him unmarried.

648
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:53,412
After being thrown out by their family,

649
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:55,131
mother and son drifted around

650
00:26:55,172 --> 00:26:56,772
and ended up nowhere.

651
00:26:56,892 --> 00:26:58,331
Jia obtained the archived photo

652
00:26:58,371 --> 00:26:59,572
of his first generation ID card.

653
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:01,251
An important clue is that

654
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:04,052
there is a big birthmark under his left eye.

655
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:05,052
However,

656
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,211
he should have never filmed

657
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,251
a second-generation ID card,

658
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,211
because there is
no electronic record of him

659
00:27:09,251 --> 00:27:10,772
in the national
public security system.

660
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:13,052
Ni,

661
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:14,371
I have a question.

662
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:15,292
Speak.

663
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,331
Can we go swimming
in the sea in Country F?

664
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:19,251
Stop it.

665
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:20,412
Listen here.

666
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:21,331
We're going to work,

667
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:22,131
not to have fun.

668
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:24,012
I would like to reiterate our discipline

669
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:25,371
and ensure absolute confidentiality,

670
00:27:25,772 --> 00:27:27,292
including for other members
of the operation team.

671
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,131
- Yes, madam.
- Yes, madam.

672
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:31,331
Dismiss.

673
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:33,412
You just know to play.

00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:10,052
Sir.

679
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:13,772
I turn myself in.

680
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,131
What's wrong?

681
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:24,772
I...

682
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:25,731
I...

683
00:28:26,292 --> 00:28:28,091
I'm drunk.

684
00:28:28,572 --> 00:28:29,491
No problem.

685
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:32,211
Since you're here,

686
00:28:32,532 --> 00:28:33,611
just make it clear.

687
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:34,611
I...

688
00:28:38,932 --> 00:28:39,611
Speak.

689
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:42,451
You can't hide from us.

690
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:45,532
Is there anything else
we don't know about?

691
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:47,091
Sir,

692
00:28:47,572 --> 00:28:49,851
I'm here to seek protection.

693
00:28:50,052 --> 00:28:52,611
You all know what I do.

694
00:28:53,211 --> 00:28:53,772
Right.

695
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:56,731
I'm in charge for the Country F line.

696
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:59,251
I help them to transport personnel

697
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:01,052
and also build downline.

698
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:05,371
I have a boss above me.

699
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:07,892
Everything supposed to be fine.

700
00:29:08,451 --> 00:29:09,851
Who knows they double-crossed.

701
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:11,532
When I sent people over,

702
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,052
they didn't give me commission.

703
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:16,371
I went to ask their boss for money,

704
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,892
but this made him anxious.

705
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:21,251
It was Tiger,

706
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:24,611
who not only cut off
all my business in Country F,

707
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:27,091
but also wouldn't let
anyone else work with me,

708
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,172
and he wanted to kill my whole family.

709
00:29:30,412 --> 00:29:32,292
I thought he was joking at first

710
00:29:32,491 --> 00:29:33,412
and didn't take it serious.

711
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:36,292
Then,

712
00:29:36,371 --> 00:29:37,772
I went there again a few days ago.

713
00:29:38,172 --> 00:29:39,251
Just as I arrived at the border,

714
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:40,611
I was surrounded by their people.

715
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:44,532
Fortunately, a few friends helped me,

716
00:29:44,812 --> 00:29:46,091
and I escaped.

717
00:29:46,292 --> 00:29:47,532
I sent my whole family

718
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:49,851
back to hometown.

719
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:53,172
I...

720
00:29:53,652 --> 00:29:56,211
But I can't hide forever.

721
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:57,692
So,

722
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,251
I turn myself in.

723
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:04,451
Then why did you want to leave just now?

724
00:30:04,772 --> 00:30:05,572
Sir,

725
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,971
you need to understand me.

726
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:10,772
I'm in the smuggling business.

727
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:12,611
I'm afraid.

728
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:14,211
It's fine to understand you.

729
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:16,172
First, please explain in detail

730
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,611
how you transported personnel,

731
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:19,851
attracted customers,

732
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,211
and divided the spoils unevenly.

733
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:23,292
Sir,

734
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:24,251
I'll tell you.

735
00:30:24,772 --> 00:30:25,491
(A week ago)
I'll tell everything.

736
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:25,971
(A week ago)

737
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:27,052
(A week ago)
Fei,

738
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:29,371
you're so troublesome.

739
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:32,091
The money you have now

740
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:34,731
is rewarded by me.

741
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:36,971
Earn money.

742
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:40,692
Earn your own money.

743
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:43,292
Don't earn so much

744
00:30:43,652 --> 00:30:44,731
but no chance to spend.

745
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:46,532
Tiger,

746
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:50,012
we agreed that for ordinary stowaways,

747
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:51,172
I get 10%,

748
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,451
for other uses,

749
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,052
I get 50%.

750
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,052
You see,

751
00:30:56,172 --> 00:30:57,971
the money for buying them

752
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,851
was from another company,

753
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:01,572
it wasn't from you.

754
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:07,172
If they sell their organs and die,

755
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,451
my risk will increase.

756
00:31:12,052 --> 00:31:13,172
Those are my resources,

757
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,172
my channels,

758
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:16,692
my ships.

759
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:20,251
You just need to do
some simple peripheral work outside,

760
00:31:20,371 --> 00:31:21,572
deceive people,

761
00:31:21,772 --> 00:31:23,172
and at most drugging up a bit.

762
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:26,572
How dare you ask for

763
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:29,052
so much money?

764
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:30,652
No,

765
00:31:30,652 --> 00:31:31,172
Tiger.

766
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:35,251
You had deducted from the last delivery.

767
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:39,652
You have to give me some this time,

768
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:42,131
otherwise I can't live.

769
00:31:42,172 --> 00:31:44,052
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

770
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,211
Last time you found
someone who was seriously ill

771
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:48,131
and causing trouble on the ship.

772
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,932
I threw him into
the sea to feed the fish.

773
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:51,532
Do you know how much I lost?

774
00:31:52,451 --> 00:31:55,331
I haven't settled this with you yet.

775
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:57,851
That's not right, Tiger.

776
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:58,692
I...

777
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:00,572
Wait... Wait... Wait a minute.

778
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:03,371
This is not...

779
00:32:07,532 --> 00:32:08,052
This...

780
00:32:08,131 --> 00:32:10,611
Look, I brought you the list.

781
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:12,331
Look.

782
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:12,971
Tiger.

783
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:14,052
Last time,

784
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:15,971
five of them are young.

785
00:32:17,412 --> 00:32:18,211
Li Shuang,

786
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,652
Lin Xiaomeng,

787
00:32:20,131 --> 00:32:21,451
and Zhang Xiaobei.

788
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:23,572
I said yes, there is.

789
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:26,012
Don't be shameless.

790
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:30,371
Don't let me see you in this hall again,

791
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:33,772
otherwise I'll kill your whole family.

792
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:34,451
Get out!

793
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,640
(Harbour city area, Sanjiang, Country F)

794
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:43,292
Go in! Go in!

795
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:44,012
All go in!

796
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:45,251
Hurry up!

797
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:46,611
Follow up!

798
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:50,451
Go in quickly!

799
00:32:56,292 --> 00:32:57,012
Hurry up!

800
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:04,491
It's so smelly.

801
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:07,491
Let them shower now.

802
00:33:08,012 --> 00:33:09,692
Listen!

803
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,331
Put your ID card and mobile phone

804
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:12,851
into this box.

805
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:15,572
Why?

806
00:33:15,611 --> 00:33:16,091
Why?

807
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:17,611
This is rule!

808
00:33:17,812 --> 00:33:18,611
You come to the company,

809
00:33:18,611 --> 00:33:20,012
you must abide by its rules!

810
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,331
You should know

811
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:22,292
where is this place,

812
00:33:22,292 --> 00:33:23,451
why are you here.

813
00:33:23,692 --> 00:33:24,091
Collect!

814
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:25,012
Hurry, hurry!

815
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:25,812
Hand it over.

816
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:26,491
Hurry!

817
00:33:26,491 --> 00:33:27,371
Hand it over.

818
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:28,292
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

819
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:29,892
Hurry up! What do you hide?

820
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:30,692
Put it inside.

821
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:32,091
What do you hide?

822
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:32,491
Put inside.

823
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:36,211
Put down.

824
00:33:36,772 --> 00:33:37,172
Put down.

825
00:33:38,532 --> 00:33:41,012
Can I get it back later?

826
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,292
Listen carefully.

827
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:45,331
Later shower yourself properly,

828
00:33:45,412 --> 00:33:46,851
don't bring any lice and fleas

829
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:48,131
out from here!

830
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:49,491
Boss,

831
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,611
it is our first time

832
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,091
to visit Harbour City.

833
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,731
The people who were recruiting said

834
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,131
we would get four days off a month

835
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:56,292
and get to go out for fun.

836
00:33:56,692 --> 00:33:58,172
When can we go out to have fun?

837
00:33:58,211 --> 00:33:58,731
Have fun?

838
00:33:59,131 --> 00:34:00,451
Are you coming for vacation?

839
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,812
Listen carefully!

840
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:08,012
Our company is not
a charitable organisation

841
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:10,812
and never feeds idle people.

842
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:13,332
Who is lazy,

843
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,612
watch up!

844
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,491
If you want to go out,

845
00:34:18,812 --> 00:34:21,211
you earn all the company's accommodation,

846
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,772
transportation, training,

847
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:24,852
and management expenses first.

848
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:28,612
Otherwise, you'll never get to go out!

849
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:31,931
It's different with what we're told.

850
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:32,332
Shut up!

851
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:39,052
Last but not least,

852
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:40,772
although there are many scripts,

853
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,012
they are all the same.

854
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,332
You all know

855
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:45,812
what men need.

856
00:34:45,931 --> 00:34:46,651
We are all men.

857
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:47,852
Some people ask,

858
00:34:48,132 --> 00:34:50,052
do men need love and sex?

859
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:52,171
Yes.

860
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:53,651
But from a certain perspective,

861
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,731
try to understand deeply,

862
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:56,812
what men really

863
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:59,491
need most is a sense of identification.

864
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,132
But you should know that

865
00:35:02,211 --> 00:35:03,251
different men with

866
00:35:03,691 --> 00:35:04,971
different experiences and identities

867
00:35:05,012 --> 00:35:08,012
have different understandings of identity.

868
00:35:08,012 --> 00:35:08,891
For example, middle-aged men

869
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:10,612
have a special identification

870
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:11,971
with the dependence of young girls

871
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:13,171
who are affectionate and helpless.

872
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:18,451
But for young men
who are just coming out of society,

873
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,171
they are most attracted to

874
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:21,651
the praise and favor of mature

875
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:24,092
and outstanding women.

876
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:24,651
So,

877
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:26,812
if you can pretend to be

878
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,372
all these different women,

879
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:29,731
then it's only a matter of time

880
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:31,211
before you get them.

881
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:33,812
Everyone has this booklet with you.

882
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:34,251
Read it.

883
00:35:34,572 --> 00:35:37,971
Inside, there are different scripts for

884
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:40,572
different women with different age and identity.

885
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:43,651
And also a right solution to various questions

886
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:47,731
that different people may encounter and ask you.

887
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:48,651
Copy and paste,

888
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:49,772
no problem at all.

889
00:35:49,812 --> 00:35:51,092
Copy and paste?

890
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:52,651
Does it work?

891
00:35:54,211 --> 00:35:55,651
Don't question our professionalism.

892
00:35:55,691 --> 00:35:57,211
We have psychologist

893
00:35:57,292 --> 00:36:00,772
and excellent marketing directors

894
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:03,812
who provide us with planned scripts,

895
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:05,891
and these are regularly updated.

896
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:06,891
In addition, you have

897
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:09,372
precise information on

898
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:10,491
the people you'll work on,

899
00:36:10,612 --> 00:36:12,691
including their families, ages, identities,

900
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:13,572
names,

901
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:17,292
and even the names
of their family members,

902
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:18,092
all are there.

903
00:36:18,251 --> 00:36:19,971
This is a solid foundation

904
00:36:20,292 --> 00:36:21,491
that our C-level executive

905
00:36:21,731 --> 00:36:24,132
built for us in the early days.

906
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:25,812
You'll see the result

907
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:27,651
if you use it correctly.

908
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:29,612
But what if they want a voice call?

909
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:31,211
What decade are you from?

910
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:34,332
Do you know that this is the high-tech era.

911
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,812
There is a software called

912
00:36:37,092 --> 00:36:39,372
an intelligent voice converter.

913
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:43,612
It transforms a rough old man voice,

914
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:48,372
into a charming and irresistible heavenly sound
in just two seconds.

915
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:49,211
Look.

916
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:53,052
Dear, are you there?

917
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,372
Dear, are you there?

918
00:36:57,812 --> 00:36:58,572
Easy, right?

919
00:36:59,411 --> 00:37:01,012
So, the important thing is

920
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:04,451
to study the scripts in this booklet.

921
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:05,332
You'll be excellent

922
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,211
if you use it correctly.

923
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:08,532
Read it properly.

924
00:37:21,651 --> 00:37:22,451
Come on, An Ni.

925
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:25,211
Your favourite Li's secret dip.

926
00:37:25,251 --> 00:37:25,931
Thank you!

927
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:27,691
An Ni.

928
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:28,092
Yes.

929
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:31,372
How are you getting on with Mr. Xiao?

930
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:33,971
I never thought of it

931
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,292
if you didn't mention it.

932
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,971
You two are really messing around.

933
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:39,491
I would like to make it clear.

934
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:41,251
Mr. Xiao is very kind

935
00:37:41,332 --> 00:37:42,651
and excellent in all aspects,

936
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:44,572
but I have no feelings for him.

937
00:37:44,812 --> 00:37:46,532
Don't try to get us together again.

938
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:47,372
It's awkward.

939
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:47,891
No,

940
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,451
you don't make me worry.

941
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:51,372
I'm telling you from experience,

942
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:53,132
Mr. Xiao is definitely

943
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,451
a very excellent and high quality man.

944
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:56,372
If you miss it,

945
00:37:56,411 --> 00:37:57,612
it's your loss.

946
00:37:57,931 --> 00:37:58,691
Hey, hey, hey.

947
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:00,772
What are you talking about?

948
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,612
An Ni is also excellent.

949
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:03,211
And also,

950
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:04,612
An Ni said she has no feeling for him.

951
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,251
If you have no feeling,

952
00:38:06,292 --> 00:38:07,731
it's useless,
no matter how excellent he is.

953
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:09,372
Yitang knows me well.

954
00:38:09,411 --> 00:38:10,171
Come on, drink.

955
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:10,691
Come on.

956
00:38:10,772 --> 00:38:11,451
Hey, you two.

957
00:38:11,812 --> 00:38:12,332
I...

958
00:38:13,651 --> 00:38:15,651
We are all in our thirties now,

959
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:17,491
you still talk about feeling.

960
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:18,651
I have nothing to comment.

961
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,372
You must be regretful
when you can't find a valentine.

962
00:38:20,812 --> 00:38:23,731
Relationship is about
speed and efficiency.

963
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:25,852
When I was with Yonggang,

964
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:28,731
we kissed on our second date,

965
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:30,532
and then on our seventh date we...

966
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:31,852
Stop, stop, stop.

967
00:38:31,891 --> 00:38:32,651
This is a public place.

968
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:34,012
You told us about this several times.

969
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:34,731
Watch up.

970
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,971
Don't talk about the details.

971
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:39,411
You're faster than us

972
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:40,612
in everything.

973
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:41,772
Yes.

974
00:38:42,132 --> 00:38:45,612
That's just very extreme.

975
00:38:47,812 --> 00:38:49,251
Did you make up with Yonggang?

976
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,691
Everything is fine.

977
00:38:53,451 --> 00:38:58,132
I really made up my mind this time
that I couldn't forgive him so easily.

978
00:38:59,332 --> 00:39:01,052
But I was soft-hearted,

979
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:04,451
and he kept on blaming himself,

980
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:06,612
it was really unbearable.

981
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:08,451
Besides,

982
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:10,691
he's also considered a victim, right?

983
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:14,092
Yonggang is not bad.

984
00:39:14,171 --> 00:39:15,691
He is kind and hard-working.

985
00:39:15,931 --> 00:39:17,772
Sometimes he is eager for
quick success and instant benefits,

986
00:39:18,012 --> 00:39:19,372
so don't give him pressure.

987
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:20,852
How dare I!

988
00:39:20,931 --> 00:39:21,812
I'm really afraid

989
00:39:21,812 --> 00:39:23,171
to say anything right now.

990
00:39:23,451 --> 00:39:25,451
Men are always career-minded,

991
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,532
so they think a lot.

992
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,451
Fortunately, Mr. Xiao is always by his side,

993
00:39:28,572 --> 00:39:29,691
and he could supervise

994
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:30,532
and give suggestions.

995
00:39:30,891 --> 00:39:32,731
Mr. Xiao's mindset is good.

996
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:34,931
You must thank him for me.

997
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:37,532
I don't like to hear that.

998
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,532
After the merging the Green Broadcasting

999
00:39:39,572 --> 00:39:41,971
with Huiquan into Huibo,

1000
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:44,211
should you thank Zhao Jikai?

1001
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:45,171
You're jealous.

1002
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:45,772
Thank you!

1003
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:47,092
Thank you so much, Mr. Zhao!

1004
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:48,211
Let's drink!

1005
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:51,612
So take care of Yonggang more in the future!

1006
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:52,812
Then the next time six of us

1007
00:39:52,852 --> 00:39:53,852
have dinner together.

1008
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:54,731
You bring Mr. Zhao.

1009
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:55,612
You bring Mr. Xiao.

1010
00:39:55,651 --> 00:39:56,731
I bring my Yonggang.

1011
00:39:57,052 --> 00:39:58,132
I don't want to cheer.

1012
00:39:58,211 --> 00:39:59,251
You say this again.

1013
00:39:59,251 --> 00:39:59,971
My fault, my fault!

1014
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:00,572
I'm wrong.

1015
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:02,092
Okay, okay, okay.

1016
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,150
(At present, we highly suspect that
Zhang Xiaobei had gone to Country F.)

1017
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:12,931
I make a call. You eat first.

1018
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,931
I really want to see

1019
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:19,052
what it looks like

1020
00:40:19,092 --> 00:40:20,731
when the three men are gathering.

1021
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:27,012
Hello.

1022
00:40:27,731 --> 00:40:28,292
He Luyuan.

1023
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:29,931
Are you sure about the message

1024
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:30,612
you just sent?

1025
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:32,651
I just received the message.

1026
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:33,931
I think it should be true.

1027
00:40:36,052 --> 00:40:36,891
If it's true,

1028
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:39,451
we're going on a very different mission.

1029
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:40,691
Where are you now?

1030
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:41,971
I'm at the hospital.

1031
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:43,332
Xiaobei's dad didn't want to eat.

1032
00:40:43,852 --> 00:40:44,691
I come to see him.

1033
00:40:44,931 --> 00:40:45,891
Why didn't you say it earlier!

1034
00:40:45,931 --> 00:40:46,731
I'll be there right now.

1035
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:47,572
Wait for me!

1036
00:40:52,012 --> 00:40:52,772
Mr. Zhang,

1037
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:56,292
please eat some.

1038
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:57,772
I don't want to eat!

1039
00:40:58,332 --> 00:40:59,691
Get out now!

1040
00:41:14,251 --> 00:41:14,971
What happened?

1041
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:16,691
Why are you coming?

1042
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:18,651
How's he?

1043
00:41:19,731 --> 00:41:21,691
Mr. Zhang didn't want to eat.

1044
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:26,651
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

1045
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:27,491
I'm An Ni.

1046
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,132
I'm junior of Wanru.

1047
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:31,012
We met before.

1048
00:41:31,132 --> 00:41:32,132
Do you still remember?

1049
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:39,772
Mr. Zhang,

1050
00:41:40,132 --> 00:41:41,572
food is very important for us.

1051
00:41:42,451 --> 00:41:44,332
You can't bear if you don't eat.

1052
00:41:44,372 --> 00:41:46,132
You eat some.

1053
00:41:47,132 --> 00:41:48,052
Why should I eat?

1054
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:49,052
I don't want to eat!

1055
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,812
I should die!

1056
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:55,171
Wanru left me.

1057
00:41:56,612 --> 00:41:59,651
Xiaobei caused such a big trouble.
