15
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:40,805
Huiquan always does things
unintentionally, huh?

16
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:42,805
You guys suppressed the heat
surrounding Zhang Xiaobei,

17
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:46,686
Shi Xiaohu, and the other victims
of the Huiquan Games.

18
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:49,086
I'm sure you did it for
Huiquan Corporation unintentionally.

19

(Meinian Square)

20
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:11,766
An Ni!

21
00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:16,605
Xiaoting, what's the matter?

22
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:18,046
You wanted to see me urgently.

23
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:19,085
An Ni,

24
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,846
I know you guys are busy preparing
for the prosecution.

25
00:02:21,926 --> 00:02:23,926
I shouldn't interrupt you
at this moment.

26
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,365
But I can't hold it in anymore.

27
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:26,406
I have to tell you.

28
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:26,926
It's okay.

29
00:02:26,926 --> 00:02:28,046
Tell me what's going on.

30
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:29,566
An Ni,

31
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:33,525
I just found a photo of my dad
with another woman in his study room.

32
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:35,326
His photo with another woman?

33
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:38,085
Do you know her?

34
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,126
I don't.

35
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,645
She looks familiar to me,

36
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,245
but I can't remember who she is.

37
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:44,326
So,

38
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,966
are you suspecting your father?

39
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:48,486
It's not that I don't want to trust him.

40
00:02:48,805 --> 00:02:50,445
It's just that he's untrustworthy.

41
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:51,365
An Ni, do you know something?

42
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:54,165
He was whispering to Yin Huiquan last night.

43
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:55,885
They talked about Zhang Xiaobei.

44
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,005
They even wanted to punish him.

45
00:02:57,885 --> 00:02:58,966
They were too much.

46
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,365
An Ni, I told you this before.

47
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:02,966
If there's something wrong with Huiquan,

48
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,645
I'll definitely get to
the bottom of this for the sake of

49
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,046
victims like Shi Xiaohu
and Zhang Xiaobei.

50
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,566
Shi Xiaohu is dead.

51
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:09,085
Zhang Xiaobei is still alive.

52
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,486
I won't allow them
to harm Zhang Xiaobei anymore.

53
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:14,846
However, if the result of your investigation

54
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,286
shows that there's nothing wrong
with Huiquan,

55
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:17,926
I can issue a public apology.

56
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:20,046
An Ni,

57
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,245
you're the only person
I trust right now.

58
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:25,165
I understand

59
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,206
what you're trying to get here.

60
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:28,686
But I hope that you won't act recklessly

61
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:29,805
when it comes to this.

62
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:30,885
You must trust the law.

63
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,725
We will protect Zhang Xiaobei as well.

64
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,085
Although I don't represent the law,

65
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:37,846
as a judicial personnel,

66
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:39,885
I won't let off any crooks

67
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:41,885
or malign any innocent people.

68
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,460
(Inpatient Department)

69
00:03:53,846 --> 00:03:54,846
Hello, Xiaobei.

70
00:03:56,805 --> 00:03:59,326
I think An Ni should've told you this by now.

71
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:01,046
Stop bothering me and my father.

72
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:02,645
My father is running out of time.

73
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:05,566
You didn't behave like this

74
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:06,605
when you texted me.

75
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:08,365
What's with the change in attitude?

76
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:10,966
Times have changed.

77
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:13,165
I no longer want to get myself
involved with these matters.

78
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:15,126
Even so,

79
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,126
are you going to forget about the incident
with Shi Xiaohu just like this?

80
00:04:20,205 --> 00:04:21,886
Shi Xiaohu took his own life.

81
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,406
Those who gave out illegal loans

82
00:04:23,406 --> 00:04:24,606
were already arrested.

83
00:04:25,606 --> 00:04:26,485
Don't tell me you think

84
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:28,245
that the matter will end just like this?

85
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:29,525
Don't you think everything

86
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:30,525
is related to Huiquan?

87
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:35,286
All this while, news regarding
Shi Xiaohu and you

88
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,325
were suppressed immediately

89
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:38,606
if they were detrimental
to Huiquan's reputation.

90
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:39,686
Have you never considered

91
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:40,846
why they did so?

92
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,645
It's a huge enterprise.

93
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:44,085
Isn't it normal for them

94
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,286
to deal with a PR crisis like this?

95
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:47,286
You work for the media.
Don't you know this too?

96
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:49,446
Of course I know.

97
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:52,286
You'll testify against
Qian Tianxin in court.

98
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:55,566
And, we know what you did in Country F.

99
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:56,765
You're very brave.

100
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,085
I'm impressed by your bravery.

101
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,566
However, why are you unwilling
to go even further

102
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:03,085
and reveal all of Huiquan's dirty secrets?

103
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:06,286
I know something's wrong with Huiquan.

104
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,126
But I have no evidence.

105
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:09,846
Huiquan Corporation is definitely related

106
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:10,925
to the incident with Qian Tianxin.

107
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,006
Zhao Jikai and Li Yitang too.

108
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:15,805
They caused Shi Xiaohu's death.

109
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,765
And now, they act
as if nothing had happened.

110
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:20,205
Justice doesn't exist.

111
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,805
(When you're watching my show)

112
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:30,205
(in front of your computer,)

113
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,485
(have you ever considered)

114
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,886
that your personal details
and related data

115
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:37,446
(might be used by criminals
as a tool to hurt you?)

116
00:05:37,686 --> 00:05:40,925
(For example, Huiquan Corporation,
which spent a lot of effort)

117
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:45,286
(to suppress the incident of Zhang Xiaobei.)

118
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,925
(They didn't spend their energy and capital)

119
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:49,726
(on how to create products)

120
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,126
(that their users would love)

121
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,726
(in an efficient manner.)

122
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:56,045
(Instead, they used it
to deceive their users.)

123
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:57,686
(They used their power)

124
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,446
(to suppress and delete comments)

125
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:01,205
(that were deemed detrimental to them.)

126
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,820
(Huiquan)

127
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,045
I called you two here today

128
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:13,325
to deliver a piece of bad news.

129
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:17,205
The company that's in the middle of a deal with us,

130
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:19,045
Kaili International Investments,

131
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,286
called me this morning out of the blue.

132
00:06:21,606 --> 00:06:24,205
They said that their executives

133
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:25,566
have started to doubt
our company's credibility

134
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:26,886
due to the rumors surrounding us.

135
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:28,686
They called to notify me

136
00:06:29,245 --> 00:06:32,365
that they would suspend
their investment.

137
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,166
We discussed the deal for half a year.

138
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:36,606
Now, they're suspending it?

139
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:38,446
They do have great timing, huh?

140
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:39,886
Jikai,

141
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:42,006
I'm sure you understand

142
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,886
the company's condition the best.

143
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,085
Chairman,

144
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:49,805
all of those were baseless rumors.

145
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:51,485
I've already told

146
00:06:51,485 --> 00:06:55,205
Li Yitang to investigate the rumors

147
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,846
and cyber-bullying cases related
to Huiquan Corporation.

148
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:57,846
We'll hold all of them accountable.

149
00:06:58,006 --> 00:06:59,886
We're sending them
the legal letter today.

150
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:06,006
And, Luo Jiangxiao's foolish daughter,
Luo Xiaoting,

151
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,846
we must make her pay the price.

152
00:07:08,606 --> 00:07:09,925
Enough.

153
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:12,085
Don't make the conflict more complicated
than it needs to be.

154
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:13,406
You guys can get back to work.

155
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,286
You, stay here.

156
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:35,805
Chairman,

157
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:38,686
since an incident like this
has happened in the company,

158
00:07:38,846 --> 00:07:40,765
for Huibo,

159
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:44,045
I think we should temporarily
halt its expansion.

160
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:45,406
Why must we halt it?

161
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,205
Back then, you were on the right track.

162
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,846
As long as we persevere,

163
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,006
we'll definitely achieve success.

164
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:57,205
When I did market research,

165
00:07:57,286 --> 00:07:59,886
I realized that there were many foreign
investment companies

166
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:01,205
that were interested in us.

167
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:02,886
We don't need to rely on
just one option.

168
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:04,686
If you give me your permission,

169
00:08:04,846 --> 00:08:05,446
I can...

170
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,765
Just focus on your task.

171
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:09,925
No matter what,

172
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:11,726
I'll turn Huibo Broadcasting

173
00:08:12,205 --> 00:08:15,365
into the flagship product of the industry.

174
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,126
Mr. Xiao,

175
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:22,566
now, the company is betting everything on you.

176
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,045
You mustn't disappoint me.

177
00:08:26,485 --> 00:08:27,686
Chairman, please don't worry.

178
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,045
I will not disappoint you.

179
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:32,486
What do you mean by you can't do it?

180
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,205
I didn't spend all my money on you

181
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:36,286
just so you could tell me that.

182
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:37,406
Do you know

183
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:38,806
the situation we're in right now?

184
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:40,486
You know nothing.

185
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,926
The old man is starting to suspect me.

186
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,205
Enough.

187
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,525
I won't waste my breath.

188
00:08:48,606 --> 00:08:51,005
Follow my previous instructions.

189
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,486
Make a clean break when it's necessary.

190
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:56,685
That's all.

191
00:09:45,046 --> 00:09:45,846
Come in.

192
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:54,205
Jikai.

193
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:55,246
That's Mr. Zhao to you.

194
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,406
Please refer to me as Mr. Zhao

195
00:09:57,926 --> 00:09:58,926
when we're in the company.

196
00:10:00,525 --> 00:10:01,966
What's with this photo?

197
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:03,085
It's nothing.

198
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:05,166
I'm just tired of it.

199
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:06,406
That's why I changed it.

200
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:12,606
Mr. Zhao,

201
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:15,406
these are the name lists and information
I've organized for you.

202
00:10:15,525 --> 00:10:17,606
We've already included the names

203
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:19,246
of every production staff for
online programs

204
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:21,926
such as "Xiaoting Never Stops"

205
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:24,046
and the names of influencers,

206
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,166
content creators,

207
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:27,205
and independent media
that spread the rumors.

208
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:29,246
See if we should send them
the legal letter directly

209
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:30,325
or make an announcement.

210
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:46,966
Zhao Jikai, you must be
out of your mind.

211
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,406
What else can you do

212
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:50,846
besides intimidating these youngsters
with the law?

213
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,046
You're the company's
legal affairs director.

214
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:54,406
Can you do something innovative
for once?

215
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,046
Do you think the company

216
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,125
needs to get into more trouble now?

217
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,205
Public opinion is unfavorable
against our company.

218
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:00,565
And now, you want to make the company

219
00:11:00,606 --> 00:11:03,286
an evil capitalist image that exploits people
without any remorse?

220
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,085
Enough. I had enough of you.

221
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:13,606
Please move out

222
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,005
of my house by today.

223
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:16,486
I don't wish to see you again.

224
00:11:16,726 --> 00:11:18,272
I no longer want
to be involved with you.

225
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,445
Zhao Jikai.

226
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,205
I'll treat it as if you got up
on the wrong side of the bed.

227
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:13,926
Didn't I tell you already?

228
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:15,885
Move out of my house.

229
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,445
Why are you here again?

230
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:30,005
What is this?

231
00:12:30,205 --> 00:12:31,005
A proposal.

232
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,806
I don't need you
to write a proposal for me.

233
00:12:36,525 --> 00:12:37,325
You don't need to please me

234
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:38,486
with such a method.

235
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:40,325
This proposal isn't for you.

236
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,726
This is the proposal I made

237
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,445
to clear Qian Tianxin's name.

238
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,645
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

239
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,046
Are you sure?

240
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:03,046
Isn't that the cause of your trouble lately?

241
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:05,726
You couldn't sleep all night long.

242
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,246
You kept sighing,

243
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,286
smoking, and drinking.

244
00:13:08,645 --> 00:13:11,366
Your browser history is filled with tabs

245
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:14,246
regarding how to clear one's name
after committing cybercrimes

246
00:13:14,406 --> 00:13:17,286
and how to hire lawyers for them.

247
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:20,166
You can look for me.

248
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:21,846
When I was in university,

249
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,765
I was a debate expert
who was on par with An Ni.

250
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:25,926
Li Yitang,

251
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,246
you shouldn't have checked my computer.

252
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,366
I even know

253
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,765
that you went abroad last time

254
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:40,286
to visit Qian Tianxin in Country F.

255
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:43,565
Who told you that?

256
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,726
You told Xiao Mu'en that you heard about

257
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:50,445
An Ni's trip to Country F from me.

258
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:52,445
But you understand this clearly.

259
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:55,005
An Ni would never tell anyone about that,

260
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:55,885
including me.

261
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:58,806
I checked your flight schedule as well.

262
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:01,246
Everything was developing

263
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,366
in the direction I didn't hope for.

264
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:04,606
Was I wrong?

265
00:14:07,606 --> 00:14:08,685
I always thought

266
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,085
that you were a foolish woman
falling in love all the time.

267
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:12,846
I didn't expect you
to be this intelligent.

268
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,685
How am I not foolish?

269
00:14:16,406 --> 00:14:18,606
The most foolish thing I have done

270
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:20,926
is to fall in love with you.

271
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:24,246
And, you never fell for me.

272
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:26,926
Enough.

273
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:29,125
Since you know everything,

274
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,606
there's no need to
hide anything from you.

275
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,445
I did go abroad to visit Qian Tianxin.

276
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:40,486
Qian Tianxin is my elder sister.

277
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:42,486
She's my accomplice too.

278
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:44,685
I've been following her around

279
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,685
ever since we met in a casino

280
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:48,645
25 years ago.

281
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:56,406
Don't tell me

282
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,565
there are sleeping pills in the drink?

283
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,125
So, you found out about the sleeping pills?

284
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,125
Don't worry.

285
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:06,806
There's nothing in it.

286
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:21,525
But why?

287
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:25,645
You had a choice.

288
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,005
You could've chosen to begin anew.

289
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:30,246
You could've chosen
to make a clean break

290
00:15:30,325 --> 00:15:31,046
with the past.

291
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:32,966
I can help you.

292
00:15:33,606 --> 00:15:34,885
As long as you leave her,

293
00:15:35,046 --> 00:15:35,966
I will do my best

294
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,286
to help you make a clean break with her.

295
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:38,286
That's impossible.

296
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:40,046
Why is that impossible?

297
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:41,565
Let's look at the worst-case scenario.

298
00:15:41,606 --> 00:15:43,486
Even if An Ni and the rest found you

299
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,565
and started to investigate you,

300
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:47,046
I could help you find a way out.

301
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,005
I can leave together with you.

302
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:51,406
I've saved up plenty of money
in the past few years.

303
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:53,685
We can go to Singapore, Japan,

304
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:54,726
or other places.

305
00:15:54,726 --> 00:15:54,966
Enough!

306
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:56,205
Stop!

307
00:15:56,726 --> 00:15:57,606
You don't understand

308
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:59,046
my relationship with
Qian Tianxin at all.

309
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,565
What happened between us

310
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:02,246
was something you could never imagine.

311
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,046
She could sacrifice herself for me

312
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:05,606
without any hesitations.

313
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:08,205
And I will sacrifice myself for her too!

314
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:10,085
Let me warn you.

315
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:11,806
You better stay away from me.

316
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:15,406
I never fell for you from the start.

317
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:17,846
If Qian Tianxin does go to prison,

318
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:19,486
I'll join her in prison.

319
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:21,606
She's the love of my life.

320
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:22,685
Understood?

321
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:31,406
Understood.

322
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,966
You want me to withdraw from
this relationship voluntarily.

323
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:42,445
Listen.

324
00:16:43,606 --> 00:16:46,005
You choose your own path.

325
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:47,366
This incident

326
00:16:47,926 --> 00:16:49,166
has nothing to do with you.

327
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:51,325
You can head to
the People's Procuratorate

328
00:16:51,406 --> 00:16:53,486
and expose me and cut your ties with me.

329
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:55,486
Of course, you could also leave

330
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:57,205
while pretending that
nothing had happened.

331
00:16:57,606 --> 00:16:58,885
No matter which path you choose,

332
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:00,246
I won't say anything.

333
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,445
I was the one

335
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,606
you better don't regret what you said.

336
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:14,925
I will never regret it.

337
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:22,766
Listen closely.

338
00:17:24,006 --> 00:17:25,486
I choose

339
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,805
to stay by your side until the end.

340
00:17:30,606 --> 00:17:31,846
From today onward,

341
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:33,846
no matter if you fall for me or not,

342
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:35,966
it no longer matters to me.

343
00:17:37,886 --> 00:17:40,486
What you desire is what I desire.

344
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:42,486
Your goal is my goal.

345
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:43,285
I will stay with you

346
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,285

347
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:46,405
no matter how much I have to suffer.

349
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:50,606
Can you stop being foolish?

350
00:18:03,006 --> 00:18:03,886
Jikai,

351
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:05,726
in the past,

352
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,805
I was a foolish girl indeed.

353
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,886
But now, I've figured it out.

354
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,085
I love you.

355
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:17,006
I cannot live without you.

356
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,445
I don't care if you aren't willing

357
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:21,886
to give me a shred of love.

358
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,085
I don't care if you only
have sympathy for me.

359
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:29,085
Even so, I want to be with you.

360
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:35,925
If so, do you know something?

361
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:38,606
I'm the mole planted in
Huiquan Corporation

362
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,085
by Qian Tianxin.

363
00:18:42,006 --> 00:18:43,045
All these years,

364
00:18:43,445 --> 00:18:45,445
I've been exploiting Huiquan Corporation

365
00:18:45,846 --> 00:18:47,445
so that I can deliver intel to her.

366
00:18:48,405 --> 00:18:49,405
That's why the prosecutors

367
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:50,405
can never figure out

368
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:53,006
why she can do all those things she did

369
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:56,126
even though she's overseas.

370
00:18:58,726 --> 00:18:59,526
People outside

371
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:00,925
are saying that Huiqian Corporation
is the issue here.

372
00:19:01,246 --> 00:19:01,846
They're right.

373
00:19:02,526 --> 00:19:04,445
Because I'm the mastermind
behind everything.

374
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:07,006
That's fine.

375
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:10,726
These are not the only crimes
I've committed.

376
00:19:11,205 --> 00:19:12,246
If you choose to follow me,

377
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:13,646
you'll only end up in one way.

378
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:15,606
I know that.

379
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:16,606
Can you stop being foolish?

380
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:18,045
It's not too late for you
to withdraw yourself.

381
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:19,486
Stop.

382
00:19:21,846 --> 00:19:23,685

you handle.

Therefore, during the review
for prosecution,

473
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:55,685
you have to keep a close eye
on the evidence,

00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:15,366
encountered some bullies in school.

503
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:17,325
Campus violence is
pretty common nowadays.

504
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:19,246
Let me out!

505
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:20,606
Let me out!

506
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:21,766
Calm down.

507
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:23,565
It's nothing.

508
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,366
I'm here after all.

509
00:25:30,726 --> 00:25:31,766
That silly girl.

510
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:33,886
I'm sure it's expensive to hire you.

511
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:34,846
Yeah.

512
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:38,565
But you don't need to
worry about the money.

513
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,325
All these years,

514
00:25:43,726 --> 00:25:45,205
I took such a high risk

515
00:25:45,285 --> 00:25:46,285
just to make some money.

516
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:48,366
But now, everything's gone.

517
00:25:49,486 --> 00:25:51,085
Now, I even have to sell my possessions.

518
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:52,366
This deal

519
00:25:53,006 --> 00:25:53,846
isn't worth it at all.

520
00:25:55,006 --> 00:25:55,805
Hu Dewang,

521
00:25:57,085 --> 00:25:58,685
your family's quality of life

522
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,126
wasn't affected at all.

523
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:02,325
Instead, it became better.

524
00:26:06,126 --> 00:26:07,205
Where did she get all the money?

525
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:09,246
Someone who supports you

526
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,405
is dealing with the affairs outside.

527
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:13,126
You just need to cooperate with me

528
00:26:14,526 --> 00:26:17,325
and tell me everything you know

529
00:26:17,366 --> 00:26:18,445
so that we can strive for leniency
upon your sentence.

530
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,006
What's your name?

531
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:24,526
You can call me Mr. Jin.

532
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:27,526
Mr. Jin,

533
00:26:27,966 --> 00:26:29,805
I didn't do anything.

534
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:32,805
My job was to train the newcomers

535
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,846
following the rules
set by the higher-ups.

536
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:35,366
I...

537
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:36,325
Hu Dewang,

538
00:26:36,726 --> 00:26:38,925
calm down, okay?

539
00:26:40,085 --> 00:26:41,285
Listen to my question again.

540
00:26:41,646 --> 00:26:42,925
Follow my question.

541
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:46,165
Let's take it one step at a time, okay?

542
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:48,805
The public security bureau

543
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:51,045
has transferred your case
to the People's Procuratorate.

544
00:26:51,126 --> 00:26:52,766
Now, it's the
review-for-prosecution phase.

545
00:26:53,126 --> 00:26:54,766
Do you understand that?

546
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,285
I did sign that.

547
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,405
I made a copy of your case file

548
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:01,685
to proceed with my research.

549
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:04,366
I realized that there were many issues

550
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:07,126
you didn't explain clearly with

551
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:08,366
the statement you gave
under interrogation.

552
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,565
Now, I'll ask you some
of the questions again.

553
00:27:13,685 --> 00:27:14,486
Please go ahead.

554
00:27:16,486 --> 00:27:18,565
You already said

555
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:21,766
that you were only a trainer.

556
00:27:21,846 --> 00:27:23,246
That's the truth!

557
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:24,925
You can answer me

558
00:27:24,966 --> 00:27:25,846
after I finish my question.

559
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:28,886
You said

560
00:27:29,165 --> 00:27:31,165
you didn't participate
in any of the fraud cases,

561
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:32,766
and that you didn't succeed
in any of them.

562
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:33,685
That's right.

563
00:27:34,006 --> 00:27:35,405
That's what I said.

564
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:37,685
But currently,

565
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:41,325
according to the evidence

566
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:44,006
already confirmed from the case files,

567
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,805
your statements were invalid.

568
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:48,486
According to the evidence,

569
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:51,205
the fraud cases you participated in
involved huge sums.

570
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,366
And, you've directed many of them too.

571
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:57,805
You're also the pillar of
the fraud syndicate.

572
00:27:58,006 --> 00:28:02,045
And, all your accomplices and the witnesses

573
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:03,486
who were coerced by you guys before,

574
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:05,246
how much did they know?

575
00:28:05,805 --> 00:28:07,126
Will they testify against you?

576
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:08,205
Have you ever considered that?

577
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:09,085
Mr. Jin,

578
00:28:09,486 --> 00:28:10,685
what should I do then?

579
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:11,846
What should I say?

580
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:13,126
What should I say so that they will

581
00:28:13,165 --> 00:28:14,445
reduce my sentence?

582
00:28:14,565 --> 00:28:15,366
Hu Dewang,

583
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:18,685
as lawyers, we have rules to follow.

584
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,846
I cannot teach you what to say.

585
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:23,766
I cannot instigate you
to give false statements.

586
00:28:24,085 --> 00:28:25,766
That's very serious,

587
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:26,726
do you understand?

588
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,246
Do not bring up that topic again.

589
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:31,766
If not, both of us will bite off
more than we can chew.

590
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:33,205
I'm sorry.

591
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:35,006
Actually,

592
00:28:35,565 --> 00:28:37,766
this is pretty obvious.

593
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:40,886
You're very clear with what you've done.

594
00:28:41,285 --> 00:28:42,285
The public security bureau
and the People's Procuratorate

595
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:43,805
aren't just for show too.

596
00:28:43,966 --> 00:28:45,565
They'll get to the bottom of this.

597
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,966
Here's my suggestion.

598
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:51,366
It's best if you prepare for the worst.

599
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:52,886
For the crimes you've committed,

600
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:54,846
you'll receive a minimum sentence
of ten years in prison.

601
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,205
If...

602
00:28:58,565 --> 00:29:00,846
If you can take out the money

603
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:02,165
and compensate the victims,

604
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,606
the law will be lenient to you.

605
00:29:04,685 --> 00:29:06,685
I don't have that much money.

606
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:09,165
I'm not the big fish here.

607
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,726
Xin already took everything.

608
00:29:11,006 --> 00:29:13,726
I'm not asking you to return
the full amount to them.

609
00:29:16,445 --> 00:29:17,246
What about this?

610
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:21,886
I'll discuss this with your backer outside.

611
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:24,366
We'll try to gather some funds.

612
00:29:24,565 --> 00:29:26,445
At least it'll show your sincerity.

613
00:29:29,606 --> 00:29:32,606
Xin, whom you mentioned just now,

614
00:29:32,766 --> 00:29:34,205
how long have you known her?

615
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:41,606
We knew each other
since we were in Country A.

616
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,205
That Xin you mentioned,

617
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:45,726
not only was she involved in the cases
in Country F,

618
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,526
but she was also involved
in the murder cases in Country A.

619
00:29:51,766 --> 00:29:53,366
How many years will she be
sentenced to prison?

620
00:29:54,606 --> 00:29:55,405
What?

621
00:29:56,366 --> 00:29:57,405
Did she treat you well?

622
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:01,565
I was always her follower.

623
00:30:04,366 --> 00:30:06,085
We don't need to worry about that.

624
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:07,405
Here's my suggestion.

625
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:10,205
No matter if it's Country A or F,

626
00:30:11,366 --> 00:30:13,966
you have clues that the police

627
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:15,766
and the prosecutors don't.

628
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:18,246
If you have any corrections
to make to the situation,

629
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:19,606
you can do it anytime.

630
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,805
Your beloved instructed me

631
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:30,805
to tell you that they're doing well out there.

632
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:34,246
She's very thankful to your friends

633
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:35,805
who are taking care of her
and your children.

634
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:39,045
She said she doesn't want to
owe people any favors.

635
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:41,085
She wants you to repay the favor
when it's possible.

636
00:30:43,366 --> 00:30:44,366
Thank you, Mr. Jin.

637
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:50,526
I forgot something.

638
00:30:50,646 --> 00:30:51,405
By the way,

639
00:30:51,646 --> 00:30:54,646
she told me that you told her

640
00:30:55,565 --> 00:30:58,726
that Xin was only one of the underlings.

641
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:00,126
You said that she had a superior.

642
00:31:00,246 --> 00:31:02,726
I think it was an old man.

643
00:31:04,165 --> 00:31:05,685
She said you heard that.

644
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,165
Was that true?

645
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:14,045
Yes.

646
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:16,685
Hu Dewang,

647
00:31:16,966 --> 00:31:17,405
you...

648
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,246
Look at you.

649
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,846
Where do I start?

650
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:23,445
When I came in, I told you

651
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:25,165
to confess everything

652
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:27,006
so that we could strive for leniency
upon your sentence.

653
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,165
What are you worried about?

654
00:31:30,285 --> 00:31:31,805
This is an important clue, you know?

655
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,366
Why didn't you tell me just now?

656
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:37,846
Think about your family and yourself.

657
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:40,126
Strive for a lighter sentence.

658
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,565
You're supposed to tell me
important clues as such

659
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:48,805
so that I can try my best to plead for your sake.

660
00:31:54,805 --> 00:31:56,205
That's all I have to ask.

661
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:59,726
This is a POA.

662
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:02,565
Your family already signed it before this.

663
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:05,685
Sign it and confirm it again.

664
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:07,766
From now on,

665
00:32:08,445 --> 00:32:11,366
I will act as your official attorney.

666
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:26,006
Thank you for making the trip.

667
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:29,445
(I already met Hu Dewang.)

668
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:30,925
(He'll follow my instructions.)

669
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:32,726
That's great.

670
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:34,966
I have to rely on experts like you

671
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,325
to deal with such situations indeed.

672
00:32:39,846 --> 00:32:41,805
(But you mustn't transfer
the money to my bank card.)

673
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:43,445
Don't worry.

674
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,445
I won't.

675
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:46,766
I've instructed someone else
to transfer it to your wife's bank card.

676
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:48,565
(Thank you.)

677
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:49,966
(Tell me if you need anything else.)

678
00:32:52,726 --> 00:32:55,126
My lawyer's license was canceled
temporarily after all.

679
00:32:55,246 --> 00:32:56,606
It's inconvenient for me to act.

680
00:32:56,685 --> 00:32:58,766
Please help me out in the future.

681
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:00,846
By the way,

682
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,325
regarding this matter...

683
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,045
(Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.)

684
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:11,165
Mr. Jin, you're intelligent indeed.

685
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,165
I didn't even need to tell you.

686
00:33:12,886 --> 00:33:13,366
That's right.

687
00:33:14,085 --> 00:33:15,445
Please don't tell anyone about it.

688
00:33:31,486 --> 00:33:33,165
You look ugly when you frown.

689
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:38,486
At least she won't be executed.

690
00:33:39,526 --> 00:33:40,366
Don't worry.

691
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:41,766
I'm still here for you.

692
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:43,405
Thank you.

693
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,580
(Five years ago)

694
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,966
Xin, I'm penniless now!

695
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:58,726
I've lost all of my money!

696
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,126
Look at you.

697
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:04,085
Before this, debt collectors were chasing after you.

698
00:34:04,685 --> 00:34:05,486
Who helped you?

699
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:07,526
I helped you.

700
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:08,966
I lent you money

701
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,286
so that you could survive.

702
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:11,445
But look,

703
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,086
you didn't keep your promise.

704
00:34:13,165 --> 00:34:15,165
You took my kindness for granted.

705
00:34:15,726 --> 00:34:17,326
And now, you actually tried to escape.

706
00:34:18,726 --> 00:34:20,326
I had to spend so much effort
to locate you.

707
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:23,365
Do you think that's
the right thing to do?

708
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:27,526
No!

709
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:28,766
Xin!

710
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:29,605
I know my fault now!

711
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:31,286
Please give me a chance!

712
00:34:33,046 --> 00:34:34,566
I didn't say I wasn't going
to give you a chance.

713
00:34:35,966 --> 00:34:37,726
Your debt isn't that huge anyway.

714
00:34:38,046 --> 00:34:39,845
It's just 500,000 yuan.

715
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:40,925
Xin!

716
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,486
I'm truly penniless now!

717
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:43,286
Besides,

718
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:46,925
my family didn't know that I came here to gamble!

719
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:48,645
I'll have no way to face my family

720
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:49,645
if they hear about this!

721
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:50,286
Quiet!

722
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:52,365
You're so noisy.

723
00:34:53,165 --> 00:34:53,966
Kai?

724
00:34:55,086 --> 00:34:56,365
You can't even deal with
a nobody like him?

725
00:34:56,405 --> 00:34:57,006
Mister!

726
00:34:58,526 --> 00:34:59,125
Kai!

727
00:34:59,685 --> 00:35:00,685
What are you doing?

728
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:02,566
This is none of your business.

729
00:35:02,605 --> 00:35:03,806
Go upstairs.

730
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:09,286
Hurry.

731
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:23,486
Fine.

732
00:35:23,885 --> 00:35:24,766
You guys can deal with him.

733
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:26,125
Remember.

734
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:28,246
Keep him alive.

735
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:28,966
Xin!

736
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:30,125
Don't leave me here!

737
00:35:30,766 --> 00:35:31,205
Xin!

738
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:39,605
Here's the IOU.

739
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:41,165
All done.

740
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,286
Here.

741
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:47,526
You can keep it.

742
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:49,006
It's the same if you keep it.

743
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:53,645
I prepared some dishes today.

744
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:54,925
All of them are your favorite.

745
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:56,845
But I don't know if they're nice or not.

746
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,845
They're definitely not as nice
as the food we have back home.

747
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:01,645
By the way,

748
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:03,645
when are you heading back?

749
00:36:07,205 --> 00:36:09,645
Security's been pretty tight lately.

750
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:14,286
I've prepared a card for you.

751
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:16,286
Take it.

752
00:36:17,205 --> 00:36:19,605
Tell me if you need more money.

753
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:22,365
What do you mean?

754
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:23,845
Are you chasing me away?

755
00:36:25,006 --> 00:36:25,885
Nonsense.

756
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:28,086
Why would I try to chase you away?

757
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:31,645
It's just that I came upon
an opportunity lately.

758
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:33,845
I wish to grab hold of it.

759
00:36:34,286 --> 00:36:35,845
That person can lead us

760
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:38,165
to the life we desire.

761
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:40,205
What about you then?

762
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,086
Will you leave with me?

763
00:36:44,165 --> 00:36:45,365
I can't.

764
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:46,966
I have my mission to fulfill.

765
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:50,165
We're no longer young.

766
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:52,766
We can't do this forever.

767
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:55,006
Kai,

768
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:57,165
I know you've been enduring it
for a long time.

769
00:36:57,286 --> 00:37:00,205
But we'll realize our goals soon.

770
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:02,445
We'll be able to lead
the life we desire.

771
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:05,445
I know you've endured it for many years.

772
00:37:05,645 --> 00:37:06,566
All this while,

773
00:37:07,006 --> 00:37:08,086
you've been complaining about

774
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:09,566
why you have to learn this

775
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,125
and that and improve yourself

776
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,566
when you're in this trade.

777
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:13,845
But you need to know

778
00:37:14,086 --> 00:37:16,526
that you're doing so to help me out.

779
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:19,205
I don't care about that.

780
00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:21,445
I just want to be with you.

781
00:37:22,205 --> 00:37:23,286
Every day.

782
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:25,405
That's why I will do the things

783
00:37:26,086 --> 00:37:26,925
you want me to do.

784
00:37:29,086 --> 00:37:29,766
I understand.

785
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:31,726
I promise.

786
00:37:32,645 --> 00:37:33,726
That day will come soon.

787
00:37:34,845 --> 00:37:36,445
Since I've already made you a promise,

788
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:38,326
I'm sure you know me well.

789
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:40,205
I'm a woman of my promise.

790
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:42,246
However, I've also promised A

791
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:44,885
that we will accomplish

792
00:37:44,925 --> 00:37:46,566
our common goal together.

793
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:47,405
It's A again?

794
00:37:48,326 --> 00:37:49,605
You always talk about A.

795
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:51,445
I've never seen him before.

796
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:53,286
I don't know the kind of person he is.

797
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:55,246
Why should I obey his instructions?

798
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:56,566
Why should I risk my life for him?

799
00:37:56,766 --> 00:37:57,486
What gives?

800
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:58,445
Kai,

801
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:00,806
I'll tell you this once again.

802
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,885
You have to believe in A

803
00:38:03,165 --> 00:38:04,365
and protect him.

804
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:06,046
As long as he's around,

805
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:08,645
there's hope for everything.

806
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:10,365
Besides,

807
00:38:10,845 --> 00:38:12,006
you've never met him before.

808
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,566
You don't understand him at all.

809
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:15,685
His capability far exceeds what you can imagine.

810
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:17,566
So, listen to me.

811
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:19,566
Believe in him, okay?

812
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,086
I don't believe in him.

813
00:38:26,006 --> 00:38:26,925
But I believe in you.

814
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:45,405
These are the summaries
of the interrogations, evidence,

815
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:47,605
defense arguments,
and prosecution opinion I've prepared.

816
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:48,086
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate,
Notary Opinion Letter)

817
00:38:48,086 --> 00:38:48,726
Mr. Wang,

818
00:38:48,845 --> 00:38:50,046
please check them for me.

819
00:38:56,205 --> 00:38:57,486
Seems like I'm getting old.

820
00:38:59,726 --> 00:39:01,326
I don't think I can help you out here.

821
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:02,766
Mr. Wang,

822
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:04,726
you must be joking with me.

823
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:06,845
You know what I need the most.

824
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:08,806
I hope that you can go through

825
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:09,885
the last trial simulation with me.

826
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:12,326
Initially, I told Han Xuan
to help me out.

827
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:14,286
But I was afraid that
he wouldn't be harsh enough.

828
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:16,726
Mr. Wang,

829
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:19,006
this is the time for you to showcase
your ability as one of

830
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:19,806
the top ten prosecutors.

831
00:39:20,046 --> 00:39:21,365
Please show me your capability.

832
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,445
Ask me the harshest questions you can think of.

833
00:39:23,726 --> 00:39:25,205
We'll come up with all the contingency
plans we can think of

834
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:26,205
so that she won't be able

835
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:27,445
to escape her legal responsibilities.

836
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,605
This time, I will send her

837
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:30,726
to the place where she's supposed to be.

838
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,605
Qian Tianxin

839
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:38,645
is really unlucky to encounter you.

840
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:40,925
I agree.

841
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:43,286
But I'm also the hope
of all her victims.

842
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:45,086
This is what we need to do.

843
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:47,526
We represent the definition
of prosecution.

844
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:49,405
Comrade An Ni,

845
00:39:51,766 --> 00:39:54,205
you're indeed an elite prosecutor.

846
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:56,286
Your title is well-deserved.

847
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,966
Regarding the damage Qian Tianxin
had done to the laborers,

848
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:13,125
we've gathered enough written evidence
and witnesses to prove it.

849
00:40:13,165 --> 00:40:14,726
The court will decide the truth.

850
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:15,845
I hope the defense attorney

851
00:40:15,885 --> 00:40:17,086
can show us substantial evidence.

852
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:18,925
If not, please don't attempt to argue.

853
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:22,845
Defense attorney,
what else do you have to say?

854
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:24,566
I have nothing to say.

855
00:40:26,766 --> 00:40:27,566
(Presiding Judge)
Sigh.

856
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:27,645
(Presiding Judge)

857
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:28,719
(Presiding Judge)
We're finally done.

858
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,605
(Presiding Judge)
Ni, let's take a break.

859
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:33,319
(Prosecutor)
No one can leave until

860
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,365
(Prosecutor)
the trial simulation is over.

861
00:40:35,165 --> 00:40:35,966
Ni.

862
00:40:37,966 --> 00:40:39,445
I won't do this again.

863
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:40,566
This is so tiring.

864
00:40:41,086 --> 00:40:42,566
You want to go through the key segments,

865
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:43,205
key evidence,

866
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:43,806
quantitative standards,

867
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:44,365
and implicated charges

868
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:45,125
of Qian Tianxin's case?

869
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:46,566
It'll be dawn before we know it.

870
00:40:47,205 --> 00:40:48,605
Look at all the white hairs I have
after staying up all night.

871
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:50,405
Besides, we have to work tomorrow.

872
00:40:50,966 --> 00:40:51,925
Mr. Wang, am I right?

873
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,165
Just listen to Ni.

874
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,086
Next, we will hear the intentional
homicide charges in Country A.

875
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:09,405
According to the statement of Paul,
the driver involved in the case,

876
00:41:10,165 --> 00:41:12,566
(Defense Attorney)
it was an old man

877
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:12,806
(Defense Attorney)

878
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:15,286
(Defense Attorney)
who requested him to kill Zhang Wanru

879
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,526
by driving over her.

880
00:41:19,486 --> 00:41:20,806
However, the gender and age

881
00:41:21,125 --> 00:41:23,445
of my litigant

882
00:41:23,645 --> 00:41:24,925
don't fit his description.

883
00:41:25,605 --> 00:41:27,365
This is a huge oversight,

884
00:41:28,246 --> 00:41:29,806
yet the prosecution side is ignoring it.

885
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:31,566
She's distorting the fact.

886
00:41:32,246 --> 00:41:34,845
She insists that my litigant is the murderer.

887
00:41:36,326 --> 00:41:37,445
Please explain yourself.

888
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:39,486
Mr. Wang,

889
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:42,605
Qian Tianxin already confessed
that she killed someone.

890
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:44,925
I don't think the defense attorney
will ask questions like those.

891
00:41:45,286 --> 00:41:46,645
Why not?

892
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,286
You're just trying to rely on luck here.

893
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:51,086
As a certified lawyer,

894
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,405
of course they'll ask questions
like those.

895
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:53,605
You should remember that.

896
00:41:54,526 --> 00:41:56,365
Prosecution side,
please explain yourself.

897
00:41:57,845 --> 00:41:59,405
According to Paul,

898
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:02,405
a woman contacted him on the phone.

899
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:03,645
He verified her voice.

900
00:42:03,685 --> 00:42:05,726
It was proven to be Qian Tianxin.

901
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:06,605
However,

902
00:42:06,645 --> 00:42:08,086
the old man who met him after that

903
00:42:08,165 --> 00:42:09,526
didn't speak to him.

904
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:11,925
He just gave him a photo of Zhang Wanru

905
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:14,605
and a note containing her full address.

906
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:16,365
However, Paul stated

907
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:18,006
that the person was
putting on a disguise.

908
00:42:18,165 --> 00:42:20,086
When that person showed his arms,

909
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,246
they were as fair as a woman's.

910
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:24,806
So, Paul was sure

911
00:42:24,885 --> 00:42:26,726
that the person was
putting on a disguise.

912
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:28,165
In addition, he didn't
utter a single word

913
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,526
during their encounter.

914
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:30,445
Judging from those two points,

915
00:42:30,486 --> 00:42:31,365
we could determine

916
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:32,365
that the old man

917
00:42:32,445 --> 00:42:34,165
was actually Qian Tianxin in disguise.

918
00:42:34,566 --> 00:42:36,205
And, she did so in order to get rid of any evidence

919
00:42:36,486 --> 00:42:38,566
related to the contract killing.

920
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:41,086
Wait.

921
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:45,566
So, the old man had hands
as fair as a woman's, huh?

922
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:48,445
That doesn't necessarily mean
that he's a woman in disguise.
