You really like giving me surprises, huh?

- He's...
-(Say no more.)

23
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,400
I've already sent Luo Jiangxiao
to solve the matter.

(You just need to assist him.)

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,079
All right.

Yitang,

28
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,439
I want you to release a press statement

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
on behalf of the company's
legal department.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,600
Be careful with the choice of words.

31
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,560
Also,

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,159
I want you to pick Luo Jiangxiao up.

33
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,840
The old man wanted

34
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,400
him to handle the situation.

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,860
(Intermediate People's Court of Jiangcheng)

36
00:02:33,999 --> 00:02:35,040
Based on the repair records

37
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,639
obtained by the investigators,

38
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,359
it is evident that the defendant, Zhu Xin,
intentionally replaced the brake pads

39
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,760
causing damage to the brake system,

40
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,760
leading to brake failure
due to overheating during the drive

41
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,159
on the mountainous road in Yunding.

42
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,400
The defendant had also replaced

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,279
(Prosecutor)
the antidepressant that the case's victim,

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,040
who was Zhu Xin's wife,

45
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,999
with desipramine

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,120
and increased the drug's dosage.

47
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:57,240
That had led the deceased to experience
dizziness and blurred vision

48
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:59,279
while driving on the mountain road

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,879
resulting in the vehicle falling into
the river and causing the deceased's death.

50
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,999
These facts are supported
by physical evidence

The collection of evidence

55
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,680
was conducted through legal procedures.

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,480
The defendant's counsel,
you may now present your defense statement.

57
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,519
Your Honor,

58
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,400
please be reminded that

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,200
(Defendant)

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,040
(Defendant)
one of the key pieces of evidence,

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,639
(Defendant)

62
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,359
(Defendant)
the brake pads,

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,600
did not directly yield the
defendant's fingerprints.

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
The brake pads were also replaced

65
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,960
by the staff of the 4S dealership,

66
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,560
and the maintenance records

67
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,799
from the dealership

68
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,200
can serve as evidence.

69
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,760
Hence, the facts of this case are unclear

70
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
and the evidence is insufficient.

71
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:38,919
Your Honor,

72
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,999
the prosecutor requests to
interrogate the defendant.

73
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,439
Please proceed.

Yitang.

75
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,480
It seems you didn't tell me the truth.

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,359
The situation might be more complicated

77
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,799
than what you told me.

78
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:58,840
Gu,

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
take the rear exit
from the underground garage.

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,999
But Ms. Li,

81
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,040
that's against the traffic.

82
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,159
Do something about it then.

83
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,200
Yitang,

84
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:14,879
calm down.

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,319
Don't worry.

86
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,319
Don't panic.

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,359
Mr. Luo,

88
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm so sorry.

89
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,479
The company assigned me
to pick you up today.

90
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:26,720
We had actually prepared an
induction ceremony for you,

91
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,759
but we didn't expect

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,680
on your first day, you would
have to deal with this.

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
I apologize for that.

94
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,680
It's my job.

95
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,319
Public relations crises

96
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,319
are a double-edged sword
to all companies.

97
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,799
Sometimes,

98
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:42,519
they can also present
unexpected opportunities.

99
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,560
I feel reassured when you say that.

100
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,440
Ms. Li,

101
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:03,599
the chairman has called just now

102
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:05,079
to inquire about the matter.

103
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
Mr. Zhao has also thrown a fit.

104
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,519
He doesn't seem to be
in a good mood.

105
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,780
(Huiquan Group)

106
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:15,240
Mr. Zhao,

107
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,199
Mr. Luo has arrived.

108
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,639
Professor Luo.

109
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,240
Allow me to introduce him to everyone.

110
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,000
Luo Jiangxiao, Mr. Luo,

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,759
will be joining our company as of today

112
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,199
as the public relations consultant
for Huiquan Corporation.

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,079
Let's welcome him.

114
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:32,919
I'm sure we're

115
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,120
familiar with his name.

116
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,240
Don't worry,

117
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,079
after the meeting,

118
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,720
you'll have plenty of time
to get to know him,

119
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,199
and to satisfy

120
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:42,759
your curiosity toward
a well-known figure.

121
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,840
All right. Let's talk business.

122
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:48,919
Mr. Luo,

123
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,799
would you like to start first?

124
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,240
Mr. Zhao,

125
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,840
I have a request.

126
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,799
I would like everyone

127
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,519
to just call me Professor Luo.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,799
All right.

129
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,639
You guys heard what he said?

130
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,799
Call him Professor Luo instead.

131
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,840
Sure.

132
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,720
Professor Luo.

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,240
So, Professor Luo,

134
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,440
based on your expertise,

135
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,840
what advice do you have?

136
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:14,880
Defendant, Zhu Xin,

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,000
is your statement

138
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,120
during the court proceedings true?

139
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,079
Generally, true.

140
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,199
When did you take

141
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,840
the deceased's car for maintenance?

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,880
March 3rd.

143
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,720
What maintenance tasks were performed?

144
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
The brake pads were
making abnormal noises,

145
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,199
so they were replaced.

146
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,840
How many staff members were
there at the 4S dealership?

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,720
One.

148
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
How much did you spend?

149
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,440
Three hundred for the brake pad,

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
and the labor cost was one hundred fifty.

151
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,840
I remember this clearly

152
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,639
because we had a

153
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,440
fight over this.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who issued the invoice
and collected the payment?

155
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,660
(Witness)

156
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,840
Him.

157
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,319
Next, the prosecutor will
present a set of evidence.

158
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,120
First,

159
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,400
the receipt that indicated

160
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,919
his spending on the 4s store March 3.

161
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,519
(4S store receipt)
The presented evidence

162
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,199
indicates that the defendant's
expenditure at the 4S store

163
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,840
was for the replacement of brake pads.

164
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,359
Second,

165
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,039
the sales and procurement records
from the 4S store

166
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,799
(4S store sales records & brake pad certificate)
provide conclusive evidence that

167
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,120
brake pads in question were genuine

168
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:20,359
and sourced through
legal and reliable channels.

169
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,240
Third,

170
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,799
the installation process and

171
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,519
effect diagram of brake pads in 4S store.

172
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,960
This matter can be discussed
from three aspects.

173
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,680
Firstly,

174
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,840
according to the provisions of the
Cybersecurity Law,

175
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,680
network operators

176
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,560
should strengthen their supervision

177
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,960
over the information published by users.

178
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,759
If they discover information that is

179
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,440
prohibited by laws and

180
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,479
administrative regulations from

181
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,519
being published and transmitted,

182
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:49,680
they should immediately

183
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,479
stop the spread of such information

184
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,639
and take corresponding measures

185
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,359
to prevent its dissemination.

186
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,000
In other words,

187
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,560
after Zhang Xiaobei's

188
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,919
suicide livestream,

189
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:07,759
the platform did not promptly
suspend or block the account.

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,799
Huibo, as a broadcasting platform,

191
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,680
is undoubtedly partially responsible.

192
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:16,720
Ninth,

193
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,599
Testimony of 4S store employee.

194
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,880
4S store received numerous
customers on a regular basis

195
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,199
and do not have a deep impression
of each customer.

196
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,840
When a lawyer approached them
for evidence,

197
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,359
the lawyer repeatedly emphasized that

198
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,479
the brake pads were replaced
at the 4S store.

199
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,680
That has led the employee to
casually mention that

200
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:34,080
the brake pads that were indeed
replaced at the 4S store.

201
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,760
Secondly,

202
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:37,680
Civil Code stipulates that

203
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,479
individuals could enjoy
personality rights,

204
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,839
which include the right to life.

205
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,320
Personality rights cannot be waived,

206
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,279
transferred, or inherited.

207
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,479
Suicide behavior

208
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,039
violates public order and morality.

209
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,640
What's more important is

210
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,440
Zhang Xiaobei is just not found

211
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,479
at this moment.

212
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,799
He was not declared

213
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,320
missing

214
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,039
or dead.

215
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,680
Thirdly,

216
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,039
encouraging others to commit suicide,

217
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,719
instigating the suicide victim,

218
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:13,880
providing psychological assistance,

219
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:17,120
the accomplice of intentional homicide,

220
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,240
aiding and abetting,

221
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,560
can be prosecuted.

222
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:21,919
Of course,

223
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,479
this is not absolute.

224
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,919
According to Article 29
of the Criminal Law,

225
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,039
those who incite others to commit crimes

226
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,039
should be punished
according to their role

227
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,680
in the joint crime.

228
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,469
The witness may now be
excused from the stand.

229
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,150
(Witness)

230
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,120
Next, the defense counsel will
proceed with cross-examination.

231
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,680
On the third of last month,

232
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,799
officers Captain He Luyuan
and Captain Long Yanling

233
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:48,399
from Municipal Public Security Bureau's
Criminal Investigation Division

234
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:51,080
suddenly returned to
the defendant's house

235
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,640
at about eleven in the evening.

236
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,520
They took the defendant back
to the Criminal Investigation Division

237
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:55,479
for questioning.

238
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,680
On that day, the two officers
did not have a search warrant.

239
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,799
According to my client's account,

240
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,560
Captain He entered the defendant's garage

241
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,159
and used the defendant's car key

242
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,039
to open the vehicle he usually
drives for inspection.

243
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,799
Inside the storage compartment
of the dashboard,

244
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:11,520
traces of drug residue were found.

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
Subsequently, the technical department
of the Municipal Bureau

246
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,279
identified the drug residue powder

247
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,279
as the same type as the medication
taken by the deceased.

248
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,880
However, Captain He's
investigation process has

249
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,479
serious loopholes and flaws

250
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,599
in terms of procedure.

251
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,560
Therefore, we believe that

252
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
this evidence should be deemed illegal

253
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,039
and should not be admitted.

254
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:32,799
In conclusion,

255
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:34,959
Huiquan

256
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,640
has no relation

257
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,799
to this matter.

258
00:10:41,719 --> 00:10:42,399
Although

259
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,919
Huiquan has just acquired Green Broadcasting,

260
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,719
they are both

261
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,320
independent entities

262
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,240
that are responsible for themselves.

263
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,599
Of course, as a broadcasting platform,

264
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,359
Green Broadcasting should bear the
responsibility of lax supervision.

265
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,760
Zhang Xiaobei's suicide livestream

266
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,399
clearly violates the Cybersecurity Law.

267
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,599
All the internet users
who incited and cheered,

268
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,680
are suspected of

269
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,839
abetting a crime.

270
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,399
As for

271
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:15,000
the principle of non-liability
for the crowd,

272
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,399
let's not delve into that.

273
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,680
In other words,

274
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,799
a healthy online

275
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,640
livestreaming platform

276
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
was manipulated

277
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,640
by a group of instigators,

278
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,159
who incited someone to commit suicide.

279
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:35,240
Huiquan should
immediately file a lawsuit

280
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:36,839
against Zhang Xiaobei himself,

281
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,479
and take action against

282
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:42,159
all users who have posted
instigating content online.

283
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,359
They should be banned or

284
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,120
even have their accounts suspended.

285
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,799
In this matter,

286
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,240
Huiquan should take a more active stance.

287
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,479
While observing
the development of this case,

288
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,240
we aim to convey a
correct concept to society,

289
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,839
and at the same time,

290
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,799
remind the public that Huiquan

291
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,919
is the biggest victim in this matter.

292
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,240
Please respond, public prosecutor.

293
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,399
According to the Criminal Procedure Law,

294
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,640
Article 138,

295
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,599
it is necessary to present
a search warrant

296
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:27,000
to the person being searched.

297
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
During arrest

298
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,919
and during detention,

299
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,880
in case of emergency,

300
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,039
a search can be conducted
even without a search warrant.

301
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,279
The defendant counsel requests
to present a defense argument.

302
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,479
Please proceed.

303
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,320
The existing evidence cannot prove that

304
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,640
it was an emergency situation.

305
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,039
The defense requested the appearance of
investigating personnel before the trial.

306
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,520
However, the defense lawyer
has just received information

307
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,240
that the investigating personnel
refused to appear

308
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,039
because the investigating personnel
could not provide proof of their appearance

309
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,640
the legality of the evidence
collection process.

310
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,039
Therefore, the evidence obtained by
several investigating personnel

311
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,520
should be considered illegal evidence

312
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,560
and should be excluded.

313
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:00,200
Please respond, public prosecutor.

314
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:02,000
The investigating personnel

315
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
is unable to attend
due to an emergency situation.

316
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,279
Now the public prosecutor will present the
law enforcement personnel's

317
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,479
body camera footage in court

318
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,240
to prove the legality of
the evidence collection.

319
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,839
Your Honor,

320
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
since the prosecutor

321
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,279
cannot ensure the timely appearance
of the investigating personnel,

322
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,200
we request

323
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,080
to first have the
important witness in this case

324
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,399
Lin Shuang to testify in court.

325
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,599
Mr. Xiao,

326
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,440
I suggest

327
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,959
on the part of Huibo,

328
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,719
we should hold a press conference

329
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,240
and promptly explain the situation

330
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,520
and offer sincere apologies.

331
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,880
Let's take preemptive action

332
00:13:42,359 --> 00:13:44,680
and make a statement
within twenty-four hours.

333
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,039
This is a basic approach
to crisis management.

334
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:49,080
All right.

335
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:51,080
Professor Luo is indeed brilliant.

336
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,200
How impressive.

337
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,200
He's so good.

338
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,100
(Intermediate People's Court of Jiangcheng)

339
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,640
Your Honor,

340
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,120
the defense lawyer's request

341
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,520
for a new witness to appear in court
was without prior notice.

342
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,799
The evidence

343
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,719
is a surprise evidence.

344
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
All witness testimonies

345
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,200
must be confirmed by

346
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,919
the court, prosecution, and defense

347
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,479
before they can proceed.

348
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,359
We have not seen the name

349
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,520
Lin Shuang on the witness list before.

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,919
Therefore, we ask the court

351
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,760
to reject the defense lawyer's request.

352
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,279
Who is this witness, Lin Shuang?

353
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,279
Lin Shuang is the owner of a hair salon
in Yuan Fangfang's neighborhood,

354
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,120
also a key eyewitness to the alleged scene,

355
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,760
where the prosecution claims
the brake system was sabotaged.

356
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,000
Your Honor,

357
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,120
we just reached an agreement

358
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,080
with Lin Shuang fifteen minutes ago

359
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,640
that she is willing to testify.

360
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,279
Considering that she is a
crucial eyewitness in this case,

361
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,839
we earnestly request the court
to allow her to testify.

362
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,240
They're really putting Article 192

363
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,719
of the new Criminal Procedure Law
to good use.

364
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,159
Since it's a matter of life and death,

365
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
if there are no unexpected circumstances,

366
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,839
I believe the presiding judge
will agree.

367
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:00,479
Yes.

368
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:01,719
Presumption of innocence.

369
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,560
And if the witness is indeed crucial,

370
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,240
we cannot persist in our objection.

371
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,520
If the evidence has significant impact

372
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,719
on clarifying the facts of the case,

373
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,880
even if it involves a surprise evidence,

374
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
the witness can still be called to testify.

375
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,760
Court agrees to the sudden request
made by the defense

376
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,520
to have Lin Shuang testify,

377
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
but considering the need for the prosecutor

378
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,760
to make the necessary preparation,

379
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,359
a decision to adjourn the trial is made.

380
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,839
Baiiff.

381
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,560
Yes, Your Honor.

382
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,719
Escort the defendant

383
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,520
back to the detention center
for continued custody.

384
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,560
The court is adjourned.

385
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,520
All rise.

386
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
The presiding judge

387
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,839
and the judge may leave the courtroom.

388
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,440
Prosecutor An is here.

389
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,440
Quick.

390
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:02,479
Prosecutor An,

391
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,080
please share your thoughts on

392
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,359
the defendant's counsel sudden request

393
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,520
for witness Lin Shuang to testify in court

394
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,599
as well as the absence of
your witness, Officer He,

395
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,640
and their impact on the case.

396
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,359
Wasn't the trial adjourned
for this reason?

397
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,520
There is no impact whatsoever.

398
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:12,200
All right,

399
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,399
friends from the media,

400
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,399
if you have any questions,

401
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,479
our prosecution office will provide

402
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,839
unified answers at the appropriate time.

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,640
Considering that the trial will
continue on another day,

404
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,039
in order to not disrupt the
course of the trial,

405
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,440
I suggest that everyone disperse for now.

406
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:23,240
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

407
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:24,320
Thank you.

408
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,279
Please let me through.

409
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,839
Thank you.

410
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,560
Captain He.

411
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:31,320
Captain He.

412
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,120
Be careful.

413
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,320
Sigh,

414
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,159
come over here,

415
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,279
wipe yourself dry.

416
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,479
Captain He,

417
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,159
that's dangerous.

418
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,760
Captain He, why did you
jump into the water?

419
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,959
Captain He, what were you doing just now?

420
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,440
Captain He, why did you
jump into the river?

421
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,919
Do you think Zhang Xiaobei's
decision to jump into the river

422
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:48,919
has anything to do with Huiquan?

423
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,719
Captain He, can you tell us more about

424
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,880
the progress of Zhang Xiaobei's case?

425
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,839
We're still in the midst of investigation,

426
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,039
so there's nothing we can update you.

427
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,560
Excuse me.

428
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:56,959
Please step back.

429
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,159
Guys, please make way.

430
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:58,760
I'm sorry.

431
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:00,760
Please take a step back.

432
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,640
Captain He, what are you doing?

433
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,839
Are you tired of living?

434
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:04,959
My heart was in my throat

435
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,240
when you took the dive earlier.

436
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,559
Thank goodness you can swim.

437
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,559
That's what confuses me.

438
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,120
Zhang Xiaobei can swim better than me.

439
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,479
Why would he jump into the river

440
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,959
to commit suicide?

441
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:18,479
Captain He,

442
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,120
the phone in your shirt keeps ringing.

443
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,100
(He Luyuan, thanks to the adjournment,
or I'll throw you into the Qingshui River)

444
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:39,599
An Ni,

445
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:40,439
An Ni,

446
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:41,800
how is it?

447
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,199
Winning the case?

448
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,880
The court session is adjourned
due to unexpected circumstances.

449
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,880
Don't worry,

450
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,439
don't have to stress about it.

451
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:53,599
The evidence chain you have built

452
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,240
in the Zhu Xin case is
already quite impressive.

453
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,559
Moreover,

454
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,439
your performance in this trial
has been commendable.

455
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:01,800
You guys prepared various
contingency plans too, right?

456
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,520
Yes, we have,

457
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,439
but in this era of the Internet,

458
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,040
information is almost completely exposed.

459
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,559
I'm not upset about it actually.

460
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,640
It's just I don't understand why
He Luyuan did not appear in the court

461
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,160
when he had agreed to do so.

462
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,839
Oh, that guy.

463
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:15,880
Don't worry,

464
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,760
when I meet him later,

465
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
I'll teach him a lesson.

466
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,319
By the way, Prosecutor Guo
is looking for you.

467
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,559
You better rush over.

468
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,400
What is it about?

469
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,240
It's about 7·23 I think.

470
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:26,559
A call came from the prison.

471
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
All right, I'll go over now.

472
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,120
Thanks.

473
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,479
They'll be watching us.

474
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:44,800
I'm sorry. I'm late.

475
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,719
Comrade An Ni,

476
00:18:52,719 --> 00:18:53,719
please proceed.

477
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,280
They must have colluded
in their testimonies.

478
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,400
No matter how they were questioned,

479
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,599
everyone claimed that Li Quan is A.

480
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
I also asked Li Quan earlier,

481
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,359
and he claimed himself as A too.

482
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,800
But not long ago,

483
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:05,880
Prosecutor Guo told me

484
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,760
(Investigation Supervision and)
there are some updates from Li Quan's side,

485
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,920
(Collaborative Coordination Meeting Room)
and he wanted to talk to him.

486
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,839
I supposed he must have
seen the video about Paul,

487
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,319
and it has an effect on him.

488
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,479
Prosecutor Guo,

489
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,479
there is a joint defense and control
meeting in the city this afternoon.

490
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,800
I got to go now.

491
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,439
All right. You may leave.

492
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,120
(An Ni,)

493
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:34,559
(so now...)

494
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,760
You come with me.

495
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,679
(timely communication and exchange
of information are crucial in this matter.)

496
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,040
(I hope we can)

497
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,319
(put that into practice.)

498
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:44,120
(What An Ni said just now about A...)

499
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,359
Give me a moment.

500
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,280
I supposed you don't
need me to remind you.

501
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,520
In this place,

502
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,359
you don't represent yourself.

503
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,719
You represent the image of the police.

504
00:20:07,199 --> 00:20:08,599
What have you done?

505
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,000
We're talking about a trial here.

506
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,839
You're a witness,

507
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,719
yet you just simply walked away.

508
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,640
Yes, I know you're concerned
about Zhang Xiaobei.

509
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,280
Many people are worried about him too.

510
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,280
More than ten of us were

511
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,479
keeping an eye on this case.

512
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,479
(Arrest scene)
Due to emotional attachment to Wanru.

513
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,400
Due to what?

514
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,920
We have to keep an eye on it.

515
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,479
There are still a lot of people
who care about this.

516
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,160
Zhang.

517
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,079
Zhang.

518
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,079
Had there been something going on
between Captain He

519
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,599
and Zhang Wanru?

520
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,359
There are three types of feelings

521
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,319
that are considered the
most reliable and significant.

522
00:20:44,439 --> 00:20:45,079
Kinship,

523
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,479
romance,

524
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,280
comradeship.

525
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,760
Kinship and romance can be
easily weakened by time and distance.

526
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:54,520
In our line of work,
where we face danger every day,

527
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,559
comradeship surpasses romance.

528
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,520
So, it's understandable that

529
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,719
Captain He feels this way.

530
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,920
After all, the person was
Zhang Wanru's brother.

531
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,719
If I were in his shoes,
I wouldn't be any calmer either.

532
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,160
Moreover, he has watched Zhang Xiaobei

533
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,920
grow up since he was just a child.

534
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,520
In a way, they're childhood friends.

535
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,719
Anyway,

536
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,199
I can understand his feelings.

537
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,359
Got it.

538
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,520
There's nothing for me to explain.

539
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,520
I'll accept whatever punishment you give.

540
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,959
So you went there.

541
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
Did you find him?

542
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,679
No.

543
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,719
You see what I mean?

544
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,839
Given the explosive public
opinion surrounding this matter,

545
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,319
and the high level of attention
it has garnered

546
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,800
throughout society,
we must take it seriously and

547
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,719
provide a thorough
explanation to the public.

548
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,359
Regardless of who is involved,

549
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,160
we must conduct a thorough investigation

550
00:21:58,719 --> 00:21:59,880
to get to the bottom of this matter.

551
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,160
Why are you standing here?

552
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,479
I asked, why are you still standing here?

553
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,319
Take care.

554
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,220
(I'm sorry)

555
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:06,479
Prosecutor Guo.

556
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,640
(Huiquan Group)

557
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,600
(Huiquan)

558
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,000
Hello.

559
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:27,359
Hello, Professor Luo,

560
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,760
It's me, Xiao Mu'en.

561
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,400
What can I do for you?

562
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,520
(Please don't say that.)

563
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,959
I need...

564
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,120
I need a favor from you.

565
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:38,359
You're too courteous, Mr. Xiao.

566
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,800
You can be direct with me.

567
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,679
All right.

568
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,160
Today,

569
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,199
Li Yitang, Ms. Li, told me that

570
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,439
Zhang Xiaobei's case

571
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,760
has become more complicated,

572
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,599
(and she said you'll be overseeing it.)

573
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,920
(Of course, I don't know Zhang Xiaobei,)

574
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,000
but he's still after all,
a livestreamer at Huibo,

575
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,479
and the incident also
happened on our platform.

576
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:01,800
It actually

577
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,559
makes me feel bad.

578
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,359
I'm just thinking

579
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:08,040
can we temporarily refrain from
filing a lawsuit against him for now?

580
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,199
(Just give it some time.)

581
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,839
Professor Luo,

582
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,000
you see,

583
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,679
we have

584
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,760
lodged a report with the police

585
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,359
(and have called for a press conference.)

586
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,280
(I'm sure we'll issue more statements
to clarify the matter in the future.)

587
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,479
(You should know)

588
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:27,280
(he's currently the center of attention
across the entire internet.)

589
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:29,920
And we have no idea if he's
still alive and dead.

590
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:33,120
If we sue him at this critical period,

591
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,599
(we might be able to make)

592
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,839
(the company's stance in public,)

593
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,719
(but how about public opinion?)

594
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,160
Public opinion will be
unfavorable to us.

595
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,800
The keyboard warriors on the internet

596
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,319
are people

597
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,520
who show no mercy.

598
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:50,319
What do you think?

599
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:52,880
Mr. Xiao,

600
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:54,719
you see,

601
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,679
I have no problem with that.

602
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,760
(After all, it'll be a decision for
Mr. Zhao to make.)

603
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,520
It's best if you can keep up
with the information.

604
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:08,760
We don't necessarily need
to sue Zhang Xiaobei.

605
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,280
(I personally feel)

606
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:12,599
(there are more convenient ways)

607
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:14,319
(to meet the company's expectations.)

608
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,359
Thank you, Professor Luo.

609
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:15,880
You're welcome.

610
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,439
See you.

611
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,120
Coming.

612
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,359
I've already ordered the food,
let's sit down and eat while it's hot.

613
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,559
You've not only ordered the food,
but you've also started eating it.

614
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:49,559
Let me fill your glass up.

615
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,959
Come, sit.

616
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,240
Today is not a Saturday,
but you want me to drink.

617
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,760
You want me to quit my job?

618
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,880
Stop being so rigid.

619
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,240
It's after working hours now.

620
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,800
What's wrong with drinking a cup or two?

621
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,719
There's no such thing as
off working hours for the police.

622
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,719
So tell me,
what can I do for you?

623
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:12,599
I just want to have hotpot with you.

624
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,000
That doesn't mean
I have any ulterior motive.

625
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,199
It's no fun anymore.

626
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:16,880
I'm going leave
if you don't need me.

627
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,559
Wait! Hold on.

628
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I have

629
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,839
a small problem.

630
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:24,439
What is it?

631
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,160
Lend me some money.

632
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,640
Zhang Xiaobei, you're like
a money-sucking machine.

633
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,199
I just transferred 1,500 yuan
to you ten days ago

634
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,280
and you finished it just like that?

635
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:38,040
There's a lot of things
I have to pay for.

636
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,280
1,500 yuan is nothing.

637
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,120
It's all gone.

638
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,959
You better tell me

639
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,040
where did you spend all the money.

640
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:42,559
Come clean.

641
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:44,319
All right.

642
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:45,920
I'm dating

643
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,359
with a girlfriend.

644
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,800
Can you imagine how much money
I have to spend on her?

645
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,679
I have to buy her meals
and take her to the movies.

646
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,520
How about this?

647
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,559
You call her right now
and ask her to come over.

648
00:27:58,199 --> 00:28:00,319
Once I see her, I'll give you the money.

649
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,959
What?

650
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,439
We've just been together
for a couple of day.

651
00:28:03,479 --> 00:28:05,040
How can I bring her to meet you?

652
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,559
Moreover,

653
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,839
who are you to me?

654
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,599
How do I explain our relationship
to the girl?

655
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,040
What are you saying?

656
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,800
You're right. Who am I to you?

657
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,559
When you need money,
you come and look for me.

658
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,240
Who am I to you?

659
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,559
My sister is gone.

660
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,599
You said you'll

661
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,760
take care of me.

662
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,400
How dare you mention your sister?

663
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,959
If she knows you're behaving like this,

664
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,160
she'll beat you up.

665
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:25,920
Why would she beat me up?

666
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,319
You can leave if you don't want
to lend me money.

667
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,120
What an attitude.

668
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:32,920
Fine.

669
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,160
Brother-in-law.

670
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,679
You're really leaving?

671
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,959
My sister is not around anymore,

672
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,839
my dad is old.

673
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,839
You're the only person in this world

674
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,479
who treats me well.

675
00:28:50,199 --> 00:28:52,240
You certainly have a way with words.

676
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,599
I'll give you a thousand.

677
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,359
Spend wisely.

678
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,660
(Please receive 1,100 yuan)

679
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,839
1,100 yuan?

680
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:12,319
To pay the bill for this meal.

681
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,559
Why aren't you smoking?

682
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,160
Came out to take a breather?

683
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,520
I'm trying to give up smoking.

684
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,199
There's someone named Lu in our unit

685
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,760
diagnosed with lung cancer.

686
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,359
I went for a body checkup

687
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:53,559
and found out that
there are nodules in the lungs.

688
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,880
I'm not scared of death,

689
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,559
especially dying in the battlefield.

690
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,319
But if I can't make it

691
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,400
to the battle zone because I'll ill,

692
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,120
I feel it's not worth it.

693
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,319
Since you're not smoking,

694
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:10,760
eat this.

695
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,880
I always wonder

696
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,959
why do you always carry
sunflower seeds with you?

697
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm used to it.

698
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,199
When we're reviewing documents,

699
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,559
we don't even have time to eat.

700
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,520
So Mr. Wang will bring some biscuits,

701
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:25,000
Han Xuan will bring some buns,

702
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,120
and I bring them so that
I can munch on them.

703
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:35,000
I actually met Zhang Xiaobei a few times,

704
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,160
but didn't have a
strong impression of him.

705
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,000
The first time when I met him,
he was still a child.

706
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,160
Wanru brought him along

707
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,199
to have dinner with us.

708
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,400
He was very tiny and adorable.

709
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,800
The next time when I met him,

710
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:48,319
he had already grown up.

711
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,479
That was at Wanru's memorial service.

712
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,660
(Martyr Zhang Wanru's grave)

713
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,359
Your sister is a hero.

714
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:56,120
We'll always remember her.

715
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:59,120
If you encounter any difficulties,

716
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,079
feel free to come look for me.

717
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,640
I met Wanru

718
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:08,839
in Country A,

719
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,959
and she died in front of me.

720
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,479
It was my biggest regret.

721
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,079
It's not your fault.

722
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:23,359
The more I try to remember
her face in my mind,

723
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,640
the more blurry it becomes.

724
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:32,880
Speaking of which, it's actually
me who should

725
00:31:34,479 --> 00:31:37,079
feel indebted to her.

726
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,920
Many people in our unit

727
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:40,280
thought we were a couple.

728
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,479
I had always wanted to find

729
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:44,719
an opportunity to explain to her.

730
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,959
You know, I was quite angry

731
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,679
when you suddenly left the court earlier.

732
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,719
But later I found out that

733
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,319
you went to find Zhang Xiaobei.

734
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,160
Thank you.

735
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:05,640
Thank me for?

736
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,719
Thank me for looking for Zhang Xiaobei?

737
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,280
No.

738
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,280
I thank you

739
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,359
for allowing me to know who He Luyuan truly is,

740
00:32:11,479 --> 00:32:12,240
and not the Captain He,

741
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,599
who was always at odds with me.

742
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:17,760
To express my gratitude,

743
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,319
I'll share some information with you.

744
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,559
In the 7·23 case,

745
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,679
there is an account holder

746
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,359
in the victim's account
named Zhang Xiaobei.

747
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,880
Only by finding Zhang Xiaobei

748
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,479
can we dig deeper into the truth.

749
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,479
Yes, but first, we still
have to locate him first.

750
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,760
How was the situation
when you went there earlier?

751
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,880
We used all the means at our disposal.

752
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,160
We even have people searching
within a three-kilometer radius downstream.

753
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,240
But so far, there's no news yet.

754
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,040
How about we take a look later?

755
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,479
- We must find him even it's difficult.
- Captain Liu.

756
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,000
- Captain He.
- Captain Liu.

757
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,599
Is she your wife?

758
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,240
What wife?
You should know

759
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm not married.

760
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,000
This is Prosecutor An Ni
from Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

761
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,920
What's the progress?

762
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:25,359
The search operation is still ongoing,

763
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,760
but no updates yet.

764
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
If the person who jumped into
the river is already dead,

765
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,439
the body will sink to the bottom
before resurfacing.

766
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:33,679
In the case of sinking,

767
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,199
the water flow in Qingshui River
is not that fast,

768
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,319
so we haven't found anything yet.

769
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,079
Yes, if someone drowned,

770
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
it would usually take about six hours

771
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,839
for the body to float up.

772
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,679
You've been searching,
but haven't found anything, right?

773
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,120
Let's change our approach, Captain Liu.

774
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,280
Let's assume that after
Zhang Xiaobei jumped,

775
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,000
he changed his mind because he was
afraid to die.

776
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,679
In that case, where could he
have gone ashore nearby?

777
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,079
One of the rescue team members
mentioned that

778
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
while the water in
Qingshui River is not deep,

779
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,479
it has some unique characteristics.

780
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,640
The riverbed is

781
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,479
mostly upright,

782
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,959
making it impossible for someone
to climb up from there.

783
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,000
Where does the downstream lead to?

784
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,360
There are some branches,

785
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,600
but the river water ultimately flows

786
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,919
to Nanshui City.

787
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,159
It's unlikely for him to swim
all the way to Nanshui City

788
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,639
without a break.

789
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,399
He would have to come
up for air along the way.

790
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,719
Considering there are
surveillance cameras everywhere,

791
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,399
yet none captured him on video.

792
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,520
Hello.

793
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,320
Really?

794
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,479
I'm with Captain He.

795
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,760
We'll go and take a look.

796
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,000
What is it?

797
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,399
Han Xuan said some influencers

798
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:35,919
were live streaming from
Zhang Xiaobei's rental place.

799
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,800
Take a look at this.

800
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,280
An Ni, we should go there immediately

801
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,760
to collect and secure evidence.

802
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,280
- Sure.
- Captain Liu, we'll make a move first.

803
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,439
- All the best.
- Thank you.

804
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,700
(Civil code)

805
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,980
(Articles of law)
(One's missing is unknown for four years.)

806
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,480
(New passcode)

807
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,060
(Bill)

808
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,199
On February 11th, he owed 1,500 yuan.

809
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,439
On February 12th, 2,000.

810
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:38,119
On February 27th, he owed 13,000 yuan.

811
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,719
He borrowed so much money for gaming.

812
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,879
Can we turn on his computer?

813
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,920
(Tell others how Huiquan's games
have led me to dire straits)

814
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,320
Put aside your work now

815
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,919
and help me check

816
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,639
Zhang Xiaobei's
gaming account in Huiquan.

817
00:37:07,879 --> 00:37:09,520
Don't miss any piece of information

818
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,560
from the day he registered.

819
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
(Huiquan, who granted you
the power of life and death)

820
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,200
(Bei, who forced you into
a desperate situation)

821
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,119
Dad.

822
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,119
What are you doing?

823
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,959
What are you doing?

824
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,719
Are you feeling guilty?

825
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,159
Guilty? Am I the one
who caused harm?

826
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,439
Am I the one
who caused harm?

827
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,639
It seems to me that you're the one

828
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,240
who's trying to mess things up,

829
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,919
and that's very dangerous.

830
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,919
Have you done any investigation?

831
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,360
Do you know the truth?

832
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,119
Are you a police officer or a judge?

833
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:50,639
You're jumping to conclusions
without solid evidence.

834
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,119
You're being used as a puppet by others.

835
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,520
You're all grown up,

836
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,679
but why don't you have any
independent thinking ability?

837
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,360
Delete it quickly.

838
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:01,760
What are you staring at?

839
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:06,320
Luo Xiaoting, don't you dare defy me.

840
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,119
But why, Dad?

841
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,600
Just look at yourself now.

842
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,119
Do you think you still look like
a nationally renowned legal expert?

843
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:17,159
Dad, what has become of you?

844
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,560
What's wrong with you?

845
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,119
Xiaoting,

846
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,520
you're twenty-six years old now.

847
00:38:24,959 --> 00:38:26,560
Ever since your mother
passed away,

848
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,399
I rarely get angry with you.

849
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,159
Today, I'm not
angry with you either.

850
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:33,360
I'm just worried about you.

851
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:35,439
Think about it.

852
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,000
Ever since you started doing this,

853
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,119
how many threats have you received?

854
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,520
Do you know

855
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,919
every time you're threatened,

856
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,320
I would have sleepless nights.

857
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,639
I'm worried about you.

858
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,479
One day, you're going to

859
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,040
land yourself in hot soup.

860
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,199
You might even risk your life.

861
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,560
Dad, you really don't need
to worry about me.

862
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,520
You're someone I look up to.

863
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:04,639
Have you forgotten?

864
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,919
In your more than forty years
of teaching law,

865
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,800
you've spoken up for the marginalized

866
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,320
and faced all kinds of threats.

867
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,959
But you have never wavered

868
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,600
in your commitment to justice.

869
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,119
Xiaoting,

870
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:20,439
I'm getting old.

871
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,240
I don't care about anything else.

872
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:24,000
I just want us

873
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,159
to be safe.

874
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,520
Xiaoting,

875
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,679
listen to me.

876
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:32,080
Delete it.

877
00:39:32,919 --> 00:39:34,959
Don't worry, Dad.

878
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,879
I won't be put myself in danger.

879
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:37,800
Moreover,

880
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,479
I spent two nights writing this.

881
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,399
Please let me send it out.

882
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:52,679
Fine.

883
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,360
Go ahead.

884
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,959
But promise me,

885
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,520
use a fake account.

886
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,320
All right.

887
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,119
Danan, I'm looking for you.

888
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,119
Stop running.

889
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:21,760
Li Danan.

890
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,240
Stop running!

891
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,520
Come down.

892
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,479
Go ahead and
climb over it again.

893
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,000
When I was running five kilometers daily
at the police academy,

894
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,719
you were still playing with mud
and peeing yourself.

895
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,320
Go on. Climb over it.

896
00:40:47,959 --> 00:40:50,040
Please help me.

897
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,240
Get down here.

898
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,840
- Get lost.
- Stay out of it.

899
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,360
Isn't that Captain He?

900
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,040
Captain He from the police force.

901
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
Let's go!

902
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:42,360
Eat something.

903
00:41:43,479 --> 00:41:44,840
Smells good.

904
00:41:45,959 --> 00:41:46,760
Should I get you a bowl too?

905
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:52,040
Captain He, please believe me.

906
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,560
If it were not for this elder sister...

907
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,360
Don't you call her your sister.

908
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,199
Everything you said is useless.

909
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,040
Whether you go or not,
it doesn't matter.

910
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,280
I really wanted to rescue you.

911
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,840
After all, you're Xiaobei's brother.

912
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,479
Save it.

913
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,520
Don't bother with useless talk.

914
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,360
Who were those three men?

915
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,639
Debt collectors.

916
00:42:09,879 --> 00:42:10,719
How did all of you

917
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,080
end up with online loans?

918
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,479
I'm in need of money.

919
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,040
Getting a loan online is easy.

920
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,520
We need money to
put food on the table.

921
00:42:20,879 --> 00:42:21,800
Put food on the table?

922
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,679
It seems you just indulging

923
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,119
in expensive meals.

924
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
You might as well eat money.

925
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,560
Did you two get loans from
the same online company?

926
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:30,959
Nope.

927
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,119
Did you meet Xiaobei before the incident?
