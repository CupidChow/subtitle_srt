He Luyuan,

32
00:03:20,736 --> 00:03:22,856
there's a possibility
that Qian Tianxin isn't A.

33

But that can't be.

The time, location,

35
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:28,016
and Paul's characteristics

36
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:29,497
I just checked.

37
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:31,537

After the police finished questioning,
now it is the procurator's turn.

43
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,296
Do you really have a lot of spare time

44
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:49,417
that you have nothing to do?

45
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:52,016
Or is my head so valuable

46
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,816
that everyone wants
to come and bother me?

47
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,337
Qian Tianxin,
on behalf of the procuratorate,

48
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,617
I'll be conducting
an interrogation with you.

49
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:04,137
Please answer truthfully.

50
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:09,016
When and where
did you meet Paul that day?

51
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,617
I need you to be precise
with the address and the exact minute.

52
00:04:12,016 --> 00:04:12,856
In the previous interrogations,

53
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:14,856
everything was recorded on camera.

54
00:04:14,936 --> 00:04:16,937
Don't you know how to refer
to the previous footage?

55
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,416
When and where
did you meet Paul that day?

56
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:24,856
I need you to be precise
with the address and the exact minute.

57
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:25,497
Fine.

58
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,217
I'll repeat it.

59
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:30,456
Paul and I agreed to
meet on July 15th, at 3:15 PM

60
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:32,897
two years ago.

61
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:36,097
He was about seven minutes late.

62
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:39,856
We agreed to meet at Marie Payne Cafe,

63
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:42,576
located at 117 Careyles Street
in Port Selva,

64
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:48,256
which is less than an hour
away from Pasak.

65
00:04:48,736 --> 00:04:52,536
We ordered two cups of
milk coffee from Country A.

66
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:53,976
Are you happy now?

67
00:04:58,696 --> 00:04:59,696
You're lying.

68
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:04,016
Me? Lying?

69
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:06,016
That's fine with me.

70
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:06,976
If you think I'm lying,

71
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:08,416
you can check the interrogation footage.

72
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:09,937
If there is any inconsistency,

73
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,217
that means I lied.

74
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:13,777
Besides,
why would I go through the trouble

75
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:15,097
of fabricating this lie?

76
00:05:15,337 --> 00:05:16,817
When I denied I was A,

77
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,777
you guys insisted I am A
and forced me to admit it.

78
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,416
Now that I have admitted it,

79
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:22,897
what else do you want from me?

80
00:05:24,777 --> 00:05:26,016
I checked the weather on that day.

81
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,937
There was heavy rain in Selva.

82
00:05:29,057 --> 00:05:31,057
with precipitation
of over 200 millimeters.

83
00:05:31,536 --> 00:05:34,736
You said you and Paul had coffee

84
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:35,617
at Marie Payne Cafe?

85
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,057
Qian Tianxin, do you know that
Marie Payne Cafe

86
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:42,456
is an open-air cafe?

87
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:44,736
They prepare drinks using coffee carts

88
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:47,296
and set up tables and chairs outside
to serve customers.

89
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:49,937
So you're saying that you and Paul sat

90
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,536
in the pouring rain,

91
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:53,177
drinking milk coffee on that day?

92
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,296
Was it raining?

93
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:02,296
But think about it.

94
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,416
This was two years ago.

95
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,377
It's pretty reasonable

96
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,617
that I can't remember
some details, right?

97
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:08,097
Fine.

98
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:09,856
Let me ask you again.

99
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,617
You can explain every
detail of your crimes,

100
00:06:13,657 --> 00:06:15,617
how you operated, how you organized,

101
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:17,256
and how you deceived people
to work for you.

102
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:19,337
But when it comes to your fraud targets,

103
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,657
you become evasive.

104
00:06:21,057 --> 00:06:22,897
Qian Tianxin, we went through

105
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,016
all your servers.

106
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,016
You're not the type of fraud syndicate

107
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,536
that would cast a wide net.

108
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:28,617
You were precise
in targeting individuals.

109
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:30,057
Who provides you
with the personal information?

110
00:06:31,817 --> 00:06:33,217
I've already told you.

111
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:34,856
It was Guo Jing'an
who provided the personal information.

112
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:36,777
Some of it came from low-level runners.

113
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:38,456
I wasn't involved in the processing

114
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:39,456
of that low-level information.

115
00:06:39,497 --> 00:06:41,177
I never bothered about it.

116
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:42,217
What did you say?

117
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:43,617
Low-level?

118
00:06:44,217 --> 00:06:46,296
Do you know that gathering citizens'
information illegally

119
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:48,057
is a very serious matter,

120
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:50,016
especially considering
the large number of victims involved?

121
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,177
Is it something a small workshop

122
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:52,256
like Guo Jing'an can provide?

123
00:06:52,337 --> 00:06:53,337
So what?

124
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:55,177
What does it have to do with me?

125
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,217
I already said that I didn't really bother
about these matters.

126
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,416
Is that not allowed?

127
00:07:10,817 --> 00:07:12,136
But honestly,

128
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:15,416
your personality is very similar to me

129
00:07:15,497 --> 00:07:16,736
when I was young.

130
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:20,057
The only difference is that
you chose the right path,

131
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:21,617
while I went down the wrong one.

132
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:27,696
If it wasn't for fate,
perhaps we could have been friends.

133
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:43,657
Excuse me for a moment.

134
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:49,736
After receiving our request

135
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:51,456
for assistance from Country A,

136
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:52,817
they immediately interrogated Paul.

137
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:56,856
However,
Paul couldn't remember the exact date.

138
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:00,296
But he confirmed that it was indeed
the place mentioned by Qian Tianxin.

139
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,456
Also, they did drink
Country A's milk coffee that day.

140
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:05,777
Does he recognize Qian Tianxin's voice?

141
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,897
He said it was Qian Tianxin
who called him.

142
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:10,136
But the one he met was an old man.

143
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:10,937
An old man?

144
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:11,536
Yeah.

145
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:15,296
He also said that
the old man was in disguise

146
00:08:15,657 --> 00:08:18,497
because when that person
handed something to him,

147
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:23,416
he noticed the hand
was pale like a woman's hand.

148
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:30,377
So can we confirm that Qian Tianxin is A?

149
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:33,216
I understand.

150
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:34,856
I'll report this matter
to the superior right away.

151
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:37,336
We're going to bring charges
against Qian Tianxin.

152
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,416
I'll get back inside.

155

If we move forward,

00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:55,416
we can gain control of
the entire market.

157

00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,817
an absolute monopoly position
in the market.

167
00:09:26,457 --> 00:09:29,416
To be profitable, we must hang on

168
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:30,976
and overcome it.

169
00:09:31,336 --> 00:09:33,976
When other companies can no longer bear

170
00:09:35,216 --> 00:09:38,057
the competition,
they'll naturally give up

171
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:39,656
a certain share of the market.

172
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:42,617
Then victory will eventually be ours.

173
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:44,736
- That's great.
- Mr. Xiao is right.

(Core principles of coping strategies)
Therefore, I believe that

178
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:55,017
at this moment, we should not be fussy
about the amount of revenue or gains

179
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:57,856
and losses we make.

180
00:09:58,216 --> 00:09:59,617
The more challenging the situation,

181
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:01,257
the more we should persevere

182
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:05,336
and launch our new products
against the trend and strive

183
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,296
to occupy the entire market share.

184
00:10:07,536 --> 00:10:09,937
According to our company's new plan,

185
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:12,017
our next step will be devoted

186
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:13,017
to developing new games

187
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:15,617
under the Huiquan Corporation,

188
00:10:15,856 --> 00:10:17,416
creating an industry linkage,

189
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,216
(Next page)

190
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,457
and establishing
a self-sustaining ecosystem

191
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:21,296
(The bottom line)
within our organization.

192
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:22,216
At the same time,

193
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,617
we should aggressively target

194
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,976
the advantageous sectors
of other platforms.

195
00:10:27,017 --> 00:10:28,216
The longer we persist,

196
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,216
the more passive they become.

197
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:33,137
Although some of those senior companies

198
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:35,096
may seem glorious on the surface,

199
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,736
we all know
that they've become so desperate

200
00:10:37,976 --> 00:10:41,617
that they're allowing
their own streamers to engage

201
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,096
in online gambling

202
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,577
and profiting from it themselves.

203
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,096
Of course, we would never engage

204
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,177
in online criminal activities
and will never do it.

205
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:54,177
This is the principle of our company.

206
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:59,096
Previously, the crackdown
on an online crime case in Country F

207
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,697
had generated
a wave of public opinion online.

208
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:06,257
At the same time,
Zhang Xiaobei's appearance

209
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,656
has indeed generated

210
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,736
some unfavorable news for our company.

211
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,377
Therefore, at this moment,

212
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,216
we must make our stance clear.

213
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,536
We're determined
to stand against cybercrime

214
00:11:15,617 --> 00:11:16,497
and fight it to the end.

215
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:18,896
The market will naturally know
which side to choose.

216
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,296
That concludes my speech.

217

(Xiao Mu'en)

218
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,817
Mr. Zhao, do you find anything wrong?

219
00:11:31,017 --> 00:11:31,817
You're right.

220
00:11:32,457 --> 00:11:35,457
We must firmly resist cybercrime.

221
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,976
(Yin Huiquan)
Mr. Xiao's speech was excellent

222
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,416
and provided us all with a vivid lesson.

223
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:50,817
In fact, I deeply feel that
everyone in Huiquan Corporation,

224
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:55,617
from top to bottom, should fully support
Mr. Xiao unconditionally.

225
00:11:55,856 --> 00:11:56,656
Chairman...

226
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:58,497
I understand your concerns

227
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,856
and the concerns of everyone.

228
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:04,776
I'll put it this way then.

229
00:12:05,697 --> 00:12:10,057
Our company is about to receive
the largest overseas investment

230
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:12,336
and the amount is quite substantial.

231
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,536
When Mr. Xiao mentioned perseverance,

232
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:20,096
we not only have the capacity to endure
but also to succeed.

233
00:12:26,617 --> 00:12:29,617
So, let's end today's meeting.

234
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:39,656
Mr. Xiao, congratulations

235
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:42,736

to our company.

243

Yeah?

244
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:29,497
I've noticed you haven't been in
a good mood these past few days.

245
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:30,296
What's wrong?

246
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:32,776
Isn't the company doing well now?

247
00:13:35,536 --> 00:13:36,216
I'm fine.

248
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:40,656
Don't worry.

249
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:42,457
I'll take care of it myself.

250

I thought you were never coming back.

258
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:24,736
You're always out partying
and looking for men all the time.

259
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,896
You left me all alone here

260
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,697
to study this computer stuff.

261
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,896
My head is about to explode.

262

I'm not a kid anymore.

263

How can I master all this?

264
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,776
Besides,
we're already in this line of work.

265
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,057
What's the use of learning it?

266
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:39,296
Who am I learning it for?

to get out of this mess one day.

But do you know?

270
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,017
Ever since I first took a knife

271
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:49,896
and attacked someone for you,

272

what difference will it make?

Help me lend money
for the rest of your life?

285

to go around attacking people?

Listen to me.

00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:20,177
I don't need you to be part of the gang.

288

290

I knew it was A who feed you
with this idea when you said that.

291

Am I right?

292
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,577
You force me to learn computers.

293
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:37,336
It's also A's idea.

294
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:38,096
Right?

295
00:15:38,216 --> 00:15:38,937
Yes, it is.

296
00:15:39,216 --> 00:15:40,017

297
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:41,896
He's right.

298

What era are we in right now?

299
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:45,216
It's the information age now.

300
00:15:45,257 --> 00:15:47,697
Our old ways are already outdated.

301
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:49,617
If we continue a life
of cheating and violence,

302
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:52,336
we'll be obsolete in less than two years.

303
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:59,416
I know you don't think highly

304
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:00,497
of the things I'm doing now.

305
00:16:01,577 --> 00:16:04,656
You think it's cheap.

306
00:16:05,536 --> 00:16:06,856
But you must understand this.

307
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,656
I'm doing this to pave
the way for us in the future.

308

And what you're doing now

309
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,736
is paving the way for me.

310
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,096
Understand?

311
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:26,577
I believe you'll be useful one day.

312
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,216
By then, you'll be on dry land,

I'll take the blame for you.

317
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:41,137
I won't let anything happen to you.

318
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:49,817
If that day comes,
you can think of your options

319
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:51,937
and make your choice.

320
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:53,416
Okay?

321

If that day comes and I can't save you,

322

then I'll go in and be with you.

324

I do believe you.

325
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:10,977
I really believe it.

00:17:57,217 --> 00:17:59,016
I received it in the morning and
I have already included it

333
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:00,057
in my evidence outline.

334
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:01,057
Now, I want to know

335
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:02,496
about the situation of the witness.

336
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:04,656
What do you mean by "uncertain"?

337
00:18:05,817 --> 00:18:07,496
Okay. Let me know when you're sure.

338
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:08,217
Ni.

339
00:18:08,496 --> 00:18:09,896
Wait. I have to make this call.

340
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:11,097
We have problems.

341
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:11,656
What's wrong?

342
00:18:11,737 --> 00:18:13,616
Zhang Xiaobei said
he doesn't want to testify in court.

343
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:15,577
What?

344
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:18,136
He just called me and
said he doesn't want to testify in court.

345
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:21,217
What's going on with him?

346
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,016
I told him nicely that
his testimony is crucial.

347
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,496
He witnessed all of
Qian Tianxin's crimes.

348
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:29,136
His testimony in court is vital for us

349
00:18:29,136 --> 00:18:30,536
to convict Qian Tianxin.

350
00:18:30,616 --> 00:18:32,296
He promised to testify.

351
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:33,737
Why is he changing his mind
out of a sudden?

352
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,057
I agree. I told him the same thing.

353
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,256
But he told me that since he came back,

354
00:18:38,256 --> 00:18:39,656
people have been harassing him.

355
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:42,577
He had made up his mind to
live a normal life.

356
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:44,296
But now he can't go back to that.

357
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:46,616
He also said that
if he testifies in court,

358
00:18:46,737 --> 00:18:47,937
he won't be able to find peace.

359
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,776
Who is harassing him?

360
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:52,177
Haven't you watched the news?

361
00:19:09,337 --> 00:19:11,416
Xiaobei, hello.
We're from Urban News Entertainment.

362
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:13,817
Can you tell us a little
about the girl Liang Ying,

363
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:15,016
who escaped with you
from the underworld?

364
00:19:15,016 --> 00:19:16,057
Yes, please share with us.

365
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:17,296
Some people say

366
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,057
that you bravely barged in
to rescue her because of love.

367
00:19:19,177 --> 00:19:19,817
Others say that she's an online hostess

368
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,817
who was involved in adult content.

369
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:22,457
Can you please tell us?

370
00:19:22,457 --> 00:19:24,496
You better not harass her.

371
00:19:24,616 --> 00:19:25,937
Otherwise, I'll come and get you.

372
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:26,857
Do you believe it?

373
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,057
Xiaobei!

374
00:19:30,496 --> 00:19:33,457
Xiaobei, there has been a lot of
discussion on the internet

375
00:19:33,496 --> 00:19:34,697
about your resurrection

376
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:36,376
after you jumped into the river.

377
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,097
The netizens are also discussing,

378
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:40,697
with some saying that you're fighting

379
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:42,496
against powerful capitalists
in your own way,

380
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:45,337
while others claim that
you're using death as a gimmick

381
00:19:45,857 --> 00:19:48,217
to attract attention and
disrupt social order.

382
00:19:48,296 --> 00:19:49,496
What would you like
to say to everyone about this?

383
00:19:49,496 --> 00:19:50,616
Are you deaf?

384
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,857
I've told you countless times

385
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,496
that I'm injured and need rest.

386
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:53,896
Can't you...

387
00:19:56,057 --> 00:19:57,097
I'm Luo Xiaoting.

388
00:19:58,217 --> 00:20:00,416
You texted me
before you jumped into the river.

389
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:02,217
Xiaobei, I want...

390
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:02,857
No, you don't.

391
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:05,177
You're no different from those people.

392
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:07,616
If it weren't for what happened before...

393
00:20:09,577 --> 00:20:10,376
Xiaobei.

394
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:17,536
Sorry.

395
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:18,616
But we cannot accept interviews here.

396
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:20,057
This is a hospital.

397
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,737
Regardless of whether you
have an appointment or not,

398
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:22,416
it's not allowed.

399
00:20:22,737 --> 00:20:25,737
Moreover, you've already seriously
affected our patients' rest.

400
00:20:25,737 --> 00:20:26,857
Please leave immediately.

401
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:29,577
We've been waiting here all night.

402
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,697
And we're legitimate journalists.

403
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,217
We have the right
to choose our interviewing methods

404
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:34,296
conduct independent investigations,

405
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,136
and obtain factual information.

406
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:36,616
- That's right.
- Yeah.

407
00:20:36,616 --> 00:20:38,416
We have press credentials.

408
00:20:38,857 --> 00:20:39,857
Come on. Let us in.

409
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,296
We're legitimate journalists.

410
00:20:41,296 --> 00:20:42,896
We have press credentials.

411
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,057
Why won't you let me in?

412
00:20:44,057 --> 00:20:45,256
Do you know this is a hospital?

413
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:46,216
According to Article 23, Paragraph 1

414
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:47,616
of the People's Republic of China Law on
Public Security Administration Punishments,

415
00:20:47,616 --> 00:20:50,057
those who disrupt the order of
government departments,

416
00:20:50,136 --> 00:20:52,136
organizations, and institutions,

417
00:20:52,217 --> 00:20:53,697
making it impossible for work,

418
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,697
production, business, medical treatment,
scientific research, or teaching

419
00:20:55,697 --> 00:20:58,656
to proceed normally, shall be warned
and fined not more than 200 yuan.

420
00:20:58,817 --> 00:20:59,857
Those with more severe circumstances

421
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,817
shall be detained for more than five days
but not more than ten days

422
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:03,536
and fined not more than 500 yuan.

423
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:04,057
An Ni.

424
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:05,577
Xiaoting, come with me.

425
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:06,256
Excuse me.

426
00:21:08,457 --> 00:21:10,457
Is she An Ni from
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate?

427
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:10,977
That's right.

428
00:21:11,016 --> 00:21:13,737
Yes, she's Prosecutor An
who went to Country F to handle the case.

429
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:14,857
She's of much higher value
than Zhang Xiaobei

430
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:15,656
in terms of investigation and reporting.

431
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,496
Let's go, hurry up.

432
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:19,296
Prosecutor An, Prosecutor An,
please wait a moment.

433
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:21,896
Prosecutor An,

434
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,016
can we have a moment of
your time for a brief chat?

435
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:24,817
Can you tell us

436
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:26,256
why are you here in person
to find Zhang Xiaobei?

437
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:27,536
(Haixuan Media)
Is it because Zhang Xiaobei

438
00:21:27,616 --> 00:21:28,737
has crucial information?

439
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,817
Is it true that Zhang Xiaobei

440
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:32,296
played a crucial role
in the investigation

441
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:33,416
of your case as rumored?

442
00:21:33,457 --> 00:21:35,376
Is Zhang Xiaobei really your informant?

443
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,416
Dear journalist, I believe

444
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:38,136
there will be an opportunity

445
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:39,416
for me to answer your questions later.

446
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:40,656
But definitely not now.

447
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:41,857
Just now, I explained

448
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,337
the Public Security Administration
Punishments Law to you.

449
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,416
Now, I would like to familiarize you
with the Criminal Law.

450
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:46,937
Article 293 of the Crime
of Hindering Public Order stipulates

451
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:48,136
that those who chase, intercept,
insult, or intimidate others,

452
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,457
with particularly severe circumstances,

453
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:51,697
shall be sentenced
to fixed-term imprisonment

454
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:53,337
of not more than five years,

455
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:55,136
criminal detention, or control.

456
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,136
Additionally, I hope that in the future,

457
00:21:58,296 --> 00:21:59,896
without Zhang Xiaobei's consent,

458
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,337
you won't force him to give interviews.

459
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:04,016
Of course, you have the right to choose

460
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,256
whom to interview.

461
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,616
But respecting the privacy

462
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,217
and dignity of every individual

463
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,697
is the obligation of every citizen.

464
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:10,416
You have stumbled upon a hot topic.

465
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:10,937
But has anyone truly cared

466
00:22:10,937 --> 00:22:13,337
about Zhang Xiaobei,
who is in the hospital ward?

467
00:22:14,337 --> 00:22:15,577
He has experienced things

468
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:16,616
that he shouldn't have at his age.

469
00:22:16,697 --> 00:22:18,097
I hope he won't be subjected

470
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:18,937
to further stress and harm.

471
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:20,697
I also hope that each one of you

472
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:23,896
can fulfill the responsibility
of an adult and protect him.

473
00:22:24,097 --> 00:22:24,896
Thank you.

474
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:40,177
Xiaobei, get up.

475
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,376
Those people have already left.

476
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:44,376
Don't worry.
I've already talked to them.

477
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:45,977
They won't bother you again.

478
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,937
Come on.

479
00:22:52,097 --> 00:22:54,577
Stop crying under the blanket
over such a small matter.

480
00:22:54,896 --> 00:22:56,697
I haven't even asked you
to compensate me for my computer yet.

481
00:22:57,416 --> 00:22:58,656
Enough, stop pretending.

482
00:22:58,776 --> 00:23:00,697
You're already an adult,

483
00:23:00,817 --> 00:23:01,296
do you still need to be coaxed? Get up.

484
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:04,616
Xiaobei?

485
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:17,457
He Luyuan, it's me.

486
00:23:17,457 --> 00:23:18,457
Help me track someone.

487
00:23:19,496 --> 00:23:21,817
I know it's not your working hour.

488
00:23:21,857 --> 00:23:23,577
The rascal is missing again.

489
00:23:25,136 --> 00:23:25,937
Hello?

490
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,057
(Health Insurance Advisory Office)
It's me.

491
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:30,457
It's okay.

492
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:35,776
I feel so overwhelmed and confused.
I want to see you.

493
00:23:38,457 --> 00:23:39,296
What's wrong?

494
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,457
Why are you saying this?

495
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,817
Do you know how difficult
it was for me to slip away

496
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:45,656
from those reporters' watchful eyes?

497
00:23:45,697 --> 00:23:47,496
It was even harder than escaping
from Qian Tianxin.

498
00:23:49,217 --> 00:23:50,016
I don't care.

499
00:23:50,616 --> 00:23:51,857
If you don't want to meet me,

500
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:53,457
I'll do another live stream
and jump into the river again.

501
00:23:53,697 --> 00:23:55,296
You know I'm capable of doing it.

502
00:23:57,457 --> 00:23:57,857
Okay.

503
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,457
I'll come to find you.

504
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:33,136
Don't come inside.

505
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,457
Is this where you live?

506
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:37,177
Let's talk inside.

507
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,616
Why are you blocking me?

508
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:39,697
Is there a man inside?

509
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:41,616
- Well, it's...
- Mommy,

510
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:42,977
come here quickly.

511
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:44,937
The cartoon is about to start.

512
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:48,577
Bao, I need to talk to go out
and talk to this man for a while.

513
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:49,857
I'll be right back.

514
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,177
You stay home, okay?

515
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,097
Mommy?

516
00:24:55,776 --> 00:24:56,977
Let's talk outside.

517
00:24:59,217 --> 00:25:00,016
Okay.

518
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:12,776
I'm sorry.

519
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:14,217
Why are you apologizing?

520
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,857
I'm now in the same generation
as your son.

521
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,496
Is there anything else
that I don't know?

522
00:25:19,817 --> 00:25:21,616
I didn't mean to lie.

523
00:25:23,097 --> 00:25:24,217
What about your son?

524
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:26,776
Does he know what his mom does?

525
00:25:28,616 --> 00:25:30,016
That's not what I meant.

526
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,536
I know.

527
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,577
Even if you say something more extreme,

528
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:35,217
I can still accept it.

529
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,937
I'm not a responsible mother.

530
00:25:36,937 --> 00:25:38,776
I'm not even worthy of being a mother.

531
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:40,977
But at that time, I really had no choice

532
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:42,817
but to leave him with my mother.

533
00:25:43,937 --> 00:25:46,057
I didn't know how things
would turn out like that.

534
00:25:47,016 --> 00:25:48,977
I left in such a hurry.

535
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,217
I don't know what the outcome

536
00:25:53,737 --> 00:25:55,536
of this bail pending trial will be.

537
00:25:56,536 --> 00:25:59,136
I don't know if I'll be arrested
and be in prison.

538
00:25:59,217 --> 00:26:01,857
The person I feel most sorry for is Bao.

539
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,016
During the bail pending trial,

540
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:05,896
weren't you abducted there before?

541
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:06,977
Besides, it was Guo Jing'an

542
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,776
who forced you to do that, right?

543
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,136
Xiaobei, there are many things

544
00:26:12,136 --> 00:26:16,057
I haven't told you because I thought

545
00:26:16,256 --> 00:26:18,256
it would be too cruel for you.

546
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:23,857
Actually, there was a reason

547
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:25,337
why I urgently left China.

548
00:26:29,057 --> 00:26:30,457
I told you to go out and earn money.

549
00:26:31,016 --> 00:26:32,016
What did you do?

550
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:35,016
You developed feelings
for a customer, huh?

551
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:36,457
I did not.

552
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:37,857
Have you forgotten your place?

553
00:26:40,136 --> 00:26:40,937
Come here!

554
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,496
I'll help you remember your place.

555
00:26:58,656 --> 00:27:01,337
Do you know that the police

556
00:27:01,697 --> 00:27:02,857
are already onto us?

557
00:27:02,977 --> 00:27:04,457
Why do you think

558
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:05,296
I run around every day?

559
00:27:06,217 --> 00:27:07,616
It's to get a few more cards

560
00:27:07,616 --> 00:27:08,296
and make some more money.

561
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:10,496
So we can run away with our child.

562
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:13,097
But what did you do?

563
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,616
You returned so much money to people.

564
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:18,536
Who did you give the money to?

565
00:27:19,256 --> 00:27:20,376
I'm asking you a question.

566
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:26,337
I only returned a small portion
of the money to those I deceived.

567
00:27:26,616 --> 00:27:29,057
I don't want to live like this anymore.

568
00:27:31,136 --> 00:27:32,337
Why pretend to be a good person?

569
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:35,057
Do you think you're so noble?

570
00:27:36,337 --> 00:27:40,016
Have you forgotten that
you helped me collect phone cards

571
00:27:40,496 --> 00:27:43,296
and bank cards from students back then?

572
00:27:45,337 --> 00:27:49,616
Without you, I couldn't have expanded
my business to such a scale.

573
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:52,496
We're in this together.

574
00:27:53,416 --> 00:27:57,296
If I go down, nobody can escape.

575
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,977
Do you know how fierce
the crackdown on cybercrime is

576
00:28:03,256 --> 00:28:05,376
by the police, procuratorate, and court?

577
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:09,457
For people like us
who collect phone cards and bank cards,

578
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:11,737
they call it something

579
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:18,337
like "assisting in criminal activities
related to information."

580
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,776
We'll all end up in prison.

581
00:28:20,896 --> 00:28:23,097
You'll be the one arrested. Me.

582
00:28:23,177 --> 00:28:24,177
The referrer!

583
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:27,016
Our son will be the son of criminals!

584
00:28:27,256 --> 00:28:28,656
Someone without any parents!

585
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:41,616
Hello, it's me.

586
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:44,016
Help me.

587
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:47,656
I can't bear it for another minute.

588
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:49,937
If this continues,

589
00:28:51,136 --> 00:28:53,337
I'll either be beaten to death
or sent to jail.

590
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:58,057
If I can go out and make some money

591
00:28:58,217 --> 00:28:59,817
to take Bao away,

592
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,496
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

593
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,217
That's easy.

594
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:08,416
Didn't I tell you that
there are job openings in Country F.

595
00:29:08,697 --> 00:29:09,697
They're all decent jobs.

596
00:29:09,857 --> 00:29:11,857
You can easily earn
over a million a year.

597
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:14,376
Moreover, wealthy businessmen
are everywhere.

598
00:29:14,616 --> 00:29:15,656
With your appearance,

599
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:16,776
do you think you won't make money?

600
00:29:17,296 --> 00:29:19,057
I know several girls
who can't be compared to you,

601
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:20,857
they're already making a fortune there.

602
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:22,376
Really?

603
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:24,616
Then I can go right away.

604
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:27,256
I'll go tomorrow.

605
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:32,256
That's why I'm the fool.

606
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:35,376
I've completely fallen for you.

607
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:36,977
But I don't know anything.

608
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,256
Even now, I'm still like a fool.

609
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,177
I'm sorry.

610
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:40,496
I know I owe you.

611
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:41,656
I'll slowly repay you.

612
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:44,857
I'll find a proper job later.

613
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:46,057
I'll work hard.

614
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,656
I'll gradually return the money

615
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:48,937
you gave me as tips.

616
00:29:49,057 --> 00:29:50,857
You want to pay me back from working?

617
00:29:50,937 --> 00:29:52,337
How can you pay me

618
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:53,376
for the suffering you've caused me?

619
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,977
I can pay you slowly.

620
00:29:55,977 --> 00:29:56,857
I don't want you to repay me!

621
00:29:59,057 --> 00:30:00,737
Guo Jing'an has already been arrested.

622
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:01,817
But you still have a choice.

623
00:30:02,577 --> 00:30:03,457
We still have a chance.

624
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:04,376
Trust me, I don't mind.

625
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,416
I don't care. We can start all over.

626
00:30:06,496 --> 00:30:06,977
Trust me.

627
00:30:06,977 --> 00:30:09,016
That's enough. Don't you get it?

628
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,737
We can't be together.

629
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,737
You still have hope.

630
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:14,737
You still have a future. But I don't.

631
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:19,217
I've caused so much harm

632
00:30:19,217 --> 00:30:19,977
to so many people like you.

633
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,577
I have to pay the price.

634
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:22,496
You still have a chance.

635
00:30:22,536 --> 00:30:23,337
You're different.

636
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,296
Do whatever you think is right.

637
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:31,256
Do something you won't regret.

638
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,577
Bao is waiting for me at home.

639
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,697
Don't run.

640
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:55,376
Xiaobei!

641
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,177
Xiaobei!

642
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,057
Can you help me look for him?

643
00:31:01,616 --> 00:31:02,817
The court hearing is about to start.

644
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:04,457
And he's an important witness
for Qian Tianxin.

645
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:06,016
What if something happens to him?

646
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:08,177
He'll be fine.

647
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:09,817
Think about it,

648
00:31:09,857 --> 00:31:11,057
who comes to the park late at night?

649
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,457
Couples who are dating

650
00:31:14,577 --> 00:31:16,177
or people who come
to dance in the square.

651
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,256
What is he doing here?

652
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:20,256
Where else can he go?

653
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:23,097
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

654
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,697
Who do you think
he wants to see the most now?

655
00:31:29,977 --> 00:31:31,097
It's Liang Ying.

656
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,376
He won't be able to see her soon.

657
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,937
He must have gone to find her.

658
00:31:34,057 --> 00:31:36,496
Don't worry. He'll show up tomorrow.

659
00:31:40,016 --> 00:31:41,057
Then I'll find him tomorrow.

660
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:41,536
Okay.

661
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:42,857
You're sure, right?

662
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:46,577
Well,
the feeling of one person liking another

663
00:31:46,616 --> 00:31:48,217
is something
only the people involved would know.

664
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:50,896
They want to be together
for 24 hours a day.

665
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:55,337
Why don't you go home?

666
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,057
Where? Your place is that way.

667
00:31:57,776 --> 00:31:59,376
Are you going to eat
at that noodle house again?

668
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,217
Come on, let's go.

669
00:32:20,616 --> 00:32:21,817
How's the sorting coming along?

670
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:23,817
I've sorted part of it, Ni.

671
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:26,097
These are the sorted ones.

672
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:03,097
The order of all case files

673
00:33:03,177 --> 00:33:04,376
needs to be rearranged.

674
00:33:06,016 --> 00:33:09,097
First, you need to arrange

675
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:10,217
the criminal organization structure

676
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:12,177
based on the position hierarchy
of each suspect.

677
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:14,616
Use each victim as a factual basis

678
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:15,857
and gather all the criminal activities

679
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:17,416
of the lower-level suspects

680
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:19,416
involved in telecommunications
fraud together.

681
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:22,256
By doing so, it'll be clear at a glance

682
00:33:22,296 --> 00:33:23,136
the number of crimes

683
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:24,376
and the amounts involved
for each suspected criminal.

684
00:33:24,776 --> 00:33:27,016
Next, you need to categorize
and summarize

685
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:28,697
all the factual evidence
related to each team leader

686
00:33:28,776 --> 00:33:30,097
and their accompanying suspects.

687
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,977
This way, the number of crimes

688
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:33,616
and amounts for each team

689
00:33:33,697 --> 00:33:34,937
will also be evident.

690
00:33:35,177 --> 00:33:37,177
Group all the teams together

691
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,376
and summarize each location.

692
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:42,457
This way, all the suspected criminals,
their involvements,

693
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:43,857
self-identified number of crimes,

694
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:46,817
and amounts will be revealed.

695
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,256
That seems to make sense.

696
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:52,457
If we follow your method,

697
00:33:53,416 --> 00:33:55,416
even complex cases
can be organized systematically.

698
00:33:56,416 --> 00:33:57,616
This is just the basic work.

699
00:33:57,977 --> 00:34:00,577
The next step is to examine the evidence
for each incident.

700
00:34:00,977 --> 00:34:02,857
It is necessary to ensure that each fact

701
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:04,616
is clearly established,

702
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:05,817
the evidence is indeed substantial,

703
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,457
and all reasonable doubts
are eliminated.

704
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:10,217
This way,
the case can be solidly established.

705
00:34:13,497 --> 00:34:14,297
Sort it out again.

706
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:44,497
Dad, I'm home.

707
00:34:48,257 --> 00:34:49,457
You're home.

708
00:34:56,616 --> 00:35:01,217
Just call me "old man."

709
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:09,257
I'm not used to
hearing you calling me "dad."

710
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:17,457
It feels like you're going somewhere.

711
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:22,616
Somewhere far away,

712
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:25,297
just like your sister.

713
00:35:28,497 --> 00:35:32,336
Dad, I'm not going anywhere.

714
00:35:32,977 --> 00:35:35,257
I'll live a good life and start anew.

715
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:39,576
What's so funny?

716
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:42,697
You don't believe I can start over?

717
00:35:43,056 --> 00:35:44,017
No, I...

718
00:35:45,297 --> 00:35:46,217
I believe you.

719
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:48,177
I do.

720
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:59,017
Dad, you would beat me or scold me

721
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:02,257
whenever I caused trouble

722
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:04,416
I've caused
such a huge trouble this time.

723
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,737
Don't you want to beat me?

724
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,697
If you don't beat me,
you could at least scold me.

725
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:15,856
You can just scold me.

726
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:16,576
Dad...

727
00:36:29,977 --> 00:36:33,656
You must have suffered a lot out there.

728
00:36:41,297 --> 00:36:43,177
During the days you were gone,

729
00:36:45,056 --> 00:36:47,457
I constantly blamed you.

730
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:50,017
I blamed you for being immature.

731
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,816
I blame you for beyond saving.

732
00:36:56,056 --> 00:37:01,697
I blame you for not being
as excellent as your sister.

733
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:09,777
But as parents, we always complain

734
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:20,497
about our children for
not living up to our expectations.

735
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:34,336
I always feel like
I owe you an apology.

736
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:40,297
Can you forgive me?

737
00:37:47,896 --> 00:37:53,056
Dad, I miss my sister.

738
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:56,096
Dad.

739
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,497
I can't believe you, Zhang Xiaobei.

740
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,257
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:26,977 --> 00:38:27,416
Forget it.

742
00:38:27,576 --> 00:38:29,136
It's not the first time you do this to us.

743
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:31,856
I get it.

744
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:34,136
But don't worry.

745
00:38:35,017 --> 00:38:38,017
I'll definitely attend
the trial this time.

746
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,860
(Uphold the law)

747
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:01,777
Hello, Ms. Qian Tianxin.

748
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:03,457
Nice to meet you. I'm Wu.

749
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,977
And I'm the defense lawyer
hired by your family.

750
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:09,697
You signed
the authorization letter previously.

751
00:39:10,017 --> 00:39:11,616
Hello, Lawyer Wu.

752
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,136
According to the notice,

753
00:39:13,697 --> 00:39:14,937
the Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate

754
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:16,816
has received the indictment.

755
00:39:17,336 --> 00:39:18,457
The trial will be held

756
00:39:18,497 --> 00:39:20,697
at Jiangcheng's Intermediate People's Court
in five days.

757
00:39:21,297 --> 00:39:23,297
Based on the information
I currently have,

758
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,376
the situation is not favorable for you

759
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,537
because you are implicated
in multiple serious crimes.

760
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:30,576
Among them, there are seven charges

761
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,497
related to cybercrime,

762
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:32,737
seven charges related to violent crimes

763
00:39:32,816 --> 00:39:34,537
such as illegal detention,
intentional injury,

764
00:39:34,616 --> 00:39:36,937
and intentional homicide.

765
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:40,537
And additional charges
including illegal organization

766
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:42,096
and illegal border crossing,

767
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:43,896
totaling nineteen charges.

768
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:47,257
Your case is extremely complex,

769
00:39:47,576 --> 00:39:49,777
and it's difficult
to find precedents to refer to.

770
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:53,937
However, I'll still do my best

771
00:39:54,497 --> 00:39:56,297
to fight for lenient treatment for you.

772
00:39:57,977 --> 00:39:59,376
Thank you, Lawyer Wu.

773
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,697
I understand that this is your job.

774
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:06,017
However, please convey to my family

775
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:09,376
that I think I've committed
extremely heinous crimes

776
00:40:09,457 --> 00:40:10,457
and deserve to die.

777
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:13,656
That's why I confessed after a while.

778
00:40:14,497 --> 00:40:17,656
I don't want to drag on
like this anymore.

779
00:40:17,856 --> 00:40:19,856
I just want a quick outcome.

780
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,816
So, I hope you can understand me.

781
00:40:27,576 --> 00:40:32,896
Ms. Qian,
I can truly understand your feelings.

782
00:40:35,257 --> 00:40:39,457
But due to
my professional responsibilities,

783
00:40:40,576 --> 00:40:42,457
I have to say what needs to be said.

784
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:47,656
No matter what you desire now,

785
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:54,497
I will do my utmost to
fight for your rights and benefits.

786
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:01,096
Tell him not to worry.

787
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:49,416
Xiaoting, what are you looking for?

788
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:51,896
I'm looking for a law reference book.

789
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,697
Some fans wanted me
to discuss Qian Tianxin's case.

790
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:56,856
So I want to study it thoroughly.

791
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,100
(Top Legal Advocate)

792
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:05,576
Here you go.

793
00:42:05,937 --> 00:42:07,816
Study this one.

794
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,217
Thanks, Dad.

795
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:18,297
I heard from our colleague
that the journalists

796
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:19,616
were waiting to interview Zhang Xiaobei
at the hospital,

797
00:42:19,656 --> 00:42:21,977
who jumped into the river previously.

798
00:42:24,136 --> 00:42:26,096
Huiquan is keeping an eye
on Zhang Xiaobei?

799
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:29,336
Dad, you said Huiquan is clean.

800
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:30,457
If they're not guilty,

801
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:31,656
why would they be afraid
of Zhang Xiaobei?

802
00:42:32,336 --> 00:42:34,136
Can you be rational?

803
00:42:35,336 --> 00:42:38,217
Our colleague was at
the hospital for an appointment.

804
00:42:38,497 --> 00:42:40,177
They happened to see you there.

805
00:42:41,096 --> 00:42:41,697
Sure, they did.

806
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:43,616
Huiquan always seems so unintentional.

807
00:42:44,416 --> 00:42:46,217
Back then,
you unintentionally helped Huiquan

808
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,497
suppress the attention of
Zhang Xiaobei, Shi Xiaohu,

809
00:42:49,856 --> 00:42:51,697
and many other victims
of the Huiquan game, right?
