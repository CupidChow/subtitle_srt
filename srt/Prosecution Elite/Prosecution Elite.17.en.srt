=Episode 17=

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,960
When you're in the most secure prison,

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,119
you can only watch on

17
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,240
as he rats us out bit by bit.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,879
Do you think he wouldn't have thought
about all that?

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,640
He met me.

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,680
He anticipated everything
and took precautions.

21
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,079
It's not your place to worry about it.

22
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,960
Besides,

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,000
An Ni can never enter my office building.

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,720
Really?

25
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:03,920
You doubt it?

26
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,400
I can say confidently

27
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:09,799
that An Ni can't do anything to me

28
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,519
even if I surrender myself
to the procuratorate.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,340
I created the business here

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,400
days and months multiplying on my own.

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,879
Before I achieve the goal A set out,

32
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,719
I will not quit.

33
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:26,799
And I won't allow anyone to ruin it.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,159
Never.

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,400
Okay.

36
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,999
I'll stay here to keep you company.

37
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,680
Thank you.

38
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,279
Madam.

39
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,680
Wei called.

40
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,600
He said he found the last person.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,560
Noted.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,480
You may leave.

43
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:02,799
Okay.

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,639
Now, we're all alone.

45
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:15,840
Xiaobei.

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
The vehicle is here.

47
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,359
Where is he?

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,159
Call my Master.

49
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:32,719
Ni!

50
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:33,519
Captain He!

51
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,120
Ready?

52
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,919
Go.

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,639
Master.

54
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,799
What is wrong with him?

55
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,680
He disappeared?

56
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,599
Can we tie him down

57
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,560
and watch over him 24/7 now?

58
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:22,400
Ni.

59
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,639
I know I'm useless

60
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,960
but I still know my place in this world.

61
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,639
I will return where I belong.

62
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,720
Perhaps he went back?

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,120
Is he out of his mind?

64
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,599
If he did return,

65
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,319
let's contact Jose

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,560
and see if we can investigate
Qian Tianxin's company.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,599
Let's go.

68
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,120
Let's go.

69
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:42,519
Okay.

70
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,440
To be honest,

71
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,400
I like men like you.

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,000
You could walk away

73
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,919
but you came back for the love of your life.

74
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,919
You're a loyal man.

75
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,400
The love of my life?

76
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Who? You?

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,519
You got lucky and caught me.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,840
I will do the same again

79
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,720
and none of you can catch me.

80
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,680
You want to escape?

81
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,400
Let me chop off your limbs.

82
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,199
Don't lie any more.

83
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,680
I can read you like an open book.

84
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,880
You must be the mole.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,319
Me? Working for them?

86
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,519
Then you are as dumb as a donkey.

87
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,599
You took me from China

88
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,919
and subjected me to forced labor.

89
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:51,440
Finally I escaped,

90
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,759
but you caught me.

91
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,319
Do I look like a mole to you?

92
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,400
I checked his belongings.

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,359
He has nothing suspicious

94
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,120
except for ten yuan in his pockets.

95
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,359
Ten yuan?

96
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,120
Is ten yuan enough

97
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,160
to escape with the girl?

98
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,560
Why?

99
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:16,680
You want the girl to starve with you then?

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,240
Men who want love but have nothing

101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,359
are so pathetic.

102
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,160
Xin.

103
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,599
What do we do now?

104
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,479
I'm in a great mood today.

105
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,479
Keep him here.

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,199
Give him a good beating

107
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,560
and waterboard him for two days.

108
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,759
Do what you want to him.

109
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,919
I'm a busy man.

110
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
Should we begin now?

111
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,319
Zhang Xiaobei is being tortured now.

112
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,680
If only I could barge in and rescue him.

113
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:57,479
Relax.

114
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,160
We are in Country F.

115
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,120
We have our own ways of doing things.

116
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,280
Officer Jose,

117
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,079
how can we enter and check the premises?

118
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,240
You need a reason first.

119
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,599
What?

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,639
Did all of us come here for show then?

121
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:37,279
You shouldn't keep that kid.

122
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,919
He is a threat.

123
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,120
So?

124
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:49,159
A predator only eats the prey
once the predator has had fun.

125
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:50,760
And I haven't had enough fun.

126
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,279
Yes?

127
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,039
What?

128
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:10,359
I have the certificate given to me

129
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:11,560
by the Gambling Commission.

130
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,479
They cannot barge in for a search.

131
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,359
I see.

132
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,560
It's An Ni again.

133
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,599
How annoying.

134
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,959
An Ni is Li Yitang's good friend.

135
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,159
Can you tell Yitang to convince An Ni

136
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,560
to get off my back?

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,719
Can you?

138
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,320
An Ni represents
the Chinese procuratorate.

139
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,719
Be nice.

140
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,799
What did I see?

141
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,580
- Ni.
- Is it a cigarette butt?

142
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,919
What is going on?

143
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,880
According to local laws,

144
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,640
smoking is banned in a factory.

145
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,039
Violators will be jailed.

146
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:03,399
Wow.

147
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,640
I find a cigarette butt in your premises.

148
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,440
Fire!

149
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,039
- Fire!
- Fire!

150
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:12,399
Hurry.

151
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,959
Let's go inside and see

152
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,479
if they do smoke in the factory.

153
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,599
Come.

154
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,479
Let's go.

155
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,479
Why?

156
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,799
You want to fight me?

157
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:36,959
Wei!

158
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,080
Wei!

159
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,200
Madam is here.

160
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,719
She told you to stop

161
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,479
and come with her.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,399
We stop here today.

163
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,839
Soak him in water.

164
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,279
Don't leave him here

165
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,680
because it stinks.

166
00:11:06,359 --> 00:11:07,359
Jose.

167
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,080
You are so unforgettable.

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,120
A senior officer at the age of 26.

169
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,760
The youngest in Sanjiang's history.

170
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,640
But then you are stuck

171
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,560
in the same position for 15 years.

172
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,479
I can expect it
because of your behavior style.

173
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,479
Miss Qian.

174
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,000
You sure know me very well.

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,880
You flatter me.

176
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,200
I don't have anything remarkable,

177
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,520
but I have a good memory.

178
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,560
I will remember people

179
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,959
who helped me

180
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,680
and who wanted me dead.

181
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,520
I know them by heart.

182
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:13,919
Look at this.

183
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,039
I'll give you a lift.

184
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,560
Okay.

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
It's the server room?

186
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:22,959
Yes.

187
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
Exactly like what Li Guoquan told us.

188
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,359
Take some photos of it.

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,359
I'm the opposite.

190
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,520
I try to handle as soon as possible

191
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,399
those who want to harm me or my friends.

192
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,919
In case I forgot one day.

193
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,760
I assume
you won't let us check up there?

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,159
It's okay.

195
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,919
I respect your privacy.

196
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,479
For all you know,
you might be keeping a man up there.

197
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,279
It's a Swiss KABA lock.

198
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:11,399
Sir.

199
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,320
Someone's waiting for you.

200
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay.

201
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,120
Miss Qian.

202
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:20,120
We will meet again soon.

203
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:22,399
Let's go.

204
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,919
Don't worry.

205
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:30,039
We won't meet again.

206
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,479
Officer He.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Prosecutor An.

208
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,680
I understand your plight.

209
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,760
We have already approved
the search warrant

210
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,279
so that you can proceed
with your investigation.

211
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,000
However, in Country F,

212
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,159
Qian Tianxin is given the license to run a casino

213
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,520
and is protected
by our Gambling Commission.

214
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,279
We cannot seize and search
their business content.

215
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,680
However,

216
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,839
if you can submit new evidence

217
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,000
indicating that Qian Tianxin violated
other laws in Country F,

218
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,880
you can demand the Gambling Commission

219
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,279
to revoke her license.

220
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,159
Thank you for your help.

221
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,200
Thank you.

222
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,700
Thank you.

223
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,880
Thank you.

224
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:32,000
Prosecutor Guo.

225
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,799
Our investigation has pretty much confirmed

226
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:36,799
that Qian Tianxin is the culprit

227
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,359
behind the cybercrimes back home.

228
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:42,080
We do have witnesses
who are willing to testify,

229
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,520
but there are some problems.

230
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,080
(Prosecutor Guo,)

231
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,240
(the biggest obstacle right now
is her casino license.)

232
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:55,479
(Teleconference Center, Jiangcheng's Procuratorate)
The casino license is basically her lifeline.

233
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,640
We need to find evidence
of Qian Tianxin's criminal activities

234
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,120
so that we can persuade the local police
to take action.

235
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,000
By the way,

236
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,039
(the door lock of her server room)

237
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,880
(is also quite complicated.)

238
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,359
It's a Swiss KABA lock.

239
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,680
(To pick it open,)

240
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,320
(you need at least ten minutes.)

241
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,799
And Qian Tianxin can erase all records

242
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:19,000
of her and her activities within four minutes.

243
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
(It'll be challenging to incriminate her.)

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,320
(We need a way to gather evidence remotely.)

245
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:24,640
My colleagues,

246
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,359
let me say something.

247
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,080
(I know without any clearance,)

248
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,359
(your investigation is faced
with enormous difficulties.)

249
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:38,799
And you have run
into many unexpected problems.

250
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,080
I appreciate your hard work,

251
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,560
(but you do know)

252
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,479
that Qian Tianxin's
international criminal syndicate

253
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,520
is growing stronger by the day.

254
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,479
(They now exist beyond the laws.)

255
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,200
(While you are investigating,
they did not lay low.)

256
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,620
(Instead, they continue to expand)

257
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:01,580
their criminal target groups

258
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,320
and develop more websites and APP

259
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,000
to infiltrate into our country.

260
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,359
(In other words,)

261
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,719
(more and more victims)

262
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:13,359
(are appearing as we speak now.)

263
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,640
My colleagues,

264
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,560
it is imperative

265
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,839
that we dismantle their network immediately.

266
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
On behalf of all leaders
of this operation,

267
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
I now order you

268
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,080
(to act officially.)

269
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:31,680
No matter what,

270
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,320
this time we have to uproot

271
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:36,279
this overseas criminal organization

272
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,159
that threatens the peace and order.

273
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,599
Officer Jose.

274
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:46,760
Thank you for your support.

275
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:49,000
It's my duty.

276
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,039
They are destroying people's lives
in our country.

277
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,000
I cannot allow them to do that.

278
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,359
Sooner or later,

279
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,080
I will bring them to justice.

280
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,760
We still need your support
in the future.

281
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,520
Once the commission revokes
Qian Tianxin's license,

282
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,520
we will swoop in and arrest them.

283
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
I'll be on standby.

284
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:09,880
Thank you.

285
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,040
Thank you.

286
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:11,880
Bye.

287
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,760
Bye.

288
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,040
Freeze!

289
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,120
Open up!

290
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,719
Freeze!

291
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,040
Call the ambulance!

292
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:29,760
Hi.

293
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,240
I'm Jose.

294
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,559
A senior officer in Country F.

295
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:39,760
Officer He.

296
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,640
You will regret this.

297
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
I'll prove you wrong.

298
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,000
The same thing

299
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,479
happened in the same way again.

300
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,719
Before I came here,

301
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,120
Prosecutor Guo told me

302
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,559
that history would not repeat itself.

303
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,199
No one wanted this to happen.

304
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:27,079
Why are you here?

305
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,439
An Ni.

306
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
Are you all right?

307
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,839
I'm asking you a question.

308
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,719
It is on the news and TV.

309
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,719
Anyone can find out
about it on the phone.

310
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,280
It's not a secret anymore.

311
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
You explained how you found us.

312
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:43,760
But why did you come to Country F?

313
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:45,559
Captain He.

314
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,400
Are you questioning me?

315
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm on my annual leave

316
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:50,400
and I'm traveling.

317
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,679
An Ni.

318
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,199
I bought you some snacks.

319
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
Some for you too, Captain He.

320
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,800
Thank you for your sacrifices.

321
00:19:57,079 --> 00:19:59,439
This is just a small gesture from me.

322
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,559
I know

323
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:03,079
you might not have the mood
because of the incident.

324
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,359
But...

325
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,439
Yes, we're not in the mood
for a reunion.

326
00:20:05,959 --> 00:20:08,199
You can call An Ni if you want to talk to her.

327
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:13,760
Captain He.

328
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,479
I know you hold confidential information.

329
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
No one told me anything.

330
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,640
Can't I travel to country F on my own?

331
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:23,800
Don't worry.

332
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,240
I won't disturb you.

333
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,599
I won't pry into your work.

334
00:20:28,959 --> 00:20:31,400
My plan was to see An Ni and leave.

335
00:20:31,719 --> 00:20:33,240
But after this tragic news,

336
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,160
I hope that I could stay

337
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,679
to keep An Ni company tonight.

338
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,920
And comfort her.

339
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,800
Mr. Xiao.

340
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,479
I'm not sure if you see
the situation here.

341
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,800
You're here to chat with me,

342
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,599
but I don't have the time for it.

343
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't even have the time to sleep.

344
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,439
Not to mention that Jose just passed away.

345
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:53,880
I'm really not in the mood.

346
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,079
You heard her?

347
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,160
An Ni.

348
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,880
I know this is a bit abrupt

349
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,040
but I thought you'd need someone
after this tragedy.

350
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,120
I'm here. I can keep her company.

351
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,240
Do you have something to say?

352
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,760
Let me see you off,

353
00:21:11,199 --> 00:21:11,640
Mr. Xiao.

354
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:13,479
Captain He.

355
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
Sorry for one more thing.

356
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,199
The hotel here is fully booked.

357
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,640
To stay closer to An Ni,

358
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:25,520
I paid double the price

359
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,000
to book the room next to An Ni's.

360
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,479
Next to your room?

361
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,280
I think...

362
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,199
Isn't that my room?

363
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,520
It's just for one night.

364
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,280
But...

365
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,520
We...

366
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,000
We booked four rooms for half a month.

367
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,439
You can't just overwrite
my booking like that.

368
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:38,559
You don't own the hotel.

369
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:39,800
Calm down, Captain He.

370
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,359
You see.

371
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:43,120
Here, money gives you everything.

372
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,959
That's why they gave me the room.

373
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,280
Of course, I am in the wrong this time.

374
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,599
I want to stay closer to An Ni,

375
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,040
at your expense.

376
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,760
Therefore,

377
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,640
I booked a suite for you
in a nearby five-star hotel.

378
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,319
Can you stay there for one night?

379
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,199
It's a presidential suite

380
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,160
of a nearby five-star hotel for one night.

381
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,079
Please?

382
00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

383
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:07,800
Why?

384
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Jump into the water if you want.

385
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:11,719
Mr. Xiao.

386
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:12,439
Mr. Xiao.

387
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
I know you took the effort to come here.

388
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,800
But this is about my work ethic.

389
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,199
If you want to talk to me,

390
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,760
you have to wait until I come back.

391
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:23,439
Okay.

392
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,240
Then leave.

393
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,679
Take your things.

394
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,660
(Xiao Mu'en)

395
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,660
(Xiao Mu'en)

396
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,160
(Do you need customer service?)

397
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,959
I hope I didn't scare you.

398
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,199
Xiao Mu'en.

399
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,400
You didn't go home?

400
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:30,640
Where are you?

401
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,800
After you chased me away,

402
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,599
I had an epiphany.

403
00:25:37,959 --> 00:25:39,800
(The Earth is round.)

404
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,160
(Captain He occupies one side of it.)

405
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,120
But God leaves the other side for me.

406
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,400
So, I talked to the tenants
on the other side of your room.

407
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,280
They are very supportive

408
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:56,400
and gladly took up my offer
to stay in the presidential suite.

409
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,359
You don't know when to give up, do you,

410
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,079
Mr. Xiao?

411
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,079
How am I supposed

412
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,199
to thaw your frozen heart?

413
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:12,160
(They say people who study laws are cold,)

414
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,120
(maybe even heartless.)

415
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,160
(Listen,)

416
00:26:16,479 --> 00:26:19,599
I came all the way from China.

417
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
And you,

418
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,719
helped Captain He to rebuke my advance.

419
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,160
Isn't that cruel?

420
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,599
Cruel? I don't think so.

421
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,959
Keeping a clueless person here is cruel.

422
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,160
(People who study IT are just)

423
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,760
(as rigid as law practitioners.)

424
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:40,079
You went out of your way to come here

425
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
but you're still only allowed
to talk to me on the phone.

426
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,479
But now, there's only

427
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,760
a wall between us.

428
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,160
Don't you find that romantic?

429
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,599
(Listen.)

430
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,460
Yes, we are separated by a wall.

431
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,400
But it doesn't faze me.

432
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,359
Whether it's a wall or an ocean
that stands between us,

433
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,319
I will always follow you.

434
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:14,280
Xiao Mu'en.

435
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:16,679
Did you just call me

436
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,160
so that you can recite a poem?

437
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:27,559
An Ni.

438
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,520
I'm dead serious about you.

439
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:34,920
Can I tell you something?

440
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,479
Mr. Xiao, allow me to interrupt you.

441
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,520
Can you move to another hotel?

442
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
It's dangerous here for you.

443
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,400
An Ni.

444
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,760
Listen to me.

445
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,199
An Ni.

446
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,040
I know I owe you an apology.

447
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:51,559
I know your work is busy and dangerous.

448
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,040
I didn't notify you and come here uninvited.

449
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,520
I shouldn't have done that.

450
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,199
I was too selfish.

451
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,800
I don't know what got into me.

452
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,240
I have always been a respectful person

453
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,040
but I let my feelings get the better of me.

454
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,040
Perhaps this is what my heart desires.

455
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:16,400
(After we hung out last time,)

456
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,599
(I have many words)

457
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,160
in my chest.

458
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,160
I want to talk to you about cybercrimes.

459
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,760
(I want to know you better.)

460
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,679
Xiao Mu'en.

461
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,959
I'm serious right now.

462
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,000
(There are codes to observe in my line of work)

463
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,880
and you're jeopardizing my job prospect.

464
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:41,760
Just moments ago,

465
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,959
someone died in front of me.

466
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:47,760
(Do you know how close we are to danger?)

467
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,439
And here you are, being reckless.

468
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,000
An Ni.

469
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,160
I am aware of that.

470
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,679
And you haven't even explained

471
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,280
how you found us.

472
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,120
I'll break it down for you.

473
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:01,520
Although you keep your operation a secret

474
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,599
from everyone else,

475
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,520
for the locals, your whereabouts

476
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,199
are public information.

477
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,000
(Ever since you stepped foot into this place,)

478
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
(your information was shared online.)

479
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,479
I'm in IT, remember?

480
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,479
Do you know how worried I was

481
00:29:18,479 --> 00:29:19,479
when I saw the news?

482
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,559
I took leave immediately and flew over.

483
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:24,120
(I noticed my mistake)

484
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,120
when I landed.

485
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,240
Among the sea of crowds here,

486
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:33,199
how am I supposed to locate you?

487
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:35,719
(When I felt defeated)

488
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,280
and decided to head back,

489
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,880
I stumbled upon news of Qian Tianxin
on the TV.

490
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,079
I found your contact number online.

491
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,079
I went hotel to hotel
to ask if you stayed with them

492
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,599
(and I finally found this place.)

493
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,199
An Ni.

494
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,359
To find you,

495
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,160
(I faced my fear.)

496
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,319
And today,

497
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:02,000
please give me the chance to say this.

498
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,640
Will you be my girlfriend?

499
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,079
An Ni?

500
00:30:20,959 --> 00:30:21,760
(Xiao Mu'en.)

501
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,959
I am very flattered.

502
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:27,479
You're a kind

503
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,400
(and friendly man.)

504
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,359
But relationship isn't
my priority right now.

505
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,880
I don't have the time for it.

506
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:42,120
Besides, your childish act of endangering
your own life

507
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,280
and coming here to disturb my work
is very disappointing.

508
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,839
You know what?

509
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:53,719
Go back to China first.

510
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,079
Once the operation here concludes,

511
00:30:57,479 --> 00:31:00,479
we can talk about it, all right?

512
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:02,959
Okay.

513
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,599
I'll go back to my work now.

514
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,040
Stay safe.

515
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,240
Rest early too.

516
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:09,800
See you.

517
00:31:39,959 --> 00:31:41,520
I don't understand.

518
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,479
What were you thinking?

519
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,800
Are you insane?

520
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,040
What's the matter?

521
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:05,040
Have you forgotten?

522
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,679
The moment you slashed him for me

523
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,319
for the first time in the casino,

524
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,479
I already went crazy.

525
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,439
I thought you were aware of that fact.

526
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,319
I did everything to protect you.

527
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,280
Have you ever thought for yourself?

528
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,000
You just declared war
on the police of Country F.

529
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,679
How are you going to get away?

530
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,319
Will it make you feel better

531
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,559
if I kill them all?

532
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,880
Maybe you won't yell at me.

533
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,479
You...

534
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
Remember what you taught me?

535
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,359
That we have to stay calm at all times.

536
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,439
Everything can be solved.

537
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,479
For our goal,

538
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,120
we have to remain calm.

539
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,520
But look at you now.

540
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,640
What has become of you?

541
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:00,839
What has become of me?

542
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,079
Did I change?

543
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,400
I built everything here with my bare hands.

544
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,920
They are mine.

545
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,240
They have no right
to stick their nose in my business.

546
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,319
Kai.

547
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,959
Remember what I told you?

548
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,400
I only have one goal.

549
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,359
Whoever gets in my way,

550
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:30,839
I'll kill them.

551
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,640
What is your plan then?

552
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,880
You'll know soon enough.

553
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:08,600
Sir.

554
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,719
Madam told us to stop luring potential victims.

555
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,719
She wants us to liquidate
all current victims.

556
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,399
Once we have the money,

557
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,240
we'll launder it right away.

558
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,320
We have to finish everything
in two days.

559
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,320
Two days?

560
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,760
That's not enough.

561
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,439
I'm mobilizing every manpower.

562
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,199
Even the chefs.

563
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,719
Oh.

564
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,560
What about the ones in the water
torture cell and in detention?

565
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:34,560
Still breathing.

566
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,439
They are being punished now.

567
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,919
Bring them here.

568
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,840
I'm as busy as it gets

569
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,040
and they will not idle around.

570
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:42,840
Go now.

571
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:43,879
Yes, sir.

572
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:44,840
Hurry.

573
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:48,240
Stop staring.

574
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,800
Work!

575
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,199
Zhang Xiaobei.

576
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,520
You can come out now.

577
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,479
And you.

578
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,159
You.

579
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,760
Come out.

580
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:00,719
Hurry.

581
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,439
Hurry up.

582
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,040
To the wall. Now!

583
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,280
Hurry up.

584
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Listen up.

585
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:31,119
We need manpower now.

586
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,639
Now is your chance to redeem yourself.

587
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:36,600
If you won't work,

588
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,959
back to the water, you go.

589
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,240
Get them a new set of clothes.

590
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,119
Come.

591
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:54,399
Xin.

592
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,600
Bring them out.

593
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:25,320
Do you know how much it costs

594
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,399
to hire a hitman in Country F?

595
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,280
500 dollars.

596
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,479
How cheap it is!

597
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,119
500 dollars is all it takes

598
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,719
to ask a stranger

599
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,360
to kill someone for you.

600
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,360
But of course,

601
00:37:46,879 --> 00:37:50,560
I know our enemies are worth more than that.

602
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:52,000
Therefore,

603
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,959
I will offer ten times the bounty.

604
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:57,840
5,000 dollars.

605
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:00,280
Wei.

606
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,080
Tell the underground network

607
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,840
that one Chinese prosecutor

608
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,080
is worth 5,000 dollars.

609
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,760
They can come to me to claim the bounty.

610
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,800
Noted.

611
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:14,479
Oh,

612
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,159
if they manage to kill An Ni
or He Luyuan,

613
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,879
they will be paid
10,000 dollars instead.

614
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,000
Whether they are at the airport,

615
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,800
the bus station,

616
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,800
by the street, or in the embassy,

617
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,840
kill them when you see them.

618
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:30,879
Noted.

619
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,719
What are you doing?

620
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:48,679
No need to come with me.

621
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,719
We're old now.

622
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,000
As the CEO of Huiquan Corporation,
you have to keep yourself clean.

623
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,240
I always support your decision

624
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,280
but not this one.

625
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,439
I cannot stand there and do nothing

626
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:04,280
while you destroy your life.

627
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,080
Kai.

628
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,240
Kai!

629
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,479
What's the matter?

630
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,360
I feel nauseous from the water cell.

631
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,639
How troublesome. Keep up!

632
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:09,959
You.

633
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:11,080
Leave.

634
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:19,360
Kai!

635
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,199
Kai!

636
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,639
What are you doing?

637
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,240
Stop!

638
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,919
Move aside.

639
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:22,600
No!

640
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,879
The police cannot have the evidence.

641
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,119
Kai, we fattened those fools

642
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,479
for a few months now.

643
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,879
They will give us the money

644
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,119
in a few days.

645
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,439
We have earned enough money!

646
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,439
This is my last wish.

647
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,280
It's the final sprint.

648
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:43,679
Once this is over,

649
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,240
we will have made one billion yuan.

650
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,119
One billion, Kai.

651
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:49,360
How many generations

652
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,240
does it take to make that much money?

653
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:53,919
My last wish,

654
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,719
my dream, our dream,

655
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,959
will come true soon.

656
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,439
And I can deliver my promise to A.

657
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,399
It's A again.

658
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:07,760
Who is he?

659
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,159
Who is A?

660
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,919
You only think about him.

661
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,959
What about me?

662
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:13,479
Do I have a place in your heart?

663
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:20,679
Kai, you know very well

664
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,439
how much you mean to me.

665
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,959
Forgive me, please.

666
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,399
This is my last run.

667
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,439
I promise you.

668
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,199
Please.

669
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,399
Let me do it.

670
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:46,520
Kai?

671
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:48,000
It will be the death of you.

672
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:56,840
Farewell.

673
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:08,280
Farewell.

674
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,600
What's the matter, sweetie?

675
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
Yes.

676
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:24,040
You're so mean. You ignore me.

677
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,000
I miss you.

678
00:42:32,479 --> 00:42:34,360
You didn't click on the link

679
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,959
I told you to last time.

680
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,919
Play with me.

681
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,800
Oh, come on!

682
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,280
But you're so capable.

683
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,439
I know you can do it.

684
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,240
Yes, I'll show it to you.

685
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:55,719
I miss you.

686
00:42:55,879 --> 00:42:57,199
