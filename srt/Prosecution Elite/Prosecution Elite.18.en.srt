00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:41,912
I miss you.

16
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:43,393
You're the best.

17
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:46,192
You must listen to what I say.

18
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:47,393
You're so naughty.

19
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:52,592
It's time to go.

20
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,033
It's our team's turn to eat.

21
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:56,272
Let's get something to eat.

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,673
Time to eat.

23
00:01:59,512 --> 00:02:02,153
Dear, I have to go now.

24
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:03,713
I'm going out for a meal with the girls.

25
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,192
Bye-bye.

26
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:34,912
All of you better listen carefully.

27
00:02:35,593 --> 00:02:38,233
Boss said all of you have worked hard
for the past few days.

28
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:40,433
So she adds extra meat to your meals.

29
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,632
Now is the crucial moment.

30
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,233
Just hang in there for two more days

31
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:46,593
and reap the benefits.

32
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,433
It doesn't matter if you've covered

33
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:51,513
your training fees with the company,

34
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,752
as long as you've collected
the money yourself,

35
00:02:54,153 --> 00:02:57,112
you'll be rewarded with 20%.

36
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:58,912
You better work harder.

37
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,353
Do better and make more money!

38
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,793
Do your job and make money!

39
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,832
- Okay!
- Okay!

40
00:03:15,873 --> 00:03:17,832
Zhang, are you full?

41
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,552
To be honest, it's not enough.

42
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:24,433
Tell you what.

43
00:03:25,073 --> 00:03:26,073
Since I arrived here,

44
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:28,793
I've never had a full meal every day.

45
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:40,192
Do me a favor
and I promise you'll have a full meal

46
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:43,032
after the job is done.

47
00:03:50,073 --> 00:03:51,993
What do you want me to do for you?

48
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,752
They're watching me closely now.

49
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:01,313
You happen to be in charge
of taking out the trash every day.

50
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:04,153
Help me take something out.

51
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,112
If it succeeds,

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,313
not only you, but everyone here
will be able to escape.

53
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,513
Are you serious?

54
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:21,633
Okay.

55
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:23,352
Give it to me.

56
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:25,873
I'll take it out for you.

57
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:36,272
Or we can discuss it later after work.

58
00:04:36,993 --> 00:04:37,552
Okay.

59
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:03,352
I apologize for last night.

60
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:05,993
I was only concerned about myself

61
00:05:06,512 --> 00:05:07,792
and didn't consider your feelings.

62
00:05:09,713 --> 00:05:10,792
You must be annoyed by me, right?

63
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,913
Honestly, thank you.

64
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:20,193
I didn't expect
you would actually send me off.

65
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:21,633
I'm truly surprised.

66
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:22,352
Mr. Xiao,

67
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:27,193
I send you off to
apologize to you on behalf

68
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:28,313
of Captain He's reckless behavior.

69
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:30,873
There are no other emotions involved.

70
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,873
Please don't misunderstand.

71
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:33,873
I understand.

72
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:39,112
I feel very happy anyway.

73
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,873
Everyone, get out!

74
00:06:14,153 --> 00:06:15,873
Go back to your workstations. Hurry up.

75
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:20,792
Zhang Xiaobei, stay.

76
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:22,112
What's the matter?

77
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:23,352
What's the matter you say?

78
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,313
Zhang Xiaobei, you sure have guts.

79
00:06:27,552 --> 00:06:28,753
We caught you

80
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,593
and beat you up like this
after you escaped once.

81
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:33,392
You still have the guts
to play tricks with me?

82
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:38,633
Do you really think
I don't dare to kill you?

83
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,193
I don't understand what you're saying.

84
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,313
Cut the crap!

85
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:42,512
Hey, what are you doing?

86
00:06:43,552 --> 00:06:44,552
Shut up!

87
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:47,392
What is it?

88
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:48,272
I said shut up.

89
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,193
Where's the thing you said?

90
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:11,512
Search again.

91
00:07:11,993 --> 00:07:13,633
He really said it's on him.

92
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:16,072
By the way, see if it's in his mouth.

93
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,473
Zhang.

94
00:07:21,112 --> 00:07:22,112
Open your mouth.

95
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:35,512
There's nothing in there.

96
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:37,033
Are you messing with me?

97
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:38,913
No, I'm not.

98
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:41,913
I wouldn't dare to fool you
even if you let me.

99
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:42,993
By the way,

100
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,153
why don't...

101
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,232
Maybe he swallowed it.

102
00:07:47,272 --> 00:07:47,993
Zhang, why you...

103
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:50,112
Zhang, you were born to be a traitor.

104
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,552
So it was in your stomach.

105
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,193
Then I have to open you up
and take a look.

106
00:07:58,552 --> 00:07:59,352
I'll...

107
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,593
Step back! I said step back!

108
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,952
You want me to die, right?

109
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:12,433
Today, no one will escape.

110
00:08:12,832 --> 00:08:13,313
Step back!

111
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,112
Calm down.

112
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,593
Xiaobei, don't do this!

113
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,473
Xiaobei, I didn't mean to betray you.

114
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:24,352
I have a wife
and children waiting for me

115
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:27,552
to bring money back.

116
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:46,273
Let me do it.

117
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:47,393
It's okay.

118
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:49,273
Thank you.

119
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:50,633
Give it to me.

120
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:02,352
My visit this time is quite abrupt.

121
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:03,792
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

122
00:09:04,032 --> 00:09:04,633
Sorry about that.

123
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:06,873
Well, I can't deny that.

124
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:08,472
But I still want to thank you.

125
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:11,112
For what?

126
00:09:12,712 --> 00:09:13,712
I'm really useless.

127
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:15,313
I can't even express myself clearly.

128
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:23,032
Xiao Mu'en,
we have a huge gap between us.

129
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:25,513
I wanted to make things clear
when I returned home.

130
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:27,712
But since things have come to this,

131
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:29,712
I should tell you directly.

132
00:09:30,073 --> 00:09:30,953
We're not compatible.

133
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:45,552
Are you officially rejecting me?

134
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:46,792
Am I right?

135
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:52,393
Don't be too serious.

136
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,073
I think we're doing well as friends.

137
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,433
I understand.

138
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:08,112
Then...

139
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:11,592
Then I wish your work
will go smoothly here

140
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:12,993
and come home safely.

141
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:14,953
You too, have a safe journey.

142
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,112
Can't we hug each other?

143
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:36,433
Zhang Xiaobei,
you won't be able to escape!

144
00:10:36,712 --> 00:10:37,912
Enough with the nonsense!
Tell them to open the gates!

145
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:38,672
Open the gates!

146
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,592
Open the gates now! Open the gates!

147
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:43,273
Zhang Xiaobei,
you won't be able to escape!

148
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:43,953
Step back!

149
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:44,953
Don't come any closer!

150
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:45,792
Get lost!

151
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:46,672
Go away!

152
00:10:47,953 --> 00:10:48,633
Leave!

153
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:51,032
- Stop right there!
- Stop!

154
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:52,953
After him!

155
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:01,953
Stop right there!

156
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:13,152
You brat, where the hell did you go?

157
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:14,953
Help me.

158
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:16,633
Get in the car now!

159
00:11:17,712 --> 00:11:18,472
Stop right there!

160
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:21,792
Stop!

161
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:23,633
Stop!

162
00:11:28,472 --> 00:11:29,273
Don't be scared. It's the police.

163
00:11:29,552 --> 00:11:30,352
Madam, are you okay?

164
00:11:30,352 --> 00:11:31,352
Okay.

165
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:33,833
You...

166
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:35,472
You're injured.

167
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:37,032
Let me check if you're hurt elsewhere.

168
00:11:37,152 --> 00:11:38,152
Are you hurt anywhere else?

169
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:40,073
Help!

170
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:41,592
We need help!

171
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,352
Is this what you're looking for?

172
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,112
Thank you very much.

173
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:02,792
The surgery is over.

174
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:04,552
You can visit him in a while.

175
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:05,232
Okay.

176
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:12,232
What is it, Han Xuan?

177
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:14,552
Is An Ni hurt?

178
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:16,712
Which hospital?

179
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:23,032
Does it still hurt?

180
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:24,273
It's okay.

181
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:29,112
An Ni,

182
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:29,912
are you okay?

183
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:32,232
I'm fine. But Mr. Xiao is...

184
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:33,232
I'm okay too.

185
00:12:33,592 --> 00:12:35,193
Just a few stitches on a flesh wound.

186
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:36,993
I have to return to China today.

187
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:38,273
It was too much.

188
00:12:38,672 --> 00:12:39,792
I'll report this to the superior now

189
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:41,112
and ask them to coordinate
with the local police

190
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:42,552
and provide us
with additional manpower to assist us.

191
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:44,993
I'll send you to the airport later.

192
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:46,672
Okay, thank you.

193
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:52,393
This is a gift from Xiaobei.

194
00:13:14,633 --> 00:13:15,912
What can I do for you?

195
00:13:17,193 --> 00:13:17,993
Look at this.

196
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:23,352
Our witness risked his life
to record this.

197
00:13:24,073 --> 00:13:26,712
So I'd like to ask
if the Gambling Commission

198
00:13:26,753 --> 00:13:27,912
can tolerate Qian Tianxin's
continued illegal activities.

199
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,672
Apart from this,
I have bloodstains on my clothes too.

200
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:32,513
There should be videos
of the shooting incident

201
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:33,993
at the airport online.

202
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:34,833
All of these are evidence

203
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:36,232
of Qian Tianxin's crimes.

204
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:41,552
She even dares to harm
the police in Country F,

205
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:45,912
which led to the tragic death
of one officer and the injury of another.

206
00:13:46,753 --> 00:13:48,753
Therefore, the police department

207
00:13:48,792 --> 00:13:51,193
officially requests your cooperation

208
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:53,592
to immediately assist the authorities
in investigating these crimes.

209
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:55,792
We demand an immediate suspension

210
00:13:55,953 --> 00:14:00,193
of all gambling operations
by Qian Tianxin's company.

211
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:01,273
Immediately.

212
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,152
I said immediately.

213
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:06,592
Very well.

214
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:12,953
Hello?

215
00:14:14,592 --> 00:14:17,313
I regret to inform you that we've decided

216
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,792
to suspend your business for today

217
00:14:19,672 --> 00:14:20,552
due to some activities

218
00:14:20,552 --> 00:14:22,833
that were against Country F.

219
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:26,552
Moreover, if the company
was found performing illegally,

220
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:30,152
we'll permanently
cancel your gambling license.

221
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:31,552
Notice hereby given.

222
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:35,073
All done.

223
00:14:35,513 --> 00:14:36,513
She's all yours now.

226

we'll immediately report this
to our superiors

227
00:14:52,513 --> 00:14:54,393
and contact the relevant authorities
in Country F,

228

urging them to initiate
the arrest operation immediately.

as soon as possible.

Okay.

The mastermind
behind the killing of Officer Jose

234
00:15:36,753 --> 00:15:38,753
is Yang Wei, Qian Tianxin's subordinate.

235

to act lawlessly.

00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:47,273
Ni, this is the place
Zhang Xiaobei said.

263
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:50,192
Gonzalez, the detained Chinese citizens
should be downstairs

264
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:51,793
while the Chinese girls
who were deceived should be upstairs.

I need one team to follow me
and search the upper floor.

Do we need to use
the locksmith you asked me to find?

270
00:17:58,553 --> 00:17:59,112
Bring him here.

to switch off the computers.

please do not transfer any funds

were lured abroad,

and forced to harm
their fellow compatriots?

(Remote Video Conference Room)
a large portion of this increase

335
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:44,192
came from criminal groups

We can basically conclude

338
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:57,033
that Ms. Qian is
an important figure in this group.

339
00:22:59,673 --> 00:23:01,033
Now she can't escape.

340
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,673
The evidence is solid as a mountain.

341
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:07,072
However, things are not that simple.

342
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:12,153
Although Country F has caught

343
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,832
Qian Tianxin's tail.

344
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,112
But every country

345
00:23:16,153 --> 00:23:17,673
has different legal regulations.

346
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:20,033
Moreover, a group like this

347
00:23:20,712 --> 00:23:22,673
has already prepared a plan on how
to collude in their testimonies.

348
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:27,712
Therefore, it'll be challenging for
the local police

349
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:29,993
to obtain evidence through testimonies

350
00:23:30,553 --> 00:23:32,273
that corroborate each other.

351
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:35,952
Without key evidence,

352
00:23:36,393 --> 00:23:38,753
how do we convict and sentence them?

353
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:41,513
These are the major issues
the local police will face.

354
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:42,952
Even more challenging will be

355
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:49,432
how to successfully
extradite her to China for trial.

356
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:51,232
These are the significant problems

357
00:23:51,273 --> 00:23:52,993
we're about to face.

358
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,393
Prosecutor Guo,

359
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:57,312
I reminded An Ni about this matter.

360
00:23:57,913 --> 00:24:02,352
Our team has been collecting evidence
of Qian Tianxin's involvement

361
00:24:02,952 --> 00:24:04,072
in various major crimes

362
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:08,352
such as fraud, illegal online gambling,

363
00:24:08,432 --> 00:24:11,273
illegal fundraising,
illegal online loans,

364
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:15,913
illegal confinement,
and intentional harm.

365
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:20,993
However, the evidence
for illegal online gambling,

366
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:24,753
illegal fundraising, and illegal loans,

367
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:30,832
mostly comes from
Qian Tianxin's company servers.

368
00:24:30,952 --> 00:24:33,673
So whether we can convict Qian Tianxin

369
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:34,913
and what charges
can be brought against her

370
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,952
may ultimately depend on
what we can find on her servers

371
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,513
with the cooperation of
the Country F police.

372
00:24:48,513 --> 00:24:52,393
Hopefully, Han Xuan can perform well
at this critical moment.

373
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:35,673
Where are they?

374
00:25:36,312 --> 00:25:36,832
They're here.

375
00:25:49,472 --> 00:25:50,273
Don't be afraid.

376
00:25:50,393 --> 00:25:51,553
We're to take you home.

377
00:25:52,753 --> 00:25:53,592
Does anyone know

378
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:55,312
where are the abducted girls?

379
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:58,273
You don't know?

380
00:26:04,112 --> 00:26:05,393
I'm Zhang.

381
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:07,712
I want to atone for my wrongdoing.

382
00:26:08,273 --> 00:26:09,513
I betrayed Zhang Xiaobei.

383
00:26:10,472 --> 00:26:11,793
I'm willing to confess.

384
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:13,513
So you're Zhang.

385
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,033
We'll talk about that later.

386
00:26:18,232 --> 00:26:18,633
Lead the way.

387
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:20,072
Okay, I'm willing to cooperate.

388
00:26:20,592 --> 00:26:21,393
I'll cooperate.

389
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,232
Ms. Qian, game over.

390
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,832
The old game is over.

391
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:47,832
But the new game has just begun.

392
00:27:08,832 --> 00:27:09,513
Thank you.

393
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:12,312
Take her away.

394
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:28,993
It should be the fourth girl.

395
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:30,592
Yes.

396
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:33,352
Excuse me.

397
00:27:33,673 --> 00:27:34,352
Please come here for a moment.

398
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:39,153
You're Ying, right?

399
00:27:41,273 --> 00:27:42,192
I'm innocent.

400
00:27:43,513 --> 00:27:44,352
I did nothing wrong.

401
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:45,712
I was deceived.

402
00:27:46,472 --> 00:27:48,273
Zhang Xiaobei told us to find you.

403
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:50,432
How is he?

404
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:52,513
Is he hurt?

405
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,273
Say something.

406
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:57,832
He's at the hospital.

407
00:27:57,873 --> 00:27:59,753
He's not in any danger so don't worry.

408
00:28:01,993 --> 00:28:03,432
Thank you for telling me.

409
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:23,952
You must be An Ni.

410
00:28:24,793 --> 00:28:25,873
You look pretty decent.

411
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:28,232
I could imagine from your voice
a few days ago

412
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:32,112
that you should be a pretty cool girl.

413
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:35,072
It's just a pity.

414
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:36,312
How so?

415
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:42,712
A delicate girl like her
should be doing her nails,

416
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:44,432
eating ice cream,

417
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:45,993
and shopping in luxury stores.

418
00:28:46,472 --> 00:28:49,633
But now, she looks disheveled,

419
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:52,952
staying in the cheapest hotel
in Sanjiang City,

420
00:28:53,393 --> 00:28:55,112
playing with her life
in a foreign country.

421
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:58,393
I really feel sorry for her.

422
00:29:21,312 --> 00:29:22,432
Come on!

423
00:29:50,432 --> 00:29:51,592
Do you think she's A?

424
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:54,633
We'll find out the truth soon.

425
00:29:57,432 --> 00:29:59,393
Ni, everything has been handed over.

426
00:29:59,793 --> 00:30:01,472
Except for one server
that is already damaged.

427
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:03,673
All the conversation information
recorded on the remaining servers

428
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:06,753
and the database records
of fund flows are here.

429
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:09,753
Pack this data and send it back to China.

430
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:12,192
Let the tech team do the urgent repairs

431
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,393
and do a thorough analysis.

432
00:30:13,873 --> 00:30:16,832
Captain He, the Chinese citizen involved
in Qian Tianxin's company

433
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:18,393
will be sent to the Immigration Bureau
for detention.

434
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:20,072
Can you request to see
if we can communicate

435
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:21,393
with the local judicial department
on this matter?

436
00:30:21,793 --> 00:30:22,952
We must be present

437
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:23,952
when Chinese citizens
are being interrogated.

438
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:24,873
Okay.

439
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:25,913
Get in the car.

440
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:26,753
Come on, get in.

441
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,393
(Huiquan Corporation)

442
00:30:29,393 --> 00:30:32,393
Mr. Zhao, the framework development
for Huibo's new platform is complete.

443
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,472
We wanted to consult with you

444
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:35,952
about when we can launch it

445
00:30:36,513 --> 00:30:39,432
and if we should add
additional investment

446
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:40,712
and conduct some preliminary publicity.

447
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,312
It's also an opportunity

448
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:44,513
to turn around the negative impact

449
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,192
we've been facing
on social media lately.

450
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:47,753
- Also, I think...
- Where's Xiao Mu'en?

451
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,712
He should be the one reporting
on such an important matter.

452
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,472
Mr. Zhao, haven't you checked the news?

453
00:30:55,993 --> 00:30:58,432
When Mr. Xiao was on a holiday
in Country F,

454
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,873
he selflessly saves a female prosecutor

455
00:31:00,913 --> 00:31:01,993
from Jiangcheng Prosecution Office
at the airport,

456
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:04,033
bravely fought
against an armed criminal,

457
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,072
and subdued him.

458
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:06,673
He also got injured in the process.

459
00:31:06,913 --> 00:31:09,033
He's currently hospitalized

460
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:09,673
at Jiangcheng People's Hospital.

461
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:13,952
Mr. Zhao, we believe that
we can recommend him

462
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:16,033
as a heroic role model
who stands up for justice

463
00:31:16,592 --> 00:31:18,352
to the city authorities,
establishing him

464
00:31:18,553 --> 00:31:20,472
as a courageous
and model entrepreneur in our city.

465
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,393
What do you think?

466
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:22,832
Does the act of saving someone

467
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:27,393
have any connection to
our Huiquan Corporation's business?

468
00:31:34,112 --> 00:31:34,673
Come in.

469
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:40,913
Mr. Zhao, I apologize for being late.

470
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:41,232
Mr. Xiao.

471
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:42,352
Hello.

472
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,753
Are you recovering well
from your injury?

473
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:46,753
I'm fine.

474
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:49,232
Luckily, it was just a flesh wound
that didn't affect any muscles or bones.

475
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:51,192
The doctor said I just need
to rest for a while.

476
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:52,072
He insisted that I wear this.

477
00:31:55,192 --> 00:31:56,192
Mr. Zhao, I'm sorry.

478
00:31:56,513 --> 00:31:58,312
I'm the person in charge of the project.

479
00:31:58,633 --> 00:32:00,273
I should be the one to report to you.

480
00:32:00,592 --> 00:32:01,673
Let's get started then.

481
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:05,993
Suddenly, I don't feel
like discussing work today

482
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:09,033
Mr. Xiao, let's have a casual talk.

483
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:11,393
You two can leave.

484
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:12,312
Okay, Mr. Zhao.

485
00:32:13,873 --> 00:32:14,393
See you, Mr. Xiao.

486
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:16,153
Xiao, please sit.

487
00:32:18,832 --> 00:32:21,432
Mr. Zhao, what do you want
to talk about?

488
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:25,153
Ms. Li, please go in later.

489
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:27,352
Who's inside?

490
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:28,592
Who else?

491
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:30,192
Mr. Xiao, of course.

492
00:32:30,472 --> 00:32:32,712
I wonder what did he do
to offend Mr. Zhao.

493
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:36,513
Looks like it's going to be
a bloodbath today.

494
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:38,472
Okay, I understand.

495
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,432
Let's talk about personal relationships.

496
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:47,993
Tell you what.

497
00:32:48,153 --> 00:32:51,232
Li Yitang and I are getting married.

498
00:32:51,592 --> 00:32:52,072
Really?

499
00:32:52,952 --> 00:32:54,312
Mr. Zhao, congratulations.

500
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,033
Don't congratulate me too soon.

501
00:32:58,072 --> 00:32:58,952
What about you and An Ni?

502
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:03,952
I heard you went on a vacation
to Country F and performed a heroic act.

503
00:33:06,033 --> 00:33:07,072
Have you already captured

504
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:07,793
the heart of a beautiful woman?

505
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,513
An Ni is indeed impressive.

506
00:33:12,153 --> 00:33:14,112
Not only did she achieve great success

507
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:16,553
by crippling Qian Tianxin's
international criminal syndicate,

508
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:19,352
but she also proved the innocence

509
00:33:19,352 --> 00:33:21,393
of Huiquan Corporation at the same time.

510
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:25,753
It so happens that An Ni and Li Yitang
are close friends.

511
00:33:26,153 --> 00:33:28,673
How about we have a double celebration?

512
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,753
The four of us can get married
at the same time.

513
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:32,432
What do you think?

514
00:33:35,832 --> 00:33:40,472
Mr. Zhao,
An Ni's trip may not be a secret.

515
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,033
But how did you know

516
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:45,993
she was working on Qian Tianxin's case?

517
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:53,273
When I met her recently,

518
00:33:54,393 --> 00:33:58,712
she had never mentioned
a single thing about the case.

519
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:01,312
How did you find out?

520
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:08,432
It was just a guess on my part.

521
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:13,872
Li Yitang also mentioned

522
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:16,192
that An Ni is going on a business trip
to Country F.

523
00:34:18,152 --> 00:34:20,833
Naturally, I connected a few things.

524
00:34:28,073 --> 00:34:29,353
It can't be.

525
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:32,553
That can't be.

526
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:34,392
No way.

527
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:36,073
(Illegal activities related to Qian Tianxin)
This is impossible.

528
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,152
(Online gambling services data,
and illegal fund flows were not found)

529
00:34:37,152 --> 00:34:37,912
This couldn't be it.

530
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:40,073
What's wrong?

531
00:34:40,353 --> 00:34:41,793
The domestic tech team has responded.

532
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:43,993
They've checked
the conversation record downloaded

533
00:34:43,993 --> 00:34:44,952
from the server.

534
00:34:45,353 --> 00:34:46,593
It all points to locations
outside of China.

535
00:34:46,872 --> 00:34:50,353
They also said that
based on the data storage we provided,

536
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:52,073
there's no evidence of illegal funds

537
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:53,192
related to Qian Tianxin.

538
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,113
It's as clean as a blank sheet of paper.

539
00:34:55,753 --> 00:34:56,952
How is this possible?

540
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,392
Maybe they deleted it

541
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:02,073
the moment we barged in.

542
00:35:03,553 --> 00:35:04,793
That was what I thought at first.

543
00:35:05,073 --> 00:35:06,192
But it's completely impossible.

544
00:35:07,513 --> 00:35:07,912
Look at this.

545
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,472
(Intelligent Case Management System
Fund flow information)

546
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:10,033
It's the latest information
on the flow of funds.

547
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,113
It points to this server.

548
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:14,392
When did this happen?

549
00:35:16,833 --> 00:35:17,593
Five minutes ago.

550
00:35:18,353 --> 00:35:19,872
Five minutes ago?

551
00:35:20,632 --> 00:35:21,432
This can't be.

552
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,113
She is still at the police station.

553
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:26,033
Could it be that we've been targeting
the wrong person all this while?

554
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:28,793
Do you think Qian Tianxin is organizing

555
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:30,513
a team-building event
with hundreds of people in the building?

556
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:36,912
She must be involved.

557
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:39,152
Now, it depends on the progress
between An Ni

558
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,472
and the team led by Captain He.

559
00:35:41,793 --> 00:35:43,273
Aren't you going to say anything?

560
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:45,152
Did she tell you

561
00:35:45,432 --> 00:35:48,432
that the Chinese police
couldn't extradite you back to China

562
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:48,793
(Li Yong, from Yanzhou, Shandong)

563
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,073
due to a lack of evidence?

564
00:35:50,152 --> 00:35:51,993
Did she promise to share money with you?

565
00:35:52,513 --> 00:35:55,553
If you accept the money,
you'll be considered an accomplice.

566
00:35:57,872 --> 00:36:01,993
Officer, now that you know everything,

567
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:03,593
can you please stop pressuring me?

568
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:05,553
I was about to get married.

569
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:07,872
I wanted to earn more money

570
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:10,593
so that her parents would approve of me.

571
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:14,553
That's why I started gambling
with the Ivory Tower Lottery.

572
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:20,232
At first, I did make some money.

573
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:24,392
I remember making over a hundred thousand

574
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:25,872
in the first few days.

575
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,672
I even bought a car for my girlfriend.

576
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,392
But later, I wanted to make more money

577
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:37,472
for the down payment for a house
and things we need, you know?

578
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:39,800
But...

579
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,712
But when she found out
I was losing money,

580
00:36:59,273 --> 00:37:03,113
she returned the car
and used all her savings

581
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:04,392
to pay off my debts.

582
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:09,392
I promised her that I would stop playing.

583
00:37:12,113 --> 00:37:13,152
But you know what?

584
00:37:13,152 --> 00:37:13,672
I couldn't let it go.

585
00:37:14,593 --> 00:37:15,632
I wanted to recover my losses.

586
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,033
And eventually, I did recover my losses.

587
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,553
But I still couldn't let it go.

588
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,152
I wanted more so I...

589
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:35,993
And in the end, I lost everything.

590
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:38,313
I used to work
for a state-owned enterprise.

591
00:37:38,313 --> 00:37:39,192
(Zhao Bao, from Liuzhou, Guangxi)

592
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:40,793
I quickly rose to the position
of deputy section chief.

593
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:42,273
The leaders think highly of me.

594
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:44,313
I was the outstanding employee
of every year.

595
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:45,672
But so what?

596
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:49,553
I watched my friends around me

597
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:52,793
living in big cities
making big money one by one.

598
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:54,513
It made me feel resentful.

599
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,872
I know those women don't like me

600
00:37:58,273 --> 00:37:59,952
because my salary is too low.

601
00:38:00,353 --> 00:38:04,152
Later,
I met a woman on a social platform.

602
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,232
She didn't mind that I'm poor.

603
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,313
She even acknowledged my abilities.

604
00:38:09,432 --> 00:38:10,712
It's all lies.

605
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:11,872
(Zhang Jian, from Tongliao,
Inner Mongolia)

606
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,793
Everyone who comes here

607
00:38:13,273 --> 00:38:15,513
has been deceived and left with nothing,

608
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:17,392
desperate and trapped.

609
00:38:17,553 --> 00:38:22,593
My parents' money and
her parent's money.

610
00:38:25,033 --> 00:38:27,273
Money that belongs to my friends
and relatives is all gone.

611
00:38:28,753 --> 00:38:30,392
Debt collectors
were in the village after me,

612
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:32,753
harassing my parents to ask me for money.

613
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:36,952
I was scared to go home.

614
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:40,232
She said that there's a pattern
to gambling platforms.

615
00:38:40,593 --> 00:38:41,793
With my intelligence,

616
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:46,192
I can definitely find loopholes

617
00:38:46,273 --> 00:38:47,232
and make a big profit.

618
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:49,993
Big profit she said.

619
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:53,753
It's fine if it was just about
cheating money.

620
00:38:54,073 --> 00:38:54,672
Those who were cheated

621
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,513
would wake up and realize.

622
00:38:56,872 --> 00:39:00,192
But by combining fraud with gambling,

623
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:04,912
the victims unknowingly

624
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,353
sink deeper and deeper.

625
00:39:08,753 --> 00:39:09,833
My girlfriend constantly demanded

626
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:12,553
to break up with me.

627
00:39:14,993 --> 00:39:15,793
So I thought of going out

628
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:17,712
to make some money.

629
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:26,313
Later, I heard one could earn
40 to 50 thousand a month in Country F.

630
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:29,033
So I came here.

631
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:34,392
Then I met Qian Tianxin.

632
00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:37,472
I willingly handed over

633
00:39:37,952 --> 00:39:39,232
all my money to them.

634
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:41,113
When the money ran out,

635
00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:43,273
I resorted to borrowing.

636
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:46,033
But the lenders were also part
of their syndicate.

637
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:47,553
They deceive people online.

638
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:50,593
Then lured them to gamble.

639
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:52,353
When they lose,

640
00:39:53,192 --> 00:39:55,033
they go to their company for loans.

641
00:39:55,672 --> 00:39:56,553
They would squeeze out

642
00:39:57,152 --> 00:40:00,192
all your value
until there's nothing left.

643
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:02,513
A person only has one life.

644
00:40:02,672 --> 00:40:03,993
There are no second chances.

645
00:40:04,753 --> 00:40:06,793
Every time I think
of how things are now,

646
00:40:09,192 --> 00:40:10,432
I truly hate myself.

647
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:16,313
The ones I've let down the most
are my parents and myself.

648
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:22,392
If only I could go back in time,
how great would that be?

649
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:24,353
Now, I just hope

650
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,712
that those who are about
to get involved can open their eyes

651
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:33,313
and not turn their potentially
happy lives into this mess.

652
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:35,513
I really want to slap myself.

653
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:44,793
It's impossible to go back.

654
00:40:55,672 --> 00:40:58,472
It's impossible.

655
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:05,432
What are you thinking about?

656
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:10,712
I was thinking about the expressions
on their faces just now.

657
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,033
It's as if the deepest despair,

658
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:15,872
the most unforgettable memories,

659
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:17,472
and the most painful recollections

660
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:18,672
were all twisted together

661
00:41:18,672 --> 00:41:20,192
to create those expressions.

662
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:25,273
Honestly, after being a police officer
for so many years,

663
00:41:25,952 --> 00:41:29,113
it's the first time I've felt
such a heavy burden.

664
00:41:31,152 --> 00:41:33,872
Just now, when I saw them,

665
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:36,273
it was exactly as you described,

666
00:41:37,273 --> 00:41:38,793
a mixture of several emotions
entangled together.

667
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:43,912
Their testimonies are now
laid out in front of us.

668
00:41:44,593 --> 00:41:45,872
We must expedite the process

669
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:47,192
of extraditing Qian Tianxin
to the country

670
00:41:47,273 --> 00:41:49,912
through legal procedures It's urgent.

671
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:01,952
Unfortunately, I must apologize to you.

672
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,033
Does the judiciary department feel

673
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:07,793
that the evidence
is not yet sufficiently substantial?

674
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:11,073
It seems that we may not be able

675
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:12,232
to proceed with the extradition
at this point.

676
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,033
Just before you arrived,

677
00:42:15,593 --> 00:42:18,313
someone presented a signed guarantee

678
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:20,192
and a large bail amount

679
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:22,152
to bail Qian Tianxin out of jail.

680
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:22,872
What?

681
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:25,033
You heard that right.

682
00:42:25,712 --> 00:42:30,273
A man paid a bail of fifty million.

683
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:32,793
Who paid the money?

684
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:34,472
Her husband.

685
00:42:34,712 --> 00:42:35,472
Her husband?

686
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:37,833
Where did he suddenly come from?
