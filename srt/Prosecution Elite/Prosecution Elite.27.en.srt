15
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:40,669
Of course, not just her friends

16
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:42,749
and family will be hurt,

17
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:45,389
but the value system of society
will also be damaged.

18
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:48,948
If they think their actions

19
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:50,908
can make us change our mind
in eradicating cybercrime,

20
00:01:51,308 --> 00:01:52,989
they have the wrong idea.

21
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:56,109
The Internet isn't a lawless land.

22
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:00,308
They shouldn't try to cross the line.

23
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:04,228
Their provocations will only enhance

24
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,669
our determination
in eradicating cybercrime.

25
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:09,628
Of course, I also hope

26
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:13,748
that you guys can differentiate
between right and wrong

27
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,548
when you use the Internet.

28
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:19,149
When you meet online rumormongers
like them,

29
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:22,589
you can step up, stop them,

30
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:25,149
and save those gullible people.

31
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:29,989
It's getting late now.

32
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,468
I still have to work tomorrow.

33
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:34,589
That's all for today's live stream.

34
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:37,748
I hope you guys can differentiate
between right and wrong

35
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:38,869
when you use the Internet.

36
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:42,149
I also hope that I can
distinguish truth from falsehood

37
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:45,869
and find the answer when I work tomorrow.

38
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,100
(Repent and Reform)

39
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,188
We meet again.

40
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,108
You were pretty cooperative before this.

41
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:00,548
You acted like you wanted to confess.

42
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:02,949
We thought you were telling us the truth.

43
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:04,949
But ever since Hu Dewang

44
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:06,869
denied that you were A on the court,

45
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,989
you had a complete change of attitude.

46
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,028
To be honest,

47
00:03:11,668 --> 00:03:12,668
I never expected

48
00:03:13,429 --> 00:03:15,789
a woman like you,
who was unafraid of death,

49
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,188
shifty, and crafty,

50
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,149
to be affected by He Dewang's statement
in the court that heavily.

51
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,309
Qian Tianxin,

52
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,789
it's been a few months since I know you,

53
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,268
yet this is my first time

54
00:03:28,468 --> 00:03:29,748
seeing you lose your composure.

55
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:35,188
If you're here just to entertain yourself
on my expense,

56
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:36,789
I'm afraid

57
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:39,309
I have to disappoint you.

58
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:41,349
Not at all.

59
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,468
You spoke for the first time

60
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,509
after several days.

61
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:46,429
That means

62
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:48,748
we did get something out of today's interrogation.

63
00:03:49,789 --> 00:03:51,388
Let me be honest with you.

64
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:53,229
You won't be able

65
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:56,309
to protect A.

66
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:01,989
What are you saying?

67
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:04,908
What exactly are you trying to say?

68
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:06,989
If you don't understand what I'm saying,

69
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,309
I'll start from the beginning.

70
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:11,748
A person of Hu Dewang's level

71
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,748
can never find out
the true identity of A.

72
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:15,949
The more determined he is,

73
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:17,948
the easier it is
to know that he's lying.

74
00:04:18,309 --> 00:04:20,909
That means someone
is trying to protect you.

75
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,548
And you're trying to protect A.

76
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,469
Prosecutor An,

77
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:35,108
you won't be able to defeat me

78
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:37,029
by playing such mind games on me.

79
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,388
And,

80
00:04:39,228 --> 00:04:42,469
I've already said everything I needed to say.

81
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:43,388
Now,

82
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:45,388
I have nothing to tell you.

83
00:04:45,508 --> 00:04:47,989
I know you already confirmed with A

84
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,268
about the things you can and cannot say

85
00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:51,749
after getting arrested.

86
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:54,068
But even if you guys are 100% ready for this,

87
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,989
who can ensure that
no mistakes will happen?

88
00:04:57,989 --> 00:04:59,548
For example, a few days ago,

89
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,948
the police arrested people

90
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:03,869
who slandered
the late Zhang Wanru online.

91
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,388
The strange thing is

92
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,629
that this person has nothing to do
with Case 7·23

93
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,709
or any cybercrime related to fraud.

94
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:14,709
However, he knows certain details in Case 7·23.

95
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,869
I'm not sure why this person

96
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,189
would commit such a careless mistake

97
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:19,989
during such a crucial moment.

98
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,068
The most logical explanation is

99
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,548
that he's flustered.

100
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,388
He's panicking.

101
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:28,309
It's because the person
most important to him

102
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,508
has been detained.

103
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:33,989
And, I have a hunch.

104
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:38,869
This person is very close to us.

105
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,508
Maybe he's right under our noses.

106
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,709
I have no idea
what you're trying to get here.

107
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,469
An Ni, actually,

108
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:54,469
you just witnessed the death of Zhang Wanru.

109
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:58,548
You've been tortured and traumatized

110
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:01,388
by that scene all these years.

111
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:04,149
That's why you're paranoid.

112
00:06:04,348 --> 00:06:06,309
You always think
that things aren't over yet.

113
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,788
You always think that
there's a mastermind behind everything.

114
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,589
You wish to give Zhang Wanru
an explanation.

115
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:13,668
But that's not the case.

116
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:16,909
This is just an illusion

117
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,508
created by your inner demon.

118
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:24,228
The person you're looking for doesn't exist.

119
00:06:28,108 --> 00:06:31,629
Whether this person exists or not,

120
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:35,189
the People's Procuratorate will
definitely get to the bottom of this.

121
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,189
What you need to do is to eat well,

122
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,189
sleep well, stay alive,

123
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:41,429
and cooperate with us.

124
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,709
I will interrogate you again.

125
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,788
No matter how many times you come,

126
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:50,508
I'll tell you this.

127
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,589
The result will be the same.

128
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,948
Don't think that
you're torturing me here.

129
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:56,469
Actually,

130
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:59,268
you're just torturing yourself.

131
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:00,469
You just want to defeat

132
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:02,749
the imaginary foe you imagined.

133
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:04,788
That's fine.

134
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,189
You can go ahead.

135
00:07:06,388 --> 00:07:07,869
But I will tell you this.

136
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:10,469
You will achieve nothing in the end.

137
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:18,348
Let's just wait and see

138
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:20,749
if I'll achieve nothing or not.

139
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:30,629
You won't object to it

140
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,228
if I resign from Huiquan, right?

141
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,149
You were doing well.

142
00:07:37,429 --> 00:07:38,749
You're famous and wealthy now.

143
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,068
Why are you trying to resign?

144
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:45,429
It's nothing.

145
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:49,029
I'm just tired.

146
00:07:51,268 --> 00:07:53,788
The online industry is an innovative industry.

147
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:57,388
Sometimes, I think
I can't figure it out.

148
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,068
It's too complex.

149
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:03,189
Even a person like you
thinks it's complex?

150
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:06,388
Don't you think the situation
is a little pessimistic?

151
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:10,309
Don't overthink it.

152
00:08:11,388 --> 00:08:13,788
I'm just expressing my sentiment.

153
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:17,749
No matter what you do,

154
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:20,268
I'll always support you.

155
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,828
Why are you only here now?

156
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:27,909
Do you think this is my firm?

157
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,948
Visiting you requires
a series of complex procedures.

158
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,228
I have to apply for it
and wait for it to be approved.

159
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,028
And, in your circumstances,

160
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:37,389
we should be grateful that
we're allowed to meet here.

161
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,069
Mr. Wu,

162
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,309
please tell my husband

163
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:42,788
that I miss him.

164
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,108
Tell him to return to our house

165
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,309
and check out its condition.

166
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,708
Tell him to take care of the house.

167
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:48,588
Ms. Qian, we can skip that.

168
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:49,468
I'm here today

169
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:51,749
to discuss your case with you.

170
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:54,228
Mr. Wu, please tell my husband

171
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:56,389
that I'm suffering in here.

172
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,028
I've already confessed to my crime.

173
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,389
However, Prosecutor An,
who's in charge of my case,

174
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:01,189
has no intention of letting me off.

175
00:09:01,429 --> 00:09:02,708
I don't understand why.

176
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,228
If this continues,

177
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:07,548
I will never be out of here.

178
00:09:07,869 --> 00:09:09,788
And, tell him

179
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:11,908
that I suspect someone out there
is trying to frame me.

180
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,668
Someone is trying to frame you?

181
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,069
Mr. Wu, I know you're a good lawyer.

182
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:20,228
I'm sure you don't want me
to suffer in here.

183
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:20,829
Of course.

184
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,509
I'm doing my best to fight for your interests.

185
00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:26,069
Why did you confess your crime?

186
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:28,708
Do you know things have become
difficult for me?

187
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:29,228
You need to know

188
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:30,788
that this concerns more than you.

189
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:31,829
This concerns me too.

190
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:32,429
Fine.

191
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,069
If you truly mean well,

192
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:35,348
remember to pass my message

193
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:36,949
to my husband when you go outside.

194
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:37,348
No problem.

195
00:09:37,389 --> 00:09:38,389
You mustn't leave out a single word.

196
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:39,908
I can pass the message for you.

197
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:41,509
However, I still need to tell you this.

198
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,069
I hope you won't give up yet.

199
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:45,668
Mr. Wu, listen closely.

200
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:47,588
Just pass the message to him.

201
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:50,189
This is vital to me.

202
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,668
No problem. Just don't give up.

203
00:10:01,588 --> 00:10:05,189
How's the progress during the trip?

204
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,788
This time, it's pretty tough.

205
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:11,908
The other party

206
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,869
came up with some tricky questions.

207
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:15,829
Chairman,

208
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,269
since we're using a live stream
to proceed with our financing,

209
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,668
why don't we let Xiao Mu'en do it?

210
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:26,829
So, even a CEO like you

211
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,189
has produced no result?

212
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,348
Fine.

213
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:32,989
I can never count on you

214
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:34,269
during crucial moments.

215
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,348
However, you have to at least
keep an eye on the game for us.

216
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,348
Nothing must go wrong.

217
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:42,989
Yes, I understand.

218
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,348
But Chairman,

219
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,468
all of those were just baseless rumors.

220
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:47,580
You shouldn't believe in them.

221
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,788
Moreover, that man was never up to anything good.

222
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,509
Maybe he's using that to blackmail us

223
00:10:54,548 --> 00:10:55,668
so that he can raise the price.

224
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:57,548
What?

225
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,468
Chairman, you look unwell lately.

226
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,949
I bought you some tonics.

227
00:11:09,908 --> 00:11:11,429
Zhao Jikai,

228
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:14,108
you're only capable of useless things.

229
00:11:16,668 --> 00:11:18,228
What can I say about you?

230
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:19,989
You had a good hand,

231
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:21,468
yet you made a mess of it.

232
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:24,069
Those who are truly capable

233
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,108
can turn a bad hand

234
00:11:26,108 --> 00:11:27,269
into a good one.

235
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:30,468
You can't just be satisfied with

236
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:31,228
your low standards, right?

237
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,429
You're right.

238
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:38,269
So,

239
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:39,908
Chairman,

240
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,869
regarding our financing...

241
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,148
Regarding our financing,

242
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:46,908
I'll ask Xiao Mu'en to do it.

243
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,269
After all, he's more familiar

244
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:53,348
and professional with Huibo.

245
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:55,228
Yes, sir.

246
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,548
I understand.

247
00:11:56,588 --> 00:11:58,389
If so, Chairman, I'll make a move first.

248
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,069
Alright.

249
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,028
The last dish is ready.

250
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,269
Captain He, you're something else.

251
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:20,548
Not only can you arrest criminals,

252
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:22,189
but you're also a great cook.

253
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:23,949
It depends on the person
visiting my house.

254
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,189
Let me try.

255
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:31,228
Hey, you are a fine young lady.

256
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:33,949
But why do you act like men?

257
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:35,548
Is this your first day knowing me?

258
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:37,468
Every day is just like the first.

259
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:38,629
What did you say?

260
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,028
Xiaobei, time to eat.

261
00:12:48,189 --> 00:12:49,228
This is pretty good.

262
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,108
Try it.

263
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:55,989
Xiaobei, what's on your mind?
You were absorbed in your thoughts.

264
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:57,908
Thanks.

265
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:59,869
I've been thinking about

266
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:01,908
what went wrong.

267
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,028
What was the kidnapper up to?

268
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:06,348
I've already turned off
the headset function

269
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:07,309
on my phone.

270
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:08,829
I even disassembled my phone.

271
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,108
I was thinking that

272
00:13:10,148 --> 00:13:11,348
there might be a tapping device inside.

273
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:12,548
It's too much of a coincidence.

274
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:13,749
Just when I was about to find An Ni,

275
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:15,509
they lured me away.

276
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:17,429
Say, did you think they were
targeting me all along?

277
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,829
Or was I just unlucky?

278
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:21,148
I'm penniless. Why did they kidnap me?

279
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,348
This is what I think.

280
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:27,668
You're an important witness
to Qian Tianxin's case.

281
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:29,468
Her trial was suspended halfway through.

282
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:30,588
I'm sure their men

283
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,309
were stirring up trouble out there.

284
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,429
This is a possibility.

285
00:13:35,028 --> 00:13:36,629
Second, you need to think about this.

286
00:13:36,668 --> 00:13:40,228
Have you ever offended anyone unknowingly

287
00:13:40,228 --> 00:13:42,348
after you returned from Country F?

288
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:45,509
There's one more thing.

289
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:46,429
The time he was kidnapped

290
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:48,509
coincided with the time when someone

291
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:50,148
tried to slander his sister online.

292
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:51,788
It's too much of a coincidence.

293
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:53,629
I think they should be related.

294
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:59,069
Who else knew that you were looking for me?

295
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,108
It can't possibly be him.

296
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:02,148
Who?

297
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,069
Danan.

298
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:04,108
It can't be him.

299
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:05,468
He tells no secrets.

300
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:08,389
Oh yeah.

301
00:14:09,069 --> 00:14:11,269
It must be Luo Xiaoting.

302
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,069
Xiaoting?

303
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:20,749
Just listen to me.

304
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:22,949
(Luo Xiaoting)
(Hello, Zhang Xiaobei?)

305
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,668
You finally appeared.

306
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:26,389
I was worried that you might be down

307
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,668
when you heard...

308
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,348
(Luo Xiaoting.)

309
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:28,989
(Let me ask you something.)

310
00:14:29,028 --> 00:14:29,908
(You looked for me, right?)

311
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,548
(Did you know
where I was going back then?)

312
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:32,389
I...

313
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:34,269
I heard from you

314
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:35,908
that you were going to look for An Ni.

315
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,389
Good, you admitted it.
Did you tell anyone about it?

316
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:40,708
(Why are you being so fierce?)

317
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:42,708
I have to confirm something.

318
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,069
This is important to me.

319
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,829
It's all because of you.

320
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,108
(After we parted ways, I texted my father.)

321
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:52,269
(I asked him if there was something wrong
with Huiquan Games.)

322
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:54,348
What did he say?

323
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,429
He had no idea too.

324
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,548
(What's the matter? Did something happen?)

325
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,908
It's nothing. I just want to see

326
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:02,668
(how many people know)

327
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:04,228
(that I was going to stop
my collaboration with Huiquan Games.)

328
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:06,028
After all, I didn't
announce it personally.

329
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:08,949
I still have time to regret my decision.

330
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,588
Where are you right now?
I'll look for you.

331
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:15,908
I'm sure you know about
the incident with my sister too.

332
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,509
I have to focus on it right now.

333
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:18,548
Alright. See you.

334
00:15:19,028 --> 00:15:19,949
It's better if I don't.

335
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:21,749
Hello?

336
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,668
How could you speak to her like that?

337
00:15:28,468 --> 00:15:30,348
Luo Jiangxiao, and Huiquan,

338
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:32,028
seems like they're my kidnappers.

339
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:34,069
If not, why would I be kidnapped right

340
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:35,829
after Luo Xiaoting texted her father?

341
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:40,788
Xiaoting was just concerned about you.

342
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,468
Maybe this is just a coincidence.

343
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:44,509
And, it might not necessarily
be Huiquan.

344
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,309
It should be a coincidence.

345
00:15:46,788 --> 00:15:47,869
Let's dig in first.

346
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,309
We can talk after the meal.

347
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:51,069
Let's dig in.

348
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,664
(I received online loan advertisements too.)

349
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,840
(Has Tiejun and the rest replied to you?
Did they receive it?)

350
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:38,348
Are you heading to work?

351
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:41,548
Mr. Luo.

352
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:44,309
What are you doing here?

353
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:45,389
Why aren't you upstairs?

354
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:46,269
I don't need to go upstairs.

355
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:47,908
I'm waiting for you.

356
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,148
Actually, I wanted to
look for you yesterday.

357
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:51,708
But it was too late.

358
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,548
I didn't come to see you
as I was afraid I might bother you.

359
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,189
An Ni,

360
00:16:55,588 --> 00:16:56,949
if you have any emergencies,

361
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:58,468
you can call me in the future.

362
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,189
My phone is on 24/7 now.

363
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,909
Mr. Luo, not only are you working for
Huiquan,

364
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,149
but you've also readjusted your life
because of it.

365
00:17:07,188 --> 00:17:08,389
You've changed a lot indeed.

366
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,308
You can cut to the chase.

367
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,428
It's like this.

368
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:18,108
I waited for you here
early in the morning

369
00:17:18,188 --> 00:17:20,068
because I didn't want Xiaoting to know.

370
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,149
And, I have an ulterior motive.

371
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,828
I hope you can tell me some details personally.

372
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:26,588
So,

373
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:27,948
do you know that Xiaobei

374
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:30,269
already knows that something's wrong
with Huiquan Games?

375
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,828
He refused to collaborate with the company
even though I arranged it for him.

376
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:36,509
This...

377
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:38,708
Is this matter very serious?

378
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:39,549
If so,

379
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:41,708
have you reported this to Huiquan?

380
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:44,188
I'm Huiquan's PR consultant.

381
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,149
Of course I have to be responsible.

382
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:47,708
I was the person

383
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:50,228
who suggested our company to
collaborate with Zhang Xiaobei.

384
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:53,108
I have to be responsible
for both parties and myself.

385
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:53,789
Wait.

386
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:54,669
Is there something wrong with that?

387
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:55,989
Is it a crime

388
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:57,588
to figure out whether Zhang Xiaobei

389
00:17:57,629 --> 00:17:58,869
was telling the truth or not?

390
00:17:59,068 --> 00:17:59,669
Mr. Luo,

391
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:02,428
you can digest that all by yourself

392
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,348
without reporting it
to Huiquan Corporation first.

393
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,228
Isn't asking Chairman Yin

394
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,509
the easiest way for me?

395
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:11,749
Mr. Luo,

396
00:18:12,948 --> 00:18:14,468
something happened to Zhang Xiaobei.

397
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:15,669
What?

398
00:18:16,749 --> 00:18:18,308
Seems like you have no idea.

399
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:20,468
Wait.

400
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:26,428
Are you trying to tell me

401
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:28,389
that you're suspecting Huiquan

402
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,708
or Chairman Yin?

403
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:32,749
Mr. Luo,

404
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,228
as the PR consultant of
Huiquan Corporation,

405
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:36,749
from a certain standpoint,

406
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,389
you cannot inquire details from me.

407
00:18:38,588 --> 00:18:39,708
I cannot tell you anything

408
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,669
even if I do know them to a certain extent.

409
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,428
I've never thought about it.

410
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:46,029
And, I've never forgotten about

411
00:18:46,348 --> 00:18:48,588
what you told me before.

412
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,068
Mr. Luo, let me put it this way.

413
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,749
I've always treated you
as my life coach.

414
00:18:55,188 --> 00:18:57,869
In the past, you told me
which path to take

415
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:59,108
and where to go.

416
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,629
I hope you can think about this clearly.

417
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:04,948
As my life coach,

418
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:09,509
if you know something or have clues

419
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:10,708
regarding the ongoing investigation,

420
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:12,869
please tell me about it.

421
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:22,828
It's like this.

422
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,389
That day, Chairman Yin and I

423
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:28,389
were entertaining some clients.

424
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:31,068
Suddenly, Xiaoting called me.

425
00:19:31,428 --> 00:19:32,308
She said

426
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:36,068
Zhang Xiaobei wanted to stop
collaborating with Huiquan.

427
00:19:37,749 --> 00:19:38,549
Today,

428
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:41,708
Mr. Zhang and I have drunk a lot.

429
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:42,228
Yeah.

430
00:19:42,269 --> 00:19:43,269
I can tell.

431
00:19:44,188 --> 00:19:46,188
We're doing it for the company's sake.

432
00:19:46,989 --> 00:19:49,228
We have to entertain them like this every day.

433
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,629
Yeah.

434
00:19:50,828 --> 00:19:52,308
Mr. Zhang was very passionate too.

435
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:53,389
Yeah.

436
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:55,989
I drank a few more drinks with him
because of that.

437
00:19:57,068 --> 00:19:58,948
Have a seat. I'll make some tea.

438
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:04,188
Have you called all of them?

439
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:05,708
I have.

440
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:07,869
Mr. Zhao said he would be going on
a business trip this afternoon.

441
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:09,549
He's packing his luggage.

442
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:11,068
Mr. Xiao should be arriving soon.

443
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,308
Urge them to come.

444
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,509
Youngsters nowadays

445
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,948
love to drag things out.

446
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:23,549
Chairman.

447
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:24,828
Mr. Luo.

448
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:25,389
Mu'en.

449
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:26,149
Were you looking for me?

450
00:20:26,428 --> 00:20:27,029
Come.

451
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:27,669
Have a seat.

452
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:28,068
Okay.

453
00:20:30,828 --> 00:20:31,629
Mu'en,

454
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:34,828
I saw you working hard

455
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,228
on the products
we're developing right now.

456
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:39,468
I appreciate your effort.

457
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,549
After this,

458
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:42,869
I'll tell the company
to give you a long vacation.

459
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:46,549
You can take a break and rest well.

460
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:48,149
Thank you, Chairman.

461
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:49,509
It's my job.

462
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,029
I heard from Mr. Luo

463
00:20:51,228 --> 00:20:52,629
that you were going to hold
an emergency meeting.

464
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:54,629
Did something happen?

465
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:56,708
Wait.

466
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,468
Zhao Jikai.

467
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:00,989
Call him.

468
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,629
Okay.

469
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:07,068
Mu'en,

470
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:09,828
I have something to discuss with you.

471
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:12,869
Regarding Zhang Xiaobei's collaboration
with Huiquan Games,

472
00:21:12,948 --> 00:21:13,989
I think the deal is off.

473
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:17,468
You have to prepare a backup plan.

474
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:18,789
You need to find someone

475
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:20,549
who can take over his spot

476
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:21,869
as a live streamer.

477
00:21:23,389 --> 00:21:24,269
What happened?

478
00:21:24,308 --> 00:21:25,428
I thought he already...

479
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:27,909
I'll tell you

480
00:21:27,989 --> 00:21:30,708
when Zhao Jikai is here.

481
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,348
It's all his fault.

482
00:21:36,468 --> 00:21:37,269
Chairman,

483
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:41,428
although Zhang Xiaobei
isn't a professional gamer,

484
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,828
and he's not skillful enough,

485
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:45,428
we considered collaborating with him

486
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:48,749
because he could help us promote our platform

487
00:21:48,948 --> 00:21:50,708
and improve our popularity.

488
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:52,509
We wanted to use him

489
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,269
to earn back some credibility

490
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:57,989
and promote the new games we launched for free.

491
00:21:58,389 --> 00:21:59,989
I don't think there are many people

492
00:22:00,428 --> 00:22:01,348
who can replace him.

493
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,549
Mr. Xiao,

494
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,108
you don't need to worry about that.

495
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:08,549
I'll deal with that.

496
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:11,308
Don't worry. You just need to focus on

497
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:12,869
the development of the games

498
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:15,269
and find popular live streamers
for the company.

499
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,669
I'll deal with the rest.

500
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,549
Okay, I'll try to think of something

501
00:22:21,188 --> 00:22:22,269
when I go back.

502
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:24,989
Chairman.

503
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:27,669
- Mr. Zhao.
- Mr. Luo.

504
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:28,948
You even gave me a silent riddle
on the phone.

505
00:22:28,989 --> 00:22:29,828
What's going on here?

506
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:32,149
Chairman is looking for you.

507
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:33,308
Come.

508
00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:34,348
Have a seat.

509
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,108
Everyone is here.

510
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:44,468
Let's begin the meeting.

511
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:46,948
Zhao Jikai,

512
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:51,108
how did you manage the Gaming Division?

513
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:53,149
The new games that were just launched

514
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,869
were reported for violating the rules.

515
00:22:56,068 --> 00:22:57,149
What's going on?

516
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,428
Chairman,

517
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:03,708
from the game's design to its marketing,

518
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:07,188
every step was performed by professional members
of different departments.

519
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:10,269
And, we even adopted
a hierarchical approval approach

520
00:23:10,749 --> 00:23:11,749
and monitor our games 24/7.

521
00:23:12,389 --> 00:23:13,588
Logically speaking, our games

522
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,509
should be fine.

523
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:18,828
Is someone trying to sabotage us?

524
00:23:19,188 --> 00:23:19,789
Luo,

525
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:21,708
tell him what's going on.

526
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:23,948
It's like this.

527
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:27,509
We were going to collaborate
with Zhang Xiaobei before this.

528
00:23:27,629 --> 00:23:29,068
Everyone knows about that.

529
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,989
But now, Zhang Xiaobei
is calling off the deal.

530
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,989
He said there was something wrong
with our game.

531
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:36,909
It's him again.

532
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:39,428
I knew the deal wouldn't succeed.

533
00:23:40,989 --> 00:23:43,068
You guys were pretty positive
about the deal before this.

534
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:44,348
That's why I didn't say anything.

535
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:46,348
Regarding the kind of person
Zhang Xiaobei is

536
00:23:46,428 --> 00:23:47,749
and the things that he's done,

537
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:48,989
I'm sure you guys know that well.

538
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:52,108
Didn't Zhang Xiaobei tell you

539
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:53,068
what was wrong with our games?

540
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:54,948
He didn't.

541
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:56,909
Mr. Yin,

542
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,308
Mr. Zhao is right.

543
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,029
Games developed by Huiquan
have to go through a series of

544
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:03,708
strict approval process
before they could be launched.

545
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:06,348
After what happened to Shi Xiaohu,

546
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:08,468
the approval process
is even stricter now.

547
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:10,708
Before the games were launched,

548
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:13,029
the user's interests were considered,

549
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:14,828
and any responsibilities
related to the company were avoided.

550
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:16,789
From that perspective,

551
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,828
our games should be fine.

552
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:21,029
However, Zhang Xiaobei
said he had evidence.

553
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:24,629
He even said he would report the issue
to An Ni of The People's Procuratorate.

554
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,068
So this...

555
00:24:26,068 --> 00:24:29,228
Since Zhang Xiaobei never told us
the issues he faced

556
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:30,549
when he played our games,

557
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,348
I believe

558
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,108
that he's the troublemaker here.

559
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,269
That's a possibility.

560
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:40,629
Chairman.

561
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:41,869
Mr. Zhao.

562
00:24:42,468 --> 00:24:43,428
In my opinion,

563
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:45,828
why don't we put this aside first?

564
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:47,509
Now, we've already announced

565
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,068
that we'll add a new gaming sector

566
00:24:49,308 --> 00:24:50,948
to our live stream service.

567
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:53,348
And, our new games have been launched.

568
00:24:53,468 --> 00:24:54,708
We cannot allow this hiccup

569
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,068
to affect our entire plan.

570
00:24:56,468 --> 00:24:58,468
Even if there's any issue in the future,

571
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:01,588
we can wait until we receive
the higher-ups' notice

572
00:25:01,588 --> 00:25:03,828
before we proceed to rectify them.

573
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,948
There's no need to wait.

574
00:25:06,428 --> 00:25:07,228
Chairman,

575
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:09,749
I can arrange my men to put off their work

576
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:11,428
and proceed with
a self-reflection session.

577
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:15,068
Wait.

578
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:19,428
I thought you were going to meet

579
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:21,428
several capable entrepreneurs
this afternoon?

580
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:23,588
Chairman,

581
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:25,188
you're more concerned about

582
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:26,909
Zhang Xiaobei's matter, right?

583
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:28,909
I can call them

584
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:30,909
and postpone our meeting.

585
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:37,228
Mr. Zhao.

586
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:39,629
I think

587
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:42,149
you should proceed with your work.

588
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:45,348
The Technology Department
can deal with the games.

589
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:49,708
Chairman, what do you think?

590
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:51,308
That's fine.

591
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:53,989
Meeting dismissed.

592
00:25:57,869 --> 00:25:58,549
Alright.

593
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,948
I understand the gist of it now.

594
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:02,989
Mr. Luo,

595
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,348
I'll say this again.

596
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:06,629
You said you have a bottom line
when it comes to your occupation.

597
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:08,428
However, as a law practitioner,

598
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:10,228
you have the right to uphold justice

599
00:26:10,228 --> 00:26:11,549
and protect the bottom line of law.

600
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:13,948
I hope you can tell me about
the details you know

601
00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:16,269
without crossing your bottom line.

602
00:26:23,828 --> 00:26:24,188
Mr. Luo.

603
00:26:24,188 --> 00:26:24,869
Go ahead.

604
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:26,509
I need to head to work now.

605
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:28,068
Alright. Mr. Luo, take care.

606
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:28,389
Okay.

607
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:32,269
Han Xuan.

608
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,308
Got it. I'll be there in a second.

609
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,070
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

610
00:26:40,188 --> 00:26:40,789
Prosecutor Guo,

611
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,149
these are the details we obtained

612
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,588
after analyzing Huiquan's products.

613
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:44,389
Take a look.

614
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:47,708
Prosecutor Guo,

615
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,000
(Superficial Issues of Huiquan Product, Summary
Report, Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

616
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,108
I made a PowerPoint slide.

617
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:51,428
I listed the appearance issues

618
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,549
that are related to Huiquan's products.

619
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:55,669
Look.

620
00:26:56,468 --> 00:26:57,869
I asked my buddy

621
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:59,108
to look for gamers of different age

622
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:00,948
and occupation to do the test.

623
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:03,549
The first conclusion we obtained was

624
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:05,669
the screening principle
under the trigger mechanism.

625
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:06,549
I also played

626
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:08,308
the new games developed
by their company.

627
00:27:08,428 --> 00:27:10,068
Their games have a common issue.

628
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,909
Players must top up their accounts

629
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:13,708
within a certain time limit.

630
00:27:13,948 --> 00:27:16,068
And, these users must be new users.

631
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,828
These games allow

632
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:19,269
the players to choose

633
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:20,468
their interactions freely.

634
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:22,789
When players do so,

635
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:24,509
they might have filtered out the people

636
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:26,149
who might provide

637
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,909
illegal P2P lending services

638
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:28,588
and texted the players.

639
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:30,389
As for how they texted them,

640
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:31,308
we have to check the terminal server

641
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:32,588
of Huiquan Corporation.

642
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:35,669
This is hard to detect indeed.

643
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,428
And, this game has no issues whatsoever.

644
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:43,869
This is a complicated program and setting.

645
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:45,588
It can never be done without

646
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:46,869
the participation of members

647
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:48,509
related to the core program itself.

648
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:49,909
And, I think

649
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:51,509
the settings in Huiquan Games

650
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:53,108
are just like the scripts
fraud syndicates have.

651
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:54,909
Those who have studied psychology

652
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:57,108
and behavior analysis
must've checked it for them.

653
00:27:57,188 --> 00:27:58,068
This way, we couldn't tell

654
00:27:58,108 --> 00:28:00,188
that Huiquan was
going against the rules.

655
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:02,989
But after Han Xuan's discovery,

656
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:04,789
we know that Huiquan

657
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:07,549
went against the law by filtering out
users' details and personal details.

658
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,029
They even used the details they obtained
to send illegal texts to them

659
00:28:10,068 --> 00:28:11,549
in an attempt to make illegal profit.

660
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:14,749
Prosecutor Guo,

661
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:16,669
according to the information source
we obtained,

662
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:17,909
everything is pointing toward

663
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:18,948
Huiquan Corporation's terminal server.

664
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:28,428
If so, someone working for

665
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:32,509
Huiquan Corporation

666
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:35,468
is suspected of unauthorized us
of personal information.

667
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:39,468
So, we discovered clues

668
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,869
related to a cybercrime committed
on online games

669
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:44,669
unknowingly while investigating
Qian Tianxin's case.

670
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,348
What about this? You guys

671
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:49,909
can send this new clue

672
00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:51,509
to the Public Security Organs.

673
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:54,308
As this case is hugely influential toward society,

674
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:57,068
we suggest the Public Security Organs
to do an investigation immediately

675
00:28:57,308 --> 00:28:58,789
and obtain evidence
from Huiquan Corporation.

676
00:28:58,869 --> 00:28:59,669
Understood, Prosecutor Guo.

677
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,660
(Huiquan Group)

678
00:29:08,188 --> 00:29:08,789
The Police are here.

679
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:10,509
Regarding this...

680
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:11,588
Mr. Luo.

681
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:12,708
The Police are here.

682
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:14,068
The Police are here.

683
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,789
Excuse me. Do you need anything?

684
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:19,509
Police at work.

685
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:21,708
Hello, Captain He.

686
00:29:21,749 --> 00:29:22,549
Hello, Professor Luo.

687
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:24,348
This is our search warrant.

688
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:25,228
We need to do a search

689
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:27,029
in the building according to the law.

690
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:28,348
Please cooperate with us.

691
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:30,869
Is Mr. Yin Huiquan around?

692
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:32,749
Sorry about this.

693
00:29:32,828 --> 00:29:35,149
Our chairman has been unwell lately.

694
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:36,108
He's resting at home.

695
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:38,068
Can you please not disturb him

696
00:29:38,468 --> 00:29:39,828
if there's no emergency?

697
00:29:40,068 --> 00:29:41,269
Please talk to me instead.

698
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:43,989
I can't agree to that.

699
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:44,789
Li Kui.

700
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:46,789
You know where Yin Huiquan lives, right?

701
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:47,228
I do.

702
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:47,989
Bring him here.

703
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:48,228
Yes, sir.

704
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:50,269
What about Mr. Zhao Jikai?

705
00:29:51,828 --> 00:29:53,749
He went out with Ms. Li.

706
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,389
I'll tell you this first.

707
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,188
I hope that no one will know about our operation

708
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:01,188
before it's over.

709
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:04,588
By the way, Captain He,

710
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:07,509
I'm the PR consultant of the group.

711
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:09,029
This is a serious matter.

712
00:30:09,188 --> 00:30:11,549
I think I have to contact Mr. Zhao first.

713
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:12,909
Professor Luo, what about this?

714
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:15,269
You can bring me to the company's server first.

715
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:17,909
Okay.

716
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:21,068
Everyone, listen up.

717
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:24,989
Do not spread any news
about our operation.

718
00:30:25,108 --> 00:30:26,149
Not even a single word.

719
00:30:26,428 --> 00:30:26,708
Okay.

720
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:28,108
Let's go.

721
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:29,428
Please.

722
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:33,629
I'll give you my full cooperation.

723
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:34,828
Remember to keep
the data center under control.

724
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:35,428
Yes, sir.

725
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,228
Hello, we're from
Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau.

726
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:47,108
Is Mr. Yin Huiquan around?

727
00:30:47,228 --> 00:30:48,669
He's resting now.

728
00:30:48,989 --> 00:30:50,708
Please tell him to follow us
to the public security bureau.

729
00:30:50,869 --> 00:30:51,468
Okay.

730
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:53,269
Please come in. I'll call for him.

731
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:09,789
What's with all the police?

732
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:13,789
Jikai, you should go back first.
I'll check it out.

733
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,188
No need for that.

734
00:31:17,348 --> 00:31:18,348
Until now,

735
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:20,789
Huiquan didn't tell anyone to call me.

736
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:22,828
There are only
two possibilities to this.

737
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,348
First, it's not a big deal.

738
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:28,348
Second, it's too big of a deal

739
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:29,669
that no one can do anything about it.

740
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:32,708
Even if I do leave right now,

741
00:31:33,068 --> 00:31:34,468
where else can I go?

742
00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:38,549
I will be captured eventually.

743
00:31:41,629 --> 00:31:42,428
Remember.

744
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:44,629
You're just the director
of legal affairs.

745
00:31:45,228 --> 00:31:46,389
You were just hired by Huiquan

746
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:47,989
to manage the department.

747
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:49,509
You know nothing.

748
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:51,348
Even if something does happen to me,

749
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,509
push all the blame on me

750
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:56,068
and resign immediately.

751
00:31:56,308 --> 00:31:58,989
Run away and don't do anything for me.

752
00:31:59,909 --> 00:32:00,909
I don't deserve it.

753
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:02,588
You're telling me this now?

754
00:32:04,228 --> 00:32:05,188
At least I have a choice

755
00:32:05,228 --> 00:32:06,948
to face this with you.

756
00:32:07,228 --> 00:32:08,348
That's my choice.

757
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:47,068
You must be Mr. Zhao Jikai.

758
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:47,669
Nice to meet you.

759
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:49,869
I'm He Luyuan from
the public security bureau.

760
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,509
We need you to follow us back

761
00:32:51,588 --> 00:32:54,188
to assist us in our investigation.

762
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:56,669
Hello, Officer He.

763
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:58,909
I'm Li Yitang, director of legal affairs
of Huiquan Corporation.

764
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:00,428
Please show me the legal permit.

765
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:04,948
This is the summon.

766
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:08,869
According to the law,

767
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:11,389
the summon cannot exceed 12 hours.

768
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,588
Even if it's a complex case,

769
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:15,989
it cannot exceed 24 hours.

770
00:33:19,108 --> 00:33:19,789
Mr. Zhao,

771
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:21,549
I will pick you up at this time

772
00:33:21,549 --> 00:33:22,948
tomorrow at the latest.

773
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:24,708
Besides, you're sick.

774
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:27,708
Remember to take your medicine on time.

775
00:33:28,188 --> 00:33:29,588
Got it.

776
00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:30,749
I'm just assisting them
in their investigation.

777
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,549
Let's go.

778
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:33,468
Please.

779
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:22,349
There are two objectives
for this emergency meeting.

780
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:25,428
Just now, I've told you guys
about the situation.

781
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:26,349
Right now,

782
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,789
Huiquan is in a perilous situation.

783
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,029
And, there are reporters downstairs

784
00:34:32,188 --> 00:34:34,029
after hearing what happened
to our company.

785
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:37,029
All of you are the pillars of Huiquan.

786
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:39,349
I hope all of you

787
00:34:39,388 --> 00:34:40,948
can come up with one unified decision.

788
00:34:41,468 --> 00:34:44,309
We need to appoint someone
who can deal with daily businesses

789
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:47,868
and emergencies at the same time.

790
00:34:56,948 --> 00:34:57,749
Mr. Xiao.

791
00:35:01,468 --> 00:35:02,069
Mr. Luo,

792
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:06,349
as you know,
I just sent a client back to his house.

793
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:10,148
I'm quite shocked by what happened.

794
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,948
And, I don't understand
the entire situation yet.

795
00:35:13,749 --> 00:35:16,269
However, I understood what
you were trying to say.

796
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:17,388
Logically speaking,

797
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:21,349
at this time, I should recommend myself

798
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:22,948
to take over the company.

799
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:25,549
But here, I would like
to recommend you instead.

800
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:27,868
In terms of qualifications
and experience,

801
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:28,908
you're the most suitable candidate.

802
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:30,148
No.

803
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:32,868
I cannot do this.

804
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:34,428
Ms. Li.

805
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:37,549
Ms. Li, tell us your opinion.

806
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:43,549
I don't have any opinions.
I'm fine with anything.

807
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:47,589
What about the rest?

808
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,549
Fine.

809
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:54,628
I'll start the conversation.

810
00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:01,789
Before the meeting,

811
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:04,468
the chairman's caretaker called me.

812
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:07,628
She told me that the chairman wanted her
to pass a message to me

813
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:09,428
before he was taken away.

814
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:14,388
He wants me to handle
the daily business of Huiquan

815
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:17,029
or recommend someone suitable.

816
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:19,228
I'm sure you guys know me well.

817
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:22,428
Although I'm an expert in
dealing with PR issues,

818
00:36:22,868 --> 00:36:26,349
I know nothing about business.

819
00:36:26,509 --> 00:36:27,628
I wish to help too, but I'm powerless.

820
00:36:27,908 --> 00:36:30,749
Therefore, I've decided to recommend

821
00:36:30,948 --> 00:36:33,109
someone who can carry Huiquan
on his shoulders

822
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:36,269
and help us get through this ordeal.

823
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:38,349
He's Xiao Mu'en.

824
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:39,589
Mr. Xiao.

825
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:41,789
Mr. Luo,

826
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:44,269
- I...
- That's right. It's you.

827
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:47,029
I will appoint people by favoritism

828
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,228
when you're
the most capable person around.

829
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:52,829
Now, this is Huiquan's darkest moment.

830
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:56,269
Externally, we need a figure with a good image.

831
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:00,708
Internally, we need a trustworthy leader.

832
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:05,509
I'm sure all of you know
how Mr. Xiao is like.

833
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:08,109
I'm sure you guys

834
00:37:08,428 --> 00:37:09,749
know what he's capable of too.

835
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:10,948
Huiquan

836
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:15,708
needs an honest and
hardworking leader like him

837
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,188
who gives an account of everything,

838
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:19,868
deals with every matter,

839
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:21,749
and replies to every issue.

840
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:23,069
Mr. Luo.

841
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:23,948
Mr. Luo.

842
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:25,628
Why are you panicking?

843
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:26,989
Please take a look downstairs.

844
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:28,668
Another group of reporters
came just now.

845
00:37:28,789 --> 00:37:29,989
What should we do?

846
00:37:48,628 --> 00:37:51,428
Mr. Xiao, how should
we deal with this issue?

847
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:02,668
Who did it?

848
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:07,428
I suspect there's someone among us

849
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,428
who lured the reporters here on purpose.

850
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:12,188
After the meeting, all departments
will conduct an investigation.

851
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:13,989
I'll see

852
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,349
who's the traitor here.

853
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,789
I'll see what they're up to.

854
00:38:18,428 --> 00:38:21,029
I'll see what's in it for them
if they make the company fall!

855
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:25,309
Everyone,

856
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:27,829
there's a storm out there.

857
00:38:27,908 --> 00:38:30,509
All of us have to be calm and collected.

858
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:32,868
We need to learn
how to deal with difficulties as such.

859
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:36,468
Huiquan has contributed
a lot to society.

860
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:39,269
We must believe
that the government and the law

861
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:40,829
will help us.

862
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:42,549
Huiquan will not fall.

863
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:45,668
As long as we stay united,

864
00:38:46,109 --> 00:38:48,388
we can overcome any obstacles.

865
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:49,509
Right now,

866
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:52,269
the company's late-mover advantage

867
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:53,989
is starting to take effect.

868
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,908
We need to learn

869
00:38:56,188 --> 00:38:58,388
how to grow during ordeals.

870
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:01,948
To those who are willing to treat
the company as their family,

871
00:39:01,989 --> 00:39:04,789
to those who are willing
to weather the storm together,

872
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,349
to those who are willing
to help the company

873
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:08,948
during such a crisis,

874
00:39:09,069 --> 00:39:11,269
we will definitely treat you guys well.

875
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:13,868
Once Chairman and Mr. Zhao return,

876
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,749
I'll report your noble deeds to them.

877
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:18,789
Mr. Luo,

878
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:20,908
please deal with
the reporters downstairs.

879
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,148
Mr. Xiao, I'll join you.

880
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:27,428
Your appearance will help to calm them down.

881
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:28,908
Okay.

882
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:31,908
Ms. Li, join us.

883
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:44,468
This is rare.

884
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:47,029
Mr. Xiao was actually enraged.

885
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:48,428
Of course.

886
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:50,148
A new broom sweeps clean, you know?

887
00:39:50,948 --> 00:39:51,948
What nonsense are you saying?

888
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:53,549
Mr. Xiao was expressing

889
00:39:53,668 --> 00:39:55,468
that he has taken over the hot potato.

890
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:56,829
He was always a responsible person.

891
00:39:57,388 --> 00:39:58,589
That's what he does.

892
00:39:59,069 --> 00:39:59,868
Hello, everyone.

893
00:39:59,908 --> 00:40:01,668
Welcome to today's news flash.

894
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:03,428
Behind me is Huiquan Corporation.

895
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:04,549
According to an internal source,

896
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:05,668
at around 5:00 p.m.

897
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,468
Yin Huiquan, chairman
of Huiquan Corporation,

898
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:08,509
and Zhao Jikai,

899
00:40:08,589 --> 00:40:10,228
CEO cum head of Gaming Division
of Huiquan Corporation,

900
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:12,829
were brought away by the
Public Security Organs.

901
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:14,148
According to reports,
as the people in charge

902
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:16,468
and policymakers of Huiquan Corporation,

903
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:18,029
they might be responsible for

904
00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:19,948
the infringement of the citizens'
personal information.

905
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,349
So, are there more

906
00:40:21,388 --> 00:40:22,868
dirty secrets waiting to be uncovered?

907
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,468
Please stay tuned.

908
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:27,908
Mr. Luo, Mr. Xiao, can you guys tell us
what's going on?

909
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:28,908
Tell us something.

910
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:30,109
Tell us something.

911
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:31,549
Tell us something.

912
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,228
Everyone.

913
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:35,509
Please quiet down.

914
00:40:36,388 --> 00:40:39,388
Thank you for being concerned
about Huiquan.

915
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:42,188
You guys came here in no time.

916
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:45,289
That means you guys do care about us.

917
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:47,228
I understand your feelings.

918
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:51,109
Here, I have two things to say.

919
00:40:51,468 --> 00:40:52,109
Firstly,

920
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:56,708
Chairman Yin and Mr. Zhao only went to
the related department

921
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:58,589
to assist them in their investigation.

922
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:01,829
The company has not committed any crime.

923
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:06,148
Huiquan Corporation is a legal
and certified enterprise.

924
00:41:06,628 --> 00:41:08,908
We won't do such risky things.

925
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:10,069
Everyone,

926
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,349
the Internet and media itself

927
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,029
are also governed by the law.

928
00:41:15,388 --> 00:41:16,989
That's why I hope you guys

929
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:19,148
can report this news rationally

930
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:21,148
and mind the words you use.

931
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:23,228
Secondly, I'm sure

932
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:25,948
you guys know who Mr. Xiao is.

933
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:27,428
From now on,

934
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:32,509
Mr. Xiao will be responsible for
running the company

935
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:36,148
for the time being.

936
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:38,309
Mr. Xiao, tell us something.

937
00:41:38,428 --> 00:41:39,989
Mr. Xiao, tell us what's going on.

938
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:40,589
Tell us about it.

939
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:41,188
Tell us.

940
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:42,749
My friends from the media,

941
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:43,789
it must've been tough.

942
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:44,589
First,

943
00:41:44,908 --> 00:41:47,589
I would like to thank you guys
for caring about our company.

944
00:41:47,948 --> 00:41:50,989
This incident is a crisis

945
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:52,628
to Huiquan Corporation.

946
00:41:52,668 --> 00:41:54,029
But at the same time,

947
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:54,989
it's also an opportunity.

948
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:59,069
If you think it's a disaster,

949
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,908
it'll be a disaster.

950
00:42:01,029 --> 00:42:03,388
If you think it's an opportunity,

951
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:05,589
it'll be an opportunity.

952
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:06,908
I have complete trust

953
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:09,029
in Huiquan Corporation's
ability to survive this ordeal.

954
00:42:09,188 --> 00:42:13,668
I believe that Huiquan Corporation
is a strong corporation.

955
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:14,989
It's an elite corporation.

956
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:16,349
It will never fall.

957
00:42:16,388 --> 00:42:18,789
But if,

958
00:42:19,388 --> 00:42:20,468
one day,

959
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:22,589
Huiquan Corporation does fall,

960
00:42:22,868 --> 00:42:25,989
I'm willing to be the last one to fall.

961
00:42:27,228 --> 00:42:28,029
Excellent!

962
00:42:28,468 --> 00:42:28,989
Thank you.

963
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:29,989
Thank you, everyone.

964
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:35,309
I summoned all of you in a hurry

965
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:38,069
mainly because An Ni and Han Xuan

966
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:39,989
had obtained the key evidence
we required

967
00:42:40,468 --> 00:42:42,948
after searching through
massive amounts of data.
