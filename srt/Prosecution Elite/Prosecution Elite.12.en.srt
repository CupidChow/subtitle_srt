It's Professor Luo's birthday in two days.

16
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,400
I will celebrate his birthday with An Ni.

17
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,760
I will talk to him.

18
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,760
That's a good idea.

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,910
I knew it.

20
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,000
Come in.

21
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,760
I'll go first.

22
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,160
Good afternoon, Ms. Li.

23
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,630
Mr. Zhao, please sign here.

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,520
Who did you sell
the information and card to?

26
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,320
I sold them to buyers from Country F.

(Jiangcheng First Detention Center)

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,320
They were generous.

29
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,190
They offered
more than the usual market price.

30
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,830
Liang Ying is your wife, right?

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,670
Does she know what you've been doing?

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,800
She doesn't know.

33
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,190
How could I possibly let her know

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,240
about all these illegal activities?

35
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,110
Where is she?

36
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,390
She ran away from home.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,910
How long has it been?

38
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,270
Three months.

39
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,240
Why didn't you look for her then?

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,800
I did, but I couldn't find her.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,470
Then why didn't you
report it to the police?

42
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,390
Do you think I would dare to report it?

43
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,030
It's impossible for me
to tell the police what I've done,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,390
well, unless the sky crashes down.

45
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,600
You need to explain this to me clearly.

46
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,470
I recently handled a case of

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,550
a man killing his wife
for insurance fraud.

48
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,030
You didn't do anything
you shouldn't have, right?

49
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,000
I only seek wealth.

50
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,830
I wouldn't dare to do anything

51
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,520
to harm others.

52
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,960
Guo Jing'an.

53
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,670
Are you having an affair?

54
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,080
Me?

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,110
It's her instead.

56
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,360
It's an online relationship,

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,030
with a young pretty boy.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,270
She's the one having an affair.

59
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,550
Just tell me,
how should I take this news calmly?

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,670
So you resorted to
domestic violence, didn't you?

61
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,750
That wasn't domestic violence.

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,520
It's just a few pushes.
Is that even domestic violence?

63
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,520
I only pushed her a few times,

64
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,550
and she ran away from home right away.

65
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,120
For three months!

66
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,360
Does she think that she's in the right?

67
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,520
Come on!

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,440
This livestream is really good after
the update for Green Broadcasting.

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,470
I know right?

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,880
I watch it every day,

71
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,240
and it keeps recommending me
a lot of beautiful girls.

72
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,470
Oh by the way,

73
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,670
did you follow
the influencer named Xiaoxiao?

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,030
Of course!

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,030
She's the most popular one
on the entire internet now!

76
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,670
Not only that,

77
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,230
the other influencers in her company

78
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,110
are also pretty good.

79
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,670
Look!

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Look at this girl named Lili.

81
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,510
Here!

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
(They said I buy followers
and do shady stuff,)

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,230
(and buy traffic to promote myself?)

84
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,760
(How ridiculous!)

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
(They're not popular,
so they come to slander me.)

86
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
(What a joke!
I'll show you today...)

87
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,350
Eat your meal! Stop playing!

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,320
Okay.

89
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,160
Guys!

90
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,880
(Let's protect Xiaoxiao together!)
Flood her livestream and scold her,

91
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,390
(We have been waiting for it.)
so she can no longer continue

92
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,200
(Xiaoxiao is our one and only!)
livestreaming on this Huibo App.

93
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,000
Mr. Secretary,

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,200
We've recently received
numerous reports from the public.

95
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,110
All clues point to the Huibo App.

96
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,480
Upon investigation, we found out that

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,760
this App has individual streamers

98
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,950
who engage in provocative behavior,

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,830
sexual innuendos,

100
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,110
smoking,

101
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,440
arguments and insults,

102
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,230
threatening speech,

103
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,040
and inciting fans,
among other behaviors.

104
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,320
The comments
in some streamers' livestreams

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
are rather offensive.

106
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,270
The content is vulgar and filthy,

107
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,200
and it has caused a negative impact

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,510
and sparked public anger.

109
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,390
Now that everyone
is aware of the situation,

110
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,110
I will now assign specific tasks.

111
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,760
Following the unified arrangement

112
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,020
of the Central Political and
Legal Affairs Commission,

113
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,950
the next step will be
to conduct a nationwide

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,640
internet purification campaign.

115
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,480
By then,

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,000
Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission,

117
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:32,920
Ministry of Public Security,

118
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,760
Ministry of Industry
and Information Technology,

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,350
People's Procuratorate,

120
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,920
and State Administration for
Market Regulation will act in unison

121
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,880
to conduct thorough investigations

122
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,790
on all network companies
within the jurisdictions

123
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,200
that bear platform
supervision responsibilities,

124
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,390
and to require the companies

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
to effectively fulfill

126
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,670
their platform's
primary responsibilities.

127
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,670
We must

128
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,390
effectively fulfill

129
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,200
the platform's content
regulation responsibilities.

130
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,160
For network companies like Huibo,

131
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,720
we must first carry out relevant

132
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,320
inspection and evidence collection work.

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,200
If there are indeed violations,

134
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,790
we must promptly contact
the key persons in charge of Huibo

135
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,160
and require them to rectify

136
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,880
the alleged violations
within a specified period.

137
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,270
Regarding the violations
committed by the companies,

138
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,350
we must investigate and
handle them according to the law,

139
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,950
while also carefully studying

140
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,720
how to guide these companies
to operate legally and compliantly.

141
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,270
Also,

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,070
regarding the accounts
that violate the rules

143
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,040
as mentioned by Director Liu,

144
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,920
we need to further tighten
the real-name registration system

145
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,760
and strengthen the system for
suspending accounts due to violations,

146
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,270
to purify the online environment

147
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,950
and further ensure our network security.

148
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,880
You're pulling
another all-nighter tonight?

149
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,440
I'm fine.

150
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,230
I actually wanted to
invite you to have dinner together,

151
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,950
and take you to a nice restaurant.

152
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,200
Please don't mention
food to me anymore, Mr. Xiao.

153
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,390
Last time you brought me soup,

154
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm afraid you'll
bring it again this time.

155
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,880
You'll put me in a difficult situation.

156
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,300
- Sir, you're here.
- You'll put me in a difficult situation.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,950
Guo Jing'an has confessed.

158
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,670
He is Yang Bao's superior.

159
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,230
Let's stop here, I'm busy now.

160
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,390
This Guo Jing'an

161
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
is really cunning.

162
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,920
He expands three more businesses

163
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,480
via illegal online loans.

164
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
As the promoter

165
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,510
of illegal online loans,

166
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,230
he earns a portion of the commission.

167
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,270
This is well known.

168
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,920
At the same time,
he sells this personal data

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,110
to those who need it,

170
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,320
earning more money.

171
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,880
Of course, his most profitable business

172
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,320
is using personal data

173
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,720
and double cards
for money laundering services.

174
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,510
He can get a two percent commission

175
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,110
from the fourth-party
settlement platform.

176
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,160
This is quite a significant volume.

177
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,600
I've already had someone
check his bank statements.

178
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,000
And there are also
some unused double cards

179
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,440
that he packages and sells them
to overseas fraud syndicates.

180
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,640
He collects them from Yang Bao

181
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,230
for about 300 to 400 yuan per set,

182
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,720
but he sells them to
overseas fraud syndicates.

183
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,830
for 2,000 yuan per set.

184
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,790
This is too cunning!

185
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,920
He really makes the most of everything.

186
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,880
Captain He,

187
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,950
did he explain to you

188
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,110
how he got into this business?

189
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,880
He said that one time,

190
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,110
when he was browsing
a part-time job website,

191
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,390
a pop-up suddenly appeared.

192
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,880
He clicked on it
and saw an advertisement

193
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,920
saying that there is a
high reward for selling phone cards.

194
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,760
Yes, it's as simple as that.

195
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,880
After he made his first fortune,

196
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,110
he became bolder,

197
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,040
and he also got to know more networks.

198
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,830
But those victims are really unlucky.

199
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,830
Their personal information is sold,

200
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,440
and then used by criminal suspects.

201
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,790
Isn't that indirectly helping

202
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,390
gambling and fraud gangs launder money?

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,950
What about his family?

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,720
Have they been investigated?

205
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,920
We are still investigating.

206
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,480
Okay then,

207
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,920
let's end today's meeting here.

208
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,110
Adjourned.

209
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,470
Captain Ding.

210
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,880
Yes, Prosecutor Guo?

211
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,470
There's one thing.

212
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,000
Erm..

213
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,080
Let's keep it professional

214
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,080
and not take thing personal.

215
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,880
Our bureau also notices

216
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,790
the chaos in Huiquan Live Streaming.

217
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,880
and prepare to issue a prosecutorial
recommendation to the Cultural Bureau.

218
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,470
Come on, Prosecutor Guo. Don't do that.

219
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,110
Our law enforcement team
is also doing our job seriously.

220
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,400
If you send the recommendation letter

221
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,880
to our superiors.

222
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,440
doesn't that mean
I have failed in my job?

223
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,200
No, no, no.

224
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,320
Don't misunderstand.

225
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,400
Not only do I know,

226
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
but I also appreciate your efforts.

227
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,880
But as the Prosecutor's Bureau,

228
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,280
we also have to fulfill our duties.

229
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,670
We merely want to provide
a more comprehensive suggestion

230
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,470
to our fellow colleagues
from a judicial perspective.

231
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,520
Like what?

232
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,350
We would like to provide
some suggestions to the Cultural Bureau

233
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,400
regarding the need of regulation on

234
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,230
Huiquan Network
and its content dissemination.

235
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,030
This includes the need to rectify
and inspect the platform promptly,

236
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,910
ensuring swift and
decisive actions are taken.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Business Lawful Operation
Commitment Letter.

238
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,280
Notice of Rectification
and Deadline for Compliance.

239
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,280
(Xiao Mu'en)

240
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,520
Administrative Penalty Decision Letter.

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,320
(Huiquan Corporation)

242
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,550
Xiao Mu'en, look at what you've done.

243
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
(Zhao Jikai)
I really need to reassess you.

244
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,550
The space of online live streaming
is not beyond the law.

245
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,880
Law and morality
must also be emphasized.

246
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,640
Actions that challenge
the legal bottom line

247
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,000
and violate
public order and good customs

248
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
will surely be cracked down upon
by the government.

249
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,960
You better think carefully

250
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,080
about how to
explain this to the chairman.

251
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,230
I declare

252
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,320
that I did not recruit these streamers.

253
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,710
These keyboard warriors

254
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,640
and the vulgar content

255
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,400
were not planned or instructed by me.

256
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,400
I'd admit it
if I were the one who did it,

257
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,350
but I didn't do it.

258
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,590
Don't think I, Xiao Mu'en,
will be the scapegoat just like this!

259
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,080
I don't even have the network

260
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,400
to find these

261
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,590
vulgar female streamers.

262
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,150
I absolutely do not allow

263
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,440
anyone to act so unmannerly

264
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,910
in our Hui Bo livestreaming platform,

265
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,910
especially those streamers
who present themselves to the public.

266
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Mr. Xiao, please sit down.

267
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,190
(Luo Jiangxiao)

268
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,110
Take it easy.

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,840
Regarding this matter,

270
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,640
it's possible that it's a
sabotage by our competitors.

271
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,280
Since the incident has already occurred,

272
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,520
what we need to do now

273
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,440
is to figure out how to solve it.

274
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,440
Mr. Zhao, Professor Luo,

275
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,080
Our company has always

276
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,280
emphasized on social efficiency, right?

277
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,150
Well then,

278
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,000
I've decided to stay
at the company during this period

279
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,110
until the problem
is completely resolved.

280
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,880
Sure!

281
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,470
No, no, no.

282
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,640
Things aren't that serious yet.

283
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,960
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

284
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:30,550
Mr. Zhao,

285
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,080
I'd like for frontline reviewers
be assigned,

286
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,670
and the ratio should not
be less than 1 to 50.

287
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,280
Also, after the meeting,

288
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,910
I will require that we do tag management

289
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,320
on all our company's streamers.

290
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,470
For those streamers
and live streaming rooms

291
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,230
that repeatedly cause problems
within a period of time,

292
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,110
they would no longer
be recommended on the App,

293
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,150
and they should be demoted in rankings,

294
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,520
or even have their accounts suspended.

295
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,200
High restrictions should be imposed

296
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,440
on daily rewards as well.

297
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,760
Furthermore, online activities

298
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,880
such as screen flooding
within a short period of time,

299
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,840
and sensitive words or vulgar language

300
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,520
should be restricted.

301
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,640
We should actively cooperate
with government departments.

302
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,520
It smells good, right?

303
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,230
It smells great.

304
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,550
Xiaoting,

305
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,710
hurry up and open the door.

306
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,320
Coming!

307
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,110
An Ni and the others are here.

308
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:46,910
An Ni!

309
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,350
Xiaoting!

310
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,400
It's been quite a while.

311
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,110
I missed you so much.

312
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,520
I missed you too.

313
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,230
Professor Luo!

314
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,200
Happy birthday.

315
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,790
Thanks.

316
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,200
Come sit down.
Let me pour you some water.

317
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:56,840
Sure.

318
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,200
Oh yeah!

319
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,670
Professor Luo,
Yitang is on her way here now.

320
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,840
She'll be here soon.

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,520
Okay.

322
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,910
Wow, there are so many dishes.

323
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,030
Professor Luo, it's your birthday today,
yet you're cooking.

324
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm really sorry.

325
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,470
I should have come earlier to help.

326
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,710
No, it's fine.

327
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,150
This is embarrassing to say, but...

328
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,320
Back then, I encouraged
all of you and said that

329
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,520
idealism is more important than money.

330
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,230
But now, I'm bending over for a living.

331
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,030
I became a PR consultant for Huiquan,

332
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,320
and thought I could
maintain my integrity forever.

333
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,640
I never thought that at this age,

334
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,110
I'd still have to go out
and make a living.

335
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,440
Yes, you're quite
clear-headed, aren't you?

336
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,440
But, you became clear-headed too late.

337
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,110
An Ni, I just can't understand.

338
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
You've been so noble all your life,

339
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,880
but now, you're working as a
strategist for Huiquan in your old age,

340
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,910
strategizing for them,

341
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,230
using all the legal knowledge
you've acquired in your life

342
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,400
to cover up for them.

343
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,400
Xiaoting.

344
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,880
Don't say that about your father.

345
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,470
Xiaoting.

346
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,400
Every time we mention Huiquan,

347
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,640
you become hostile towards me.

348
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,960
I understand what you mean.

349
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,230
It's my birthday today.

350
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,710
Let's not bring up this matter, okay?

351
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,790
We can talk about it later.

352
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:19,960
Dad.

353
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,150
You're my real dad.

354
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,520
Mom passed away early.

355
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,760
And you are the one
who understands me the most in this world.

356
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,960
You know me well.

357
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
I'm blunt with my thoughts.

358
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,590
I swear, I always wanted

359
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,790
to make your sixtieth birthday today

360
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,230
a truly meaningful one.

361
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,710
But just now,

362
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,200
you insisted on talking about this.

363
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,710
I really feel that
you're being hypocritical.

364
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,590
Xiaoting, what's wrong with you today?

365
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,150
It's your dad's birthday.

366
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,640
Can't we celebrate it peacefully?

367
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,640
Stop messing around.

368
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,880
An Ni, you've watched me grow up too.

369
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,520
Back then,

370
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,520
my dad never failed to

371
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,590
fill us with motivational talks.

372
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,230
You, Yitang, and me,

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,520
we all grew up

374
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,350
under his discipline and education.

375
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Since young,

376
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,030
my dad was my idol.

377
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,790
But now,

378
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,110
what has he become?

379
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,710
He keeps telling me that

380
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,350
he went to Huiquan for me,

381
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,000
to earn enough money for me to live on.

382
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,790
Yes.

383
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,000
As a father
fulfilling his duty to his daughter,

384
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,550
there's nothing wrong with that.

385
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,080
I am genuinely grateful to him as well.

386
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,790
But a noble person
knows what to do and what not to do!

387
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,550
In my heart,

388
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,840
and yours as well,

389
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,760
he's always been a noble person.

390
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,000
But now, going to such a company

391
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,400
and earning money by

392
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,880
covering all these bad deeds for them,

393
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,230
that's not something
a noble person would do.

394
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,960
Only a hypocrite will do that!

395
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,710
What's wrong with you today, Xiaoting?

396
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,790
Stop it.

397
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,280
An Ni.

398
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,710
Just let her speak.

399
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Let her say whatever
she wants to say today.

400
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Okay, Dad.

401
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,760
If you go to such a company

402
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,350
and earn money in such a way,

403
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,080
what's the difference between that

404
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,000
and robbing on the street with a knife?

405
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,150
Luo Xiaoting!

406
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,880
Explain yourself clearly!

407
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,640
What kind of company did I go to?

408
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,960
What kind of methods did I use?

409
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,590
What kind of money did I earn?

410
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,080
Professor Luo, calm down first.

411
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,710
Just stop it.

412
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,840
Dad.

413
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,590
If you think that

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,960
I'm being unreasonable

415
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,350
by saying these things,

416
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,280
then let me ask you,

417
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,470
would you dare to
take out your voice recorder,

418
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,470
and let An Ni

419
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,110
listen to your final recording?

420
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,200
After listening,

421
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,880
I believe that as a prosecutor,

422
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,710
An Ni will give the most fair judgment.

423
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,640
Xiaoting!

424
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,280
Where are you going, Xiaoting?

425
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,520
Xiaoting?

426
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,310
Xiaoting!

427
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:21,760
What's wrong?

428
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,040
Come in first, I'll talk to you later.

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,880
Professor Luo, Yitang has arrived.

430
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,310
Professor Luo.

431
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,830
Professor Luo.

432
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,920
Happy birthday, Professor Luo.

433
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,310
Professor Luo.

434
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,160
Regarding what happened
earlier with Xiaoting,

435
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,800
there might be some
misunderstandings between you two.

436
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,070
I'm sure everything will be fine

437
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,280
once you find a time
to clarify things with her.

438
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,350
Today, let us focus on
celebrating your birthday, alright?

439
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,760
An Ni.

440
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,160
Actually,

441
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,350
this matter is not
as Xiaoting imagines.

442
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,920
I'll tell you when the time is right.

443
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,800
Perhaps...

444
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Xiaoting is not wrong.

445
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,400
I do need to reflect on my behavior.

446
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,830
But rest assured,

447
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,190
there should be
nothing wrong with Huiquan.

448
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,560
And here I was wondering
what you two were saying.

449
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
Of course there's
nothing wrong with Huiquan.

450
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,310
Otherwise, wouldn't I,
as the legal director,

451
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,430
be wasting my efforts?

452
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,710
Alright, enough.

453
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,920
Let's not mention this matter anymore.

454
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,470
Professor Luo.

455
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,230
No matter what happened just now,

456
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,040
it doesn't matter anymore.

457
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
Today,

458
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,280
let's happily celebrate

459
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,470
your 60th birthday together.

460
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,830
Happy birthday, Professor Luo.

461
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Thank you.

462
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,470
Wang Haoming.

463
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:37,960
Professor Luo, in the future,

464
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,190
if we choose to become lawyers or
corporate legal professionals,

465
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,310
should we be loyal to legal justice

466
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,640
or to the parties involved?

467
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,470
(Jiangcheng University)
This is a good question.

468
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,950
Is there any student who is willing

469
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,350
to answer the question
raised by this student just now

470
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,350
or express their own views?

471
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,470
Yes, Li Yitang?

472
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,310
I think that

473
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,110
the ideal state would be
to be loyal to both the law

474
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,310
and the parties involved.

475
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,430
But considering
the professions of lawyers

476
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,400
and legal professionals,

477
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,190
to put it bluntly,

478
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,040
it's about resolving problems
for others in exchange for money.

479
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Therefore, it should be

480
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,920
the interests of the parties involved
that take precedence above all else

481
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,230
within the framework of the law,

482
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,590
to ensure the maximization
of the parties' interests.

483
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,160
That is the ultimate goal we pursue.

484
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,110
As for whether we should
be loyal to the law and justice,

485
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,920
they don't need to worry about that.

486
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,590
It should be reflected in the roles of

487
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
prosecutors,

488
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,640
judges, and lawyers.

489
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,710
Everyone,

490
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,640
since your first day

491
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,110
of entering this law school,

492
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,040
you should remember

493
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,800
the mission you carry
as legal professionals.

494
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,950
Since I started teaching,

495
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,430
I haven't had the opportunity
to speak up for the parties involved.

496
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,070
But I do consider it fortunate

497
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,160
for me personally.

498
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,830
Today, I want
all of you to remember that

499
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,430
these two aspects are not contradictory,

500
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,350
but rather
the fundamental professional ethics.

501
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,110
Being loyal to the law

502
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,310
and being loyal to the parties involved.

503
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,920
Perhaps there is a misconception here.

504
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,830
Is defending a person known to be guilty

505
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,430
not being loyal to the law?

506
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,190
The answer is

507
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,110
of course not.

508
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,430
According to their professional duties,

509
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,680
lawyers are not obligated to expose
the crimes of the parties involved.

510
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,710
On the contrary,

511
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,520
their duty is to
defend the parties involved.

512
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,520
In other words,

513
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,680
if a lawyer

514
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,160
reveals the crimes
of the parties involved,

515
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
then that is

516
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,590
not being loyal to the law.

517
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,000
Legal justice always prevails.

518
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,350
As legal professionals,

519
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,110
we should pursue

520
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,950
procedural justice,

521
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,710
but more importantly,
we should pursue substantive justice.

522
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,230
Perhaps

523
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,190
one day

524
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,430
when you face the realities of life

525
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,110
and have to compromise
for your livelihood,

526
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,830
I hope that all of you

527
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,230
can strike a balance.

528
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:00,710
(Dad.)

529
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:03,230
(Regardless of whether
there is a problem with Huiquan,)

530
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,470
(what have you actually done for them.)

531
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,760
(Yesterday was your birthday.)

532
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
(As your daughter,)

533
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,800
(I shouldn't have embarrassed you)

534
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,950
(in front of your students.)

535
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,520
(Dad.)

536
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,040
(I'm sorry.)

537
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
(This cake)

538
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,660
(can be said as a
belated birthday gift for you.)

539
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,560
(Dad, I believe in your character,)

540
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,310
(Although I still can't accept)

541
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,350
(the things that you do in Huiquan,)

542
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,190
(I know you must have your reasons.)

543
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,400
(If you don't want to
explain yesterday's incident,)

544
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,470
(I won't ask again.)

545
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,760
(I won't mention it)

546
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,430
(to An Ni again too.)

547
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,760
(But if one day,
you think the time is right,)

548
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,950
(I look forward to having
a good conversation with you.)

549
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,000
(From the daughter
who always loves you.)

550
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,190
We just found out too.

551
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,230
Before, I thought he
just had a gambling problem.

552
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,430
So I thought, I'd just accept it
if he lost in his gamble.

553
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,710
But I didn't expect

554
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,640
that it was a scam from the beginning.

555
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,920
He gambles on sports to win big

556
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,560
in order to recover the money

557
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,430
that has been scammed.

558
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
But how is that possible?

559
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,800
How can he win it back?

560
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,640
An Ni, among my friends,

561
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,520
you're the only one
who can talk to the police.

562
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,040
You're a prosecutor.

563
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,070
Please think of a way to help us

564
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,470
retrieve the money.

565
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,280
Xiaojiao.

566
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,400
Even if I'm not a prosecutor,

567
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,520
I'm still your friend.

568
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,230
I will do my best to help you.

569
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,830
But I'm not a police officer,

570
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,830
I can't overstep my boundaries.

571
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,710
We still have to follow
the proper procedures.

572
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,950
We need to file a police report first.

573
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,740
Do you have any evidence right now?

574
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,560
If it doesn't meet the
requirements for filing a case,

575
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,440
it will be useless to ask anyone.

576
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,440
We have!

577
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
We have, right? Tell her!

578
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,040
It's one thing if people
from other industries get scammed.

579
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,430
But I'm a senior programmer,

580
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,350
yet I got scammed.

581
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,560
If this gets out,

582
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,710
I would be utterly embarrassed.

583
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,310
Xiaojiao.

584
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Let's just let it go, okay?

585
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,040
You're utterly embarrassed?

586
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,920
Then I'm embarrassed beyond measure.

587
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Just tell!

588
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,430
Why did we come here
in the first place even?

589
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,640
An Ni is on our side.

590
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,430
Hurry up and tell her.

591
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,760
Actually, I'm pressured
by Xiaojiao every day.

592
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,430
I reflect every day.

593
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,470
I try to find solutions every day.

594
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,470
I ponder every day.

595
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,310
And that's when I realized.

596
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,040
Chen Yonggang,

597
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,310
What now, my dear?

598
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,560
Where's the money
in the savings account?

599
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,520
I live frugally,

600
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,470
and saved that money over the years.

601
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,400
Where did you take it?

602
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,310
Did you go gambling again?

603
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,800
What kind of a man are you?

604
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,110
What's wrong with you?

605
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,680
Xiaojiao, listen to me.

606
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,070
I didn't gamble, really! I didn't!

607
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,830
Please believe me.

608
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,190
Then where did the money go?

609
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,310
Sit down first, okay?

610
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,230
My dear, I admit it.

611
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,830
I did take the money from the
savings account without permission.

612
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,040
But I didn't gamble, really!
I didn't go gambling!

613
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,040
I swear! I can swear on anything!

614
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,310
I really didn't gamble!

615
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,920
I took that money and invested it.

616
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,830
Invested it?

617
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,430
I invested the money
because I wanted to get more money,

618
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,920
so that our family
could have a better life.

619
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,310
You don't deserve to mention our family.

620
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,310
Right, I don't deserve it.

621
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,000
Then I'll call him now,

622
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,310
and get the money back
along with the interest.

623
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:04,560
That should do, right?

624
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
(The number you're trying
to reach is unavailable.)

625
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,950
My dear, please don't get upset.

626
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,560
He's a busy businessman.

627
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:22,280
He might be occupied and
not checking his phone at the moment.

628
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,350
I'll try to ask someone

629
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,280
for his contact.

630
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,920
Hello, Yuan.

631
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,710
It's me. I have something to ask you.

632
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,350
Do you remember

633
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,830
our primary school classmate, Zhanpeng?

634
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,710
Do you have his phone number?

635
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,640
Great! Please send it to me quickly.

636
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,520
Okay.

637
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
Hello, Zhanpeng.

638
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,350
Dude, why didn't you let me know that

639
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,590
you've changed your phone number?

640
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,680
You scared the heck out of me!

641
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,520
I thought you were a scammer.

642
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:57,920
What?

643
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:59,920
Who am I?

644
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,950
I'm Chen Yonggang. Who else could I be?

645
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,590
Don't play dumb with me!

646
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,310
It's not you?

647
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,950
Why does your voice sound different?

648
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,920
Are you really Zhanpeng?

649
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,640
Hello?

650
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,430
Hello?

651
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,110
My dear.

652
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,640
It seems like I've been scammed.

653
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,680
This seems to be what they call

654
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,400
a "Friendship Scam".

655
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,110
I'm really angry every time I hear it.

656
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,800
What were you thinking?

657
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,590
This...

658
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,920
They've really found the
right victim for the scam.

659
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,920
Alright, Xiaojiao.

660
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,830
Stop scolding him.

661
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,520
Look, he's practically
lowering his head to the ground.

662
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,950
You must be regretting it, Yonggang.

663
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,430
Actually, these things are really rare.

664
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,110
But similar situations do exist.

665
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,220
Many people are defenseless

666
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,860
against these prepared scammers.

667
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,360
Besides, the person who runs this scam

668
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,280
would usually poses as an old classmate

669
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,310
to randomly add people
to their contacts,

670
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,590
and then obtain
the victims' personal information.

671
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,430
After obtaining the information,

672
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,520
they further collect useful information

673
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,200
through big data analysis.

674
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,280
That's how they perfect their disguise

675
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,760
as your old classmate.

676
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,430
These days

677
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,280
I'm filled with self-doubt.

678
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,760
I could have avoided being scammed,

679
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,400
but now,

680
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,560
my savings are all gone.

681
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,590
And I have to pay for my own mistakes.

682
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,070
On top of that,
the humiliation of being scammed

683
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,520
is truly indescribable.

684
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,760
Alright, stop blaming yourself.

685
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,310
Self-blame is useless now.

686
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,350
If these bad people
are not brought to justice,

687
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,190
similar tragedies will happen again.

688
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,310
Let's go find Captain He.

689
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,260
He happens to be around here.

690
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,950
He has more experience
dealing with such cases.

691
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,830
Okay.

692
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,040
Thank you.

693
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:57,760
Captain He.

694
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,880
Where's Long?

695
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,230
How come I haven't seen her all day?

696
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,190
She's leading the team
to catch the "Friendship Scam".

697
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,350
Chen Yonggang's case.

698
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,620
Oh?

699
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,310
Captain He is really efficient.

700
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,640
Captain He is efficient indeed.

701
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,710
Who are you trying to curry favor with?

702
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,310
What are you making a fuss about?

703
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,680
That's because

704
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,350
the evidence provided
by Chen Yonggang is solid,

705
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,280
so we were able to
quickly identify the suspects.

706
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,400
Alright, stop fooling around
and get to work.

707
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:22,560
Help me make two copies.

708
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,070
Okay.

709
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,260
Alright, everyone, let's get started.

710
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,920
After Captain He and I

711
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,430
visited Jiangcheng University together

712
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,640
and conducted investigative visits,

713
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,520
we discovered different types of crimes

714
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,520
that infiltrated the student community

715
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,430
and committed various criminal acts.

716
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,800
This time,

717
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,190
the university leaders
attach great importance

718
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,640
and has assigned Director Wang Heyu

719
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,190
to guide the
investigation together with us.

720
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,430
And indeed we found

721
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,040
various forms of illegal activities,

722
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,640
such as campus loans,

723
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,920
nude loans, blacklisted loans,

724
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,520
trap loans, high-interest loans,
and so on.

725
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,720
This aligns with the information

726
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,960
Han Xuan gathered during his visit

727
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,110
to Jiangcheng University last time.

728
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,190
This time, Director Wang Heyu

729
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,110
has also brought us

730
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,280
a very important clue.

731
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
There are a total of
four online loan companies

732
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,040
(Gambling sites Fourth party payment)
dealing with these university students.

733
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,190
One of them shares a common point

734
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,950
with the behind-the-scenes company of

735
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,040
Shi Xiaohu and Zhang Xiaobei's
online lending company,

736
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:07,520
and that is

737
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,470
their former legal representatives
were former employees of Huiquan.

738
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,560
And that they would resign on their own

739
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
after a short period of work.

740
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,040
For the specific details,

741
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,800
let's have Captain He

742
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,190
analyze it for us.

743
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,070
Are these incidents mere coincidences

744
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,950
or are they indeed related to Huiquan?

745
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,560
Our current priority

746
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,830
is to find the

747
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,350
legal representative
of the illegal loan company

748
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,350
that used to work for Huiquan.

749
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,230
We need to find out

750
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,430
what kind of connection
he has with Huiquan.

751
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,640
But we need to keep this matter secret

752
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,920
to avoid alerting the suspects.

753
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,160
If Huiquan is really
connected to these people,

754
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,880
once we find one person,

755
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,590
the others will be alerted to the news,

756
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,280
and they will become more cautious,

757
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,950
making our investigation more difficult.

758
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,280
Let our police comrades
handle this matter

759
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,950
and discuss a plan first.

760
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:52,710
Alright.

761
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,520
Sure.

762
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,070
Han Xuan.

763
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,040
Alright.

764
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,230
Give this to Wang Heyu.

765
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,720
(Weizhijue Restaurant)

766
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,710
The others have gone back to rest.

767
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,040
It's just a few of us left.

768
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,830
We're staying up late
just for a bite to eat.

769
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,070
That's their loss
for not wanting to join.

770
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,430
Although it's Saturday today,

771
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,590
let's not get too drunk.

772
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
Agreed.

773
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:19,920
Let's not get too carried away.

774
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,040
It's so hard for me
to have this meal with you.

775
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,500
It's been months.

776
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,310
It's either you're too busy,
or I have cases to handle.

777
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,520
Come on.

778
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,830
Let's enjoy the drink today.

779
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,000
Don't drink too much, guys.

780
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,310
You should also drink less.

781
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,640
You're different from
these old comrades.

782
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,160
What? Old comrades?

783
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,310
Fine. You're still young.

784
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,950
Get some corn juice
for this kid right here.

785
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,710
Drink water.

786
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,680
Come, have a drink.

787
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,470
Drink this corn juice. It's better.

788
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,920
About the case six months ago,

789
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,350
thank you.

790
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,160
Last time, because my
evidence was insufficient,

791
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,310
I had to keep investigating.

792
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,000
If it weren't for the
specific direction you gave me,

793
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,680
we still wouldn't know today

794
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,590
if the case could be sentenced.

795
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,640
Let's not talk about that.

796
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,560
Thanks.

797
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,080
Captain He.

798
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,110
Who was the one who said
'Let's not mention any cases' just now?

799
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,430
Are you trying to pick a fight?

800
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,950
You, you, you.

801
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,920
You'd better...

802
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,070
I'll drink juice.

803
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,920
Finish all the juice.

804
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,110
Drink it up.

805
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,000
I'll toast you.

806
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:14,830
Come, Captain He.

807
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,640
You're toasting with this?

808
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,040
You should use a bottle to toast.

809
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,110
That's right.

810
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,310
Captain He should use a bottle.

811
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,920
That's called double standards.

812
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,520
You guys drink first.
I'll go to the restroom.

813
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,430
You allow him to drink juice only.

814
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,710
Yet, when it comes to me,
I have to toast with a bottle?

815
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,000
Fine, you drink this first.

816
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,430
Then you can drink the hot pot broth too

817
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,230
Is that good enough?

818
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,310
Old comrade.

819
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,310
Waiter.

820
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,000
Hello.

821
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,950
I'll pay the bill.

822
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,800
It's for that table.

823
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,190
That table?

824
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,640
Table number seven.

825
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,160
Right.

826
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,190
Okay, wait a moment.

827
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,830
Check the bill, please.

828
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,920
The total is 216 yuan.

829
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,950
Would you like to use QR code payment?

830
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,680
Is this method acceptable?

831
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,190
What do you think?

832
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,430
This is 216 yuan.

833
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,710
Could you split it for me?

834
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,160
One hundred yuan on one bill each.

835
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,040
I don't have enough balance,
so I'll make two different payments,

836
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,640
one Alipay and one WeChat Pay.

837
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:08,800
Alright, that's doable.

838
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,160
Okay.

839
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,640
Okay.

840
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,710
I'll scan WeChat Pay first.

841
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,710
Alright, scan here.

842
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,560
Okay, it's done.

843
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,310
It's Alipay next.

844
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,110
And there's another 16 yuan.

845
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,830
Yes.

846
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,040
Sixteen.

847
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,160
Okay, it's done.

848
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,350
Okay.

849
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,070
Do you need the bill?

850
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,920
No, thank you.

851
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,520
Okay, thank you, goodbye.

852
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,830
(Exclusive Interview)
(Chairman Yin.)

853
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,800
(There have been marketing that claims)

854
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,000
(that Huiquan has
registered overseas companies.)

855
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,640
(Have you set your sights
on the international market?)

856
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,280
(May I ask you,)

857
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,310
(what are the purposes
and reasons behind this?)

858
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,160
(Our Huiquan Corporation)

859
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,710
(has indeed established)

860
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,640
(offshore companies long ago.)

861
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,230
(This is not an unfounded rumor.)

862
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,710
(As a high-tech company)

863
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,340
(with a product-centric approach
in the Internet industry)

864
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,110
(Is Huiquan transferring assets to
overseas in a disguised manner?)

865
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,640
(Huiquan needs to mitigate various
risks in the international market)

866
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,470
(and promote its development overseas.)

867
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,110
It has begun?

868
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,070
(But our ambitions are greater.)

869
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,190
(We hope to enter)

870
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,040
(the competition and financing
of international capital.)

871
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,680
(Chairman Yin,)

872
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,160
(is Huiquan transferring assets)

873
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,920
(to overseas in a disguised manner?)

874
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,310
(Does Huiquan's strategic development
have any direct relation)

875
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,830
(to your family's life abroad?)

876
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,520
(Huiquan will never forget its
deep roots in the domestic market)

877
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,430
(and the support of
domestic users over the years)

878
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,190
(which has solidified)

879
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:34,110
(the foundation
of our overseas development.)

880
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,280
(As the number of
Huiquan's overseas users)

881
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,560
(grows faster than domestic users,)

882
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,830
(it increases our motivation)

883
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,950
(to establish companies overseas.)

884
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,310
(We not only focus on the present)

885
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:46,070
(but also look into
the future of the next ten years.)

886
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,640
I'm so freaking full.

887
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,040
You're quite considerate, huh?

888
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,310
How many days have
you not washed your jacket?

889
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,080
Well, there's no need to keep
changing jacket all the time.

890
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,910
Have you not washed it for several days?

891
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,760
It kind of smells.

892
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:15,230
You...

893
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,190
What?

894
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,710
Next time, I'll give you a scented bead.

895
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,710
What is it for?

896
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,080
It will make your clothes smell better.

897
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,520
Just like the smell on you?

898
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,630
Hey, stop it. What are you doing?

899
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,760
Anyway, Heyu pretended to go

900
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,560
to the bathroom and paid the bill.

901
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,520
What was he thinking?

902
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,910
His situation is different from ours.

903
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,430
In our case,

904
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,950
we don't have any family burden,

905
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,040
but he, on the other hand,
needs to feed his family.

906
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,360
yet he competes with us to pay the bill.

907
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,390
He is a righteous person.

908
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,840
Although he usually appears very stingy,

909
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,020
he is the oldest among us today.

910
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,430
(Today,
I officially announce to the public)

911
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,950
(Exclusive Interview)
(Huiquan Corporation has officially)

912
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,340
(established an
offshore company overseas.)

913
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,800
(I will lead the company
into the international market)

914
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,900
(However, due to time constraints...)

915
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,580
(The recent events
have all pointed to Huiquan.)

916
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,340
Isn't it a bit too coincidental?

917
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,360
Yeah, so we need to sort out this matter.

918
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,560
Right now,
we're just blindly suspecting.

919
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,080
We don't have any concrete evidence

920
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,260
linking it to Huiquan.

921
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,580
All possible direct evidence
related to Huiquan

922
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,460
vanished along with Zhang Xiaobei.

923
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,320
We have no idea where they went.

924
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,360
Impossible!

925
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,910
Hurry up and send the photo.

926
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:34,950
Let them confirm the identity.

927
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,280
What's wrong?

928
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,950
The Nanshui City Bureau
discovered a male corpse

929
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,150
in the Qingshui River Development Zone.

930
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,230
They suspect it's Zhang Xiaobei.

931
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:56,910
Are you okay?

932
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:57,950
I'm fine.

933
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,630
Did you confirm it?

934
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,800
It's not Zhang Xiaobei.

935
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,360
Zhang Xiaobei had a scar on his leg.

936
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,840
He loved swimming, right?

937
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,560
One time, he got scratched,

938
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,150
and I was the one who
accompanied him to the hospital.

939
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,710
What kind of mystery is this?

940
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:10,520
How did his ID card

941
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,190
and phone card
end up on someone else's body?

942
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,710
You've never seen him before
when you were in school?

943
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,230
Not that.

944
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,040
I'm having stomach pain now.

945
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,910
My stomach is in pain.

946
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,560
Is it because the food
we just ate wasn't fresh?

947
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,000
Don't tough it out.
Let's go to the hospital.

948
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,320
Can you walk?

949
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,710
I can walk, it's okay.

950
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,430
Does it hurt?

951
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,320
You make it seem
as though I just had a baby.

952
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,430
Minimally invasive
appendectomy doesn't hurt.

953
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,150
Hasn't the anesthesia worn off by now?

954
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:58,220
It has.

955
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:00,220
It was a little painful just now,
hence the painkiller drip.

956
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,710
Though you had the surgery already,

957
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,080
we should not take it lightly either.

958
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,360
This is what they said online.

959
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,760
Avoid strenuous exercise
within two months after the surgery.

960
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,630
And they also said

961
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,080
you can eat after,

962
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,470
but you have to eat
vegetables and fruits,

963
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:16,150
and they have to be blended prior.

964
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,710
He Luyuan.

965
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,040
Liquid food...

966
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
The hospital will provide me
with meals like these.

967
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,760
As for you, go home and bring me some

968
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,040
clean clothes and toiletries.

969
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,230
Now?

970
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,630
Nobody is at my house now.
My parents aren't home.

971
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,950
Will you be fine here alone?

972
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,230
Yes. Besides, there are
doctors and nurses here.

973
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,840
They will be on duty soon.

974
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:34,840
Okay,

975
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
If you're not in too much pain,
just take a rest.

976
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,230
Okay.

977
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,320
Alright, I'll go and come back quickly.

978
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,430
Go then.

979
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:32,910
An Ni.

980
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,630
You're still awake, right?

981
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:35,840
Oh yeah, that's right.

982
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,560
You wouldn't have been
able to answer my call if you were.

983
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,120
Do you remember
the door password of your house?

984
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,950
I forgot.

985
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,470
It's zero-seven.

986
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,320
Good, got it.

987
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,150
That's great.

988
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,910
There are even shoe covers.

989
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,190
Who is it?

990
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,520
The property management.

991
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,230
Open the door.

992
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,760
What's the matter?

993
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,230
We received a complaint from a neighbor.

994
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,430
We've come to verify the situation.

995
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,230
Just talk here. Please don't come in.

996
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,800
Hello.

997
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,760
I'm the property manager
of this building.

998
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,760
I want to verify who you really are.

999
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,230
What are you doing here?

1000
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,360
Someone complained that

1001
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,430
you came here sneakily.

1002
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,120
Are you the owner here?

1003
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,600
I'm a friend of the owner.

1004
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,470
A friend?

1005
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:21,760
Yeah.

1006
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,000
A friend...

1007
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,040
Are you familiar with this family?

1008
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,080
You don't even know
how to open the lock, right?

1009
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,080
Yes.

1010
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,000
I'm not familiar.

1011
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,280
This is my first time here.

1012
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,560
Then do you have any identification?

1013
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,520
Show it to me.

1014
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,080
I forgot to bring my ID
when I changed clothes today.

1015
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,710
If you don't have any ID,

1016
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
then you must come to the
property management office with us.

1017
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,080
We must clarify the situation.

1018
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,000
Ah.

1019
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,470
I'm He Luyuan from the City Bureau
Criminal Investigation Division.

1020
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,180
Which police station
has jurisdiction over this area?

1021
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,460
Ask the police officer
to come over here.

1022
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,200
Police?

1023
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,120
Where is your police ID then?

1024
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,800
I changed my clothes,

1025
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:54,760
and forgot to bring it with me.

1026
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,230
You say you're a police officer,

1027
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,470
but who can believe that?

1028
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,190
In that case,

1029
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,280
since you don't have any identification,

1030
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,470
you must come with us
to the property management office.

1031
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Once the police arrive,

1032
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,080
we'll know who you are.

1033
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,710
Let's go.

1034
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,470
Let's go.

1035
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:07,080
Okay, okay, okay.

1036
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,910
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1037
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,670
Wait, I'll turn off this light.

1038
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,190
Alright.

1039
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,390
We'll be waiting for you
at the entrance.

1040
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,630
You guys take your job too seriously.

1041
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,080
Come.

1042
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,800
Let's go.

1043
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,980
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

1044
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,670
After our investigation,

1045
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,080
this Yin Huiquan and...

1046
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,280
An Ni!

1047
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:30,950
An Ni is back.

1048
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,470
You've come back.

1049
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,040
Are you feeling better?

1050
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,910
An Ni.

1051
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:36,630
Do you feel better?

1052
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,320
I'm fine.

1053
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,470
Why do you seem to have gained weight?
