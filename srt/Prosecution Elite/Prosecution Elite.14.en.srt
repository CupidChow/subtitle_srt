I am the one who should die.

16
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,447
Wanru left me.

17
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:48,926
Xiaobei caused such trouble.

18
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:51,767
I have lived

19
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:54,807
a miserable life.

20
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:57,606
I'm such a failure!

21
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:01,887
Mr. Zhang,

22
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:03,767
you can't say that.

23
00:02:04,326 --> 00:02:06,326
Wanru sacrificed herself for justice.

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,566
We will always remember her.

25
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:11,926
Xiaobei should have his reason.

26
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:24,846
Mr. Zhang,

27
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,726
Actually, He Luyuan called me over

28
00:02:27,926 --> 00:02:28,967
because he wanted me to tell you

29
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:30,206
about Zhang Xiaobei's situation.

30
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:31,887
You take one bite of this meal

31
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,807
and I'll tell you one thing, okay?

32
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:38,807
Where is he?

33
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:42,247
According to the
latest information we have,

34
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,366
Xiaobei should have gone overseas

35
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:45,167
through illegal channels.

36
00:02:45,286 --> 00:02:46,006
What?

37
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:47,766
Did he go overseas?

38
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:49,766
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

39
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:51,447
We're doing everything we can

40
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,206
to track him down.

41
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:53,527
I'll be sure to bring

42
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,087
Xiaobei over to see you soon, okay?

43
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:58,687
You trust me.

44
00:03:00,286 --> 00:03:00,687
Come on.

45
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,126
You promised me,

46
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,407
I tell you one thing,
you take a bite of this.

47
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,006
Come on.

48
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:09,087
You eat on your own.

49
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:12,206
All right.

50
00:03:14,286 --> 00:03:15,126
You must find him.

51
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:17,327
No problem.

52
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:18,926
I'll find him and bring him to you.

53
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,126
Let me get you some water.

54
00:03:29,407 --> 00:03:31,447
Bro, how did you get here?

55
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:34,607
I was thinking to earn more money.

56
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:36,126
Who would have thought of this?

57
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:37,407
Earn more money?

58
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,486
You want to get rich instantly?

59
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:40,887
There are only

60
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,447
electric batons screaming
and whips here.

61
00:03:42,726 --> 00:03:44,087
You're lucky if you can survive.

62
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:44,967
Don't think about earning money.

63
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,286
Did you get scammed over?

64
00:03:48,087 --> 00:03:49,087
If you want to leave here,

65
00:03:49,286 --> 00:03:51,047
you have to ask
your family to pay a fee,

66
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:52,967
which includes the use of the equipment,

67
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:54,766
the cost of belongings,
the cost of living,

68
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:56,726
the cost of air,

69
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,087
the cost of the keyboard

70
00:03:58,486 --> 00:03:59,766
and the cost of the floor.

71
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:03,486
How many did you owe?

72
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:05,167
Don't mention it anymore.

73
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,687
About 50.

74
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:07,607
You?

75
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:09,206
Don't mention it also.

76
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,566
I was scammed by the "Friendship Scam".

77
00:04:12,206 --> 00:04:13,206
I lost about one hundred.

78
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,926
I have no more hope.

79
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,847
I was sitting in
that computer room today,

80
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:20,766
looking at those people.

81
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:21,847
I don't like anyone.

82
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:23,446
I felt like the person who

83
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:24,247
lied to me was there,

84
00:04:24,646 --> 00:04:25,606
even with the same script.

85
00:04:28,326 --> 00:04:29,926
Bro, were you also

86
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:31,287
scammed by the "Friendship Scam?"

87
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:32,727
Sort of.

88
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:34,766
Well.

89
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,527
Go to sleep.

90
00:04:35,687 --> 00:04:36,527
We need to wake up early tomorrow.

91
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:37,606
Everyone sleeps.

92
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:40,446
What kind of day did I have on this day?

93
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:54,606
Where are you?

94
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:57,567
Come, come, come.

95
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:58,287
Please.

96
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,527
Professor, is Xiaoting at home?

97
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:02,847
She isn't at home.

98
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:03,687
Have a seat.

99
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:08,567
Well.

100
00:05:09,127 --> 00:05:09,926
I'll start working

101
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,206
in lockdown in a few days.

102
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:12,486
I was afraid that Xiaoting
might have something urgent

103
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:13,166
and she couldn't reach me,

104
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,166
so I called her

105
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,926
but she turned off her phone,
so I came to look for her.

106
00:05:16,326 --> 00:05:18,007
Professor, do I disturb you?

107
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:19,127
No, no.

108
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:20,166
How are you?

109
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,007
Do you get used to
the new job in Huiquan?

110
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:23,886
It's great.

111
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:26,287
That's good.

112
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:29,807
Professor,

113
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:32,486
When we were at school,

114
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,007
we had a heated discussion

115
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,646
about the plot of a foreign movie.

116
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:36,766
Do you still remember?

117
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:39,166
It was about a diplomat
who found that there was

118
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,007
a problem in the
judicial system of his country

119
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,886
and disclosed it to
a newspaper reporter.

120
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:44,046
At that time, many classmates

121
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:45,567
didn't agree with his approach.

122
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:46,687
But you said that

123
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:47,967
his approach actually

124
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:50,206
made the national
judiciary system better.

125
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,407
He wasn't unpatriotic.

126
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:53,366
I think this theory

127
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:54,727
is also applicable to corporations,

128
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:55,886
applicable to Huiquan.

129
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:02,046
An Ni,

130
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,766
I understand what you mean.

131
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:06,407
There are 3 points

132
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:08,087
I want to talk about Huiquan.

133
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:11,366
Firstly, Since I worked at Huiquan,

134
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:13,326
I haven't found any problems yet.

135
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:18,407
Secondly, It's also against the
bottom line of professional ethics

136
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:22,326
to disclose the company you work for.

137
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:27,247
I've never done this in my life.

138
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:28,687
I hope you can understand.

139
00:06:30,247 --> 00:06:30,926
Thirdly,

140
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:33,567
You can also ask Yitang about this.

141
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:35,567
We all know the law

142
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,567
and would never take sides with Huiquan

143
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,886
on a matter of principle.

144
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:41,247
Professor, I understand.

145
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:43,967
Actually, we encountered some obstacles

146
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:45,127
in handling the case a while ago.

147
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,007
I saw that the script
sent out by Huiquan

148
00:06:47,046 --> 00:06:48,486
was very much like your style of work,

149
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,247
and since we hadn't talked
for a long time,

150
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,326
I came to visit you.

151
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:53,687
Professor,

152
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:55,206
our procuratorate has

153
00:06:55,287 --> 00:06:56,606
the procedures for handling cases.

154
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:58,166
We just talk about it casually.

155
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:02,127
Wait a minute.

156
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:04,326
Look.

157
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:09,926
Come.

158
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:12,886
This book

159
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,247
introduces the two different legal systems

160
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:17,807
in the world today.

161
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:19,087
You take it and read.

162
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:22,087
Professor, I don't use
this book at the moment.

163
00:07:22,606 --> 00:07:23,206
You take it.

164
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:24,206
You'll use it in the future.

165
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:26,646
All right.

166
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:27,766
Then I'll take it.

167
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:28,807
Thank you, professor.

168
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:30,886
It's getting late,

169
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:31,727
I'll go back first.

170
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:33,087
Rest well.

171
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:34,366
When Xiaoting comes back later,

172

Why aren't we sitting
next to each other?

211
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:16,487
It's good to have a seat.

It looks like you
to me from a distance.

222
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:32,446
What a coincidence.

223

Oh! I'm sorry.

Just forget about it.

Mr. Xiao is also going abroad?

on a business trip to Thailand.

Oh.

235
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,487
Should we board the plane now?

237
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:56,487
it's time for us to go.

238
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:57,527
We need to board the plane quickly.

239
00:09:58,047 --> 00:09:58,326
All right.

240
00:09:58,446 --> 00:09:59,126

251
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:48,287
Wake up.

252
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:52,367
Is this a bit crowded?

253
00:10:52,646 --> 00:10:54,006
Why not we exchange our seats?

254
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,367
You can stretch your legs.

255
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:56,126
Okay?

256
00:10:57,047 --> 00:10:58,167
I'm together with her.

257
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:03,407
Thank you.

258
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:43,607
Excuse me.

259
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:45,087
Please give me a blanket.

260

I know everything you said.

265
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:42,607
But I think

266
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:45,126
your current situation isn't very good.

267
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,246
They should all have their eyes on you.

268
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:54,727
You scare me!

269
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:57,646
Why are you still awake?

270
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,087
I answer a phone call

271
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,047
from a foreign country.

272
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,487
There is a time difference.

273
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:03,886
Go to sleep.

274
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,766
No wonder you can't sleep at night.

275
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:23,126
You didn't finish your milk.

276
00:13:23,246 --> 00:13:26,287
The doctor said that
drinking milk helps you sleep.

277
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:27,287
Come.

278
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,646
Finish your milk.

279
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:36,607
Drink the milk every night, okay?

280
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:41,167
Sleep.

281
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:30,240
Darn it.

282
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:31,927
How can you deal with such a card?

283
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:33,686
Who do you help to get a flush with it?

284
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:34,646
It's a trick.

285
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:35,886
I don't want to play anymore.

286
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:39,527
Someone is scared away before

288
00:14:41,927 --> 00:14:42,607
Why?

289
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:44,087
Is there anyone

290
00:14:44,646 --> 00:14:45,766
who wants to give up?

291
00:14:46,246 --> 00:14:47,167
What are you talking about?

292
00:14:47,646 --> 00:14:49,246
Do you think you're
the only one who's rich?

293

Which of us

294
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:51,686
is not prominent in the Sanjiang

295
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:52,566
Chinese community?

296
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:56,326
Just play and lose.

297
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,900
Wow.

298
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,087
Qian Tianxin,

299
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:20,326
you'll be game over.

300
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,886
You can't be a royal flush.

301
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,200
All in.

302
00:15:38,686 --> 00:15:39,487
Someone had arrived home.

303
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:40,847
You need to go back now.

304
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:42,087
Got it.

305
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,206
I told you,

306
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:58,527
whoever comes,

307
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:00,527
the result is the same.

308
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,727
Because this is my home field.

309
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,446
I will never lose.

310
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:14,206
Next time,

311
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:16,527
remember this.

312
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:19,087
Let's go.

313
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:26,487
Come on.

314
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:27,566
Here.

315
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:29,607
One more.

316
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:31,886
Again?

317
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:33,607
I can't drink anymore.

318
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:34,446
Just drink.

319
00:16:35,087 --> 00:16:36,487
Otherwise, how do we spend this night?

320
00:16:37,006 --> 00:16:38,287
Can you sleep after you go back?

321
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:42,206
It's suffering.

322
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:46,847
I remember the last time
I was so worried,

323
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,727
it was in the Anti-Drug Division.

324
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:51,927
Yes.

325
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:54,446
That's been ten years, right?

326
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:58,326
I remember that time when Gao Rui

327
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:02,407
disguised himself as an undercover agent

328
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,526
to lure that guy
named Yan something, right?

329
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,406
It was the day that
Gao Rui went to trade with them,

330
00:17:10,566 --> 00:17:12,446
that made me so worried.

331
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:15,647
How time flies.

332
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,526
Gao Rui is a senior now.

333
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:19,926
True.

334
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:25,046
As I get older now,

335
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:28,607
I often think that...

336
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,967
Do you know what do I scare now?

337
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:35,526
Some people leave,

338
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:36,926
and some people stay.

339
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,446
I scare this the most.

340
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:45,526
Did you hear about

341
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,647
Yang Weidong passed away

342
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,206
three days ago?

343
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:55,526
I heard about this yesterday.

344
00:17:56,847 --> 00:17:58,647
Is it because of pancreatic cancer?

345
00:17:59,367 --> 00:17:59,967
Yes.

346
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,046
Once diagnosed,

347
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:04,286
doctors said he had

348
00:18:05,326 --> 00:18:07,007
no more than three months to live.

349
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,607
But in the last two months,

350
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:13,087
he continued to work twenty-three days.

351
00:18:14,007 --> 00:18:15,446
This makes me feel...

352
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:16,446
I...

353
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:19,406
I'm sorry to meet
his family and children.

354
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:24,887
I feel guilty.

355
00:18:31,087 --> 00:18:35,967
Our industry is an industry that protects

356
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,526
the country and the people.

357
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:41,847
From the day we put on this uniform,

358
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:44,727
we are destined to
be harder than others,

359
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,847
and more dangerous than others.

360
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,446
What do we want from this job?

361
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:53,767
Isn't it the pride in our hearts?

362
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:00,847
I believe that Yang Weidong
must have left

363
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,647
a lot of regrets after he passed away.

364
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:04,607
But he was glorious

365
00:19:05,526 --> 00:19:06,647
and went with honour.

366
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:09,087
This is true,

367
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,166
and this makes sense.

368
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:18,446
But I still feel sorry for him.

369
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:20,007
What is this called?

370
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:21,727
People are so

371
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:24,166
sentimental when they get old.

372
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:27,127
These days, I often think of

373
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:28,847
when we were young,

374
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:30,087
we were so energetic

375
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,367
and worked together.

376
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,166
That energy.

377
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:36,286
That time when you're transferred from

378
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:38,406
Public Security Bureau
to the Procuratorate,

379
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:41,007
I felt lonely for a while.

380
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,806
I was transferred from the army

381
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:47,127
to the Public Security Bureau
as a criminal investigator,

382
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:49,926
and then transferred to the Procuratorate,

383
00:19:50,526 --> 00:19:52,326
I've worked in every
one of these departments.

384
00:19:53,566 --> 00:19:55,127
I'm old now,

385
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,847
but I have to learn
to handle cybercrime cases.

386
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,526
A mobile phone and a computer

387
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:03,326
can destruct so many families.

388
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,206
This is terrible.

389
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:07,767
So to be honest,

390
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:09,286
what am I thinking now is

391
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:11,166
let's work together to fight

392
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:13,487
this last battle well.

393
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:15,406
Even if you let me retire tomorrow,

394
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:16,087
I'll accept it.

395
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:21,926
So this time, it's up to An Ni.

396
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:27,326
Let's drink tea instead,

397
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:30,767
wish He Luyuan and An Ni's team victory,

398
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,526
also to Yang Weidong.

399
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:54,286
It didn't take long to fly,

400
00:20:54,326 --> 00:20:56,526
but how could I
sleep all over in pain?

401
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,007
Let me wash my face.

402
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:00,566
Help me to take my bag.

403
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:02,847
You two help to take the luggage.

404
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,566
I'm going to get some change first.

405
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:04,727
Yes, help me to take the luggage.

406
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:05,566
No problem.

407
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:06,326
Ni, you get more change.

408
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:07,686
Ouch.

409
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:15,607
Look here!

410
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:16,526
Come to my side!

411
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,526
May I help you?

412
00:21:24,286 --> 00:21:24,967
Come to my side!

413
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:26,727
It seems that we are not welcome.

414
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:29,007
You see the white taxi on my left.

415
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,847
Someone over there
has been taking pictures with a camera.

416
00:21:35,686 --> 00:21:36,686
This car is supposed to pick us up.

417
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:44,647
How are you?

418
00:21:45,286 --> 00:21:46,967
I'm Jose, Senior Inspector of

419
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,406
Sanjiang City Police Bureau.

420
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:51,446
Upon orders from the judicial department
and Investigation Bureau of Country F,

421
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:54,967
I have come to communicate
with representatives of

422
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:56,206
the special task force from China.

423
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,087
Hi, I'm He Luyuan.

424
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:58,487
Hi.

425
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,566
This is Prosecutor An Ni.

426
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:00,206
- Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,767
This is her assistant, Han Xuan.

428
00:22:01,806 --> 00:22:03,247
This is my partner, Long Yanling.

429
00:22:03,487 --> 00:22:04,087
Hi.

430
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:05,847
We're just an advanced team.

431
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:06,926
The rest of the team will be here soon.

432
00:22:06,967 --> 00:22:07,526
We come to

433
00:22:07,566 --> 00:22:09,206
know about the local situation first.

434
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:11,326
I advise you that

435
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,847
it's better not to
simply walk around town.

436
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:14,406
You don't know much about Sanjiang.

437
00:22:15,446 --> 00:22:16,847
So, are you guys leaving or not?

438
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:18,206
I'm very busy.

439
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:21,046
I wouldn't bother
getting involved in these things

440
00:22:21,326 --> 00:22:23,206
if my superiors
hadn't given me such an order.

441
00:22:26,767 --> 00:22:27,566
Get in the car.

442
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:29,686
We take the car behind.

443
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:54,607
Ni, I think they take this care seriously.

444
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:56,127
They even sent a
senior inspector over to pick us up.

445
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:57,007
Is his post high?

446
00:22:57,526 --> 00:22:58,446
Senior inspector

447
00:22:58,487 --> 00:22:59,806
is just an ordinary police

448
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,247
in the local police system.

449
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,206
If you want to compare,

450
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:05,247
his post is lower than Captain He's.

451
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:30,967
Stand up!

452
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:33,806
I'm chatting with the customer.

453
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,166
I almost success, really.

454
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:35,887
Don't talk nonsense to me.

455
00:23:35,926 --> 00:23:36,647
Stand up!

456
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:46,847
Who else is in the same dorm with him?

457
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:48,286
Stand up, all of you!

458
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:49,526
Hurry up!

459
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,166
Boss wants to talk to you.

460
00:24:18,406 --> 00:24:19,326
Say it!

461
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:21,607
You better say it!

462
00:24:22,526 --> 00:24:23,367
Don't hit me!

463
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:24,727
Stop it!

464
00:24:27,326 --> 00:24:27,926
Hurry up!

465
00:24:28,007 --> 00:24:28,326
Call!

466
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:29,526
Continue to call!

467
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:35,206
You say it or not?

468
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:39,526
Stop hitting me!

469
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:40,446
Say it or not!

470
00:24:40,607 --> 00:24:41,406
You don't want to say?

471
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:42,526
Continue!

472
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,127
Call!

473
00:24:50,487 --> 00:24:51,247
Continue to call!

474
00:24:51,607 --> 00:24:52,526
Call until someone answers it.

475
00:24:53,127 --> 00:24:54,127
If you can't call successfully today,

476
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:55,166
I'll kill you.

477
00:24:55,887 --> 00:24:57,087
I beg you don't hit me!

478
00:24:57,127 --> 00:24:57,727
Don't hit me!

479
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,286
Hello! Hello! Mom!

480
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:02,326
Mom, you transfer money to me quickly!

481
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:04,247
I can't take it anymore!

482
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,247
Quickly!

483
00:25:06,286 --> 00:25:07,087
Don't hit me!

484
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:08,446
I beg you, mom!

485
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,487
I can't take it anymore here!

486
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:12,806
I beg you!

487
00:25:13,526 --> 00:25:14,326
Don't hit me!

488
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:15,647
I beg you!

489
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:26,806
Wei.

490
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:30,166
Say it quickly!

491
00:25:34,607 --> 00:25:35,526
Say it or not?

492
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,166
Continue to hit!

493
00:25:44,326 --> 00:25:46,247
I think you were told about this by

494
00:25:46,686 --> 00:25:48,487
a teacher on your first day here, right?

495
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:51,847
I don't do charity here.

496
00:25:52,406 --> 00:25:54,206
The money I spent on you,

497
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:56,526
including transportation, clothing,

498
00:25:56,607 --> 00:25:58,686
management, training, accommodation,

499
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,566
which one don't need money?

500
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:04,326
Unexpectedly, someone thought of

501
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,487
running away without
compensating me with the money.

502
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:08,767
Don't hit me!

503
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,087
These two guys

504
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:13,247
even tried to sneak off while using

505
00:26:13,286 --> 00:26:14,007
the toilet this morning.

506
00:26:14,046 --> 00:26:14,967
They want to go to the police station

507
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,406
to find the police to protect you.

508
00:26:17,926 --> 00:26:18,767
Unfortunately,

509
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:21,566
your plan had failed.

510
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:29,607
You guys are in the same dorm
with them, right?

511
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:36,007
Are you thinking of running away too?

512
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:39,326
Or do you want to find
the police to protect you?

513
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,326
No, we won't.

514
00:26:41,926 --> 00:26:42,446
We don't dare.

515
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:43,046
We really won't do that.

516
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,967
The company spent

517
00:26:52,127 --> 00:26:53,727
a lot of money on you guys.

518
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:56,727
You don't appreciate it.

519
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:00,686
I ask you the last time,

520
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,806
Do you compensate for

521
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,367
the company's losses?

522
00:27:06,607 --> 00:27:08,406
I just came here for two days

523
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:10,727
and you're asking me
to pay you 100,000 yuan,

524
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:12,566
how can I have the money to pay you?

525
00:27:12,806 --> 00:27:15,487
I was already in debt in China

526
00:27:15,566 --> 00:27:17,127
and ran over.

527
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:20,806
My relatives and friends
had already blocked me.

528
00:27:21,286 --> 00:27:23,647
Who can I borrow money from?

529
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:31,166
You guys come to my company,

530
00:27:32,046 --> 00:27:34,607
neither willing to create
value for the company

531
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:37,247
nor to compensate
my company for the losses.

532
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:39,326
You are just like hob meat.

533
00:27:39,367 --> 00:27:40,967
It's really difficult for me.

534
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,926
Boss, please let me go!

535
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:44,326
My family is very poor.

536
00:27:44,526 --> 00:27:45,566
I can do nothing.

537
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:46,446
I'm useless!

538
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:47,206
I'm useless!

539
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:48,446
I'm useless! I'm useless!

540
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:49,847
I can do nothing!

541
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:50,446
Boss!

542
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,326
You're not useless.

543
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:53,767
Let me tell you.

544
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:57,487
Everyone has their value,

545
00:27:57,686 --> 00:27:58,686
including you.

546
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,166
I think you guys

547
00:28:02,007 --> 00:28:03,326
are unable to pay the money.

548
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:08,526
I think if I don't maximize your value,

549
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:11,686
then I'll be here for nothing.

550
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:14,686
All right.

551
00:28:15,406 --> 00:28:16,127
Settle them.

552
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:19,127
Send these people

553
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,406
to the workspace,

554
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:23,247
then throw them outside.

555
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:25,686
Show to the people under me,

556
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:28,526
if any of you dare not pay

557
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:31,446
or meet my workload target,

558
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:32,686
that's fine.

559
00:28:33,206 --> 00:28:35,127
Go ahead!

560
00:28:36,406 --> 00:28:38,007
I'm waiting.

561
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:42,727
Boss, it's our fault! It's our fault!

562
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:45,326
Boss, it's our fault!

563
00:28:53,887 --> 00:28:55,286
It's so hot here!

564
00:28:57,127 --> 00:28:58,406
How's it? Can it be switched on?

565
00:28:58,526 --> 00:28:59,686
It's not responding.

566
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:02,406
There's no wind.

567
00:29:03,446 --> 00:29:05,046
It's really difficult for the inspector

568
00:29:05,127 --> 00:29:06,406
to find such a place for us.

569
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,607
Ni, do you feel weird?

570
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:14,727
It's not travelling season now.

571
00:29:14,847 --> 00:29:16,446
Look, we'd been all over town,

572
00:29:16,686 --> 00:29:17,926
they say there's
no room in the hotel,

573
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:19,446
but there's room here,

574
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:21,206
just enough for the four of us.

575
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:22,967
What a coincidence!

576
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:25,326
I think it's only the beginning.

577
00:29:25,607 --> 00:29:26,806
Why not we go out?

578
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:28,607
The room is so stuffy.

579
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:31,247
I saw there's karaoke downstairs.

580
00:29:31,367 --> 00:29:32,087
Han Xuan,

581
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:33,967
do you think we're coming to have fun?

582
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,926
Can you have a sense of crisis?

583
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:38,566
Ni, Jose said he'll take

584
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,286
the four of us to the local

585
00:29:40,326 --> 00:29:41,967
Procuratorate tomorrow.

586
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,406
We just take a rest for one day.

587
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:44,326
Come on.

588
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:45,166
Just one day!

589
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,286
Okay, okay, okay.

590
00:29:46,406 --> 00:29:47,286
Go back and take a break.

591
00:29:47,326 --> 00:29:48,806
Gather in the corridor after 10 minutes.

592
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:50,127
See you later.

593
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:54,727
Why are you so hurry?

594
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,326
Help me to take the luggage!

595
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:56,887
Ouch.

596
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:28,007
You also put on sunglasses.

597
00:31:30,887 --> 00:31:32,127
You really wear shorts!

598
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,326
Where are your clothes from?

599
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:34,367
Didn't you lose the luggage?

600
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:35,926
I have the shorts in my bag.

601
00:31:38,046 --> 00:31:39,406
We seem like coming for vacation.

602
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,326
Refreshing, right?

603
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:42,166
You're the only one feeling refreshing.
Let's go!

604
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:43,007
Let's go!

605
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:48,127
Come in.

606
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:50,247
(Chief Procurator's Office)
Prosecutor Guo,

607
00:31:50,767 --> 00:31:51,446
do you look for me?

608
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:53,806
Have a seat.

609
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:56,566
What happened?

610
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:58,166
You seem to be unhappy.

611
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:00,526
Did your wife make you angry?

612
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:02,127
Don't talk nonsense.

613
00:32:04,166 --> 00:32:05,007
Look at this.

614
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,206
Isn't this An Ni?

615
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:08,847
(Introduction of An Ni)

616
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:09,727
(the prosecutor of No.4 Procurator's Office)
Why?

617
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:10,847
(Physical Characteristics)
(Height 168cm, Weight 47kg)

618
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:12,166
(Arrive at Sanjiang on 7th June)
She's not even reached Country F,

619
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:13,446
are you going to give her credit?

620
00:32:15,446 --> 00:32:17,487
This was just sent to
the Supreme People's

621
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,806
Procuratorate by the
judicial department of Country F.

622
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,767
Six hours ago, they cracked down on

623
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:25,367
a spot of cross-border crimes

624
00:32:25,406 --> 00:32:27,046
in the Sanjiang area of Country F.

625
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:31,046
This is material found on
a henchman's mobile phone.

626
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:33,887
It details the identity of An Ni

627
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:35,206
as a China prosecutor,

628
00:32:36,046 --> 00:32:37,926
as well as her height,
physical characteristics,

629
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:39,926
clothing, arrival time,

630
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:41,566
and even personal preferences

631
00:32:41,607 --> 00:32:42,487
and family situation.

632
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:46,686
An Ni hadn't arrived yet

633
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:48,566
six hours ago.

634
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:50,087
She's still at the airport in China.

635
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,046
Do you know the severity of the problem?

636
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:57,286
Our prosecutor was going to

637
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,166
Country F to work on a case,

638
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:01,647
and the criminals
had all the information about her

639
00:33:01,767 --> 00:33:03,647
before she even got on the plane.

640
00:33:04,206 --> 00:33:05,887
What do they want to do after this?

641
00:33:08,007 --> 00:33:11,326
I mean that you may contact
An Ni immediately

642
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:13,286
and tell them to take extra precautions.

643
00:33:13,686 --> 00:33:14,806
Do not simply take action.

644
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,127
Also, inform the embassy
and consulates of F country,

645
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:19,847
coordinate with the local police

646
00:33:20,127 --> 00:33:21,367
and make emergency plans.

647
00:33:21,526 --> 00:33:23,326
In addition, we need to inform

648
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:26,286
the task force team to set off immediately

649
00:33:26,566 --> 00:33:28,127
and meet up with An Ni's team
as soon as possible.

650
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:31,647
An Ni and the team
are going to fight alone,

651
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:34,847
and this makes me feel worried.

652
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:39,847
Prosecutor Guo.

653
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:40,367
Yes?

654
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:43,286
I suddenly remembered something funny.

655
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:44,847
Do you remember?

656
00:33:44,926 --> 00:33:48,806
During the spring festival show
here at the Procuratorate,

657
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:50,727
you performed a show which was

658
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:54,806
turning the card into a pigeon.

659
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:58,806
There are a lot of people

660
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:00,607
having their eyes on you.

661
00:34:01,326 --> 00:34:05,166
You performed turning
the card into a pigeon.

662
00:34:05,487 --> 00:34:07,487
It's an amazing show!

663
00:34:08,766 --> 00:34:13,046
Wang Heyu, I'm serious now.

664
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:15,607
I'm also serious now.

665
00:34:16,326 --> 00:34:17,447
You might have forgotten,

666
00:34:17,927 --> 00:34:19,367
since you went on the stage,

667
00:34:20,407 --> 00:34:25,447
we kept on looking at your sleeves.

668
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:29,566
But you're not afraid.

669
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:33,486
You shook your hands,

670
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,246
the card became the pigeon.

671
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:42,207
Deceptive trick.

672
00:35:05,087 --> 00:35:06,766
You're right.

673
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,526
We landed with eyes on us.

674
00:35:10,087 --> 00:35:11,207
I just confirmed that

675
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:12,647
everything in the room is broken,

676
00:35:13,087 --> 00:35:14,687
including the air conditioning,

677
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:15,687
wireless network and sockets.

678
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:18,046
I guess the only
useful electrical appliance

679
00:35:18,087 --> 00:35:19,766
is the bug under the table.

680
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,367
There's even a bug.

681
00:35:22,326 --> 00:35:23,526
It's going to be

682
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:25,246
much worse than we thought.

683
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:27,647
If there's any
discussion about the case,

684
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:28,887
we will proceed here.

685
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:29,687
Agree.

686
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,167
What should we do now?

687
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:35,966
Should we just wait for

688
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:37,447
people to come to us?

689
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:38,806
Hello.

690
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:42,806
All right.

691
00:35:43,367 --> 00:35:43,726
Yes.

692
00:35:45,286 --> 00:35:46,046
Why?

693
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:48,726
Answer your question just now.

694
00:35:48,966 --> 00:35:50,407
I think we should take action first.

695
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:54,046
The advanced team is just four of us.

696
00:35:54,687 --> 00:35:56,407
The rest of the team hasn't arrived yet.

697
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:57,726
We're in a foreign country.

698
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:59,286
It's dangerous to go out there.

699
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:00,367
It's not four of us going out together,

700
00:36:00,486 --> 00:36:01,687
I'll go out with Han Xuan first.

701
00:36:01,766 --> 00:36:02,806
You two are here to take cover.

702
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,087
That's more dangerous.

703
00:36:04,367 --> 00:36:05,927
It's more dangerous
if we're not going out.

704
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,966
Someone is watching us out there.

705
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:10,087
Ni, where do we go?

706
00:36:11,326 --> 00:36:12,566
You just follow me.

707
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:19,167
Be careful.

708
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:41,087
Come in.

709
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:49,647
Ms, the new batch of bait had arrived.

710
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,207
Do you want to check it out?

711
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:52,847
Okay.

712
00:36:53,006 --> 00:36:53,806
Got it.

713
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:55,407
Tell them to wait for me at the foyer.

714
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,006
Got it.

715
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:29,927
Mr, can we go now?

716
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:30,847
No.

717
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:34,326
We have something to do.

718
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:38,887
The most important thing is eating.

719
00:37:43,486 --> 00:37:44,286
Enjoy.

720
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,780
(Sanjiang Procuratorate, Country F)

721
00:38:04,607 --> 00:38:06,647
No entry without formal attire.

722
00:38:07,447 --> 00:38:09,847
Hi. We're prosecutors from China.

723
00:38:10,326 --> 00:38:11,526
We have an invitation from

724
00:38:11,526 --> 00:38:12,887
the Chief Procurator, Mr. Raphael.

725
00:38:13,486 --> 00:38:15,607
Please inform Mr. Raphael immediately.

726
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:17,447
Here is the main entrance.

727
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:18,566
Nothing special.

728
00:38:18,647 --> 00:38:19,566
There's an idiot.

729
00:38:20,887 --> 00:38:21,806
Look at her outfit,

730
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,766
she said she's a prosecutor.

731
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:26,046
I think she's sending
Mr. Raphael's food order.

732
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:27,367
What is he talking about?

733
00:38:28,887 --> 00:38:30,927
If you inform Mr. Raphael immediately,

734
00:38:31,087 --> 00:38:33,486
I promise not to tell him
what you had just said.

735
00:38:35,447 --> 00:38:37,207
Mr. Raphael, there's a visitor.

736
00:38:38,006 --> 00:38:39,127
I'm so sorry.

737
00:38:39,766 --> 00:38:40,286
Never mind.

738
00:38:44,326 --> 00:38:45,806
What a surprise!

739
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:46,766
Mr. Raphael.

740
00:38:47,607 --> 00:38:48,127
Welcome.

741
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,447
Welcome both from China.

742
00:38:52,006 --> 00:38:53,806
Why did you two come alone?

743
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:55,847
I thought you wouldn't come to see me

744
00:38:55,887 --> 00:38:57,526
until you met with the China task force

745
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:58,526
in a couple of days.

746
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:00,966
If it wasn't for the emergency,

747
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:02,407
we wouldn't take this action.

748
00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:04,447
I feel so sorry to meet you like this

749
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:05,367
for the first time.

750
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:06,286
No, no, no.

751
00:39:06,326 --> 00:39:06,766
Well.

752
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:07,887
Let's talk inside.

753
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:10,087
Ms. An Ni, Mr. Han Xu, please.

754
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:11,566
Han Xuan,

755
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:12,966
not Han Xu.

756
00:39:13,046 --> 00:39:13,887
Han Xuan.

757
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:14,687
Han Xuan, Han Xuan.

758
00:39:22,887 --> 00:39:24,647
Is this how humans live?

759
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:27,966
We pretend as women
during the day to cheat money,

760
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:31,367
we become labours at night to do chores.

761
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:35,367
Sometimes I think I'd rather be dead.

762
00:39:36,726 --> 00:39:39,006
You'd better speak louder

763
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,687
so that she can hear you.

764
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:42,046
At that time,

765
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,887
you really will wish you were dead.

766
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:46,367
You're right.

767
00:39:47,207 --> 00:39:49,927
Compared to the two guys who ran away,

768
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:54,087
our roommates ended up pretty good.

769
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:57,167
At least we're not in trouble.

770
00:39:57,647 --> 00:40:00,607
We're still fine.

771
00:40:01,726 --> 00:40:04,207
It's really lucky.

772
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,566
Hey, Xiaobei,

773
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:19,127
do you still have
the thought of escaping?

774
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:23,966
Otherwise, you want to be here forever?

775
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:25,006
Stay here until we die?

776
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:28,566
Of course not.

777
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,847
I dream every night,

778
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:34,207
sleeping in the same bed
with my wife and children.

779
00:40:34,806 --> 00:40:36,966
But be patient,

780
00:40:37,486 --> 00:40:39,246
otherwise, you'll end up

781
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:40,847
like those two guys who escaped.

782
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:42,766
Just wait.

783
00:40:42,887 --> 00:40:44,046
Just wait.

784
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:49,046
Perhaps the Chinese police

785
00:40:49,766 --> 00:40:51,167
will send us home?

786
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,687
What are you thinking about?

787
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,087
Are you crazy?

788
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:55,607
This is Country F.

789
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:57,847
Where got Chinese police here?

790
00:40:59,006 --> 00:40:59,927
Lower your voice.

791
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:02,687
Don't stop. Continue your work.

792
00:41:04,726 --> 00:41:05,407
Continue.

793
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:06,927
It's annoying.

794
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:11,087
Let me tell you.

795
00:41:11,566 --> 00:41:14,526
I came here a bit earlier than you,

796
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:16,887
it wasn't like this before.

797
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:19,286
They would bring us out and

798
00:41:19,806 --> 00:41:22,486
play around two days in a month.

799
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:28,246
But all of them
have been very nervous lately.

800
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:31,087
I had heard whispers

801
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:33,127
between them several times,

802
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,847
saying that no one
is allowed to leave here.

803
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:41,127
It seems that
they don't let people from China

804
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:42,887
get the goods on them.

805
00:41:48,486 --> 00:41:49,367
What are you dawdling on?

806
00:41:50,687 --> 00:41:51,486
Just a little work,

807
00:41:51,486 --> 00:41:52,806
you can't finish it yet.

808
00:41:53,207 --> 00:41:54,407
Do you want to get hit?

809
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,486
A little more left,

810
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:57,607
almost done.

811
00:41:59,006 --> 00:41:59,966
Okay, stop it.

812
00:42:00,887 --> 00:42:02,286
Tidy up the things and follow me.

813
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:05,486
There's something
good waiting for you.

814
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,726
What is going on today?

815
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,486
They called us to come over again.

816
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:18,726
How do I know?

817
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,927
We do nothing wrong lately, right?

818
00:42:22,127 --> 00:42:23,167
Of course!

819
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,167
We work so hard.

820
00:42:27,006 --> 00:42:28,766
The workload target is almost met.

821
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:31,167
There should be nothing wrong.

822
00:42:31,246 --> 00:42:32,087
Look at you all,

823
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:35,207
so outdated, haven't seen the world.
