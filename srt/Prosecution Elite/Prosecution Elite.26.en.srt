(Dad, why aren't you answering
your phone?)

00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:50,086
(Is there still
a problem with Huiquan Games?)

17
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:51,765
(Zhang Xiaobei suddenly quit.)

18
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:57,845
Problem?

19
00:01:58,165 --> 00:01:59,006
What kind of problem?

20
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:03,366
But didn't Zhang Xiaobei agree

21
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,366
to do a live stream at Huiquan?

22
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:10,806
(If there was no problem,)

23
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:12,965
(why would he suddenly refuse to do it?)

24
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,485
(He even said he's going to see An Ni
at the procuratorate.)

25
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:19,045
Hello, Professor Luo.

26
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:21,886
Yitang,

27
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:22,646
can...

28
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,205
Can you be honest with me?

29
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,886
Is there anything problematic

30
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,726
with Huiquan Games?

31
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:32,166
What's wrong?

32
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,246
Why are you asking this out of a sudden?

33
00:02:34,765 --> 00:02:36,565
Did someone say something to you?

34
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:39,366
It's Zhang Xiaobei.

35
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,965
I don't know what he told Xiaoting

36
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:45,526
that she kept calling me,

37
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,526
leaving me confused right now.

38
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:50,605
Zhang Xiaobei is an impulsive person.

39
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:53,526
What does it matter to you what he says?

40
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,605
Besides Xiaoting is too naive.

41
00:02:55,685 --> 00:02:56,965
She believes anything
without checking the facts.

42
00:02:57,205 --> 00:02:58,325
Listen to me

43
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,845
and don't let them get too close.

44
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:01,325
It won't benefit Xiaoting.

45
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,286
You're right.

46
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:04,685
I think so too.

47
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:07,726
But from her tone of voice,

48
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:10,246
it didn't sound like
she was causing trouble for no reason.

49
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:12,526
If...

50
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:16,446
If Huiquan Games is problematic...

51
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,205
Problematic?

52
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:19,726
What could be problematic about it?

53
00:03:22,446 --> 00:03:23,446
I don't think

54
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:25,765
Zhang Xiaobei told Xiaoting about it.

55
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,646
Then it's even more questionable.

56
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,485
Doesn't that mean
there's no solid evidence?

57
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:32,685
But Xiaoting said

58
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:35,405
Zhang Xiaobei is on his way
to see An Ni.

59
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,166
Did Zhang Xiaobei say that in person?

60
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:38,446
I supposed so.

61
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,205
Otherwise, Xiaoting won't keep calling me.

62
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:46,765
All right.

63
00:03:46,765 --> 00:03:47,726
I understand now.

64
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:50,125
How about this, Professor Luo?

65
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:52,205
Don't tell anyone about this yet,

66
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,806
including Chairman Yin.

67
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:56,926
I'm sure you know

68
00:03:56,926 --> 00:04:00,286
everyone in the company
is feeling uneasy.

69
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:05,166
I understand.

70
00:04:05,965 --> 00:04:07,765
Don't shake everyone's morale.

71
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:10,366
Okay.

72
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:11,565
I'll get back inside then.

73
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:12,325
Okay.

74
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,400
(Li Yitang: Is there any problem
with Huiquan Games?)

75
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:38,940
(Zhang Xiaobei went to see An Ni.
I don't know what he'll say to her.)

76
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,940
(Li Yitang)

77
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:44,045
(Hello?)

78
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:45,566
(Where did you hear this from?)

79
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:47,205
Professor Luo told me.

80
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:50,325
I think Zhang Xiaobei said something
to Luo Xiaoting.

81
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:52,445
Xiaoting contacted Professor Luo
right after.

82
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:53,846
(Even Professor Luo)

83
00:04:53,846 --> 00:04:55,605
(starts questioning this matter.)

84
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:56,165
All right.

85
00:04:56,285 --> 00:04:57,285
I got it.

86
00:04:57,605 --> 00:04:58,605
You don't have to worry
about these anymore.

87
00:04:58,966 --> 00:04:59,846
I'll handle it.

88
00:05:04,686 --> 00:05:05,485
Hello?

89
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,860
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

90
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:20,686
(The host is impressive.)
(Ladies and gentlemen,)

91
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:23,086
(welcome to "Qiu Qiu Talks,")

92

00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,325
(I'm rooting for you.)
(Those familiar with my show know)

94
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,566
(that I always speak my mind.)

95
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:29,686
(I say whatever comes to my mind)

96
00:05:29,725 --> 00:05:31,246
(without fear of offending anyone,)

97
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,966
(I can't believe such people exist.)
(especially those so-called "big shots")

98
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:35,005
(in our city of Jiangcheng.)

99
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,566
(Yes, I'm going
to offend someone again.)

100
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,966
(Can you guess who?)

101
00:05:41,485 --> 00:05:42,605
(Let me know in the comments)

102
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:44,285
(by typing their name on the screen.)

103
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:48,126
(Recently, a viewer asked me)

104
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:49,846
(if I dared to offend An Ni.)

105
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:51,485
(Well, sooner or later,)

106
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:53,325
(I'll offend this popular figure too.)

107
00:05:53,406 --> 00:05:56,126
(However, Prosecutor An Ni)

108
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,765
(may be in the spotlight)

109
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,205
(and the center of attention recently.)

110
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:02,205
(But I don't want to talk about her today.)

111
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:04,485
(Today, I want to talk about a pair
of attention-seeking siblings)

112
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:06,566
(who are only after fame
and reputation.)

113
00:06:10,285 --> 00:06:12,725
(I'm talking about Prosecutor An's)

114
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:14,686
(law school alumna,)

115
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:18,005
(the so-called heroic policewoman,)

116
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:19,285
(Zhang Wanru.)

117
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,686
(When I said
they were seeking fame and reputation,)

118
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,485
(some viewers got upset,)

119
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:27,485
(saying that she was a hero, a martyr.)

120
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:29,485
(Don't get agitated just yet.)

121
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:32,045
(I'll explain everything to one by one.)

122
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,445
(First, let's talk about
Zhang Wanru's younger brother,)

123
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:38,686
(the well-known Zhang Xiaobei.)

124
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,445
(Zhang Xiaobei attempted suicide
by jumping into a river on live stream,)

125
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,005
(which gained a lot of attention.)

126
00:06:43,806 --> 00:06:46,806
(But then,
he suddenly reappeared in public.)

127
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,725
(Later, it was revealed
that all of this was...)

128
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:18,966
Just you wait.

129
00:07:23,646 --> 00:07:25,806
Ma'am, do you sell knives?

130
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:28,566
No, we don't.

131
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:32,445
Director Wang,

132
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:33,045
you're still at the office?

133
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:34,806
Where are you going?

134
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,406
Xiaobei said he has something
to discuss with me.

135
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:38,005
Prosecutor Guo just issued

136
00:07:38,086 --> 00:07:39,205
an urgent notice saying

137
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,526
there'll be a meeting shortly.

138
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:41,846
Why does Xiaobei want to see you?

139
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:42,765
Did anything happen?

140
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:44,165
I still don't know.

141
00:07:44,366 --> 00:07:45,445
He's waiting for me across the street.

142
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:47,205
All right then.

143
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:49,246
Then you have half an hour.

144
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:49,966
Come back quickly.

145
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:51,126
You must attend this meeting.

146
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,926
Okay, I'll be back as soon as I can.

147
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:46,566
Ma'am, Was there just a young man

148
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:47,446
holding the same drink as me

149
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,165
waiting here?

150
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,206
Well, there was someone like that.

151
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,845
He's tall.

152
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,405
He also bought the same drinks as you

153
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,126
and sat there for a while.

154
00:08:57,285 --> 00:08:58,686
After he answered a call,

155
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,246
he left in a peculiar manner.

156
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:02,965
He just left?

157
00:09:04,006 --> 00:09:05,126
He said he'll wait for me here.

158
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,405
Why did he just leave?

159
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:07,965
Thank you, ma'am.

160
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,045
Okay, take care.

161
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:12,206
Hello?

162
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,206
Have you finished working?

163
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,285
I have a meeting later.

164
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:16,886
What's the matter?

165
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:18,326
(Are you free tonight?)

166
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:19,605
Come and find me.

167
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,806
I had a dream about you last night.

168
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:22,926
I missed you.

169
00:09:24,246 --> 00:09:24,965
After the meeting ends,

170
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:25,965
I'll go and find Xiaobei first.

171
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:27,206
Then I'll come to find you.

172
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:28,686
Why are you looking for him?

173
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,285
He told me he had something to tell me

174
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:33,326
(and told me to wait at the entrance
of the prosecutor's office.)

175
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:34,766
(But when I came down,
he was nowhere to be found.)

176
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:35,886
(I don't know where he went.)

177
00:09:36,006 --> 00:09:36,686
(His phone is also switched off.)

178
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:40,085
You're not his mom.

179
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:42,965
(Don't you know what he's like?)

180
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:43,926
He's always been that unruly.

181
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,045
Perhaps he's acting on a whim

182
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,366
and doing whatever comes to his mind.

183
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,965
Well, he doesn't have
to switch off his phone.

184
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:52,126
Wait, why are you overreacting?

185
00:09:52,165 --> 00:09:54,006
What could happen to a big guy like him?

186
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:55,126
(Stop overthinking.)

187
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,165
(You should go to the meeting.)

188
00:09:57,446 --> 00:09:59,126
I'll see you after the meeting is over.

189
00:09:59,246 --> 00:09:59,845
Okay.

190
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:01,446
All right, then.

191
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:02,126
I'll see you later.

192
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,126
Which one of you knows
what happened to my sister?

193
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:30,686
Let's talk elsewhere.

194
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,085
(Jiangcheng Procuratorate. Dedicated)

195
00:10:37,085 --> 00:10:39,045
Strengthening the enforcement
of internet supervision

196
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:41,806
and promoting comprehensive
online governance.

197
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:45,006
Actively implement
the sixth prosecutorial recommendation

198
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:47,206
and handle the cases
of information network crimes

199
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:48,566
that have been directly handled

200
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:50,006
by our institution recently,

201
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,206
as well as those reported

202
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:53,326
and handled by other regions.

203
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,206
I had Heyu prepare

204
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,566
a targeted strategic analysis report.

205
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:02,926
Once we reach a consensus,

206
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:05,165
we'll forward it to the Ministry
of Industry and Information Technology,

207
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,326
the Ministry of Public Security,
and other relevant departments

208
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:08,806
for collaborative efforts
and investigative recommendations.

209
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:13,965
Heyu, could you give everyone
a brief introduction on this?

210
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:16,206
Well...

211
00:11:17,246 --> 00:11:20,886
Currently,
the most prevalent trend in cybercrime

212
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:23,165
is concealment and disguise,

213
00:11:23,566 --> 00:11:25,246
followed by aiding and abetting.

214
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,045
Based on recent case characteristics,

215
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:30,766
it's not difficult to realize the tendency

216
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:32,806
of "three transformations, two ends,
and one concealment."

217
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:34,285
These "three transformations" refer

218
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:35,525
to the trends of getting younger,
more organized,

219
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:36,405
and forming a chain of connections.

220
00:11:37,285 --> 00:11:38,366
The "two ends" involve

221
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,446
recruiting inexperienced
individuals domestically

222
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:42,525
and establishing a base

223
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:47,006
of operations abroad to channel funds.

224
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:48,485
The "one concealment" aspect

225
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,766
is that the leaders
of these criminal organizations

226
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,045
mostly hide behind the scenes.

227
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:56,006
So far,

228
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,006
many so-called leaders apprehended

229
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:00,525
were merely "white gloves" or proxies.

230
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:02,566
Therefore, our top priority

231
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,085
is to decisively eradicate

232
00:12:04,085 --> 00:12:06,206
the breeding ground for cybercrime

233
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,126
and continuously enhance

234
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,446
our prevention capabilities.

235
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:14,806
So I suggest we should not stop
our preventive education efforts

236
00:12:15,006 --> 00:12:17,965
because among the recent suspects

237
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,766
being investigated and prosecuted,

238
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:23,886
a large portion consists
of young individuals

239
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:26,525
who have just entered society
or are job seekers.

240
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,366
Among them,

241
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:33,886
there are even some university students
and engineers who are adept at developing

242
00:12:33,926 --> 00:12:36,525
and evading techniques on the internet.

243
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,806
This group is particularly vulnerable

244
00:12:38,886 --> 00:12:41,566
to falling for scams and
being manipulated,

245
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:43,485
leading them onto the path of crime.

246
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,085
That's the basic situation.

247
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:47,045
Okay.

248
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:53,285
An Ni,
do you have any suggestions or measures?

249
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,126
I haven't prepared

250
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:57,285
any suitable suggestions
or measures yet.

251
00:12:58,165 --> 00:13:00,165
But I'd like to share my insights
and lessons learned

252
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,725
from the cases I've been involved in.
Is that okay?

253
00:13:05,246 --> 00:13:08,206
In simple terms,
we need to cut off the criminal chain

254
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,126
both upstream and downstream,

255
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:13,006
especially the black and gray industries
and associated crimes.

256
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,845
In the cases we previously handled,

257
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:16,326
we communicated and collaborated

258
00:13:16,405 --> 00:13:17,566
with the courts, public security,
cyberspace administration,

259
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,485
and industry
and information technology departments.

260
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:22,965
As prosecutors, we can intervene early

261
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:24,926
and oversee together.

262
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,965
This way, we leverage

263
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:29,366
the advantages and value
of each department.

264
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:31,566
However, we should focus on
our judgment of the case,

265
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:32,845
the qualification of the crime,

266
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:34,405
sentencing recommendations
for the suspects,

267
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:36,165
and the acceptance of evidence,

268
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,405
where we can particularly
exert our influence.

269
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,405
In the future,
I hope we can continue to strengthen

270
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,006
communication and collaboration
with various departments

271
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:43,686
and establish
unified case-handling standards.

272
00:13:45,206 --> 00:13:47,766
For example, in the past,
I worked with Captain He

273
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:50,326
from the Public Security Bureau

274
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,806
on a joint operation
to target key links.

275
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:54,405
I believe we need to govern

276
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:55,525
this crime from the source

277
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,405
and curb its occurrence.

278
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:59,165
People like Guo Jing'an

279
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:01,085
should never be allowed
to commit more crimes.

280
00:14:01,246 --> 00:14:03,045
But when we were handling

281
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:04,405
the cases of Zhang Xiaobei
and Shi Xiaohu,

282
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:05,845
we found many young people

283
00:14:05,926 --> 00:14:08,645
like Yang Bao in various universities.

284
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,605
I believe these young people

285
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:11,926
are just temporarily misguided

286
00:14:12,326 --> 00:14:15,126
As prosecutors, we should not solely
measure their crimes

287
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:17,405
with the yardstick of the law.

288
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,206
Instead, we should adhere
to a combination of education,

289
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:23,446
rehabilitation, punishment, and warning.

290
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:25,446
Now, let's go back

291
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:26,725
to what Prosecutor Guo said before.

292
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:29,405
These crimes
can be completely prevented.

293
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:30,766
But once the harm is done,

294
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:32,525
it's difficult to recover the losses.

295
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:34,806
Therefore, in the future,

296
00:14:34,926 --> 00:14:36,366
we should consistently
prioritize prevention over crackdowns.

297
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:41,645
Xing.

298
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:43,645
Prosecutor Guo.

299
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,525
The implementation
of the sixth prosecutorial recommendation

300
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:46,845
(Zhang Xiaobei: I just wanted to talk.)
and the analysis report

301
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:49,366
will be immediately followed
by convening meetings

302
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:50,686
with relevant departments
to ensure effective communication.

303
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,085
I will provide you
with a detailed implementation plan

304
00:14:53,285 --> 00:14:54,725
(You can call me any time.)
no later than tomorrow.

305
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:55,246
Okay,

306
00:14:55,965 --> 00:14:57,686
the coordination with the departments
needs to be expedited.

307
00:14:57,845 --> 00:14:58,405
Understood.

308
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,100
(Attorney-General's Office)

309
00:15:03,165 --> 00:15:04,645
The special task force
has just finished the meeting.

310
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:06,085
Based on your performance
throughout the year,

311
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,405
they've decided to recommend

312
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:08,446
both of you represent our institute

313
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:10,686
in the provincial prosecutor's
competition.

314
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,366
Go back and prepare well.

315
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:16,525
Make sure we're
in the top ten in the province.

316
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:17,965
-Yes, Prosecutor Guo.
-Okay, sir.

317
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:20,446
Okay, go and prepare yourselves.

318
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:31,165
This person is so disgusting.

319
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:32,645
So hateful.

320
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:35,246
When did you start talking like that?

321
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:38,085
Regardless, they should be dealt with
according to the law.

322
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:40,165
Listen here.

323
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:41,566
When An Ni returns,

324
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,045
no one should mention
this matter to her.

325
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:45,165
If she finds out,
she'll definitely be livid.

326
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,845
And she's at...

327
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:47,926
Han Xuan,

328
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:49,405
where are the papers from last time...

329
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:54,165
All right.

330
00:15:54,446 --> 00:15:55,085
Stop pretending.

331
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:56,285
I do have a mobile phone

332
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:57,446
and I've read the news online.

333
00:15:58,566 --> 00:15:59,405
Don't worry.

334
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:02,206
I won't get influenced by those insects

335
00:16:02,206 --> 00:16:03,926
who only spread negative news online.

336
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:06,645
If they go beyond the limits of the law,

337
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,366
the law will deal with them.

338
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:09,806
But ten minutes ago,

339
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:11,085
she posted a new video about...

340
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,246
What new video?

341
00:16:18,326 --> 00:16:19,405
I can't bear to tell you.

342
00:16:19,766 --> 00:16:23,165
An Ni, why don't you watch it yourself?

343
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:31,326
(Qiu Qiu Talks)
(What does "like brother like sister")

344
00:16:31,525 --> 00:16:33,366
(and the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree?)

345
00:16:33,845 --> 00:16:35,126
(Think about it.)

346
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:37,926
(She said she was going abroad
on a mission back then.)

347
00:16:38,845 --> 00:16:40,485
(But anyone could tell)

348
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:42,926
(that she was just going abroad
to improve her future prospect)

349
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,886
(and pave the way for her promotion
when she returned.)

350
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,566
(If she didn't have connections,
who could have such an opportunity?)

351
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:49,446
(When the news came out that year,)

352
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:51,285
(there were comments)

353
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:54,326
(saying things like "Thank you
for your hard work.")

354
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:59,246
(To the youngsters
who left those comments,)

355
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,645
(you earn money selling cabbage)

356
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,085
(but have the mindset of selling drugs.)

357
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:04,885
(You have a monthly salary of 3000 yuan)

358
00:17:04,926 --> 00:17:06,846
(and consider this and that for others.)

359
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,326
(Let me tell you.)

360
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,446
(It wasn't hard for her at all.)

361
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:12,566
(She had a vacation abroad,)

362
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:14,285
(received two salaries,)

363
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,165
(and enjoyed benefits
both domestically and internationally.)

364
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:17,806
(But when ordinary people like us)

365
00:17:17,966 --> 00:17:19,800
(get hit by a car while walking
on the street,)

366
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:21,365
(that's because we were careless)

367
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:22,326
(and deserve it.)

368
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:25,365
(But she became a hero)

369
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:26,566
(when she was hit by a car
while walking in the street.)

370
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:27,486
(That's great.)

371
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:29,125
(She was awarded the title of martyr)

372
00:17:29,245 --> 00:17:30,045
(and buried in the martyr cemetery.)

373
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,446
Ni, don't get angry.

374
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,966
But this matter is really strange.

375
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:37,285
The cause of Zhang Wanru's death

376
00:17:37,326 --> 00:17:38,926
was supposed to be kept confidential.

377
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,326
And it was always stated
as dying in the line of duty.

378
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:42,806
How did Bian Qiuqiu know

379
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,326
such detailed information?

380
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,005
You're right.

381
00:17:47,486 --> 00:17:50,486
I originally thought
it was a sensational act

382
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:51,885
by an internet celebrity.

383
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:54,326
But what are their motives?

384
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,285
When was that video sent?

385
00:17:57,765 --> 00:17:59,606
When you were looking for Zhang Xiaobei.

386
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,326
Oh, no.

387
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,285
If Zhang Xiaobei watches this video,

388
00:18:03,326 --> 00:18:04,326
it will be a disaster.

389
00:18:04,365 --> 00:18:05,765
Ni, calm down.

390
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,005
Bian Qiuqiu's actions

391
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:08,086
have already violated criminal law

392
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,045
by defaming the honor
and reputation of a martyr.

393
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:11,885
The law won't let her go.

394
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:14,125
But Zhang Xiaobei doesn't know
about what you just said.

395
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:15,165
He Luyuan,

396
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:16,686
go find Xiaobei immediately.

397
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:17,885
It'll be too late if you delay.

398
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:19,726
Ni.

399
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:25,045
What's going on here?

400
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:25,686
He's not at home too.

401
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:26,726
He's not answering his phone.

402
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:30,206
Things come one after the other.

403
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:32,125
Let alone this matter concerns
his sister.

404
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,846
It has probably crossed his bottom line.

405
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,606
As someone who has studied law,
Bian Qiuqiu knows the law

406
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:36,365
but still breaks it.

407
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:37,486
She must be held accountable

408
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,005
for distorting the facts.

409
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:41,446
Not only for Zhang Wanru

410
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,365
but for any national hero or martyr.

411
00:18:43,365 --> 00:18:45,486
It is not allowed to have
any defamation or slander.

412
00:18:48,446 --> 00:18:53,125
But I'm curious about the source of
the case information that she posted.

413
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,245
We've looked into this matter.

414
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:55,125
No one leaked the information

415
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:57,645
or had any connection with Bian Qiuqiu.

416
00:18:58,086 --> 00:19:00,206
I suspect she obtained this information

417
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,206
through two channels.

418
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:03,566
One is by browsing

419
00:19:03,765 --> 00:19:06,005
the news online at that time,

420
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,806
and the other is probably

421
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:10,726
through the suspect of the case
who knows A

422
00:19:10,846 --> 00:19:12,926
whom we haven't arrested yet.

423
00:19:18,206 --> 00:19:18,885
It's Xiaobei.

424
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:20,525
He texted me.

425
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:22,005
Look at this guy.

426
00:19:22,606 --> 00:19:24,446
He texted you
instead of answering my call.

427
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,404
(The more I think about my sister,
the sadder I become.)

428
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,446
(Luckily, I read an article about traveling
and finding solace to alleviate sorrow.)

429
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:28,486
Why don't you give him a call?

430
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,420
(So don't worry, I'll turn off my phone
and take some time to find peace.)

431
00:19:32,165 --> 00:19:33,005
It's switched off.

432
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:44,606
Captain He.

433
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,326
Thank you for not coming inside.

434
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:51,765
Or else Grandma's condition will worsen

435
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:52,966
if she sees you.

436
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,125
What's wrong with her?

437
00:19:57,566 --> 00:19:58,846
It's the time of the year.

438
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,806
She needs to get treatment
at the hospital.

439
00:20:02,926 --> 00:20:03,806
I was worried if I go in,

440
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:05,165
she'd ask me if you did

441
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:06,525
something bad again.

442
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:08,525
Thank you, Captain He.

443
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:10,806
Why do you want to see me?

444
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,285
Xiaobei said he wants to take a stroll.

445
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,446
But he switched off his phone.

446
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:15,926
Do you know where he went?

447
00:20:16,086 --> 00:20:17,926
Don't tell anyone about this.

448
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:18,765
Do you hear me?

449
00:20:19,446 --> 00:20:20,245
Okay.

450
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:25,446
Where are you going?

451
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,486
You should go home first.

452
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:28,885
Don't worry about it.
We'll talk after I get back.

453
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:29,365
I'll get going then.

454
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:35,125
How am I supposed to know about this?

455
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:36,606
Don't Bei usually report to you

456
00:20:37,005 --> 00:20:38,525
wherever he goes?

457
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:39,846
You trust you more

458
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,005
and that Prosecutor An Ni.

459
00:20:42,806 --> 00:20:44,206
You're lying, right?

460
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:45,926
I wouldn't dare.

461
00:20:45,966 --> 00:20:46,966
I'll go in and see your grandma then.

462
00:20:47,005 --> 00:20:47,726
No, please don't.

463
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,206
I really don't know anything.

464
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,005
If there's nothing else,

465
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,486
I need to help Grandma clean up.

466
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,125
I'll get back inside then.

467
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:55,806
Go.

468
00:20:57,285 --> 00:20:58,045
Wait.

469
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:01,645
Come here.

470
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:18,525
Take this.

471
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:20,525
I can't.

472
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:21,726
I can't take this, Captain He.

473
00:21:22,566 --> 00:21:22,885
Just take it.

474
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,086
Get back inside.

475
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:29,765
Thank you, Captain He.

476
00:22:25,806 --> 00:22:27,405
You must be Bian Qiuqiu.

477
00:22:30,726 --> 00:22:32,885
Are you my fans?

478
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,005
Bian Qiuqiu,

479
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,726
You're being lawfully summoned
to be investigated.

480
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:37,926
Under what grounds am I being summoned?

481
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:39,645
Can't you read the charges?

482
00:22:40,245 --> 00:22:40,926
You're suspected of infringing upon

483
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,645
the honor and reputation
of a national hero.

484
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:45,405
You know Comrade Zhang Wanru, right?

485
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:48,125
In simple terms,
your actions are despicable.

486
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:50,525
You can kill people without weapons.

487
00:22:50,566 --> 00:22:51,926
With your hands and mouth alone,

488
00:22:52,005 --> 00:22:53,285
you can completely take someone's life.

489
00:22:53,525 --> 00:22:54,446
Let me tell you,

490
00:22:54,566 --> 00:22:56,365
the internet is not a lawless place.

491
00:22:56,606 --> 00:22:58,405
You'll pay the price
for your illegal actions.

492
00:22:58,525 --> 00:22:59,326
Take her away.

493
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,086
What are you doing?

494
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,365
Let me go!

495
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:14,525
Who's there?

496
00:23:15,566 --> 00:23:16,765
An Ni, it's me.

497
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:20,446
Come in quickly.

498
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:21,446
Come inside.

499
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:23,885
What happened to you?

500
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:25,165
Who did this to you?

501
00:23:25,326 --> 00:23:25,806
Ni, I...

502
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:27,606
Go inside. Go inside and talk.

503
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:28,365
Come.

504
00:23:28,806 --> 00:23:30,326
Why are you all wet?

505
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:33,125
Sit down.

506
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:34,726
I'll get you a towel.

507
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:39,566
Here you go.

508
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,165
Sit down and wipe yourself dry.

509
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:43,885
What happened?

510
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:45,045
Sit down.

511
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:47,765
What's going on with you?

512
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,365
Where have you been
for the past few days?

513
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:51,645
I was kidnapped by several masked men.

514
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:53,405
When I went to see you,

515
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:54,686
I received a call

516
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:56,365
from an unknown international number.

517
00:23:56,765 --> 00:23:59,165
They claimed they know the truth
behind my sister's death.

518
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,966
But for safety reasons,

519
00:24:01,045 --> 00:24:01,726
they asked me to meet them

520
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:03,005
at a location they specified.

521
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:04,245
As a result.

522
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:06,326
You ended up in a place
in the middle of nowhere

523
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:07,125
and got beaten up?

524
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:12,765
You're soaking wet.

525
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:14,885
I guess you did what you're good at

526
00:24:15,206 --> 00:24:16,486
and swim back from the river, huh?

527
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:18,326
You guys sure are professional.

528
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:20,446
I only say a couple of words,
you could figure out almost everything.

529
00:24:22,206 --> 00:24:23,726
You scared me to death.

530
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:25,446
I'm glad you're okay.

531
00:24:25,686 --> 00:24:28,926
Do you know how many times
you made us worried sick about you?

532
00:24:29,446 --> 00:24:30,606
I'll get you some water.

533
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,206
Where's your phone?

534
00:24:36,446 --> 00:24:37,846
Why didn't you call the police?

535
00:24:37,966 --> 00:24:38,806
You could've contacted

536
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:40,285
me first, you know?

537
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:41,926
I didn't dare to call the police
at the time.

538
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,206
I thought I should talk to you first

539
00:24:43,326 --> 00:24:44,726
and discuss it thoroughly.

540
00:24:46,206 --> 00:24:46,806
Have some water first.

541
00:24:46,806 --> 00:24:48,245
I'll call He Luyuan.

542
00:24:51,926 --> 00:24:53,125
Okay, I know.

543
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:54,645
He's on his way here.

544
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:55,645
He told us not to hang up.

545
00:24:55,726 --> 00:24:56,926
Tell him what happened.

546
00:25:01,005 --> 00:25:01,806
Yuan.

547
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:02,966
(Here's what happened.)

548
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,365
He escaped! Stop the car!

549
00:26:24,446 --> 00:26:26,005
-Stop right there!
-Stop!

550
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,005
Don't run!

551
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:31,206
-Stand right there!
-Stop!

552
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:42,365
Useless thing!

553
00:26:42,405 --> 00:26:43,446
Can't you even watch him properly?

554
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:44,326
He jumped into the river.

555
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:45,926
You can't expect me to go after him
when the current is too strong!

556
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:47,086
You have to go after him
even if you have to jump into the river.

557
00:26:48,045 --> 00:26:49,446
We quit!

558
00:26:49,765 --> 00:26:50,245
Let's go.

559
00:26:56,165 --> 00:26:57,365
Did he disturb you from your rest?

560
00:26:57,405 --> 00:26:57,686
Not at all.

561
00:26:57,926 --> 00:26:58,365
Where is he?

562
00:26:58,726 --> 00:26:59,846
He's sitting inside.

563
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:04,765
It has only been a few days and you're...

564
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:05,926
Come on, Yuan.

565
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:09,125
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

566
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:11,125
Do you know how worried An Ni
is about you?

567
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:12,525
I'm sorry.

568
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:15,885
Sit down.

569
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,645
Not bad, you still managed to escape.

570
00:27:18,885 --> 00:27:21,045
You sure live up
as a family member of a police officer.

571
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:23,165
Tell me the features
of those three people.

572
00:27:23,446 --> 00:27:24,446
Starting from their physiques.

573
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,926
Those three...

574
00:27:29,926 --> 00:27:30,645
Before you got in the car,

575
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,326
did you notice what kind of car it was

576
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:34,086
or did you see
the license plate clearly?

577
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:36,846
There was no license plate.

578
00:27:37,686 --> 00:27:39,086
It's a van.

579
00:27:39,765 --> 00:27:40,486
I think they were driving
in the mountain.

580
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:41,926
It was so bumpy that it made me dizzy.

581
00:27:42,566 --> 00:27:44,645
You're not really giving me
any useful information.

582
00:27:44,645 --> 00:27:46,365
You need to give more clues.

583
00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:47,245
For example,

584
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:48,846
did any of the three people

585
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:50,446
have a distinctive voice

586
00:27:50,966 --> 00:27:52,966
or a unique tattoo?

587
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:56,365
I remembered something.

588
00:27:56,765 --> 00:27:58,765
One of them had a long scar

589
00:27:59,446 --> 00:28:00,846
on the back of their neck.

590
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:04,765
Is that all?

591
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,206
That's all I saw.

592
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:11,045
Let's not rush
to remember everything now.

593
00:28:11,045 --> 00:28:12,326
Since he's back,

594
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:14,165
he can take his time to recall
in the coming days.

595
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,245
At the entrance of the procuratorate,

596
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:17,285
you said you wanted to see
because of something.

597
00:28:17,285 --> 00:28:18,486
What is it about?

598
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:20,806
I found an issue

599
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:22,765
with the Huiquan Games.

600
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:24,086
A major issue.

601
00:28:36,686 --> 00:28:38,446
According to the game's design,

602
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,726
if you want to progress quickly,

603
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,806
you have to spend money to reload

604
00:28:43,045 --> 00:28:44,846
and enhance your skills,

605
00:28:44,885 --> 00:28:46,726
upgrade equipment,
and unlock hidden tasks.

606
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:50,125
But shortly after, I started receiving

607
00:28:50,125 --> 00:28:52,285
several loan advertisements

608
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,765
from different online lending platforms.

609
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:54,885
I was confused.

610
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:56,086
How did they know?

611
00:28:56,326 --> 00:28:57,486
This happened right after

612
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:58,525
I registered with my new number,

613
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:00,926
which I only use to call you guys
and a few friends.

614
00:29:00,926 --> 00:29:02,525
I didn't do anything

615
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:04,726
or provide any personal information.

616
00:29:05,966 --> 00:29:08,846
Then I realized that
when I logged into the game,

617
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:10,206
I need to use my ID

618
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,686
and register my phone number.

619
00:29:12,566 --> 00:29:13,125
But at that time,

620
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:14,926
I didn't suspect anything.

621
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:17,966
Later, while I was playing the game,

622
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,245
I wanted to try different gameplay

623
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:20,486
and play with a new account while at it.

624
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:22,245
This game became extremely popular
right after its release.

625
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:23,765
I can make money
after selling the account.

626
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:25,686
So I used Li Danan's information

627
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:26,525
to register a new account.

628
00:29:27,125 --> 00:29:28,326
I was doing well at the beginning
of the game.

629
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:29,926
But as I progressed,
it became increasingly difficult.

630
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:31,165
So I spent some money.

631
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:33,045
During the interactive options,

632
00:29:33,165 --> 00:29:36,165
I selected options based on
my previous preferences.

633
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:38,045
But not long after that,

634
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:39,446
Li Danan's phone received

635
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:40,446
several loan advertisements

636
00:29:40,486 --> 00:29:42,086
that were exactly the same as mine.

637
00:29:42,686 --> 00:29:43,045
Bei.

638
00:29:43,086 --> 00:29:43,405
Yeah?

639
00:29:44,486 --> 00:29:45,206
How is it possible

640
00:29:45,206 --> 00:29:46,726
that I received
the same messages as you?

641
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:49,885
What do you mean?

642
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:50,365
Look at this.

643
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,635
(Lemon Loan: Your loan information
has been successfully registered.)

644
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:52,580
(We'll protect your credit information
and stop deducting payments shortly.)

645
00:29:54,446 --> 00:29:55,245
I see.

646
00:29:56,326 --> 00:29:57,726
Even though the characters
are different.

647
00:29:58,446 --> 00:29:59,645
But the gameplay and options

648
00:29:59,645 --> 00:30:01,245
are exactly the same as yesterday.

649
00:30:01,326 --> 00:30:03,165
Moreover, I also reloaded
some money to your account.

650
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:05,686
Could there be an issue with this one?

651
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:07,245
What?

652
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:09,726
I thought it might be
a coincidence the first time.

653
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:11,606
The second coincidence
doesn't mean much either.

654
00:30:11,606 --> 00:30:13,245
But I really suspect something is wrong.

655
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:15,405
I'm still that sensitive.

656
00:30:15,525 --> 00:30:18,726
So I borrowed the identity information
of some friends at the internet cafe

657
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:20,125
and registered a bunch of new accounts.

658
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:24,206
Xiaobei, I received the messages.

659
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:25,525
Okay, I got it.

660
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:29,365
Xiaobei, I received them too.

661
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:30,645
I got them too.

662
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:31,686
Okay, buddy.

663
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:34,566
Xiaobei, I got it too.

664
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:35,525
Thanks, man.

665
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:39,926
Bei, you were right.

666
00:30:39,926 --> 00:30:41,926
I told you there was a problem, right?

667
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:45,525
Danan, don't tell anyone else about this.

668
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:46,885
Got it?

669
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:47,645
Okay.

670
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,525
This time, I'll try different options,

671
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,645
different characters,
and different tasks.

672
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:55,486
But it's a bit strange that
most of the accounts

673
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,045
I added money to
had received loan advertisements.

674
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,686
But there are some that didn't.

675
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:01,885
I'm wondering if it has something to do

676
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:03,926
with the actions or choices
I made in the game.

677
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:06,280
And it's because of this
that I discovered

678
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:07,966
Huiquan Games is definitely problematic.

679
00:31:11,806 --> 00:31:13,606
After going around in circles,
it leads us back to Huiquan.

680
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,086
Xiaobei, I can't definitively determine

681
00:31:18,206 --> 00:31:19,765
whether your response to this situation

682
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:21,446
is right or wrong.

683
00:31:21,566 --> 00:31:23,125
But we'll do our best to investigate it.

684
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:25,245
You've made significant progress.

685
00:31:25,486 --> 00:31:27,245
Compared to your
impulsive behavior before,

686
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,486
your current awareness is good.

687
00:31:29,486 --> 00:31:30,285
It's commendable.

688
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:33,966
Leave the rest to me and Captain He.

689
00:31:34,005 --> 00:31:35,206
We'll solve it together.

690
00:31:35,365 --> 00:31:36,765
As for you, take care of your safety

691
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:37,765
and protect yourself.

692
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:38,686
Don't worry.

693
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,926
It's almost dawn.
How about you get some rest here?

694
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:43,686
I'll go and wash your clothes.

695
00:31:43,726 --> 00:31:44,525
Wait a minute.

696
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:46,525
He's not a child anymore.

697
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:47,365
You two are alone together.

698
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,926
You're letting him stay with you.

699
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:50,765
You... Come with me.

700
00:31:50,806 --> 00:31:51,405
Go to my place.

701
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:52,326
I'm not going with you.

702
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:53,765
You're a single man.

703
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:55,326
I can already imagine

704
00:31:55,326 --> 00:31:56,966
the condition and the smell
at your place.

705
00:31:58,405 --> 00:31:59,966
I dare you to say that again.

706
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:01,926
Okay, I'll come with you.

707
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:02,525
Ni, I'll get going now.

708
00:32:03,045 --> 00:32:03,525
I'm leaving.

709
00:32:05,846 --> 00:32:06,926
Get some rest.

710
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:07,726
Okay.

711
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,966
An Ni, where are you going?

712
00:32:25,326 --> 00:32:26,125
Prosecutor Guo said

713
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:27,846
Bian Qiuqiu has been apprehended.

714
00:32:27,926 --> 00:32:28,686
The bureau is preparing to launch

715
00:32:28,686 --> 00:32:30,005
a public interest lawsuit against her.

716
00:32:30,245 --> 00:32:32,446
But based on the current interrogation,

717
00:32:32,566 --> 00:32:33,686
Bian Qiuqiu's case seems

718
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,165
to be more than just a simple case.

719
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,125
There are likely masterminds
and instigators behind it.

720
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:38,686
I'm planning to interrogate her.

721
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:40,846
I must go with you
for today's interrogation.

722
00:32:40,966 --> 00:32:42,846
I want to see who insists on

723
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:43,966
going against us and for what reason.

724
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:48,045
Ni, you've been working
back-to-back like this.

725
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:49,086
Can your health take it?

726
00:32:50,005 --> 00:32:51,525
That's not the issue.

727
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:56,765
I thought bringing back Qian Tianxin
from Country F would settle things.

728
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:58,606
But things keep happening
one after the other recently.

729
00:32:58,606 --> 00:32:59,806
It's getting more and more suspicious.

730
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,125
Also about Wanru...

731
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:03,606
You...

732
00:33:04,446 --> 00:33:05,365
Don't worry, Han Xuan.

733
00:33:05,606 --> 00:33:07,165
I know you're worried about me.

734
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:10,846
But now Bian Qiuqiu case
is no longer just

735
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:12,566
about infringing upon the honor
of heroes and martyrs.

736
00:33:12,726 --> 00:33:13,486
It's very likely related

737
00:33:13,486 --> 00:33:15,525
to the mysterious person
behind Case 7·23.

738
00:33:15,765 --> 00:33:16,566
And this mysterious person

739
00:33:16,566 --> 00:33:18,165
is getting more and more restless.

740
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:20,645
The more restless he gets,
the more irrational he gets.

741
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:23,045
The more irrational he gets,
the closer we are to him.

742
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,566
Enough said. Let's go.

743
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,245
(Harmony Prison)

744
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,486
We all know that the things
you confessed to the bureau

745
00:33:36,486 --> 00:33:37,566
aren't that simple.

746
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:41,726
These days,
I've been suppressing my anger

747
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:43,206
and watching all the videos and articles

748
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:44,486
you've posted online.

749
00:33:45,365 --> 00:33:48,326
I've also carefully reviewed
all the case files

750
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,125
of your interactions

751
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:51,926
in the bullet comments, comment section,

752
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:53,326
and private messages with others.

753
00:33:54,285 --> 00:33:56,285
We discovered something very strange.

754
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:59,765
When Zhang Wanru sacrificed herself,

755
00:33:59,846 --> 00:34:02,165
there wasn't a single media outlet
in the country that reported on it.

756
00:34:02,686 --> 00:34:04,005
Yet you confidently claimed

757
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:05,365
that she was killed by a car.

758
00:34:06,365 --> 00:34:07,765
How did you know that?

759
00:34:12,246 --> 00:34:14,446
I really don't know anything.

760
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:18,726
One day,
a person suddenly got into my car.

761
00:34:18,926 --> 00:34:20,206
There was these female police officer

762
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,726
that my boss really hates.

763
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:26,325
We'll pay you and
you help me dig into her background.

764
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:30,006
Also, shame her family online.

765
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:32,926
So? Can you do it?

766
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,405
Mister, you may have misunderstood.

767
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:40,046
We're independent media professionals

768
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:42,246
with our own unique media perspectives.

769
00:34:42,726 --> 00:34:44,405
We don't engage in online shaming.

770
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:50,726
Do you know why I picked you
instead of others?

771
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:53,085
I know the rules.

772
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:56,286
This isn't about money.

773
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:59,605
I have to be responsible
for the content I share.

774
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:04,165
Besides,
I've never done such a thing before.

775
00:35:06,046 --> 00:35:08,206
How about four coins?

776
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:11,325
You're pretty greedy.

777
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:13,726
Do you know the value of one coin now?

778
00:35:14,085 --> 00:35:15,206
It's 30 thousand US dollars.

779
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:18,085
I'll pay you two coins as an advance.

780
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:20,206
After the work is done,
I'll pay you the other two coins.

781
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:23,686
But remember one thing.

782
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:25,926
If I can get in your car once,

783
00:35:26,446 --> 00:35:28,526
I can get in your car a second time.

784
00:35:29,686 --> 00:35:32,885
If you think your head is made of iron,

785
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:36,405
feel free to tell everyone about me.

786
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:39,246
Of course, not.

787
00:35:39,885 --> 00:35:40,885
I would never tell anyone.

788
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:44,286
I keep secrets very well.

789
00:35:44,526 --> 00:35:48,565
Just send me the details
of that female police officer.

790
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:50,486
I'll start writing the content tonight.

791
00:35:50,926 --> 00:35:52,125
I'll do it well.

792
00:35:52,165 --> 00:35:53,605
Don't worry.

793
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:09,325
(Zhang Wanru: Criminal Police.)

794
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:12,325
Zhang Wanru
of Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau.

795
00:36:13,085 --> 00:36:13,885
A martyr.

796
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,885
(Brother: Zhang Xiaobei.)
Her father, Zhang Wanli.

797
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:23,085
She has a younger brother,

798
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:23,565
Zhang...

799
00:36:24,286 --> 00:36:25,125
Zhang Xiaobei?

800
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:31,325
What else?

801
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:34,325
By the way,

802
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:37,766
he said his boss holds a grudge
against Zhang Wanru.

803
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:39,526
That's why he did it.

804
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:43,845
He mentioned "us" twice
during the conversation.

805
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:48,006
I'm guessing he's not alone.

806
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:52,885
I see.

807
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,686
Bian Qiuqiu has confessed.

808
00:36:55,526 --> 00:36:56,966
We've also restored Bian Qiuqiu's

809
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,206
private chat records on Huibo.

810
00:36:58,325 --> 00:36:59,125
Guess what we found?

811
00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:00,845
Someone indeed leaked the information.

812
00:37:01,006 --> 00:37:02,805
And this person made a deal
with Bian Qiuqiu

813
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,125
using foreign virtual currency.

814
00:37:04,565 --> 00:37:05,966
However, we're currently unable

815
00:37:05,966 --> 00:37:07,325
to find the IP account or login address.

816
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:09,405
It seems the person behind this
is technologically savvy.

817
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:10,845
I noticed that the mode of operation

818
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:12,246
is quite similar to Qian Tianxin.

819
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:15,686
Ni, I've mostly figured out your request.

820
00:37:15,885 --> 00:37:17,926
Please inform Captain He
to give me a few days.

821
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:19,605
I'll work overtime
after work to get it done.

822
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,766
But I can't guarantee the results.

823
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,486
Unless you ask Captain He

824
00:37:25,605 --> 00:37:27,686
to assign Long to assist me closely.

825
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:30,365
Is that Captain He?

826
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:32,926
Did you hear that, Captain He?

827
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,486
Yes.

828
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,206
I'm sure you heard him loud and clear.

829
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:38,726
Surely, he has a request.

830
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,125
Han Xuan is currently testing the game

831
00:37:41,165 --> 00:37:42,926
based on Zhang Xiaobei's suspicion
of the situation.

832
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:45,286
However, I find something very strange.

833
00:37:45,645 --> 00:37:47,726
Huiquan is a large enterprise.

834
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:49,286
Their publicly available games,

835
00:37:49,286 --> 00:37:52,006
programs,
and code shouldn't have any issues.

836
00:37:52,085 --> 00:37:53,926
Otherwise, it would be too obvious.

837
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:55,085
Yes,

838
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:56,125
we can't simply rely on
Zhang Xiaobei's speculation

839
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,766
to conclude that it's a criminal offense.

840
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,165
So we can only analyze
the information ourselves.

841
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:03,686
Okay.

842
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:04,605
All right.

843
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:06,645
I'll let you know
after I have the result.

844
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:07,605
Okay.

845
00:38:09,966 --> 00:38:11,325
Long asked me to convey this to you.

846
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:12,926
"Getting close to you is not a problem,

847
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:14,165
but no way I'll fall in love with you."

848
00:38:16,006 --> 00:38:16,325
What?

849
00:38:16,486 --> 00:38:17,486
Stop it.

850
00:38:17,726 --> 00:38:18,405
Get ready.

851
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:20,206
We're interrogating Qian Tianxin later.

852
00:38:20,966 --> 00:38:22,405
What? Why are we going again?

853
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,885
I'm just an ordinary worker.

854
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,680
Case 7·23 back then

855
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,486
was not thoroughly investigated,

856
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:35,085
and the leaders at higher levels
have yet to be brought to justice.

857
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:37,486
The police may
have suspected Yin Huiquan.

858
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:38,926
But there was no concrete evidence.

859
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:40,605
Now the new evidence points

860
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:42,286
to Huiquan Corporation again.

861
00:38:43,286 --> 00:38:44,405
The more critical the situation,

862
00:38:44,845 --> 00:38:46,766
the more cautious
we need to be in our investigation.

863
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:49,486
When it comes to private enterprises,

864
00:38:49,766 --> 00:38:51,286
we must avoid creating adverse effects.

865
00:38:51,845 --> 00:38:54,125
Prosecutor Guo, I highly suspect

866
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,165
that even if this person
is not Yin Huiquan himself,

867
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:58,605
he surely has
a significant tie to Huiquan.

868
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:00,885
Which one are you more inclined towards?

869
00:39:01,926 --> 00:39:03,885
How should we guide
the police investigation?

870
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,486
Initially, all the clues

871
00:39:07,486 --> 00:39:08,885
in Case 7·23 pointed to Yin Huiquan.

872
00:39:08,966 --> 00:39:11,565
During the trial, Hu Dewang mentioned

873
00:39:11,565 --> 00:39:14,605
that A is an old man. In Case 7·23,

874
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:16,766
all the arrested criminals
and their statements,

875
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:18,565
as well as the matching conditions,

876
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,165
also pointed to Yin Huiquan.

877
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:22,726
Also, Qian Tianxin's gang

878
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:25,125
is closely related to Case 7·23.

879
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:27,006
Zhang Xiaobei's response

880
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:28,526
may be related to online loans.

881
00:39:28,526 --> 00:39:30,766
But cybercrime can diverge in
multiple directions.

882
00:39:30,885 --> 00:39:33,686
It's not surprising even if
it's involved at any level.

883
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:35,446
So I suspect that Huiquan Corporation

884
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:37,686
is likely involved
in multiple cybercrimes.

885
00:39:37,845 --> 00:39:39,046
Taking into account

886
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:40,845
Qian Tianxin's previous response,

887
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:43,405
it's likely she's taking the blame
for someone else.

888
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:45,526
She's making every effort

889
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:46,565
to protect that person.

890
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:48,486
Whether that person is Yin Huiquan

891
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,085
or someone else,

892
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:52,486
we can only find out
once we investigate the matter thoroughly.

893
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:57,165
I understand your point.

894
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,486
I agree that you should continue
with the investigation.

895
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:02,006
However, you must be cautious
in your approach

896
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:04,085
and ensure there's a complete
chain of evidence.

897
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:06,565
We'll not let any criminal go free.

898
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:07,885
But we must also
avoid wrongfully accusing

899
00:40:07,885 --> 00:40:08,966
any innocent person.

900
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:13,726
Based on the information
we currently have,

901
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:17,206
the person who hired Bian Qiuqiu

902
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:19,926
must be someone
who knows about Case 7·23.

903
00:40:20,365 --> 00:40:21,365
Regardless of whether he's a member

904
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:22,926
of Qian Tianxin's gang.

905
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:25,085
The fact that he chose to take action

906
00:40:25,286 --> 00:40:27,966
during this particular time
is quite intriguing.

907
00:40:28,325 --> 00:40:28,926
Okay.

908
00:40:29,286 --> 00:40:29,766
By the way.

909
00:40:30,246 --> 00:40:34,325
so what's the situation
with Zhang Xiaobei?

910
00:40:35,486 --> 00:40:37,125
He's doing much better now.

911
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:38,966
He already knows
he's still being targeted

912
00:40:38,966 --> 00:40:41,006
for revenge by the other party.

913
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,325
So he has also mentally prepared himself

914
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,405
and has not been affected
by cyberbullying.

915
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:46,325
He's a lot better now.

916
00:40:47,085 --> 00:40:48,405
He may not be affected.

917
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:51,966
But we can't allow cyberbullying
to harm more people.

918
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:54,766
This incident is extremely malicious.

919
00:40:54,926 --> 00:40:56,405
It must never happen again.

920
00:40:56,565 --> 00:40:57,365
Yes.

921
00:40:58,486 --> 00:40:59,565
I just remembered.

922
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:03,405
It seems like you haven't done
legal education online for a long time.

923
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:06,926
There have been too many recent events.

924
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:08,085
I couldn't keep up.

925
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,206
You need to pick up where you left off

926
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:11,486
and continue doing it.

927
00:41:12,286 --> 00:41:13,006
Let's do it today.

928
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:15,565
We'll focus on combating

929
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,885
the urgent issue
of spreading online rumors.

930
00:41:19,926 --> 00:41:21,726
Yes, Prosecutor Guo.
I'll take note of it.

931
00:41:27,246 --> 00:41:29,246
To all the students
who are watching this live stream,

932
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:30,165
hello there.

933
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:32,085
I believe that everyone watching

934
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:35,246
is aware that social news

935
00:41:35,246 --> 00:41:37,605
is a breeding ground for online rumors.

936
00:41:38,206 --> 00:41:40,686
Every time there is a social news,

937
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:42,726
corresponding rumors
are bound to emerge.

938
00:41:43,206 --> 00:41:45,885
Of course, there will also
be corresponding victims.

939
00:41:46,165 --> 00:41:48,206
(The individuals behind these rumors)

940
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:50,006
(have a few common goals.)

941
00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:52,125
To escalate social conflicts,

942
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:55,605
undermine the credibility
of government departments,

943
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:59,526
and to and harm those
they wish to target.

944
00:42:01,565 --> 00:42:04,526
Recently, there has been
a widely circulated rumor online

945
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:06,726
involving my senior.

946
00:42:07,526 --> 00:42:08,766
(This senior of mine)

947
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:10,206
(came from a humble background.)

948
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:11,325
(Her mother passed away early.)

949
00:42:11,605 --> 00:42:12,966
(All alone, she operated)

950
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:14,046
(within a criminal syndicate overseas,)

951
00:42:14,246 --> 00:42:17,926
(carrying out tasks that constantly
pose a threat to her life.)

952
00:42:18,006 --> 00:42:19,605
(This requires immense courage.)

953
00:42:19,766 --> 00:42:21,726
(But these online rumor mongers)

954
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:26,246
(base these rumors on
our heroes and martyrs,)

955
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:27,766
(subjecting them to slanderous attacks.)

956
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:31,885
(These rumors have caused immense harm)

957
00:42:31,926 --> 00:42:33,446
(to her friends and family.)

958
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:35,286
And it's not just her friends and family

959
00:42:35,365 --> 00:42:37,365
who suffer from the harm caused,

960
00:42:37,405 --> 00:42:40,006
but our entire societal
value system as well.
