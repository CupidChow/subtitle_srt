15
00:01:39,094 --> 00:01:42,414
Mr. Ding, don't be upset.

16
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:46,454
This matter has no direct connection
to the Chairman.

17
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:50,333
What you're doing is not fair to him.

18
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:51,933
(You don't have to explain for him.)

19
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,533
We all see what's going on.

20
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,253
The board of directors
has the responsibility

21
00:01:55,374 --> 00:01:57,094
to protect
the interests of the shareholders

22
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:58,134
and oversee Huiquan

23
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:00,374
to ensure it runs smoothly.

24
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:04,533
I heard he put his son under you.

25
00:02:04,853 --> 00:02:06,734
He's making you babysit him,

26
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,933
(to look after his son
and keep him under control.)

27
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:14,094
If everyone follows in his footsteps,

28
00:02:14,413 --> 00:02:16,374
will Huiquan still be able to grow?

29
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:19,254
Mr. Ding, please calm down.

30
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:21,974
How about this?

31
00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:25,374
I apologise on the Chairman's behalf.

32
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:29,174
Please convey my apologies
to the board as well.

33
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:31,573
Why don't we do this?

34
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:34,693
We'll ask his son
to leave the company immediately

35
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,493
and clarify that he has nothing to do
with our company.

36
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:37,573
He will not be allowed

37
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:40,814
to hold any position
in the company anymore.

38
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:42,493
How about that?

39
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:44,853
Let's each take a step back.

40
00:02:45,334 --> 00:02:47,133
After all, without the Chairman,

41
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:48,534
Huiquan wouldn't be where it is today.

42
00:02:49,174 --> 00:02:49,814
Isn't that right?

43
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:52,693
Well, give us a minute to discuss it.

44
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:55,334
Okay. Please take your time.

45
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,573
Well, what do you guys think about this?

46
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,213
It's obvious, isn't it?

47
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:03,734
He can't be the Chairman

48
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:05,894
if he hollows us out.

49
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,413
Yes, you're right.

50
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:08,814
That's true.

51
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,614
Tell you what,
we'll let it go this time.

52
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:16,853
Don't let it happen again.

53
00:03:16,933 --> 00:03:17,933
It's just this once.

54
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,653
Zhao Jikai has been
in trouble for a long time.

55
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:26,174
The president of the company
should be a member of the board.

56
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:30,094
Plus, the partner you brought in,

57
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,053
the second largest shareholder,

58
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,693
has given his full power of
attorney in writing

59
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:40,293
(and has exercised his right
to vote for you to join the board.)

60
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:44,334
(In accordance with the relevant articles
of association and regulations of the company,)

61
00:03:44,894 --> 00:03:51,413
(we, the directors,
now ask that you join the board)

62
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:52,734
(as its new member.)

63
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:59,213
Mr. Ding,
I don't think that's appropriate.

64
00:04:00,693 --> 00:04:01,293
We can only be assured

65
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:03,653
if you hold a certain amount of power.

66
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:05,454
The process will be swift.

67
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:10,853
This is our wish,
as well as everyone else's.

68
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:12,734
Thank you.

69
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:14,374
I thank the board of directors

70
00:04:14,413 --> 00:04:15,814
for their trust and support.

71
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,293
I'll treat you well
on your next visit to Huiquan.

72
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:19,533
All right.

73
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:20,373
That's all for now.

74
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:33,533
Chairman,

75
00:04:33,734 --> 00:04:35,413
you asked Professor Luo
to come back and assist us.

76
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:36,533
He gave his idea.

77
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,454
Yin Tiancheng

78
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,934
was accused of sexual harassment
and blasted on the Internet.

79
00:04:39,214 --> 00:04:41,813
My first response was to tell them
to delete the post and regulate the comments.

80
00:04:43,454 --> 00:04:46,293
We are an Internet company.

81
00:04:46,934 --> 00:04:51,533
We can't let them stir up trouble
in this industry and step on us.

82
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:53,734
But Professor Luo stopped me.

83
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:57,293
He refused to let me delete the post

84
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,533
or let me organise a team
to refute the claims.

85
00:05:01,174 --> 00:05:02,454
Mr. Yin, Professor Luo is here.

86
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,214
Let him in.

87
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:04,853
Yes.

88
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:09,054
Professor Luo is here.
Let him explain himself to you.

89
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:12,614
Luo. Have a seat.

90
00:05:19,093 --> 00:05:21,214
I know I shouldn't bother you
after you resigned.

91
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:23,813
But you're the only one
who can solve this problem.

92
00:05:24,293 --> 00:05:26,373
In a matter of hours,

93
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,133
Yin Tiancheng's case
was all over the Internet,

94
00:05:31,293 --> 00:05:32,454
and everyone knows about it now.

95
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,973
Luo, what should we do?

96
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,734
You've been in the Internet business

97
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,214
for so long.

98
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:45,334
Surely you've noticed something fishy

99
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:49,054
about this case.

100
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:56,373
You mean this is a plot against Huiquan?

101
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:58,494
Yes.

102
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,734
On the one hand, they chose to do this
in this particular period of time

103
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:05,054
because Hiquan urgently needed funds.

104
00:06:05,133 --> 00:06:07,133
That requires
a positive corporate image.

105
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:09,693
On the other hand,

106
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:12,774
matters that concern gaming

107
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,533
could easily attract the attention

108
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,494
of the Procuratorate.

109
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:19,054
If we use means to restore

110
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:20,934
Tiancheng's reputation

111
00:06:21,174 --> 00:06:23,373
and delete the post and comments
in the backend,

112
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,133
we will get caught by the Procuratorate

113
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,454
if we are not careful. Is that right?

114
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:31,614
Yes, it's entrapment.

115
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:34,533
Yin Tiancheng is your weakness.

116
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,334
You will act carelessly out of concern.

117
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:39,934
They're betting on you losing your calm.

118
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:44,813
If the Procuratorate catches you,
it'll be hard for you to defend yourself.

119
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:48,253
How very calculated.

120
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:52,133
Thank goodness
you see the clear picture, Luo.

121
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:55,093
Well, we can't do nothing

122
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:56,533
and stand idly by, can we?

123
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,214
Take the legal route.

124
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:02,813
We'll do two things.

125
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:06,054
First step. Collect evidence

126
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:07,093
and report the case.

127
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:08,734
Report the person who published the post

128
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:11,774
for online defamation.

129
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:14,133
According to the judicial interpretation
by the Supreme People's Court

130
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:15,133
and the Supreme People's Procuratorate
regarding the handling of crimes

131
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,734
involving the illegal use
of information networks,

132
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:20,093
if the same piece of information
has been viewed

133
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,133
or clicked on more than 5,000 times

134
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:27,293
or if it has been forwarded
more than 500 times,

135
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:28,533
it should be considered

136
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,934
as a serious circumstance
as stipulated by criminal law.

137
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:34,734
Are you confident
that a case will be filed?

138
00:07:36,614 --> 00:07:37,934
We cannot be certain

139
00:07:38,654 --> 00:07:42,293
if this is deliberate falsification
or a misunderstanding yet.

140
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:45,014
That's for the Public Security Organs
to investigate.

141
00:07:45,494 --> 00:07:47,934
In fact, it doesn't matter
if a case is filed or not.

142
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:50,413
What matters is
we make our stance clear.

143
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,614
By posting that we've reported the case,

144
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,734
we can prove Yin Tiancheng's innocence

145
00:07:56,334 --> 00:08:00,973
to a certain extent and
turn public opinion around.

146
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,413
What about the second step?

147
00:08:04,174 --> 00:08:04,813
The second step is to go after

148
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:07,614
the website that deliberately

149
00:08:07,894 --> 00:08:08,813
published this information too.

150
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:10,693
Refer the matter
to the government department.

151
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:14,813
Have the CAC intervene and
remove the offending content

152
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:16,093
and issue a warning.

153
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:18,494
It's clear that the perpetrator

154
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,334
is targeting Huiquan.

155
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:22,614
As the victims,

156
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:25,093
we'll promptly report this issue
to the Procuratorate.

157
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:26,054
Good.

158
00:08:26,253 --> 00:08:27,293
I'll have
our corporate lawyer handle this.

159
00:08:27,614 --> 00:08:28,133
No.

160
00:08:31,014 --> 00:08:32,173
There's an even better candidate.

161
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:36,774
(Hello, everyone.)

162
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:39,654
(After the police pulled up
the surveillance footage,)

163
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:42,454
(I realised that
it was all a misunderstanding.)

164
00:08:42,894 --> 00:08:44,214
(When the other person involved and I)

165
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:45,894
(passed each other by...)

166
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:46,774
What are you guys watching?

167
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:48,133
Hurry up and eat.

168
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:50,334
Ni, we're watching an apology video.

169
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:52,774
We're getting in on the gossip, Ni.

170
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:55,253
This is a huge one. Isn't it, Jia?

171
00:08:56,334 --> 00:08:57,053
Huge?

172
00:08:57,214 --> 00:08:58,613
How so? Tell me about it.

173
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,094
This is what happened.

174
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:04,414
Yin Tiancheng, Yin Huiquan's son,

175
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:08,094
was caught red-handed sexually harassing
a woman in public.

176
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,654
The woman said
Yin Tiancheng touched her behind.

177
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,974
Well, before even checking
the surveillance footage,

178
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,534
the woman took photos of his work ID

179
00:09:17,613 --> 00:09:20,014
and him and posted them on the Internet.

180
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:22,294
She wanted to cancel him.

181
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,094
And the netizens jumped in
to criticise Yin Tiancheng.

182
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,733
Goodness. Look at the kids these days.

183
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:30,094
They can find one's
personal information so fast.

184
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:31,654
Here they are, all enjoying the gossip.

185
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,373
We've missed out on a lot,

186
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:33,854
Director Wang.

187
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:34,933
Missed out on what?

188
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,813
We've got our hands tied with
the cases on our hands.

189
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:38,493
We've got no time for all of this.

190
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:39,974
This is the most ridiculous bit.

191
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:42,253
There has been a huge plot twist.

192
00:09:43,493 --> 00:09:46,253
That woman uploaded
a ten-second apology video on Huibo.

193
00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:50,613
(Sorry.)

194
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:51,613
(I'm so sorry)

195
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:53,493
(for all the inconvenience caused.)

196
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:56,014
(We've apologised to each other.)

197
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,094
(Please do not spread
any form of this matter any further.)

198
00:09:59,454 --> 00:10:00,974
(This will be the last time
I speak out on this matter.)

199
00:10:01,774 --> 00:10:02,414
(Thank you.)

200
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,693
That poor Yin Tiancheng.

201
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,133
He got cancelled for no reason.

202
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:11,933
We're going live this week, right?

203
00:10:12,214 --> 00:10:13,253
It should be Director Wang's turn.

204
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:14,774
Director Wang,

205
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:16,654
I think you can talk about this case.

206
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,573
This concerns the protection
and privacy of personal information.

207
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,974
Besides, it's actually quite similar

208
00:10:20,014 --> 00:10:21,654
to the extreme Internet defamation case
that the Supreme People's Procuratorate

209
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:22,894
has just gotten involved in,

210
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:24,334
where a private prosecution
turns into a public prosecution.

211
00:10:24,693 --> 00:10:25,894
Moreover, it's good
to strike the iron while it's hot

212
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:27,493
and spread legal awareness
among the public.

213
00:10:28,613 --> 00:10:29,133
Yes.

214
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,373
The 7·7 case of the woman in Hangzhou

215
00:10:30,414 --> 00:10:32,334
who picked up a parcel

216
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:33,173
and was slandered and defamed.

217
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:34,454
The Procuratorate had to issue

218
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:35,454
a Prosecution Recommendation

219
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,573
for it to go from a private prosecution
into a public prosecution.

220
00:10:36,654 --> 00:10:38,974
Indeed. This is a pivotal landmark case

221
00:10:39,253 --> 00:10:40,854
where the Supreme People's Procuratorate
demonstrates the importance

222
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:42,014
of taking a strong stance
against online defamation

223
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:42,933
from a judicial perspective.

224
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:45,214
All right.

225
00:10:46,334 --> 00:10:47,493
We have the same idea.

226
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,214
Zhao, hurry up and finish lunch

227
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,253
and sort out the full story for me.

228
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:55,253
Copy that.

229
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:01,334
Are you the one looking for me?

230
00:11:05,094 --> 00:11:06,014
Yin Tiancheng?

231
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:07,933
Why are you dressed like that?

232
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,294
I don't dare to come out
without this getup.

233
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:12,334
Why are you here?

234
00:11:12,654 --> 00:11:13,454
I want to report the situation.

235
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,294
All right. Come with me.

236
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:21,173
I have a lot of complaints

237
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,014
about the Procuratorate.

238
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:24,813
What's the matter with you guys?

239
00:11:25,373 --> 00:11:27,454
You guys were aggressive
when it came to investigating Huiquan.

240
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:29,974
A bunch of prosecutors kept
coming to the company repeatedly.

241
00:11:30,454 --> 00:11:32,253
But where are your people now

242
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,414
that I've been framed?

243
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,014
Answer me, Prosecutor An.

244
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:37,534
What did a civilian-run enterprise

245
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,173
like Huiquan do to you guys?

246
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:40,813
When something happened,

247
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:42,693
you guys kept biting on us
and refused to let us go.

248
00:11:43,693 --> 00:11:45,173
But now that I've been victimised,

249
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:46,414
you guys won't do anything.

250
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:54,493
First of all, I understand how you feel.

251
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:57,334
But it's neither
justified nor meaningful

252
00:11:57,414 --> 00:11:59,534
for you to come at us
with your grievances.

253
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:04,014
Secondly,
you should've followed the procedure.

254
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:06,214
You should've reported the case
to the Public Security Organs first.

255
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,294
Even if a case is filed and the referral
is made for prosecution,

256
00:12:08,334 --> 00:12:10,334
it should be handled
by the district procuratorate.

257
00:12:10,454 --> 00:12:12,334
Not the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

258
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:16,253
I'll be dead by the time
you guys go through the process.

259
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:20,214
Prosecutor An, I'm not going anywhere

260
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:21,813
unless you help me.

261
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:23,693
I've been cancelled anyway.

262
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:25,774
There's nowhere I can go
once I step outside.

263
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:31,933
Give me a reason why I have to be the one

264
00:12:31,974 --> 00:12:33,253
to handle this case.

265
00:12:33,613 --> 00:12:35,573
Because you were in charge
of Huiquan's case.

266
00:12:36,654 --> 00:12:38,334
And I'm related to Huiquan.

267
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,133
Take a look at this.

268
00:12:44,103 --> 00:12:45,863
Someone hired a gangsterdom PR

269
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:47,693
to spread the rumour
that I sexually harassed that woman

270
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:49,173
and spread it all over the Internet.

271
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,813
Everything was manipulated.

272
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:56,214
I paid someone to look into it.

273
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:57,774
For the sake of my reputation.

274
00:12:58,493 --> 00:12:59,974
This has nothing to do
with my father, Yin Huiquan,

275
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:01,974
and Huiquan Group.

276
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,693
This is all the proof I can find.

277
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:05,253
You're a prosecutor.

278
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:08,933
You should be able to find
more on the Internet.

279
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:13,894
Looking up such personal information
on the Internet

280
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:15,373
will involve personal privacy.

281
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:16,854
You'll also need to prove

282
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,053
that the prosecutor
is connected to the case being handled.

283
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:20,454
Everything still has to be done

284
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:21,613
in accordance with legal procedures.

285
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:23,053
You're just dismissing me.

286
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:26,454
Let me put it this way.

287
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,493
A dozen people can now manage

288
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:31,053
tens of thousands of accounts
on the Internet.

289
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:35,733
They are able to send
videos, pictures, and posts,

290
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,454
from the same IP address
at the same time,

291
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:39,933
all of which
are deliberately fabricated.

292
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:42,454
The purpose is
to inflame the public's emotions.

293
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,613
They will also post provocative comments,

294
00:13:45,693 --> 00:13:47,414
delete comments that question them,

295
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,894
set the pace, and get uninformed people

296
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:51,253
to make follow-up comments
and share these things.

297
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:54,334
They are using the sense of justice
of these netizens

298
00:13:54,573 --> 00:13:55,493
to manipulate public opinion

299
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:57,014
and accelerate the spread of rumours.

300
00:13:57,454 --> 00:13:59,014
But in this case,

301
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:01,334
Huiquan Group has continued
to abide by the law

302
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:02,654
and did not act in retaliation.

303
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,373
This showed me a new perspective

304
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,373
of your father, Yin Huiquan,

305
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:09,253
and made us understand that many things

306
00:14:09,334 --> 00:14:11,173
may not be as simple as they appear.

307
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:14,454
We also highly suspect that
there might be a third party

308
00:14:14,933 --> 00:14:17,094
trying to muddy the waters.

309
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:18,414
A third party?

310
00:14:19,414 --> 00:14:21,253
What do I do now, then, Prosecutor An?

311
00:14:23,493 --> 00:14:25,253
Report to the public security
using the appropriate procedures.

312
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:29,253
The Procuratorate will maintain order
on the Internet using our own way.

313
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:32,373
Please have faith in the power
of the rule of law of your country.

314
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:35,294
Be it you as an individual
or Huiquan Group,

315
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,334
we will make the fairest judgement.

316
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,014
Well,
I can't just sit around and do nothing!

317
00:14:41,253 --> 00:14:42,573
I know you're anxious,

318
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,214
but it's no use worrying.

319
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,014
I suggest you watch

320
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,493
more law popularisation videos
from the Procuratorate's channel

321
00:14:48,894 --> 00:14:50,573
and spend less time
watching videos of pretty women.

322
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,334
Your father had Professor Luo

323
00:14:57,974 --> 00:15:01,534
tell you to come and find me, didn't he?

324
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:09,334
Procuratorate Legal Awareness Day.

325
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:10,813
I'm on duty today.

326
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:15,053
Hello, everyone. I am a prosecutor
at Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate,

327
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:15,933
Wang Heyu.

328
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:20,014
(I am a prosecutor of the Public Interest
Litigation Department as well.)

329
00:15:20,094 --> 00:15:23,294
Today, we will be commentating on
current events.

330
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:27,053
I want to talk about the re-appropriation

331
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:31,053
of social death and personal information.

332
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,053
(Innocent)
(The case we are talking about)

333
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:37,014
(took place on a certain date in 2021.)

334
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:41,294
(Mr. Yin went to get coffee
from a coffee shop.)

335
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:06,454
(The Internet
is not a land beyond the law.)

336
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:08,854
(Break the law)
(Vigilantism is not an option.)

337
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:13,733
(If everyone were to solve matters)

338
00:16:13,774 --> 00:16:15,774
(that should be
within the jurisdiction of the law)

339
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:19,693
(by exposing them,
the dignity of the law)

340
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:21,573
(would be trampled on.)

341
00:16:23,214 --> 00:16:26,094
(The power of the law
will be disregarded.)

342
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:29,053
(The private sphere
of Internet users will be violated.)

343
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:32,094
(The network environment
will deteriorate.)

344
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,493
(I would like to remind everyone)

345
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:40,373
(to use tools of the law
to defend your rights.)

346
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:41,933
This incident took less than two days

347
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:46,414
from escalation to conclusion.

348
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:49,573
But through uncontrolled and disorderly

349
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,573
dissemination of information,

350
00:16:51,894 --> 00:16:55,053
inappropriate discussion has yet to cease

351
00:16:55,894 --> 00:16:57,294
even until today.

352
00:16:57,294 --> 00:16:58,253
(Law weapons)

353
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:01,294
(If the entire incident
had not been captured)

354
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,014
(by the surveillance cameras,)

355
00:17:03,214 --> 00:17:05,493
(the consequences
would've been unfathomable.)

356
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:09,253
(It could've affected
someone for the rest of their life.)

357
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,934
This person might not only be
the person involved.

358
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:21,333
Tomorrow, it could be you, me, or them.

359
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:24,654
(Civil Code of the People's Republic of China)
Today, I will tell you that personality

360
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:27,853
is protected by our laws.

361
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:31,934
Article 111 of the Civil Code
of the People's Republic of China

362
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:37,133
clearly states Any organisation
or individual that needs

363
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:42,973
to access other's personal information
must do so in accordance with the law

364
00:17:43,253 --> 00:17:45,133
and guarantee
the safety of such information

365
00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:46,574
(and may not illegally collect, use,)

366
00:17:46,934 --> 00:17:51,654
(process, or transmit
other's personal information.)

367
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:53,093
Tell prosecution stories,

368
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:55,054
conduct effective legal education,

369
00:17:55,613 --> 00:17:57,294
engage in interactive discussions,

370
00:17:57,414 --> 00:17:58,894
and keep up with trending issues
concerning the people.

371
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:00,774
(Thank you for watching)

372
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,093
(the official account
of the Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.)

373
00:18:04,373 --> 00:18:07,493
(Stay tuned every week.)

374
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:12,934
That was okay, right?

375
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:14,774
Director Wang.

376
00:18:15,453 --> 00:18:17,373
Your logic is impeccable.

377
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,973
Protection of personal information
in the Civil Code.

378
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:23,133
Your articulation was
simple, clear, and direct,

379
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,014
with a perfect balance of priorities
and a seamless flow.

380
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,174
Don't... Don't do that.

381
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,534
You're a flatterer.

382
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,973
I was a nervous wreck.

383
00:18:30,294 --> 00:18:35,973
I just made these up on
the spur of the moment.

384
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:38,054
But keep it up.

385
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,414
Next time, you do it.

386
00:18:40,613 --> 00:18:41,213
No problem.

387
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:43,014
You sound confident.

388
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:43,733
I mean it.

389
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:22,333
Hello?

390
00:20:23,414 --> 00:20:24,373
Ling?

391
00:20:27,054 --> 00:20:27,774
Ling.

392
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,133
It's me.

393
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:32,694
Listen to me.

394
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:34,294
It's terrible!

395
00:20:35,294 --> 00:20:38,054
Someone has been looking for you lately.

396
00:20:38,534 --> 00:20:39,014
(Hello?)

397
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:40,213
(Did you hear me?)

398
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:42,014
(Hello?)

399
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,453
What's going on?

400
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,220
(Madam Qi, Missing call)

401
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:07,080
(Li Yitang)

402
00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:25,934
(Impartial and Responsible)
We recently received anonymous reports

403
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:27,133
from members of the public.

404
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:30,534
There are several that
are worth digging into.

405
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:35,054
The first is a report on
the alleged monopoly

406
00:21:35,613 --> 00:21:38,213
and data-driven price discrimination

407
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:39,853
by Huibo, a live-streaming platform

408
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,054
under the Huiquan Group.

409
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:43,654
I suggest
the Public Interest Litigation Department

410
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,213
refer the case
to the Anti-Monopoly Bureau

411
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,014
of the Municipal Administration

412
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:51,694
for Market Regulation in a timely manner.

413
00:21:52,014 --> 00:21:53,534
If the case is true,

414
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:55,333
suggest that they open a case
for investigation.

415
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:57,014
Yes.

416
00:21:57,853 --> 00:21:58,853
Prosecutor Guo,

417
00:21:58,934 --> 00:22:01,534
nowadays,
driven by the effect of the Internet

418
00:22:01,574 --> 00:22:04,174
and the economy of scale,

419
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:07,054
many leading Internet companies
have begun to show trends

420
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:11,973
of monopoly or even oligopoly.

421
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:15,373
Therefore, regulating anti-monopoly

422
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,414
in the digital space

423
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:18,853
will be one of the future
directions of our work.

424
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:22,014
We also received a complaint
from the manufacturer

425
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:25,894
of the famous skincare product,
Maininice.

426
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:27,894
It concerns Huibo too.

427
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,453
They claim that a host

428
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:32,934
named Meow-Meow Cat is selling

429
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,733
large quantities of counterfeit products
with the brand's trademark on them,

430
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,453
severely infringing upon their trademark

431
00:22:38,493 --> 00:22:40,414
and intellectual property rights.

432
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:45,373
An Ni, contact the Administration
for Market Regulation at once

433
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:47,654
and inform them of this matter

434
00:22:47,774 --> 00:22:49,054
and have them investigate
and verify the case.

435
00:22:49,213 --> 00:22:52,414
Likewise, if it is verified,
recommend they open a case.

436
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:53,213
Yes, Prosecutor Guo.

437
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:55,613
Indeed.
According to reports from the public,

438
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,333
there are now more and more

439
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:02,014
counterfeit products being sold

440
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:03,174
through live streaming.

441
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,934
I have also found that since the launch

442
00:23:05,934 --> 00:23:07,654
of the live-streaming feature on Huibo,

443
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,654
many more hosts have joined in.

444
00:23:09,853 --> 00:23:11,774
But not every one of them
meets the standard.

445
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,574
Many of them came from
other live-streaming platforms,

446
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,253
and they themselves
have a lot of problems.

447
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,894
Meow-Meow Cat looks very familiar.

448
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:22,253
I think she has sold goods on other
live-streaming platforms before,

449
00:23:22,294 --> 00:23:23,973
and her sales did very well.

450
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:26,213
Yes. I often come across
them saying slogans such as

451
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,373
"direct from the manufacturer",

452
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,534
"authenticity guarantee", or "get ten times
money back if you receive a fake product".

453
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:32,453
I've also purchased
from live-streaming platforms,

454
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,654
and I've found that some of the hosts

455
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:35,654
actually fake their orders and sales
to increase their credibility.

456
00:23:35,853 --> 00:23:37,414
This kind of behaviour

457
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,574
is false advertising, except

458
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,054
executed in a more discreet manner.

459
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,613
I wonder if Meow-Meow Cat

460
00:23:42,694 --> 00:23:43,694
is doing all of this.

461
00:23:45,493 --> 00:23:45,853
Let's do this.

462
00:23:45,894 --> 00:23:46,853
Conduct further exchange
and communication

463
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,814
with our comrades

464
00:23:49,093 --> 00:23:52,093
from the Administration
for Market Regulation.

465
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:54,654
This time,
not only do we need to find out

466
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:55,774
if there was any false advertising,

467
00:23:56,093 --> 00:23:57,654
but we'll also need to investigate
if she infringed upon the brand's trademark

468
00:23:57,973 --> 00:23:59,934
and whether she was
manufacturing counterfeit products

469
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:01,333
as she sold them.

470
00:24:01,493 --> 00:24:02,534
Once verified,

471
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:05,133
we will resolutely crack down
on the entire operation,

472
00:24:05,414 --> 00:24:06,253
thoroughly investigate the entire chain,

473
00:24:06,373 --> 00:24:07,373
and promptly transfer
all clues of suspected crimes

474
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:09,453
to the Public Security Organs.

475
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:11,814
This includes individuals
and online platforms

476
00:24:11,934 --> 00:24:13,333
who knowingly provide
customer service, copywriting,

477
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:14,534
and other forms of assistance

478
00:24:14,574 --> 00:24:16,894
to the hosts engaged
in fraudulent activities.

479
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:17,973
Objectively speaking,

480
00:24:18,054 --> 00:24:19,774
these people also assisted

481
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,414
in the commission of the crime

482
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,654
and are joint offenders.

483
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:23,934
Understood, Prosecutor Guo.

484
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:25,453
We must crack down

485
00:24:25,694 --> 00:24:27,613
on these sales at the source

486
00:24:27,894 --> 00:24:30,373
and break the chain of crime
at the root.

487
00:24:30,453 --> 00:24:32,174
Indeed. Platforms are not as innocent

488
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,733
as they claim to be.

489
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,534
They turned a blind eye to the sale

490
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:37,093
of counterfeit trademarked goods
on their platform.

491
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:39,054
This time, they must be made
to suffer the consequences.

492
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,934
In recent years, we've witnessed
an increasing number of cases

493
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:46,774
linked to the Internet.

494
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,934
The new forms of cybercrime

495
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:52,574
are constantly evolving

496
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:55,973
and have infiltrated almost every aspect

497
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:57,574
of people's production and life.

498
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:01,213
Everyone, there is a long way to go

499
00:25:01,574 --> 00:25:03,373
to combat the new cybercrime,

500
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:04,934
so I hope that you will do your best

501
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:08,253
to build up your legal knowledge
as soon as possible

502
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:09,654
and practice your basic skills.

503
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:11,493
- Yes.
- Yes.

504
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:24,373
Prosecutor Wang.

505
00:25:24,694 --> 00:25:25,414
Hello.

506
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:26,534
I'm Yin Tiancheng.

507
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:31,253
Sorry for making you come all this way.

508
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:32,894
It's okay. I have a car,
so it's not a big deal.

509
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:39,014
What's this?

510
00:25:39,093 --> 00:25:41,654
These are the gifts
you sent my wife, Li Jun,

511
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:44,213
on her live stream.

512
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,093
I calculated the cost

513
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:47,574
of these gifts
according to the platform.

514
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:49,574
I did the calculations.

515
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,493
You gifted a total of RMB18,600.

516
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:52,294
It's all here.

517
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:54,054
Why are you giving it back to me?

518
00:25:54,093 --> 00:25:55,894
There's no way I can accept you

519
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,133
returning my gift.

520
00:25:57,414 --> 00:25:59,373
Besides, this is just the usual gifting.

521
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:01,014
I could give any live streamer

522
00:26:01,453 --> 00:26:04,174
way more than this amount in
a night on Huibo.

523
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:05,733
Yes, I know.

524
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,574
The gifting function

525
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:09,574
on live stream platforms

526
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:12,534
is a standard business model.

527
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:16,014
It's a form of interaction

528
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,453
between the live streamer
and the viewers.

529
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:21,054
But I think it's important

530
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,453
to spend wisely on everything.

531
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,453
You're young.

532
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:29,774
You shouldn't spend

533
00:26:29,853 --> 00:26:32,534
all your time and energy

534
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:33,613
on things like these.

535
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:36,054
You should spend reasonably.

536
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:37,453
Practise moderation in everything.

537
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:38,934
This is nothing.

538
00:26:39,894 --> 00:26:40,894
A lot of live streamers

539
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:42,414
can't thank me enough
for spending on them.

540
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,054
I don't care about them.

541
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:46,574
I only speak on behalf
of me and my wife.

542
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:51,613
So please take this money back.

543
00:26:52,574 --> 00:26:54,253
One more thing.

544
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:59,373
I will not be delivering
the goods you ordered.

545
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:03,534
I've contacted the platform's backend
customer support.

546
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,973
They will be in touch.

547
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:11,253
But I suggest you cancel
the orders yourself.

548
00:27:11,414 --> 00:27:11,973
That would be best.

549
00:27:12,014 --> 00:27:13,774
What is the meaning of this,
Prosecutor Wang?

550
00:27:15,654 --> 00:27:17,213
You stood up for me

551
00:27:17,453 --> 00:27:19,373
when everyone else
refused to believe me.

552
00:27:20,253 --> 00:27:22,493
I just wanted to show my appreciation.

553
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:23,733
Can't I do that?

554
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:26,213
Tiancheng,

555
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:33,534
my wife is just running a small business.

556
00:27:33,574 --> 00:27:36,174
I'm just an ordinary prosecutor.

557
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,934
If you really are interested in
her products,

558
00:27:41,253 --> 00:27:44,894
you can make a reasonable purchase.

559
00:27:45,534 --> 00:27:52,014
It was your first time
joining her stream, and you placed

560
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,453
such a huge order.

561
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:55,774
Who would think

562
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:58,174
that this is a normal transaction?

563
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:05,934
Also, I didn't go out of my way
to help anyone.

564
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:08,694
I'm only doing my job.

565
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:12,574
I will not treat you differently

566
00:28:12,654 --> 00:28:15,493
just because you are Yin Tiancheng

567
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:17,733
and your father is Yin Huiquan,

568
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:18,694
the chairman of Huiquan Group.

569
00:28:19,814 --> 00:28:23,613
I only did it because I am a prosecutor
of the people,

570
00:28:23,973 --> 00:28:26,973
and you are a member of the people.

571
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:31,774
You're different from the others.

572
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:34,414
Are all prosecutors like you?

573
00:28:35,133 --> 00:28:37,934
To settle something without saying a word

574
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,694
and speak with such clarity
without an ounce of arrogance.

575
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:44,373
Thank you.

576
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:47,493
Thank you
for your recognition of my work.

577
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:51,373
Keep the money.

578
00:28:52,014 --> 00:28:52,814
Goodbye.

579
00:28:54,694 --> 00:28:56,253
Where are you going?
Let me give you a ride.

580
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:59,613
No need. I always to work on foot.
[*11th lines bus means on foot.]

581
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,093
(Huiquan Corporation)

582
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:12,213
The Municipal Supervisory Authority
of the Anti-Monopoly Bureau

583
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:15,574
wants to talk to us

584
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:17,694
after receiving a tip
from the Procuratorate.

585
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:19,654
This is a warning letter.

586
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:22,453
We have been told

587
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:27,373
to make changes and rectify ourselves
in accordance

588
00:29:27,493 --> 00:29:30,654
with the anti-unfair competition law

589
00:29:30,814 --> 00:29:32,534
and e-commerce law.

590
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:35,774
But if we do that,

591
00:29:36,414 --> 00:29:40,453
it'll mean another crisis for us.

592
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:46,414
Chairman, I think

593
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:51,333
while this appears to be a crisis,

594
00:29:51,493 --> 00:29:52,333
it could very likely be

595
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:54,014
an opportunity for the company too.

596
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:55,814
If we can react quickly

597
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:56,534
and take remedial action,

598
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,333
it may be the perfect time

599
00:29:58,654 --> 00:30:02,534
to turn a bad thing into a good thing.

600
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,333
I believe that an excellent company

601
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:07,333
needs to stimulate and bring out
its comprehensive strength

602
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,373
and abilities all the more

603
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:10,493
in the midst of crises.

604
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:12,694
That is what makes
a mature and healthy company like ours

605
00:30:12,733 --> 00:30:14,973
different from the others.

606
00:30:16,934 --> 00:30:20,894
Chairman,
if this matter is handled properly,

607
00:30:20,973 --> 00:30:22,133
our company's reputation

608
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,853
will not only be restored

609
00:30:24,733 --> 00:30:27,894
but our popularity
might even be expanded.

610
00:30:28,574 --> 00:30:29,294
Well said,

611
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:32,014
Mu'en. Let's do this.

612
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:34,733
Write back
to the Anti-Monopoly Bureau.

613
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,133
Declare our stance

614
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:39,453
and show them our corrective measures.

615
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,493
How should I word it, Chairman?

616
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:45,814
I think what you said was good.

617
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,054
You can also tell them

618
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:51,333
that Huiquan is open to suggestions

619
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:53,133
and are actively involved
in rectifying the situation.

620
00:30:53,774 --> 00:30:55,333
You can add this as well.

621
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:59,574
That under the correct leadership
of the Anti-Monopoly Bureau,

622
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:02,294
we will improve
the management of the market

623
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:05,133
and promote a healthy, stable

624
00:31:05,174 --> 00:31:06,774
and fair development of the market.

625
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:08,733
Perfectly said, Chairman.

626
00:31:08,973 --> 00:31:10,973
It is at such critical times

627
00:31:11,093 --> 00:31:12,294
that we must make a timely statement.

628
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,373
Jiang, be prepared

629
00:31:17,894 --> 00:31:20,654
for the administrative fines as well.

630
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:24,373
If we do get a fine,
I have looked into it.

631
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:25,934
It would be around 3%

632
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:28,174
of Huibo's annual turnover.

633
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:31,733
You must be prepared for that.

634
00:31:32,054 --> 00:31:33,973
We must ensure the normal flow of funds

635
00:31:34,014 --> 00:31:35,774
for the company in any case.

636
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:40,054
Besides that,
the investigation will take a long time.

637
00:31:40,174 --> 00:31:42,613
So let's not disclose this

638
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:44,414
to the board and shareholders yet.

639
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:48,054
Chairman, if we don't tell them
about such a serious matter

640
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:50,373
and we do receive a fine,

641
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:52,213
I worry the board will...

642
00:31:52,253 --> 00:31:54,093
Oh, I'll take responsibility
if anything happens.

643
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:56,934
Just do as I say.

644
00:32:01,133 --> 00:32:02,414
(Huibo, the broadcasting platform)

645
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,174
(under the city's leading enterprise,
Huiquan Group,)

646
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:08,774
(may become the first enterprise
in our province to be investigated)

647
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:09,694
(Huibo is investigated for anti-monopoly)
(for anti-monopoly cases.)

648
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:28,654
Mayor,
it's Mr. Yin Huiquan of Huiquan Group.

649
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:30,054
Give me the phone.

650
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:35,853
Mr. Yin.

651
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,054
Mayor Xu.

652
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:40,733
Good evening.
Sorry for you calling you this late.

653
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:43,373
Mr. Yin,
it must be something urgent for you

654
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:44,453
to call me at this hour.

655
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:45,973
Let's skip the pleasantries.

656
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:47,253
Please cut to the chase.

657
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:52,174
Nothing escapes you, Mayor Xu.

658
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:54,654
This is the matter.

659
00:32:55,534 --> 00:32:57,934
Our city's Procuratorate provided a tip

660
00:32:58,253 --> 00:33:00,853
to the Municipal Administration
for Market Regulation,

661
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:03,213
and the administration wasted no time

662
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,174
in conducting an investigation

663
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:07,453
on Huiquan Group's Huibo.

664
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:11,213
You know Huibo is a product

665
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,973
that Huiquan recently acquired.

666
00:33:13,973 --> 00:33:15,493
We want to do something

667
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:18,294
for the people of Jiangcheng.

668
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,133
As a pillar industry,

669
00:33:20,654 --> 00:33:26,534
both Huiquan Group and I have put
a lot of work and effort into it.

670
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:28,733
There is still a difference

671
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,373
between a live-streaming platform
and the Internet.

672
00:33:30,534 --> 00:33:31,414
A live streaming platform

673
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:33,493
combines both social networking

674
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,973
and instant monetisation.

675
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,253
However, no matter how hard we try,

676
00:33:38,294 --> 00:33:42,534
we are still faced with the suspicion
of monopolising the market.

677
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:47,133
We might even be served serious fines.

678
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:53,814
As the head of Huiquan, I can only ask
the officials that serve us

679
00:33:54,174 --> 00:33:58,174
to help mediate wherever possible.

680
00:33:59,493 --> 00:34:02,534
Mr. Yin, I'm not sure
about this matter yet.

681
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:06,694
I'll find out what's going on first.

682
00:34:06,814 --> 00:34:08,893
Within the framework of the law,

683
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:09,693
and without generating

684
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:11,653
any negative impacts,

685
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,453
if it is indeed necessary,

686
00:34:14,014 --> 00:34:15,014
I will formally bring up the issue

687
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,374
at the municipal government's

688
00:34:17,493 --> 00:34:18,413
committee meeting

689
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:19,854
and discuss it at the assembly.

690
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,893
Will this satisfy you?

691
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:24,294
All right.

692
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:25,973
I'm very pleased with that.

693
00:34:26,294 --> 00:34:27,253
Thank you, Mayor Xu.

694
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:30,534
That would be the greatest support
you can give us.

695
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:31,774
Thank you very much.

696
00:34:32,014 --> 00:34:32,534
All right.

697
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,014
Let's keep in touch. Goodbye.

698
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:37,973
Here.

699
00:34:39,134 --> 00:34:42,534
Mayor, I think we shouldn't get involved.

700
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:47,014
Check with the Municipal Administration
for Market Regulation.

701
00:34:47,374 --> 00:34:51,173
If Huiquan has followed
all the regulations of the market,

702
00:34:51,774 --> 00:34:52,733
then just let them know

703
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:55,774
that the municipal government
fully supports it.

704
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,374
There's no need for us to hide.

705
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:00,574
But it is important to be cautious

706
00:35:01,054 --> 00:35:02,014
and prevent regulatory lag.

707
00:35:02,774 --> 00:35:05,774
If the conditions
for closing the investigation are met,

708
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:07,893
then we will focus

709
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:11,693
on guiding and promoting healthy competition
and the development of enterprises.

710
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:15,814
Of course, capital must not be allowed
to expand in a disorderly manner.

711
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:19,014
Market behaviour must be regulated.

712
00:35:19,574 --> 00:35:20,054
Yes.

713
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,860
(Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau)

714
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:27,854
Captain He.

715
00:35:28,973 --> 00:35:31,094
Master. Meow-Meow Cat is Liu Yanfei.

716
00:35:31,294 --> 00:35:32,253
What's our next step?

717
00:35:32,893 --> 00:35:34,334
What's the update

718
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:35,334
on the Municipal Administration
for Market Regulation's end?

719
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,733
They had a third party

720
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:39,413
test the counterfeit products

721
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:40,374
purchased by the victims.

722
00:35:40,854 --> 00:35:43,453
Maininice, the business, also provided
its own quality inspection report

723
00:35:43,614 --> 00:35:44,933
and trademark registration certificate.

724
00:35:45,253 --> 00:35:46,453
We have conclusive evidence.

725
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:49,054
Apply for a warrant of detention
and prepare for the arrest.

726
00:35:49,534 --> 00:35:50,413

Friends!

757
00:37:19,493 --> 00:37:22,253
Do you know why my skin is so nice?

758
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:25,534
That's because I use Maininice!

(Meow-Meow Cat,)

760

straight from the manufacturers,

768
00:37:42,213 --> 00:37:45,574
- but our channels...
- Are legitimate!

they're asking if they get a discount)

- Close the live stream, Zhang.
- Come here.

790
00:38:31,453 --> 00:38:32,534
Stand against the wall.

791
00:38:36,453 --> 00:38:37,493
Are you the host?

792
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:39,614
Name.

793
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:41,814
Meow-Meow Cat.

794
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:43,453

00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,933
Do you know why we're here?

797
00:38:47,094 --> 00:38:48,334
No.

798
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,534
You know

799
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:50,774
what you did.

800
00:38:51,054 --> 00:38:52,134
I see you've developed
a habit of counterfeiting.

801

(Terminal 1)

802
00:39:01,493 --> 00:39:05,893
(Hello. The number you have dialled
is currently unavailable.)

803
00:39:19,493 --> 00:39:20,294
Ms. Li.

804
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:23,574
Li Yitang? It is you.

805
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,134
It's me.

806
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,094
Why are you here?

807
00:39:29,294 --> 00:39:30,413
I came to send my schoolmate off.

808
00:39:30,854 --> 00:39:31,453
I see.

809
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,453
Why are you in this getup?

810
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:34,933
Well, my schoolmate came,

811
00:39:34,973 --> 00:39:35,893
so I took him around for a few days.

812
00:39:36,054 --> 00:39:37,294
I got myself sick.

813
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,094
I caught a cold, so I put on a mask.

814
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:41,453
What about you?

815
00:39:41,574 --> 00:39:43,933
I just got back
from a business trip to the south.

816
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:47,213
I heard you've been
promoted to president.

817
00:39:47,413 --> 00:39:48,213
Congratulations.

818
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:49,933
Actually, things are kind of awkward

819
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:52,614
for Mr. Zhao right now.

820
00:39:53,453 --> 00:39:56,134
It's fine. Don't overthink it.

821
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:57,854
The military camp stays,
but the soldiers come and go.

822
00:39:57,893 --> 00:39:59,294
Huiquan will continue to operate
no matter who leaves.

823
00:40:02,014 --> 00:40:04,213
I still miss the time

824
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:06,334
when the three of us worked together.

825
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:10,134
I don't want these things to separate us.

826
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,893
In the future,
if you need my help with anything,

827
00:40:12,973 --> 00:40:13,574
just let me know.

828
00:40:14,253 --> 00:40:14,493
All right.

829
00:40:15,334 --> 00:40:16,814
We're all in Jiangcheng.

830
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,733
There will be plenty
of opportunities for us to meet.

831
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:21,493
Is anyone picking you up?

832
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:24,413
No, I haven't gotten a cab yet.

833
00:40:24,814 --> 00:40:26,614
Why don't I give you a lift?
My car is right there.

834
00:40:28,413 --> 00:40:29,173
Sure.

835
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:30,933
- I'll take you up on your offer, then.
- Come on.

836
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:33,253
- Let me carry that for you.
- Thank you.

837
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:41,574
Liu Yanfei, you previously sold goods
on another platform.

838
00:40:41,693 --> 00:40:43,453
Why did you switch to Huibo?

839
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:46,413
Well, the fees were cheaper,

840
00:40:46,893 --> 00:40:48,653
they had more comprehensive
live-streaming functions,

841
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:50,213
and the service was better.

842
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,814
And when did you
start selling counterfeit goods?

843
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,334
I can't remember.

844
00:40:56,493 --> 00:40:57,893
The beginning of this year, maybe.

845
00:40:58,134 --> 00:40:58,788
This year?

846
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,134
Do you think
we won't be able to find out

847
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:02,534
if you delete the replay footage?

848
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:07,094
I started last year.

849
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:11,574
You used to be an entertainment streamer.

850
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:15,213
Why did you decide to sell
and manufacture counterfeit goods?

851
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:18,134
That's the only way
to maximise monetisation.

852
00:41:18,374 --> 00:41:20,774
Relying on those gifts is unstable,

853
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,213
and it depends on the mood of the fans.

854
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:25,253
They're both time-consuming,
so I might as well sell goods instead.

855
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:28,854
At the start, I sold a lot of products
from different brands

856
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,893
just to have a try and help sell them.

857
00:41:31,574 --> 00:41:33,733
I was given different percentages
of commission by the merchants.

858
00:41:34,374 --> 00:41:35,134
Then I discovered

859
00:41:35,173 --> 00:41:36,973
that Maininice, in particular,
was really popular

860
00:41:37,054 --> 00:41:38,253
and sold very well.

861
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:40,094
But Maininice's manufacturing prices

862
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:41,213
are too tightly regulated.

863
00:41:41,574 --> 00:41:43,574
I could barely make any profit.

864
00:41:44,413 --> 00:41:45,933
I had no choice.

865
00:41:46,374 --> 00:41:48,574
So you guys decided
to produce your own products

866
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,134
and sell them instead.

867
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:53,334
The quality
of their ingredients is good.

868
00:41:53,334 --> 00:41:55,574
Of course, they're more expensive
than the cheaper ones.

869
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:57,253
Besides, those who watch the streams

870
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:59,134
are all greedy for a bargain.

871
00:41:59,173 --> 00:42:01,213
I'm not going to pay extra
out of my own pocket.

872
00:42:01,893 --> 00:42:05,413
But, Officer,
all these infringing products

873
00:42:05,534 --> 00:42:08,413
were not sold at their original prices!

874
00:42:08,534 --> 00:42:10,933
I don't think that's
a violation of the law.

875
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:13,173
And who was it that claimed
their products

876
00:42:13,733 --> 00:42:14,893
were authenticity-guaranteed

877
00:42:15,014 --> 00:42:16,413
and would give ten times money back
if any were found to be fake?

878
00:42:16,733 --> 00:42:18,134
Have you considered the consequences?

879
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:23,014
I'm a public figure with a fan base
of millions of followers!

880
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:26,854
You can't do this to me.

881
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:29,294
You cheated your fans.

882
00:42:29,374 --> 00:42:30,733
Do you think
they would still support you?
