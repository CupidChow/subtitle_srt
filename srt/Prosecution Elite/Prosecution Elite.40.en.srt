Summon the defendant, Zhang Qiang.

16
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,270
(Defender)

17
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,120
Hello, Zhang Qiang.

18
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,080
I'm the defense attorney of Zhou Siyue.

19
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,239
I have several questions for you.

20
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,919
I hope you can answer me honestly.

21
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,080
Okay.

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,080
Zhang Wanru, the cop who was murdered
as mentioned in the indictment,

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,040
do you know her?

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,159
Yes.

25
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,040
She used an alias.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,760
At first, I didn't know

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
her name was Zhang Wanru.

28
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,960
(When did she join the team of Country A?)

29
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:07,199
The defendant has already confessed.

30
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,840
Why is the attorney still questioning about
Zhang Wanru's undercover mission?

31
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,799
Court investigation is the first debate

32
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,680
between the prosecutor and defendant.

33
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,879
The attorney's question clearly

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,799
had certain agenda.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,999
Is Zhang Wanru's mission related

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,760
to Zhou Siyue's innocence defense?

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,400
His question comes with bait.

38
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,760
In the cross-examination and debate afterward,

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,120
he will lead the judge

40
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,639
to think in the way that will benefit his case.

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,159
This is his preparation.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
We have no idea

43
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,999
what He Jiawei is after,

44
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,960
but I think he is impressive.

45
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,439
He could be better than Ms. An Ni.

46
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,599
He was An Ni's idol in college.

47
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,359
For her, he's invincible.

48
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,159
But for the sake of
the people's rights

49
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,719
and to end crimes,

50
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,920
An Ni will give it her best.

51
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,639
Prosecutor,
please present your evidence.

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,239
Presenting evidence of Zhou Siyue's

53
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,120
international syndicate of telecom frauds.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,599
(Prosecutor)
First off, the digital evidence

55
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:12,639
(Prosecutor)

56
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,200
(Prosecutor)
of this international syndicate.

57
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,999
The data in this memory card

58
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,799
will prove that Zhou Siyue
has operations

59
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,280
in Huadu, Country A, and Country F

60
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,439
and the international
cyber syndicate's structures,

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,320
management, methods of scamming,

62
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,879
data of staff,
and counter-intelligence methods.

63
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,860
(Presiding Judge)

64
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,320
Defendant Zhou Siyue,

65
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,840
do you have any objections?

66
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,400
I have no knowledge of the memory card.

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,999
I do not know its content.

68
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:56,799
Attorney of Zhou Siyue,

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,879
please state
your opinion on the evidence.

70
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,920
I'd like the prosecutor to explain

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,879
where she acquired the memory card.

72
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Prosecutor, please explain.

73
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,999
This memory card is a piece of evidence

74
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,840
our undercover agent Zhang Wanru

75
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,400
sacrificed her life for in Country A.

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,479
According to the provisions

77
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
of the Supreme Court, Procuratorate,
and Ministry of Public Security,

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,600
on issues regarding the
collection, extraction, review,

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
and determination of
digital data criminal cases,

80
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,919
Article 7.

81
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,479
The collection and extraction

82
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:43,519
of digital data should be

83
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,919
conducted by two or more investigators.

84
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,120
The methods of collection

85
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,840
(should comply with technical standards.)

86
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,000
(The evidence collection procedures)

87
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,000
(and methods by the prosecutor)

88
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,639
(have violated the laws and regulations
of our country.)

89
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,479
(I suggest the court excludes them
as illegal evidence.)

90
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,799
Zhang Wanru sacrificed
her life for the evidence.

91
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,400
How is it illegal?

92
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,720
He is using the metaphor
of the fruits of the poisonous tree.

93
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,479
For advocacy of innocence,

94
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,079
it's said that all evidence acquired

95
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,560
is like fruits on a tree.

96
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,160
When the tree is tainted,

97
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,280
all the evidence we provide,

98
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,680
which is the fruits on that tree,

99
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,280
has been tainted as well.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,359
The court shall exclude the evidence.

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,880
In other words, the evidence
was illegally acquired,

102
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,359
and will not be used by the court.

103
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,000
That is the philosophy of
countries with the common law.

104
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,440
It shouldn't be employed
by a legal proceeding in our country.

105
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Look.

106
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,639
Zhou Siyue's attorney used that theory

107
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,880
to his advantage

108
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,479
via the exclusionary
rule of our country.

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,960
I must say that was impressive.

110
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,639
Every step he takes
is incorporated with our law.

111
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,319
He has solid reasoning.

112
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,759
So, how will the trial go?

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,639
It depends on the prosecutor's ability

114
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,600
to flexibly employ the evidence
to her advantage.

115
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,160
Prosecutor, continue to
present your evidence.

116
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,400
The following is evidence
regarding the defendant Zhou Siyue's

117
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,079
international syndicate of telecom fraud,

118
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,280
including testimonies from co-defendant

119
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,639
Li Quan and Qian Tianxin,

120
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,919
as well as statements from the victims.

121
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,079
If the clients say no,

122
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,400
tell them this is the latest info on the products

123
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,759
and the secret purchase info.

124
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,639
We're giving them away for free!

125
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,239
Tell them to just take it.

126
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
And we are giving away

127
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,440
free coins during an upcoming event.

128
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,880
It will be exclusive to their province.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,479
There are only slots left.

130
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Not bad.

131
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,199
Sure.

132
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,160
If the clients say they are busy

133
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,160
and are unwilling to hear us out?

134
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,560
Continue to speak with enthusiasm.

135
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160
(It's okay.)

136
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,519
(This is a giveaway from us.)

137
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,600
(We are having this giveaway)

138
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,239
(to give back to old users
and to garner new users.)

139
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,319
(If you're busy,)

140
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,400
(I can add you on WeChat)

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,639
(and send you the info on the event.)

142
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,799
(If you want in,)

143
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,359
(just give me a message.)

144
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,840
(Your WeChat account
is your phone number,)

145
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:19,479
right?

146
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,960
See?

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,400
That's how you do it.
Establish a contact.

148
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,479
Then, toss them the bait.

149
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,479
(Lure them in.)

150
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,720
(Once you've piqued their interest,)

151
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,039
(ask for a small amount of administration fee.)

152
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,560
(Alprazolam)
(To cover their cost,)

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,799
(they will continue
to invest even more money.)

154
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,199
Defendant Zhou Siyue,

155
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,239
any objections against the evidence?

156
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:21,039
Laozi once said,

157
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,440
"Nature will take from the excess
to make up for what's lacking.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,440
but humans use
what is lacking for gains."

159
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,759
It's human nature.

160
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,960
The first men to
gain success via the internet

161
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,960
merely made use
of the timing and opportunity.

162
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,639
They might not be smarter than me.

163
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,360
And I was only born a few years after them.

164
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,800
I missed the time
where the internet economy

165
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,240
was thriving like weeds.

166
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,280
Defendant, please state your opinion

167
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,480
based on the evidence presented.

168
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,240
The prosecutor accused me
of committing crimes.

169
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,960
But I am the result of it.

170
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,840
What gave birth to the crime

171
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,439
is the information society that
constantly bombards everyone's life.

172
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,319
Western sociologists Samuel A. Stouffer
and Robert King Merton

173
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,319
have each stated their theories
on relative deprivation.

174
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,840
In other words,

175
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,960
when we realize we are at a disadvantage

176
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:14,800
or when we are inferior to others,

177
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,400
we will feel deprived.

178
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,720
(That leads to dissatisfaction, anger,
and resentment.)

179
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,199
In the day and age

180
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,079
where information
society expands rapidly,

181
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,960
rounds of rivalry on social media

182
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,400
is promoting anxiety.

183
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:35,160
All of us cannot escape it.

184
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,679
The internet magnifies
our sense of deprivation

185
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,079
and amplifies anxiety.

186
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,079
However,

187
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,199
the virtual world
created from the internet

188
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,040
gave most of us room to take a break.

189
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:50,960
People get to forget
their stress for a moment.

190
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,559
Only in the virtual world

191
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,759
can the sense
of deprivation be eliminated.

192
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:00,999
Only there can all be equal.

193
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,319
(Presiding judge)

194
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,519
(Presiding judge)
In the virtual world,

195
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,800
whether you are poor or rich,

196
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:08,240
(Defender)
we play the same game.

197
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,679
(Defender)

198
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,439
(Defender)
We donate to the same streamers.

199
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,679
The internet breaks us free from
the shackles of inequality

200
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
so we can be our own masters.

201
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,240
This is the cause I devoted my life to.

202
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,639
I make people pay for
the freedom and equality

203
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,879
they cannot acquire in the free world.

204
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,480
You call me a fraud.

205
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,679
But I'd rather call myself a magician.

206
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,040
Attorney of defendant Zhou Siyue,

207
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,519
please state your opinion.

208
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,079
The evidence provided by the prosecutor

209
00:10:41,119 --> 00:10:43,519
is about the Operation 7·23 internet scams.

210
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,079
However, she has failed to prove

211
00:10:46,119 --> 00:10:47,040
that my client, Zhou Siyue,

212
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,360
is the mastermind behind this
massive international scam syndicate.

213
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,759
(Prosecutor, your response.)

214
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,240
(According to the statement
from the co-defendant Li Quan,)

215
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,639
Zhou Siyue is the mastermind
of their syndicate.

216
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,559
I will show detailed evidence

217
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,840
of Zhou Siyue being the mastermind
of that syndicate.

218
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,600
I request for co-defendant Li Quan's
to be brought to court.

219
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
Summon the defendant, Li Quan.

220
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:17,000
(Witness)

221
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,319
My name is Li Quan.
In 2018, I was a managing agent

222
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,879
in Qian Tianxin's scam syndicate in Country A.

223
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,639
To the world,

224
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,160
I was the person in charge in Country A.

225
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,199
But the truth is,

226
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,559
I was taking orders from my superiors,
Qian Tianxin.

227
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,759
After our base in Huadu got into trouble,

228
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,999
my superiors suspected that
we had a mole among us.

229
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,519
(We were told to set up a trap.)

230
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,999
(We had confirmed)

231
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,679
(that Zhang Wanru
was an undercover cop.)

232
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,720
(Permanent Resident, Name: Zhang Wanru)
(Immediately, I reported this)

233
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,600
(Permanent Resident, Name: Zhang Wanru)
(to my superiors.)

234
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,079
(I got the files.)

235
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,360
I didn't think
you'd contact me personally.

236
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,040
Is Zhou...

237
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,999
(Never mind him.)

238
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,199
(He is useless to us now.)

239
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:13,280
(But you, on the other hand...)

240
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:15,600
Yes.

241
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:17,800
After I get to the bottom of this,

242
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,160
I won't show any mercy.

243
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,559
(Regardless of what information
this mole had collected from us,)

244
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,400
(I think we should assume the worst.)

245
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,559
(No one wants the evidence)

246
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,160
(to fall into the mole's hands)

247
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,439
(or even get leaked.)

248
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,759
Understood.

249
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,480
(Should anything go wrong,)

250
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,999
(you know what to do.)

251
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:36,920
(Remember,)

252
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,480
(do not mention my name to anyone.)

253
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,280
(Permanent Resident, Name: Zhang Wanru)
You only know about A.

254
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,240
To ensure the authenticity and
completeness of the evidence,

255
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,879
we kindly request the court's

256
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,679
permission to play the interrogation
footage of co-defendant Paul.

257
00:12:59,119 --> 00:12:59,960
Granted.

258
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,519
Paul.

259
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,280
Who ordered you

260
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,800
to hit Zhang Wanru with a car?

261
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,879
Prestigious prosecutor,

262
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,600
I'd like to confess my crime.

263
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,559
I was addicted to drugs at the time.

264
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,999
I needed money.

265
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,879
That was when

266
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,840
an old man from Port Selva

267
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,920
met me on Carey-Layes Avenue.

268
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,280
He gave me a photo.

269
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,480
He wanted me to murder the woman.

270
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,160
(Paul.)

271
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,519
(Can you identify who hired you?)

272
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:30,800
(Was it her?)

273
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:32,439
(No, not her.)

274
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,679
(Is it him?)

275
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,759
(No.)

276
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,559
(- Him?
- No.)

277
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,319
(And this person?)

278
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,720
(They look similar.)

279
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:45,879
(He looks like the man.)

280
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,480
(But you said it was an old man.)

281
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,040
(When we met,)

282
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:53,639
(I had suspected him.)

283
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,759
(He dressed up like an old man,)

284
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:59,960
(but the hands were smooth and fair
like a woman's.)

285
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,879
Bring Li Quan from the court.

286
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,519
Defendant, please explain.

287
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:28,840
All those who are present and absent think

288
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:30,559
that I am a cursed criminal

289
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,519
of unspeakable evil.

290
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,600
I won't deny that.

291
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,600
But I want you to remember one thing.

292
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,439
I hope you keep in mind

293
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,480
that cyber crimes nowadays

294
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,360
are different from
all conventional forms of crime.

295
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,360
I didn't hold a knife at your neck

296
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,280
and force you to hand over your wealth.

297
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,199
You did all of these willingly.

298
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:58,160
Had you not been so greedy,

299
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,160
you wouldn't have fallen
for false promises of making a fortune.

300
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,800
Had you contained your urges,

301
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:06,960
you wouldn't have clicked on
the porn streams.

302
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,040
Had you not pursued
the delusional exhilaration,

303
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,439
you wouldn't have partaken in
online gambling.

304
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,600
You chose to do these on your own.

305
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,160
The empire that I had wasn't built by my hands,

306
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,800
it was you who built it for me.

307
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Of course.

308
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,800
You can put me in jail
and give me a death sentence.

309
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:29,600
You can make me accept

310
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,160
the punishments you think I deserve.

311
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,360
But I want you to listen very closely.

312
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,160
None of you has the right to judge me

313
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,879
from a moral high ground.

314
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,360
All of these were your doing.

315
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:49,079
Defendant's attorney,

316
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,519
state your opinion.

317
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,679
I feel sorry for Zhang Wanru's death.

318
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,040
But in this case,

319
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,679
Zhang Wanru employed illegal methods
during her investigation.

320
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,439
All evidences presented are against the law.

321
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,439
They should be
excluded as illegal evidence.

322
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:09,280
The information presented accused
Zhou Siyue of crimes,

323
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,040
but it's unclear and the evidence is lacking.

324
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,280
I request that the defendant
be acquitted of all charges.

325
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,559
(Attorney, please explain further.)

326
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,199
(The key evidence presented by the prosecutor,)

327
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,679
(which was allegedly provided by Zhang Wanru)

328
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,439
(in the form of digital
data in the memory card)

329
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:24,759
had the following issues.

330
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,879
Based on the trial,

331
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,119
the source of the data is unknown.

332
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,240
The making, acquisition,

333
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,480
locations, and methods are questionable.

334
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,199
(It failed to eliminate any doubts.)

335
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,319
We have no means to verify
the authenticity of the content.

336
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:38,999
According to
the examination and determination

337
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,360
of evidence in death penalty cases,

338
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,639
it should be excluded
as illegal evidence.

339
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,240
Secondly,

340
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:45,439
Zhang Wanru is alleged

341
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:48,240
to have facilitated the defendant
in carrying out fraud crimes.

342
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,240
It's made clear
after the court investigation.

343
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,319
Zhang Wanru falsified her identity.

344
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
She used illegal entry and lies

345
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,840
to earn the trust of
the defendant's team.

346
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,920
She became an executive after joining the team.

347
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,159
How is the attorney
accusing Zhang Wanru now?

348
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,559
The attorney is using the sting operation
by the police

349
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,679
as a reason to defend the defendant, Zhou Siyue.

350
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,559
What is a sting operation?

351
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,760
In countries with common law,

352
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,039
their criminal law,

353
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:26,000
has a justified reason for defense

354
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,960
where the defendant may claim
that they committed the crime

355
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,880
under the influence of the police.

356
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,600
They may use that as a reason
to absolve themselves.

357
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,120
But why would the common law

358
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,679
acknowledge this kind of defense strategy?

359
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,279
The permission to use
the sting operation as an excuse

360
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,559
is to prevent the authority

361
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,960
from creating false charges on innocent people.

362
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,880
A country should teach
the people to respect the law.

363
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,919
If the police are using traps on people,

364
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
what does it mean?

365
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,919
They are creating more crimes.

366
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,199
That will paint a bad on the justice
system for the people to see.

367
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:12,240
The opinion presented by the prosecutor
regarding the sentencing

368
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:15,640
of the death penalty
for the defendant Zhou Siyue

369
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,120
goes against Article 15 of Criminal Procedure Law

370
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,559
of the People's Republic of China.

371
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,319
It goes against the principle of
leniency for those who plead guilty.

372
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,319
My defendant has pleaded guilty.

373
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,520
But the prosecutor didn't show

374
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,840
leniency regarding
her sentence recommendation.

375
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,000
The attorney just said

376
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,919
Zhou Siyue should
be acquitted of all charges

377
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,399
and now he says
the guy had pleaded guilty.

378
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
There is a name for this method.

379
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,120
The "fence-straddle" tactic.

380
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,799
This is a new defense tactic

381
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,199
that emerged after
the 2018 Criminal Procedure Law's

382
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,919
introduction of the leniency system

383
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,700
for pleading guilty.

384
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,559
What this means is

385
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,159
while the defendant pleads guilty,

386
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,559
the attorney can still

387
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,159
fight for the defendant to be acquitted.

388
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,799
He is also allowed to make use

389
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,000
of the system of pleading guilty

390
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,120
to fight for the
defendant's basic rights.

391
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:08,880
He's fighting for
Zhou Siyue to be acquitted.

392
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,720
How can he prove the defendant
is pleading guilty?

393
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,439
Because the attorney

394
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,199
has the independent right to a defense.

395
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,399
The law doesn't forbid
the defendant's attorney

396
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:20,640
to go for an innocence defense

397
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,679
after the defendant has pleaded guilty.

398
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,640
Fairness is always a top priority

399
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,159
in the legal system.

400
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
This tactic of "fence straddling."

401
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:36,120
has an advantage in
preventing false accusations.

402
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,199
Of course it's allowed to exist.

403
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,360
Prosecutor, your response.

404
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,199
Firstly, regarding the defense
raised for the defendant Zhou Siyue

405
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:47,760
concerning the alleged illegality
of the digital data collection in this case,

406
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
the response is as follows.

407
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,159
Regarding the provisions
on the collection,

408
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,399
extraction, review, and determination

409
00:19:52,439 --> 00:19:54,399
of digital data in criminal cases,

410
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:55,199
Article 8

411
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:55,919
and Article 9,

412
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,079
it is indeed true
that the digital evidence

413
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:01,760
in this case was not
collected in accordance

414
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,120
with the aforementioned regulations.

415
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,640
Silence.

416
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,640
However, the attorney's
viewpoint falls into

417
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,960
the fallacy of hasty generalization.

418
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:13,120
Defendant Zhou Siyue's attorney

419
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,399
has not shown the full spirit

420
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:16,720
of the judicial interpretation of issues

421
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,760
related to the collection,
extraction, review,

422
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,000
and determination of digital data

423
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,159
in criminal cases in court.

424
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,720
Instead, he has taken isolated excerpts

425
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,399
and misinterpreted the spirit

426
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,279
of the judicial interpretation,
misleading the court.

427
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,399
Our sole purpose here today is

428
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:31,360
to ascertain the truth, to determine

429
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,559
whether the defendant has committed a crime,

430
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,679
what crime has been committed,

431
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,600
and what punishment should be imposed.

432
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,640
Therefore,

433
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,439
let's turn our focus

434
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,039
to the main purpose of this trial.

435
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,919
In this case, the evidence collector Martyr
Zhang Wanru, who sacrificed her life,

436
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,679
collected evidence
within the syndicate alone

437
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,480
and constantly
faced life-threatening danger.

438
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,159
It is due to objective reasons
that the evidence

439
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:55,199
was not collected according
to the aforementioned regulations.

440
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,600
As referred by the attorney,

441
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,760
according to Article 10
of the provisions on issues regarding

442
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,480
the collection, extraction, review,

443
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,199
and determination of
digital data in criminal cases,

444
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,559
it was not clarified
by the attorney in court.

445
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,720
The prosecutor shall explain now.

446
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,159
Due to objective reasons,

447
00:21:10,199 --> 00:21:12,360
if it was not viable
to collect digital data based on

448
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,960
Article 8 and Article 9,

449
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,840
methods such as photography,

450
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,039
printing, and recording can be
used to secure relevant evidence,

451
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,919
with the reasons
clarified in the statement.

452
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,480
Therefore, Martyr Zhang Wanru's
evidence collection

453
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,159
complies with the legal

454
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,720
procedural requirements, and is lawful.

455
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:31,199
The evidence collected
by Martyr Zhang Wanru,

456
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,079
backed by numerous
co-defendant confessions

457
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,919
and victim statements,

458
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,279
has been accepted as evidence

459
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,439
in the trials of the co-defendants

460
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,640
(in Huadu, Country A, and Country F.)

461
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:43,319
Therefore,

462
00:21:43,399 --> 00:21:45,880
the evidence should not be excluded.

463
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,279
The digital data
presented by the prosecutor in court,

464
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,679
along with other relevant evidence,

465
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,600
correspond to each other

466
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,279
forming a chain of evidence.

467
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,799
I request that the court

468
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:59,520
trust the digital evidence
Martyr Zhang Wanru sacrificed her life for.

469
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,600
Secondly,

470
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,919
the issue raised by the attorney

471
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:05,600
regarding the illegal evidence

472
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,600
is a case of the straw man fallacy.

473
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,120
Prosecutor, please explain.

474
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,399
Zhou Siyue's attorney

475
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,559
argues that Martyr Zhang Wanru
had previously worked

476
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,960
undercover overseas

477
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,199
and engaged in various activities
within the syndicate.

478
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,600
He thus proposed

479
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,360
that Martyr Zhang Wanru was part
of the sting operation.

480
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,240
He further deduced that
the investigation was unlawful

481
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,000
and came to a conclusion

482
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,600
that this is a case of

483
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,159
sting operation by law enforcement.

484
00:22:32,439 --> 00:22:34,079
He thus suggested the court

485
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:36,480
on the basis of
excluding illegal evidence,

486
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,960
that the defendant should be acquitted.

487
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,559
This argument constitutes
a case of straw man fallacy.

488
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,039
(Silence.)

489
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,480
(None of the evidence in this case)

490
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,720
(suggest that
Martyr Zhang Wanru ever enticed)

491
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:54,079
or influenced the syndicate

492
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,120
to engage in criminal activities.

493
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,399
Prior to Martyr Zhang Wanru's
undercover operation,

494
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:00,199
the criminal intent and behavior

495
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:02,520
were already evident.

496
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,319
Therefore,

497
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,319
Martyr Zhang Wanru cannot be

498
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,399
misconstrued as
part of a sting operation.

499
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,559
The digital evidence that cost
Zhang Wanru her life

500
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,120
should not be
excluded as illegal evidence.

501
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,799
The attorney cannot
use Martyr Zhang Wanru's

502
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,039
aforementioned actions
as a reason to absolve

503
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,360
the defendant Zhou Siyue
of criminal charges.

504
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,760
Finally,

505
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,559
regarding the sentence
recommendation for the defendant,

506
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,919
the principle of pleading guilty

507
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:24,799
and accepting punishment
should be upheld.

508
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,360
However, if the defendant does not
accept the sentence recommendation,

509
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,640
it is pleading guilty
without accepting punishment.

510
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,199
The principle of leniency for pleading
guilty can only be applied moderately,

511
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,600
rather than indiscriminately.

512
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Taking into account

513
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,000
that the defendant Zhou Siyue is
the principal offender in a murder

514
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:41,399
and a key member
of the cyber crime syndicate,

515
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,520
the severity of the crimes
committed is significant,

516
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,120
and the consequences are serious,

517
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,559
it's not adequate to apply absolute
leniency and exclude the possibility

518
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,279
of applying the death penalty.

519
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,000
The debate ends.

520
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,919
Defendant,
please make your final statement.

521
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,279
The prosecutor

522
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,199
thinks she is helping those
who were scammed

523
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,000
and upholding justice for the victims.

524
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,279
But is that what they need?

525
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,399
The high and mighty judges

526
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:17,919
and prosecutors,
do you know these people?

527
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,120
Yes.

528
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,520
I scammed them.

529
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,480
But I also ignited their hope

530
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,000
and their ambitions.

531
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,360
I helped them take the step

532
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,600
that led to a different life.

533
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,039
I believe

534
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,199
the prosecutor will not agree with me on this.

535
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
It can't be helped.

536
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,799
We don't share the same values.

537
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,439
You must find it odd.

538
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
I agreed to plead guilty,

539
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,760
so why am I arguing?

540
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,159
Why would I spend a huge fortune

541
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,319
to hire the most outstanding lawyer to defend?

542
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,559
I want this trial to be exciting enough

543
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,439
to set an example.

544
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,079
An Ni.

545
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,880
Hate me however you want,

546
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,960
but you will never forget me

547
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
or break free from me.

548
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,720
Even after I die,

549
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,960
my name shall always

550
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,000
be tied to your name.

551
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,079
It's all black and white.

552
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,600
It's can't be deleted.

553
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,319
It sticks.

554
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
It will forever be there.

555
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:52,000
Just like

556
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,520
my love for you.

557
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,799
Silence!

558
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,559
The final statement ends.

559
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,679
The court is adjourned.

560
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,279
Sentencing will not be made today.

561
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:23,279
We will continue in the next trial.

562
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,950
(Six Months Later)

563
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,940
(After the court trial and deliberation
by the judicial panel.)

564
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,082
(1. Zhou Siyue is found guilty of intentional homicide
and is sentenced to death.)

565
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:48,418
(He is also found guilty of fraud

566
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:51,260

569
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,253
(Sentences are to be served concurrently,
and the death penalty is to be implemented)

570
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:06,680
(with the confiscation of all assets.)

571
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:13,940
(2. Zhao Jikai is found guilty
of infringing upon citizens' personal information)

572
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,240
(and is sentenced to six years in prison,)

573

575
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,240
(with a fine of eight million RMB.)

576
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,820
(Sentences are to be served concurrently,
resulting in a total of 15 years in prison,

577
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:38,240
(along with a fine of ten million RMB.)

578
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,340
(3. Li Quan is found guilty of intentional homicide)

579

585
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,350
(along with a fine of three million RMB.)

586
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,770
(Huiquan Group)

587
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,000
Mr. Liu!

588
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,640
How are the family affairs going on?

589
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:52,640
Mr. Yin.

590
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,120
I feel so ashamed.

591
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,799
After my wife found out,

592
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,120
she really taught me a lesson.

593
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,760
Had you not vouched for me,

594
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,640
I wouldn't have made it.

595
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,799
I am so sorry for what happened in the past.

596
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
It's behind us now.

597
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,520
I would rather

598
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,120
not recall the unpleasant memories.

599
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm glad you're back at Huiquan.

600
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,079
Mr. Yin.

601
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,520
Why did you call for this meeting?

602
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,079
I summoned all of you

603
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,679
because I have two pieces of good news.

604
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,399
First off,

605
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,000
after Jiangcheng
People's Procuratorate

606
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,039
ordered an immediate reformation,

607
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,120
the court has ruled
that all the illegal proceedings

608
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,840
that came from Xiao Mu'en syndicate
and used to purchase shares

609
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:49,159
has been confiscated by the treasury.

610
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,399
In other words,

611
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:55,319
Huiquan's finances are totally clean.

612
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,079
The negative impact we left the society

613
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,159
is slowly fading.

614
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:04,319
Our reputation and
ratings as a corporation

615
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:05,840
have improved tremendously.

616
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,159
Many corporations are eager

617
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,799
to be our business partners.

618
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,039
Secondly,

619
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,919
Huiquan Corporation has already

620
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,279
found a new business direction.

621
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,279
From now on, Huiquan
will put more efforts

622
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,319
in the market economy and user necessities.

623
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,240
I hereby announce

624
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,760
that our new product
experience officer, Chen Yonggang,

625
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
shall be in charge of this mission.

626
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,279
You're finally here.

627
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
What is this place?

628
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,720
Why did you ask to meet here?

629
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:46,319
(Legal Affair Department)
This is where I work.

630
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,880
(Legal Affair Department)

631
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,159
I am the new legal representative

632
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:50,640
of this company.

633
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:51,919
Wait.

634
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,000
For real?

635
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:54,159
Of course it's true.

636
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,919
This is huge.

637
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,039
You should have told me.

638
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,199
I just got here not long ago.

639
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,720
Check out the place.

640
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,159
The environment is nice, right?

641
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,559
Not bad.

642
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,520
It's near your house too.

643
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:06,319
Yes.

644
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,760
Not bad.

645
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,360
Made up your mind
to start working again?

646
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:14,559
It's a long story.

647
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,240
Sit down. I'll get you some water.

648
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:17,039
Sure.

649
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,720
Your family is doing better
as time goes by.

650
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:39,039
Yonggang is now Huiquan's
product experience officer.

651
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:41,039
You are the legal representative
of this law firm.

652
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,439
I'm happy for you.

653
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,960
But it won't be easy for a full-time mom

654
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,120
to get back to working again.

655
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,439
It must have been tough.

656
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
It's nothing.

657
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
After going through so many things,

658
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,079
I can see that Yonggang
has matured a lot.

659
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,520
Of course, you helped out
a great deal too.

660
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,039
He just got promoted.

661
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,120
But surprisingly,

662
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,439
he spends more time with the family.

663
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:10,919
He encouraged me to follow my heart.

664
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,960
So, I took the step.

665
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,120
We spent four years studying law.

666
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,279
Over the years, you've been

667
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,480
doing the job you're meant for.

668
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,679
I think

669
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:23,520
it's time for me to do the right thing.

670
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,840
I want to be myself again.

671
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,919
You will do great.

672
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:34,880
Hello? Who is it?

673
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,120
(This is Jiangcheng Hospital.)

674
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,399
(Are you a friend of Li Yitang?)

675
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,720
What is it?

676
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,760
(When we checked the ward,
we learned that she's run off.)

677
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,520
What is it?

678
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,559
It's the hospital.
Tang went missing.

679
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,600
Thanks.

680
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,919
Hello.

681
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,799
I'd like a glass

682
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,279
of what she's having.

683
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,159
Okay.

684
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,640
My drink was made to my preference.

685
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,279
You may not like it.

686
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,240
Drinks are about the mood.

687
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,679
Life is a long journey.

688
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,279
Whether a drink is to my taste or not

689
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,399
is insignificant.

690
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
More importantly,

691
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,600
who am I having this drink with?

692
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,760
Hello.

693
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,279
My name is Zhao Jikai.

694
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,880
I'm Li Yitang.

695
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,800
Not bad.

696
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,040
(I will never forget him.)

697
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,240
(But I won't make
the same mistake again.)

698
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,520
Mr. Wang and Ms. An Ni

699
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,159
both got selected to be

700
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,399
on the National Prosecution
Cyber Crime Expert Think Tank.

701
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,800
They are the first batch

702
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,159
of cyber crime prosecution
experts in Jiangcheng.

703
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,040
We should work harder.

704
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,879
Otherwise, they'd leave us in the dust.

705
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:50,439
Alright, Jia.

706
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,159
We are still National Prosecution

707
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,199
Digital Evidence Collection
Training Camp's

708
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:56,800
honorable evidence collector.

709
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,439
The two of us match the two of them

710
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,399
to form a perfect team.

711
00:34:59,439 --> 00:35:00,839
You don't have any modesty at all.

712
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,280
How do I look?

713
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,800
This badge looks cool.

714
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:08,080
Can I wear it for a little?

715
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,399
No!

716
00:35:08,399 --> 00:35:10,000
I wore this at the last event.

717
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,119
It's different from yours.

718
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,560
How is it any different?

719
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,960
I joined the event as well.

720
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,839
We are the same.

721
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,000
Given our friendship,

722
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,240
don't be so calculating.

723
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,639
Enough. You can't have it.

724
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,839
Give it back now!

725
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:23,879
Admit it.

726
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,480
Did I not teach you how to write

727
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,480
the review report?

728
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,879
Did Mr. Wang teach you that?

729
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:28,560
No.

730
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,599
I didn't need your help.

731
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,919
That was only a discussion at best.

732
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,560
I know that.

733
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,480
Is someone badmouthing me?

734
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,240
What's wrong with you two?

735
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,800
A little exchange of ideas.

736
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,599
Exchange of ideas?

737
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,560
Everyone, settle down.

738
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,000
I have good news to announce.

739
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,359
I now announce

740
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,800
that Supreme People's Procuratorate

741
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,679
has rewarded every one

742
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,080
of Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate
a Class One Commendation.

743
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Do not get too conceited.

744
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:00,760
It's an honor,

745
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
and a motivation from the higher-up.

746
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,960
We must keep up the good work.

747
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,879
The other good news is...

748
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,879
Procurator Guo, a double delight?

749
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:12,879
Heyu is right.

750
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:14,399
A double delight.

751
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,159
Today,

752
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,839
Supreme People's Procuratorate

753
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:21,439
has issued praises to
30 investigative teams

754
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,599
and their 49 prosecutors nationwide.

755
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,599
Jiangcheng's
Special Task Force of Operation 7·23

756
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:31,800
has been announced
as a national outstanding task force.

757
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,919
- Great!
- Great!

758
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:40,919
Prosecutor An Ni has been selected as the
Outstanding Prosecutor of the Year.

759
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,560
Come, An Ni.

760
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,359
Give us a speech.

761
00:36:47,879 --> 00:36:50,399
Procurator Guo, she is not here.

762
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,679
Where is she?

763
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,399
Today is the death anniversary
of Martyr Zhang Wanru.

764
00:36:54,439 --> 00:36:56,199
She went to clean her tomb.

765
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:58,919
Yeah, she mentioned that.

766
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,159
I got busy and forgot.

767
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,080
Okay.

768
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,399
Let's take a photo.

769
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,000
Take a photo.

770
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,639
Everyone, let's take a photo.

771
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,320
Sir, move a little to the left.

772
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,800
Comrades over here,

773
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,080
move to your right a little.

774
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,960
Okay.

775
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,199
On the count of three.

776
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,159
One.

777
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,679
Two.

778
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:17,760
Three.

779
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:30,220
(Heroes are remembered for generations,
martyrs are remembered forever.)

780
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,080
Wanru.

781
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,080
How are things over there?

782
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,639
I can finally visit you with a smile.

783
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,119
This is a copy of Jiangcheng Daily.

784
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:12,960
Xiao Mu'en and Qian Tianxin

785
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,439
have both been given the death penalty.

786
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,520
Justice may be overdue,

787
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,760
but it always prevails.

788
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,520
(Tomb of Martyr Zhang Wanru)

789
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,040
(Tomb of Martyr Zhang Wanru)
You can have peace now.

790
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,199
Wanru.

791
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,520
I've cleaned your father's tomb for you.

792
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,240
I was surprised just now.

793
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,560
That brat Xiaobei still visits you guys even now.

794
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,240
Wanru.

795
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:08,000
Jiangcheng has become a beautiful place.

796
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,879
I wish you could see it.

797
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,800
I knew you'd be here today.

798
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Congratulations.

799
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,919
National Outstanding Prosecutor.

800
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,199
Wanru.

801
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:51,399
Look at him.

802
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:52,480
He's still so mean.

803
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,839
Had it not been Wanru's spiritual support,

804
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,480
I would've given up so many times.

805
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:04,320
I thank you too,

806
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:05,359
Officer He Luyuan.

807
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,800
It's all part of the job.

808
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,480
It's what I wanted to do.

809
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:15,240
Let's go.

810
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,119
After Case 7·23,

811
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,760
you know

812
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,800
what the people of Jiangcheng call you?

813
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,280
What do they call me?

814
00:40:30,399 --> 00:40:32,000
Is it some kind of weird nickname?

815
00:40:33,439 --> 00:40:36,159
A normal and extraordinary nickname.

816
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,800
Prosecution Elite.

817
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,200
♪The hot frozen rain sculptures me♪

818
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,320
That's too big of a title to live up to.

819
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,960
Let's me tell you some statistics.

820
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:48,800
Last year,

821
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,639
the prosecutors investigated over
three million cases nationwide.

822
00:40:53,399 --> 00:40:56,280
Over 800, 000 criminals of all kinds
were arrested.

823
00:40:56,919 --> 00:40:57,720
Among them,

824
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:00,919
282,000 people were charged with

825
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,720
online gambling fraud

826
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,679
and the spreading of indecent content.

827
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,800
There are over 200,000 in
the prosecution nationwide.

828
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,679
There are over 60,000 prosecutors.

829
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,280
Among them,

830
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,960
over 20,000 were female prosecutors.

831
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,399
All of them can take on the title

832
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,080
of Prosecution Elite.

833
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:19,960
There are only 20,000

834
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,599
female prosecutors in the country?

835
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,320
Well...

836
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:23,359
I worked with

837
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,399
one of the 20,000 female prosecutors.

838
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,199
How fortunate of me.

839
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,679
There you go again.

840
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:34,839
I heard you are getting transferred
to the Provincial Procuratorate.

841
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,199
This morning,

842
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,159
Procurator Guo asked for my opinion.

843
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,520
Congratulations.

844
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,119
I turned down the offer.

845
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,080
You did?

846
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,080
But it's a great opportunity.

847
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,560
They have big cases to solve.

848
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:54,119
You get better chances
to show your skills.

849
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,879
Major cases are great opportunities,

850
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,520
the smaller cases are equally important.

851
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
Besides, I grew up in Jiangcheng.

852
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,760
I have a special
attachment for the place.

853
00:42:02,919 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm more than

854
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:05,839
willing to be a normal prosecutor here.

855
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,800
Are you...

856
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:09,480
Do you mean a special attachment
for the place only

857
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,159
or the people too?

858
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,159
Hang on.

859
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,760
Hello?

860
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:16,560
Who is it?

861
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,520
Didn't you tell the presiding judge?

862
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,399
When a prosecutor
is investigating a case,

863
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:24,080
they will monitor the investigations
by the Public Security Bureau.

864
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,560
I don't know

865
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,599
which case you mean.

866
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,320
I am handling 11 cases.

867
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,919
Six of them might already be in trial,

868
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,280
but the sentencing hasn't been made.

869
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:36,520
There are three cases

870
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,280
where more investigation is needed.

871
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:39,320
And there's one...

872
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,280
Okay, I get it.

873
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,119
Wait there.

874
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:45,040
I'm on my way.

875
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,900
