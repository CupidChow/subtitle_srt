15
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:40,857
Who paid the fee?

16
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:42,537
Her husband.

17
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:43,457
Husband?

18
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:45,897
Since when did she get a husband?

19
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:46,936
I don't know.

20
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,817
She had no husband
during our preliminary investigation.

21
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:49,897
That's right.

22
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,016
She does have a husband.

23
00:01:53,257 --> 00:01:55,936
He's a doctor in Country F.

24
00:01:56,336 --> 00:02:00,936
He's a renowned figure in Sanjiang.

25
00:02:01,177 --> 00:02:02,936
He's on good terms with
many prosecutors,

26
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:06,497
officers, even public servants.

27
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:07,936
Due to her marriage with him,

28
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:11,257
Qian Tianxin remains
as a citizen of Country F.

29
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:15,057
I'm afraid things
will be more troublesome.

30
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,016
Do you know that?

31
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,537
Where did she get a husband?

32
00:02:20,097 --> 00:02:23,097
I have another piece of bad news for you.

33
00:02:24,136 --> 00:02:27,097
Her trusted aide, Wei,

34
00:02:27,977 --> 00:02:29,576
was just bailed as well.

35
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:33,376
His bail bond is the same amount,
which is 50 million yuan.

36
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,656
And, he's downstairs as we speak.

37
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:46,897
Ni, how did it go?

38
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:49,656
Qian Tianxin and Yang Wei
were bailed out of jail.

39
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,296
Bailed out of jail?

40
00:02:53,457 --> 00:02:55,097
How could that be?

41
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:02,057
Yang Wei,

42
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:03,457
you better don't get ahead of yourself.

43
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:05,296
It's your business
if you're willing to spend money

44
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,337
to be freed temporarily.

45
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:08,457
However, you'll return here in no time.

46
00:03:11,736 --> 00:03:13,376
Officer He, do you remember what I said?

47
00:03:14,136 --> 00:03:17,177
Our score hasn't been settled yet.

48
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:18,897
Wei, get in.

49
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:21,177
I'll wait for you.

50
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:23,296
Goodbye.

51
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:31,257
They escape again.

52
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:41,817
It's hot. Slow down.

53
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,057
Never in my dreams had I imagined

54
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,337
that I would be fed by a beautiful girl like you.

55
00:03:50,537 --> 00:03:53,817
Sometimes, getting beaten up isn't a bad thing.

56
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:55,977
Stop your slick talk.

57
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,016
It's not like you're disabled.

58
00:03:58,736 --> 00:03:59,417
Have it yourself.

59
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:02,496
Prosecutor An, Officer He,

60
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:03,576
you guys are here.

61
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:05,097
How do you feel?

62
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:07,576
I'm still alive, I guess.

63
00:04:08,216 --> 00:04:10,537
Thank you for saving me from that place.

64
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:12,097
Thank you for giving me a chance

65
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,776
to take care of Xiaobei.

66
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,577
I've finally fulfilled my wish.

67
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:19,376
Next, I will cooperate with your unit.

68
00:04:19,857 --> 00:04:21,616
I will assist with your investigation.

69
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:23,977
I hope that you guys can take care of Xiaobei
on my behalf.

70
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:27,537
He's a nice person.

71
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,417
I heard that the cops released Qian Tianxin

72
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:35,417
just when we got our hands on her.

73
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:36,297
Was that true?

74
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:41,896
Qian Tianxin was bailed out of jail

75
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:42,857
with 50 million yuan.

76
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:44,697
But don't worry.

77
00:04:45,176 --> 00:04:46,697
She still has to obey
the rules of the bail.

78
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:47,417
She won't be able to escape.

79
00:04:48,097 --> 00:04:49,456
What's the difference?

80
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:51,456
She's still having her way out there.

81
00:04:51,737 --> 00:04:53,297
Did you know how many people
she had harmed?

82
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,977
And now, she's enjoying herself
out there.

83
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,697
You guys are useless.

84
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,257
What nonsense are you saying?

85
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,616
You think we released her?

86
00:05:00,656 --> 00:05:01,817
You think we don't want to arrest her?

87
00:05:01,936 --> 00:05:02,936
You think we're here to have fun?

88
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,336
We're in another country.

89
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,857
We have to follow their rules.

90
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:06,616
Who do you think you are, huh?

91
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:08,137
You think you can
do whatever you want here?

92
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:09,216
You're too full of yourself.

93
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:10,137
He Luyuan.

94
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:11,097
Stop.

95
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:02,137
Xin,

96
00:06:02,977 --> 00:06:03,896
it's him.

97
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,137
Do not disturb me again.

98
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:11,857
Okay.

99
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:16,737
Hello?

100
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:17,336
(Hello.)

101
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:21,737
I remember that I told you this

102
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:23,456
before you left, right?

103
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:24,737
(Do not contact me)

104
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,456
(in the next three months)

105
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:27,936
(unless there's an emergency.)

106
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:30,616
You were arrested by the cops.

107
00:06:31,417 --> 00:06:32,537
Does that count as an emergency?

108
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:35,257
I told you already.

109
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:36,697
You don't need to worry.

110
00:06:36,936 --> 00:06:38,216
I haven't even gotten to lie down

111
00:06:38,257 --> 00:06:39,336
on the bed in the detainment center.

112
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,737
Everything is within his plan.

113
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,137
(Everything has been arranged for.)

114
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:44,737
(What are you worried about?)

115
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:46,697
Why?

116
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:49,297
Why do you always listen to him

117
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:50,616
(instead of me?)

118
00:06:51,697 --> 00:06:53,297
Don't tell me you called me

119
00:06:53,577 --> 00:06:55,137
just because you're jealous?

120
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:56,537
I think something like

121
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:58,137
that is beyond your age, you know?

122
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:01,216
There's no time for jokes.

123
00:07:02,137 --> 00:07:03,857
Do you think everything's fine now?

124
00:07:05,616 --> 00:07:06,616
Right now,

125
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,417
you're still in a risky situation.

126
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:10,896
Risky?

127
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,456
Are you referring

128
00:07:13,496 --> 00:07:15,537
to Officer He, who comes to Country F?

129
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:18,017
Or your wife's best friend?

130
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:21,216
(You do expect too much out of them.)

131
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:23,656
(Let me tell you something.)

132
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:24,896
According to my knowledge,

133
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:26,537
for the past three days,

134
00:07:26,857 --> 00:07:28,137
it's either they were interrogating

135
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:29,616
those who were captured
at the police station

136
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:32,697
or visiting Zhang Xiaobei in the hospital.

137
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:35,936
From what my informant told me,

138
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:38,137
your friends

139
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:39,496
(were pretty disappointing.)

140
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:40,936
No matter what,

141
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:42,216
this time,

142
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,137
you have to listen to me.

143
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:47,376
An Ni and Officer He,

144
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:49,297
they won't let you off this easily.

145
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,697
The calmer the situation looks,

146
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:53,656
the more careful you need to be.

147
00:07:54,137 --> 00:07:55,977
(It's best if you can take a boat
and leave the country.)

148
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:57,376
Enough.

149
00:07:57,857 --> 00:07:59,257
Can you just stop?

150
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:00,817
You're back in the country.

151
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:02,456
You should be worried about yourself.

152
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,336
Right now,
we're at the forefront of a storm.

153
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,216
I'm not the one in danger.

154
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:08,456
(You're the one in danger here.)

155
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,056
Why can't you just listen to me?

156
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:14,737
(When will you stop following his arrangements?)

157
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:16,137
(When you have nowhere to escape)

158
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,336
and when it's too late?

159
00:08:17,537 --> 00:08:17,817
(Hey.)

160
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:20,977
Can you stop driving a wedge between us?

161
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:23,936
(Don't teach me what to do.)

162
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,616
(He's the only one)

163
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:26,616
who can tell me what to do.

164
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:28,257
To him,

165
00:08:28,656 --> 00:08:30,137
you're completely ignorant.

166
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,537
But you're completely ignorant about

167
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:35,617
China's judicial power too.

168
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,937
China's judicial power?

169
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:41,016
I'm very curious as to

170
00:08:41,057 --> 00:08:42,857
who you're referring to.

171
00:08:43,336 --> 00:08:45,216
Don't tell me it's the girl
who's still wet behind the ears?

172
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:47,576
(I think now)

173
00:08:47,617 --> 00:08:48,417
her happiest moment

174
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:50,377
is to hug her mother
every day after work.

175
00:08:50,937 --> 00:08:52,256
She came to the wrong place.

176
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:54,937
This girl is just a youngster

177
00:08:55,016 --> 00:08:55,937
who's too eager to render merit

178
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:58,336
and wants people to acknowledge her.

179
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:00,537
(This isn't her territory.)

180
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,336
I'm not the one who should be running.

181
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:04,576
It's her.

182
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:07,377
Do you know something?

183
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:09,696
(The culprit who tried to shoot An Ni)

184
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,816
(was restrained by her boyfriend)

185
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:14,977
(and handed to the cops.)

186
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:19,136
You don't need to worry about that.

187
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:21,136
(I believe you know this too.)

188
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:23,336
(All of my informants
are discreet and individualistic.)

189
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,696
Even if any of them were arrested,

190
00:09:26,136 --> 00:09:27,497
I won't be implicated.

191
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:31,016
(An Ni's boyfriend is called Xiao Mu'en.)

192
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:33,816
I almost gave myself away
when I was chatting with him

193
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:36,537
two days ago.

194
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:39,656
He's devious and observant.

195
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,216
I'm worried

196
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,857
that they might've discovered something.

197
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:47,816
Just stop.

198
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:49,857
That's all for this incident.

199
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:51,016
I told you already.

200
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:51,896
You don't need to worry.

201
00:09:51,937 --> 00:09:52,937
Stop trying to persuade me.

202
00:09:54,216 --> 00:09:56,456
(As for An Ni, I will deal with her.)

203
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:57,497
You don't need to worry.

204
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:58,417
And,

205
00:09:58,816 --> 00:10:00,336
this is a state of emergency.

206
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:01,776
For our safety,

207
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,456
you should stop calling me.

208
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,136
Once everything settles down,

209
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:06,497
I'll find you naturally.

210
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:07,576
I'll hang up now.

211
00:10:32,937 --> 00:10:33,336
Please.

212
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:40,377
Xin.

213
00:10:41,136 --> 00:10:41,737
Semones is here.

214
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:46,256
Okay.

215
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:47,537
I'll be there in a second.

216
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,177
Hello.

217
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:00,297
Good evening.

218
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:01,497
Senior Inspector Semones.

219
00:11:02,336 --> 00:11:04,216
I hope I didn't bother you
with my presence.

220
00:11:04,256 --> 00:11:04,776
Wei.

221
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:06,216
Get me a glass.

222
00:11:06,816 --> 00:11:07,937
How could that be?

223
00:11:08,057 --> 00:11:10,737
I was looking for a person to have a drink with.

224
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:13,417
So, how was it? Have you heard anything

225
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,497
from the police station
for the past three days?

226
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,136
Nothing happened.

227
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:20,417
That Chinese prosecutor

228
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:22,417
brought her police boyfriend

229
00:11:22,576 --> 00:11:24,977
to protest in front of Gonzalez.

230
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:28,016
She reprimanded us for being careless

231
00:11:28,057 --> 00:11:30,136
and allowing a suspect
of serious accusations

232
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:31,177
to be bailed out of jail.

233
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:35,336
I heard that things
didn't go well with them.

234
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,537
They even argued because of it.

235
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:39,497
Fools.

236
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:41,057
Here.

237
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:41,816
Cheers.

238
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:51,016
This wine is nice.

239
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:51,937
Of course.

240
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:54,136
I prepared this especially for you.

241
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:55,136
So,

242
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:56,696
what do you plan to do now?

243
00:11:57,576 --> 00:11:58,656
Now,

244
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:01,776
you've already regained freedom.

245
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:05,136
Seems like those guys
will have to go back empty-handed

246
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:06,937
after their efforts went down the drain.

247
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,537
I heard that you transferred the information

248
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:11,177
you stored in your server and database

249
00:12:11,216 --> 00:12:12,696
to another place beforehand.

250
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,937
Do you plan to take a break

251
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,537
and make a comeback?

252
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:18,857
Senior Inspector Semones,

253
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:20,977
since when were you this concerned
about my business?

254
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:24,216
Are you worried that you might be implicated

255
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:27,297
if An Ni gets her hands on me?

256
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:32,537
It'll definitely land us in trouble

257
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:35,016
if you keep it with you.

258
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:37,656
You've already made enough money.

259
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,297
You should stop.

260
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:42,016
Hurry and destroy all of the data.

261
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:43,776
That's the best for everyone.

262
00:12:45,377 --> 00:12:46,336
Senior Inspector Semones,

263
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,097
is there a misunderstanding?

264
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:49,937
Why do you guys always

265
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,136
see me as a bloodsucker?

266
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:54,097
Do I look like a mosquito?

267
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,696
Actually,

268
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,497
I think I'm a bee.

269
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,857
I'm harvesting honey

270
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:05,097
for the queen bee tirelessly.

271
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:06,776
Tell me then.

272
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,216
Do you think

273
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,256
a bee will get tired from
harvesting honey?

274
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,576
You're crazy.

275
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:16,656
Alright now.

276
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:18,336
Don't be so tensed up.

277
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:20,256
Life is short.

278
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:21,656
We should relax.

279
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,216
What about this?

280
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,256
I think I'll hold a party

281
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:26,977
tomorrow afternoon.

282
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:29,696
I'll invite esteemed figures

283
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:31,417
from the Chinese and business circles
to join my party.

284
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:33,136
I can also dispel the rumors

285
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:35,136
that have been surrounding me.

286
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,256
By the way,

287
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:38,016
I will also invite

288
00:13:38,136 --> 00:13:40,456
esteemed figures from the judicial
and political fields to support me.

289
00:13:40,937 --> 00:13:43,737
You should come by then.

290
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:44,696
Is that okay with you?

291
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:46,696
Of course.

292
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:48,216
Remember to come.

293
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:49,417
There will be hot babes around.

294
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:50,857
You must come, okay?

295
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:25,857
What's the matter?

296
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,820
(Please come to my private party.
I will send you the address soon.)

297
00:14:34,937 --> 00:14:36,297
Qian Tianxin invited me

298
00:14:36,336 --> 00:14:37,336
to her private gathering.

299
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,816
She even told her men
to deliver an outfit to me

300
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:40,576
as she was afraid
I wouldn't have any nice ones.

301
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:42,816
That's too much.

302
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:45,097
Isn't she provoking us right now?

303
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,377
I guess she already thought

304
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:49,896
that she won the battle.

305
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,057
I don't think it's just
a mere provocation.

306
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,937
She should try to bribe us too.

307
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,816
She'll give us one or two key figures
for us to bring back

308
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,097
so that we can claim credit.

309
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:03,097
In exchange, she wants us
to stop monitoring her.

310
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,377
You do know her pretty well, huh?

311
00:15:08,336 --> 00:15:09,857
Don't go. It's too risky.

312
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:10,537
Don't forget.

313
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,256
She just hired someone to shoot you.

314
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:16,417
No matter how crazy she is,

315
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,216
I don't think she'll hurt me in public.

316
00:15:19,097 --> 00:15:20,816
Besides, she already
delivered the outfit here.

317
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,216
If we don't go,

318
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,097
it'll show that we have
a guilty conscience.

319
00:15:25,537 --> 00:15:26,816
If so,

320
00:15:28,097 --> 00:15:29,377
let's get ready.

321
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:33,537
It's so hot.

322
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:35,537
I thought you left it there
for the entire night?

323
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:42,937
Stop blowing.

324
00:15:44,456 --> 00:15:45,336
You can have it.

325
00:15:54,136 --> 00:15:56,776
But you already took a sip.

326
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:57,576
It's fine.

327
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:18,857
Ms. An Ni.

328
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:20,656
My boss is waiting for you.

329
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:21,776
Please.

330
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:46,456
Please excuse me.

331
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:56,256
Hello.

332
00:16:56,456 --> 00:16:57,456
Prosecutor An.

333
00:16:58,937 --> 00:17:00,057
Ms. Qian, thank you for inviting me

334
00:17:00,216 --> 00:17:01,656
to your party.

335
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:05,497
Are you not used to such functions?

336
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:08,536
Not at all.

337
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,456
I have great adaptability.

338
00:17:12,257 --> 00:17:14,056
You've been in Country F
for some time now.

339
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:15,377
And, we've been

340
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:16,977
pitting ourselves against each other
all the time.

341
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,737
It's rare for us

342
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:20,696
to have the chance
to chat with each other.

343
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:22,377
Please.

344
00:17:40,056 --> 00:17:40,657
Please.

345
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:52,936
Please excuse me

346
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,017
for bringing you to such a quiet place.

347
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:56,816
I love places that are quiet.

348
00:17:58,056 --> 00:17:59,416
Do you play chess?

349
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:01,336
I did learn a little before.

350
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:03,176
Great.

351
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:04,497
You're my guest.

352
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:06,296
You can control the white pieces.

353
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:14,737
Say,

354
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,017
there's no need for you to do this.

355
00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:18,216
We've been pitting ourselves
against each other for a long time.

356
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,657
You know this too.

357
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:24,017
Even if I do record everything I did

358
00:18:24,497 --> 00:18:25,696
with a recording pen,

359
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:27,977
you still can't do anything to me,

360
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:29,137
am I right?

361
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,097
Are you sure

362
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:35,657
that we'll return
empty-handed this time?

363
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:37,857
When did I say

364
00:18:37,897 --> 00:18:39,377
that I would let you
return empty-handed?

365
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:40,416
You misunderstood me.

366
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:43,777
I've already instructed
the two managers under me.

367
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:45,977
They were willing to admit

368
00:18:46,056 --> 00:18:47,897
that they were the ones
behind everything.

369
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:51,137
You can bring them back

370
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,336
and announce to the world

371
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:55,137
that you've eradicated

372
00:18:55,336 --> 00:18:58,097
a foreign mega cybercrime syndicate.

373
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:59,737
And, you even caught its leader.

374
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,336
You can render merit

375
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:02,696
and receive all the awards you want.

376
00:19:02,857 --> 00:19:03,377
Isn't that great?

377
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,617
It's the best of both worlds, am I right?

378
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:08,617
So, Ms. Qian Tianxin,

379
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:12,377
did you think we came all the way here

380
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:13,777
just because we wanted to render merit
and receive awards?

381
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:15,897
Don't tell me it was
because of your dreams?

382
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:18,857
You need to know this.

383
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:20,416
You have to pay the price

384
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,576
for the things you desire,

385
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:24,137
especially your dreams.

386
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:25,857
You have to pay a huge price for them.

387
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:27,777
Sometimes,

388
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:31,137
you might even lose your loved ones
because of them.

389
00:19:35,056 --> 00:19:36,456
That's right.

390
00:19:42,536 --> 00:19:43,536
So, was that how

391
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:45,696
you lost your loved ones?

392
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:46,977
Me?

393
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:48,377
You're wrong.

394
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,296
I don't love anyone.

395
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,737
I was just after the rights

396
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,696
of being a citizen in Country F.

397
00:19:55,897 --> 00:19:56,897
That's why I married

398
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:58,657
a renowned dentist.

399
00:19:59,737 --> 00:20:01,137
I assume you didn't think

400
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:04,017
that I could do this three days ago.

401
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:07,857
You're someone who will achieve
something by any means necessary.

402
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:11,097
You could pay a huge sum

403
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:13,056
just so you could be bailed out of jail.

404
00:20:13,617 --> 00:20:14,536
You could get married

405
00:20:14,536 --> 00:20:15,936
to someone who you didn't love.

406
00:20:16,336 --> 00:20:17,497
You could also let your subordinates

407
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:18,416
take the blame for you.

408
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:20,857
Let me put it this way.

409
00:20:21,377 --> 00:20:23,617
We couldn't find out where
the victims' fund went to

410
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,696
because your account handlers

411
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:27,176
could transfer the illegal fund

412
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,216
you received to bank accounts
all over the world

413
00:20:29,336 --> 00:20:31,576
in matters of seconds.

414
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,657
We have no way to convict you

415
00:20:34,897 --> 00:20:37,536
because we can't find any records of you
and your transactions.

416
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:40,456
We have no way to make sure your accomplices

417
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,936
have the same testimonies.

418
00:20:46,056 --> 00:20:48,657
You paid a huge sum to bail yourself out of jail.

419
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:51,296
That means you can also hire the best local lawyer

420
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:53,377
to maintain your freedom.

421
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:55,696
You were prepared for everything.

422
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,857
You do know me well.

423
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:02,257
So, Prosecutor An,

424
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,497
what do you intend to do?

425
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:05,777
Do you know something?

426
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:07,816
The saddest thing about you

427
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:09,897
is that you know everything about me,

428
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,176
you know the details of my crimes

429
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,336
and the processes,

430
00:21:14,936 --> 00:21:16,137
you even have evidence

431
00:21:16,257 --> 00:21:19,216
of me committing illegal detainment
and intentional harm.

432
00:21:19,657 --> 00:21:21,097
Even so, you can't defeat me.

433
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:23,816
You have no way to
bring me back to China.

434
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,176
You don't even have a way

435
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:27,456
to make me stay in prison
for one more day.

436
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:30,737
You knew that I was a crook.

437
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:31,777
However,

438
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:35,416
you could not bring me away
with unlawful procedures.

439
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:39,737
That's your weakness.

440
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:43,696
You can never win against me.

441
00:21:46,216 --> 00:21:47,456
After hearing that,

442
00:21:48,536 --> 00:21:51,056
I guess I'm cornered.

443
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:53,936
The situation is unfavorable to me.

444
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:56,536
Of course.

445
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:57,536
You need to know something.

446
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,576
You're in my territory.

447
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,377
How could I lose?

448
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:05,296
Since you already said that,

449
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,176
why don't you hear me out too?

450
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:10,857
I believe you're also very interested in me.

451
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,336
If not, you wouldn't have ordered your men

452
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:13,777
to tail me for the past few days.

453
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:15,456
Sure.

454
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:17,696
We can look at the story from
another perspective.

455
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,816
Why not?

456
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:23,777
Evidence of you committing
illegal detainment and intentional harm

457
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:24,657
has come to light.

458
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:26,657
And, the biggest turning point

459
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:28,536
happened three days ago.

460
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:30,936
(Currently, the development
of the situation)

461
00:22:31,137 --> 00:22:33,456
(has exceeded the level of difficulty
that we predetermined.)

462
00:22:33,857 --> 00:22:35,497
(Qian Tianxin and her crime syndicate)

463
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:37,176
(had used many cunning maneuvers)

464
00:22:37,576 --> 00:22:39,336
(that we didn't expect.)

465
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:40,897
Therefore,

466
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:42,576
judging from the current circumstances,

467
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,416
can we just put this case aside for the moment?

468
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:48,657
(We've already cornered Qian Tianxin.)

469
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:50,336
(And, we've already obtained
conclusive evidence)

470
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:51,977
(of her illegal detainment
and intentional harm crimes.)

471
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:53,936
(If we push forward,)

472
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:55,536
(we can obtain)

473
00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:58,056
the key evidence
regarding her cybercrime syndicate.

474
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,456
If we back off now,

475
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:01,696
we'll miss out on our only chance to solve the case.

476
00:23:02,056 --> 00:23:03,497
During such crucial moments,

477
00:23:03,536 --> 00:23:05,936
we shouldn't give Qian Tianxin any space to breathe.

478
00:23:06,657 --> 00:23:09,416
(However, the local technical department
had already analyzed)

479
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,857
(the result you got from investigating)

480
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:13,377
(Qian Tianxin's servers and database.)

481
00:23:13,497 --> 00:23:16,056
(There's no information
related to China mainland.)

482
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:19,536
(We think that she was already prepared for it.)

483
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,897
(She deleted the evidence
right when you guys acted on it.)

484
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:26,296
That means the most direct path
to convicting her of her crime, which is

485
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:28,137
to investigate the data related to them,

486
00:23:28,176 --> 00:23:29,336
has been blocked off.

487
00:23:32,657 --> 00:23:34,017
(Prosecutor Guo, it's like this.)

488
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:35,456
(This is what I mean.)

489
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:37,377
Although the local technical department

490
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,497
didn't discover any information related to our country,

491
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:42,897
I realized that there was
related information flowing in this direction

492
00:23:43,137 --> 00:23:45,097
even if we had cut off
Qian Tianxin's servers.

493
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:46,456
That's why I suspect

494
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:47,977
that they transferred the related data

495
00:23:48,017 --> 00:23:50,017
to a backup server beforehand.

496
00:23:50,737 --> 00:23:52,536
(I never considered
that possibility before.)

497
00:23:52,657 --> 00:23:55,377
(We cooperated with
the local Internet department)

498
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:59,097
(and tried to investigate
the possibility of a backup server)

499
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,176
(using an external source
following the flow of information.)

500
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:04,576
(But we found that this server didn't exist at all.)

501
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:05,617
(Let me put it this way.)

502
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:07,137
(Even if it did exist,)

503
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:09,536
(it might have been deleted completely.)

504
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:10,576
Prosecutor Guo, that's not it.

505
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:13,097
You cannot confirm such information
from the outside.

506
00:24:13,857 --> 00:24:15,216
I think only the access routes

507
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:17,216
of the server were deleted.

508
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,137
(The real data should be)

509
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:20,536
(on the server's local hard drive.)

510
00:24:23,137 --> 00:24:24,497
(Let me give you an example.)

511
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,056
(For example, if we go on a trip,)

512
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:28,897
(we need to follow the signboard)

513
00:24:28,936 --> 00:24:30,097
(to reach the destination we desire.)

514
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,097
(But now, the signboard
has been taken down.)

515
00:24:32,216 --> 00:24:33,377
(And, we can't find the destination.)

516
00:24:33,816 --> 00:24:34,816
But the destination still exists.

517
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:35,456
It's always there.

518
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:36,576
It won't just vanish

519
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:37,737
because we couldn't find it.

520
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:39,897
Prosecutor Guo,

521
00:24:40,097 --> 00:24:40,857
I'll say something too.

522
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:43,696
According to the time
I've spent with Qian Tianxin,

523
00:24:43,737 --> 00:24:46,536
I realize that she's a criminal
with a stubborn tendency.

524
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:48,816
She's very confident in the ways

525
00:24:48,857 --> 00:24:49,737
she committed the crimes.

526
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:52,536
And, she pays great attention
to the result of her crimes.

527
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,176
So, if she deleted the access routes

528
00:24:55,216 --> 00:24:56,657
to hinder our investigation,

529
00:24:56,737 --> 00:24:59,416
there's a high possibility
that she won't delete the real data.

530
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:00,216
That's right.

531
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,056
Even if she does intend to delete them,

532
00:25:02,097 --> 00:25:03,257
she can't delete them in one go.

533
00:25:03,816 --> 00:25:05,936
It takes at least two months to delete the data

534
00:25:06,017 --> 00:25:07,056
of a huge enterprise.

535
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:09,257
(It'll at least take her a few days)

536
00:25:09,737 --> 00:25:11,576
(to delete the key data of a company.)

537
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:13,696
Unless...

538
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:18,416
Unless she destroys
the physical storage of the server.

539
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:23,056
You've studied us thoroughly indeed.

540
00:25:23,536 --> 00:25:24,816
It's a shame

541
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,696
that it's meaningless.

542
00:25:28,456 --> 00:25:30,097
We suspected that too.

543
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:33,857
Even if you didn't delete the data

544
00:25:34,017 --> 00:25:35,377
and store it in the local hard drive,

545
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:37,816
we'd have no way to find it.

546
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,216
It's because this place is huge.

547
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:42,017
And, you're deeply influential here.

548
00:25:42,536 --> 00:25:45,296
You have plenty of real estate,
land, and enterprises here.

549
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:46,497
Let's forget about

550
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:48,257
the fact that the local police
wouldn't cooperate with us

551
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,097
to investigate the properties
under your name.

552
00:25:50,296 --> 00:25:51,497
Even if they do cooperate with us,

553
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:53,977
you might also hide it

554
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,777
in somewhere we have never heard of.

555
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,176
Sorry about that, Prosecutor An.

556
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:04,936
This is my win.

557
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,017
Checkmate.

558
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:09,936
It's fine, Ms. Qian.

559
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:11,617
We'll never give up

560
00:26:11,936 --> 00:26:13,377
unless you give us the checkmate.

561
00:26:15,176 --> 00:26:16,377
Even if we can't find out

562
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:17,416
where you hide the backup server,

563
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:19,977
I know someone who knows it.

564
00:26:26,696 --> 00:26:27,696
You mean Li Guoquan?

565
00:26:28,216 --> 00:26:29,137
This is the distribution plot

566
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,657
for Qian Tianxin's local properties.

567
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:32,257
Take a look.

568
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:34,696
Tell us where she might hide
the backup server at.

569
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:44,536
Here.

570
00:26:47,017 --> 00:26:48,377
It's not like we didn't suspect
this place before.

571
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:50,056
However, this is her house.

572
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:52,137
She invites esteemed figures

573
00:26:52,216 --> 00:26:53,897
and tycoons to her house every week.

574
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:55,176
It's always crowded.

575
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:57,696
We think that she won't hide it here.

576
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,137
You guys don't understand
Qian Tianxin at all.

577
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,777
Although she's extremely conceited,

578
00:27:03,617 --> 00:27:05,696
she also lacks a sense of security.

579
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:06,816
She trusts no one,

580
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:08,257
and she does everything by herself.

581
00:27:09,017 --> 00:27:11,056
When I designed the server for her,

582
00:27:11,137 --> 00:27:12,176
her only request

583
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:13,696
was for me to install the server rack

584
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:16,137
within five km of her house

585
00:27:16,536 --> 00:27:19,176
so that she could monitor it
and destroy it anytime.

586
00:27:22,176 --> 00:27:22,936
No wonder.

587
00:27:23,737 --> 00:27:25,416
It's no wonder she goes back twice
every week.

588
00:27:25,497 --> 00:27:26,857
She spends the rest of the week
in the company.

589
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:27,617
And,

590
00:27:27,936 --> 00:27:28,897
to make it extra secure,

591
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:32,056
she told me to add a function to her server.

592
00:27:32,097 --> 00:27:34,416
She wanted a function that could
destroy the data from a long distance.

593
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:37,897
Wait.

594
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:40,617
Didn't Han Xuan say the process

595
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,176
would at least take a few days?

596
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:43,936
There's a faster way to it.

597
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:47,176
Just burn the circuits
and destroy it physically.

598
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:49,497
I came up with the mechanism for her.

599
00:27:49,777 --> 00:27:53,296
However, to prevent accidents and misuse,

600
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:56,536
I designed another verification process

601
00:27:56,657 --> 00:27:57,936
that was very complex.

602
00:27:58,257 --> 00:27:59,977
It takes three minutes to complete
the verification process.

603
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:03,257
Only then, it'll proceed
with destroying the circuits.

604
00:28:03,336 --> 00:28:06,456
But I don't think
we discover anything like that on the server.

605
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:07,176
Therefore,

606
00:28:08,536 --> 00:28:10,536
it must be on the backup server.

607
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:13,816
I heard from my old boss,
President Wang,

608
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:16,977
that Qian Tianxin cheated him of that villa.

609
00:28:17,617 --> 00:28:20,257
And, the basement
has a complex structure.

610
00:28:21,497 --> 00:28:23,536
If so, are you familiar with
the structure of the basement?

611
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,857
I heard that the villa designer

612
00:28:29,657 --> 00:28:30,657
is in France now.

613
00:28:34,536 --> 00:28:37,056
Excuse me. Checkmate.

614
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,056
Logically speaking,

615
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,176
it should end here.

616
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:47,377
However, you neglected the most important point.

617
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:50,296
You see, our motherland

618
00:28:50,977 --> 00:28:52,737
is stronger than you think.

619
00:28:53,056 --> 00:28:53,936
Mr. Zhou, this way, please.

620
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:55,536
An Ni.

621
00:28:59,017 --> 00:28:59,576
Who's that?

622
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:01,017
It's Mr. Zhou,

623
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,536
the designer of Qian Tianxin's villa.

624
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,737
Mr. Zhou was in France initially.

625
00:29:05,936 --> 00:29:07,696
I contacted him through
relevant channels.

626
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:09,176
He flew back to the country

627
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,377
after hearing about the situation.

628
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:11,857
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

629
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:13,336
I'm An Ni from
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

630
00:29:13,536 --> 00:29:14,576
Thank you for your cooperation.

631
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,137
This is the climax of the story.

632
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:23,617
We found a local contractor in China.

633
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:25,977
Following Mr. Zhou's design plan,

634
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:27,377
his workers reproduced

635
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:29,176
a miniature model of your basement

636
00:29:29,257 --> 00:29:30,897
in half a day.

637
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:34,617
Chief Gonzalez also
gave us his full cooperation.

638
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:37,377
Right after we got the design plan,

639
00:29:37,497 --> 00:29:39,936
he ordered his SWAT team to do a drill.

640
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:41,897
We had limited time.

641
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:46,097
They went through 11 simulations in one day.

642
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:49,017
They stormed your basement

643
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,336
within three minutes on each attempt.

644
00:29:51,816 --> 00:29:52,416
Now,

645
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:55,296
we just lack the final blow.

646
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:14,737
All clear.

647
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:22,456
What gives them the right
to raid my villa?

648
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:24,737
I've been bailed out of jail.

649
00:30:24,816 --> 00:30:25,897
And, I didn't commit any crimes.

650
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:27,536
What gives them the right to do so?

651
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:29,336
I didn't commit any crimes.

652
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:30,097
Don't you remember?

653
00:30:30,737 --> 00:30:31,536
Qian Tianxin,

654
00:30:32,137 --> 00:30:33,137
you did commit a crime.

655
00:30:33,816 --> 00:30:36,176
Chief Gonzalez reported you personally

656
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,257
for attempting to bribe a cop

657
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:40,336
by committing
illegal monetary transactions.

658
00:30:40,536 --> 00:30:42,216
That friend of yours, Semones,

659
00:30:42,536 --> 00:30:45,296
he was arrested
by the local anti-corruption agency last night.

660
00:30:45,657 --> 00:30:46,737
Now, the police

661
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:48,777
will search your villa
according to the law.

662
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:50,657
They will seize all electronics

663
00:30:50,737 --> 00:30:51,576
and investigate them.

664
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:53,737
Qian Tianxin,

665
00:30:54,497 --> 00:30:55,857
you were too focused on your offense.

666
00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:58,657
You neglected the situation
surrounding you.

667
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:10,257
Now, you have no way to run.

668
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,336
Checkmate.

669
00:31:32,216 --> 00:31:33,737
We meet again, my friend.

670
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:37,377
I think you're more familiar
with the procedures by now.

671
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:40,137
I assume you won't cause me
any inconveniences.

672
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,857
Someone else will deal with the crimes

673
00:31:44,017 --> 00:31:45,497
you committed in China.

674
00:31:46,296 --> 00:31:50,576
Just now, we found firearms in your basement.

675
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,857
Although it's legal to possess firearms
in Country F,

676
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:58,936
the firearms you possess are of unknown sources.

677
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:03,056
You've gone against the rules
while on bail.

678
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,257
Don't think that
you can escape this time.

679
00:32:05,696 --> 00:32:08,296
Just stay in the detainment center.

680
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:17,576
I only realized it by now.

681
00:32:18,377 --> 00:32:19,696
So,

682
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:21,617
you approved my bail

683
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:24,497
because it was part of your plan.

684
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,097
I don't know about that.

685
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:31,137
And, I have nothing to tell you.

686
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:33,977
But I can tell you about a timeless principle.

687
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:37,257
If a hunter wishes to catch a fox,

688
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:40,216
he needs to be more cunning
than the fox.

689
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:50,936
The police vehicle is outside.

690
00:32:51,696 --> 00:32:53,137
I'm sure you know which is it.

691
00:32:54,497 --> 00:32:55,336
Let's go.

692
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:09,737
Prosecutor Guo,

693
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:11,536
we received news.

694
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,456
The SWAT team disarmed the mechanism

695
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,897
before it was activated.

696
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:17,497
The server is safe.

697
00:33:17,816 --> 00:33:18,777
And, it has been delivered

698
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:20,536
to Sanjiang Police Station in Country F.

699
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:22,056
Our task force there

700
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:24,977
is ready to transfer the data to us.

701
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,336
The members of the technical team

702
00:33:27,377 --> 00:33:29,176
can analyze it immediately.

703
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:31,777
And, Qian Tianxin

704
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,696
has broken the rules while on bail.

705
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:36,657
She has been arrested officially
once again.

706
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:39,017
This time, bailing is not allowed.

707
00:34:07,497 --> 00:34:08,296
Let's go.

708
00:34:18,336 --> 00:34:19,137
Ni!

709
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:20,576
Ni.

710
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,137
We found the server.

711
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:23,377
The mechanism was deactivated.

712
00:34:23,776 --> 00:34:24,576
The cops intend

713
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:25,697
to move the server rack
to the police station.

714
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:27,897
Our colleagues are on standby over there.

715
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:30,496
Let's go.

716
00:34:31,056 --> 00:34:31,897
Comrades,

717
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,536
I have a suggestion.

718
00:34:34,937 --> 00:34:36,736
For Prosecutor An Ni,

719
00:34:37,736 --> 00:34:38,776
He Luyuan,

720
00:34:38,897 --> 00:34:39,776
Han Xuan,

721
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,417
and the members of our task force,

722
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:44,617
we should stand up and applaud them.

723
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:01,897
Didn't you tell me to wait for you?

724
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:05,336
I was always waiting for you.

725
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:11,496
Stop him!

726
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,336
It's been an hour
since you arrived here.

727
00:35:27,617 --> 00:35:29,016
You didn't utter a single word.

728
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:31,657
Do you think you'll be fine
by keeping quiet?

729
00:35:33,377 --> 00:35:35,016
Stop putting on airs.

730
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:36,417
We're in Country F.

731
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:37,976
If you still don't understand

732
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:38,937
the situation you're in,

733
00:35:39,296 --> 00:35:41,177
we'll make you understand it very soon.

734
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,097
I know what you guys are going to do.

735
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:50,536
You'll just punish me with a stun baton,

736
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:52,296
force me to take cold showers,

737
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,056
and not let me sleep.

738
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,256
You'll also hang my thumb on the fan.

739
00:36:01,177 --> 00:36:03,177
All of these are just child's play.

740
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:04,617
It's nothing remarkable.

741
00:36:05,976 --> 00:36:08,217
However, if our positions were swapped,

742
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:10,976
if you guys were under my supervision

743
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,857
instead of the other way around,

744
00:36:14,336 --> 00:36:15,937
it'd be much more interesting.

745
00:36:16,536 --> 00:36:18,336
I will show you guys

746
00:36:18,496 --> 00:36:21,097
the extent of the human imagination.

747
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:28,576
So, do your worst.

748
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,217
Anyway,

749
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:32,256
I'll just say this.

750
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:35,296
I will not utter a single word

751
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:37,857
until my husband's lawyer is here.

752
00:36:45,897 --> 00:36:47,976
The person you're looking for is here. Please.

753
00:36:52,736 --> 00:36:53,536
Qian Tianxin,

754
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:55,296
seems like you don't really

755
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,296
like the renovation here.

756
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,177
It's subpar.

757
00:37:07,177 --> 00:37:07,897
That's fine.

758
00:37:08,857 --> 00:37:10,056
I'm sure you'll like
the interrogation chamber

759
00:37:10,177 --> 00:37:12,336
we have in Jiangcheng.

760
00:37:13,976 --> 00:37:15,137
It depends on whether

761
00:37:15,256 --> 00:37:16,736
you're capable enough to bring me back.

762
00:37:17,776 --> 00:37:18,576
Qian Tianxin,

763
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,137
with the evidence in our hands,

764
00:37:21,417 --> 00:37:22,736
you'll at least
be imprisoned for 20 years

765
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:24,897
no matter which prison
you're assigned to.

766
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:30,097
You must think that you're lucky

767
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:31,217
because we can't do anything to you

768
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:32,576
since we're not in the country.

769
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:34,976
But let me tell you this.

770
00:37:35,736 --> 00:37:37,336
We'll definitely do everything we can

771
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:38,496
to transport you back to our country

772
00:37:38,496 --> 00:37:39,296
and put you on trial there.

773
00:37:39,816 --> 00:37:41,536
If you're not willing to speak here,

774
00:37:41,617 --> 00:37:42,736
I'm all ears

775
00:37:43,016 --> 00:37:45,417
when we return to the country together.

776
00:37:47,377 --> 00:37:49,697
Bravo, Prosecutor An.

777
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,137
You think

778
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:52,377
that you achieved something great

779
00:37:52,457 --> 00:37:53,857
and that you're a heroine now, huh?

780
00:37:55,137 --> 00:37:56,857
Do you really think

781
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,657
the scams in Sanjiang City will end

782
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:00,417
after you arrest me?

783
00:38:01,217 --> 00:38:02,457
You think everyone can sleep in peace

784
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,897
and have a happy ending now?

785
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:07,857
What a joke.

786
00:38:08,336 --> 00:38:09,536
Listen.

787
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:10,897
There are plenty of people like me

788
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:13,457
in Sanjiang City.

789
00:38:14,177 --> 00:38:16,496
Do you know how many people from China

790
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,816
are in the same trade as me

791
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,097
in the entire Southeast Asia?

792
00:38:20,736 --> 00:38:22,976
Even if you do curb
this issue in Country F,

793
00:38:24,056 --> 00:38:25,056
there are Country D,

794
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:26,976
Country E,

795
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,056
Country G,

796
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:31,457
and Country A.

797
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:34,137
Do you know
how many people are involved?

798
00:38:34,336 --> 00:38:36,217
Can you arrest all of them?

799
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,016
You guys will never win this battle.

800
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:43,657
As long as greed and lust exist,

801
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,336
we'll always have customers.

802
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,056
You guys will never win.

803
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,937
Since you already mentioned it,

804
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:01,016
I'll tell you this then.

805
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:04,137
No matter where your people hide,

806
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:07,336
we will find you guys one by one

807
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,056
and arrest all of you.

808
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:19,417
Chief Gonzalez,

809
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:20,897
we've already handed the data

810
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:22,816
in Qian Tianxin's data to the country.

811
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:25,576
Her crimes have basically been confirmed.

812
00:39:25,976 --> 00:39:27,857
According to The Laws of
the People's Republic of China

813
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:29,056
and the laws in your country,

814
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:31,016
Qian Tianxin is eligible for extradition.

815
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,937
We hope we can extradite her successfully

816
00:39:32,976 --> 00:39:34,776
and put her on trial in our country
with your help.

817
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:39,897
What makes it so difficult?

818
00:39:41,097 --> 00:39:42,417
Now,

819
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:45,536
there are new complex, situations
that have been added to our legislation.

820
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:47,496
You guys cannot extradite Qian Tianxin.

821
00:39:49,457 --> 00:39:50,496
However,

822
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:53,336
I also considered the fact that you guys
would do everything you could

823
00:39:53,496 --> 00:39:56,256
to extradite Qian Tianxin.

824
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:59,657
Therefore, I contacted
someone special for you.

825
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:04,097
Maybe he can help you guys to resolve this issue.

826
00:40:04,336 --> 00:40:04,937
Who is it?

827
00:40:05,457 --> 00:40:06,417
It's your old friend.

828
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:07,417
It's me.

829
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:10,217
Raphael?

830
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:27,177
Hello, sir.

831
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:28,816
My name is Gomez.

832
00:40:28,937 --> 00:40:30,457
I'm Qian Tianxin's husband.

833
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:33,256
And my wife is in some trouble now.

834
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,857
She is detained by you.

835
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:38,097
I hired a lawyer for her.

836
00:40:38,336 --> 00:40:39,536
May I come in, please?

837
00:40:39,657 --> 00:40:41,377
Only lawyer can go inside.

838
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:42,457
You just stay here.

839
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:43,937
Alright.

840
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:48,857
You know what to say, right?

841
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:50,536
I know.

842
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:06,336
Anyway,

843
00:41:06,657 --> 00:41:08,336
the police of Country F

844
00:41:08,336 --> 00:41:09,857
has filed a case against you officially.

845
00:41:10,897 --> 00:41:12,697
Due to your previous performance,

846
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,336
bail is not possible right now.

847
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:16,137
To us,

848
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:18,976
the best result is
to keep you in Country F.

849
00:41:19,336 --> 00:41:21,457
Everything is negotiable
when you're here.

850
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:24,377
However, if they do extradite you,

851
00:41:25,217 --> 00:41:27,256
we won't be able
to do anything about it.

852
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:30,857
How is he?

853
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:37,177
He's safe for the moment.

854
00:41:38,377 --> 00:41:39,617
He had a message for you.

855
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:41,657
He's safe as long as you're safe.

856
00:41:42,937 --> 00:41:43,736
Remember,

857
00:41:44,617 --> 00:41:46,056
you can say something about the crimes

858
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,857
they've confirmed.

859
00:41:48,576 --> 00:41:50,217
Try to make the prosecutors in Country F

860
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:51,937
file a suit against you

861
00:41:51,937 --> 00:41:52,937
before they extradite you.

862
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:55,217
This way, you'll be
put on trial in Country F.

863
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:57,417
That's my goal.

864
00:41:57,536 --> 00:41:58,256
However,

865
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:00,897
do not cross the line.

866
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:07,937
Tell my husband

867
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,576
that I will follow his instructions.

868
00:42:13,976 --> 00:42:16,657
If everything doesn't go as expected,

869
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:19,016
he hopes that you can...

870
00:42:25,137 --> 00:42:26,217
I understand.

871
00:42:31,016 --> 00:42:32,016
Mr. He,

872
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:33,417
Ms. An,

873
00:42:33,816 --> 00:42:35,937
I treated you guys to this

874
00:42:36,217 --> 00:42:37,336
when we met for the first time.

875
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,457
You guys don't have
any complaints, right?

876
00:42:40,816 --> 00:42:41,857
Why would we?

877
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,256
We were only able

878
00:42:43,336 --> 00:42:45,336
to crack this case successfully in Country F

879
00:42:45,377 --> 00:42:48,137
all thanks to your help and coordination.

880
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:50,457
We haven't got a chance
to thank you yet.

881
00:42:50,536 --> 00:42:53,217
Here. Let's have a toast with water
instead of liquor.

882
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:54,177
Thank you.

883
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:58,256
Don't thank me yet.

884
00:42:58,816 --> 00:43:00,617
You can thank me

885
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:02,217
after you bring her back to the country.

886
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:04,816
