15

Chairman.

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,590
Luo.

17
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,590
You are back.

18
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,720
That's right.

19
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,590
The secretary of Mayor Xu called me

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,360
and said that they will
get our corporate later.

21
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,630
I will greet them.

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,440
Okay.

23
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,830
It takes a while for
Mayor Xu to get here.

24
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,000
We are all free now.

25
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,630
Let's have some tea in my office.

26
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,040
We can have a chat.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,750
Luo,

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,830
recently our corporate has

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,720
a lot of issues.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you for what you've done

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,520
as a legal expert.

32
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,390
Chairman,

33
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,320
this is my duty.

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,960
If there is something wrong,

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
please correct me.

36
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,750
You are too modest.

37
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,520
Nobody wants anything
to happen to our corporate.

38
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,520
But with you in our corporate,

39
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,320
I will feel more dependable than ever.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,910
How are you adjusting to being here?

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,320
Do you need anything else?

42
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,360
No.

43
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,390
I'm doing great here.

44
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,110
Thank you for your concern.

45
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,440
Luo, have some tee.

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,440
Luo,

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,520
don't speak well of Zhao Jikai.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,320
I know

49
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,000
him very well.

50
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,880
But this time,

51
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,190
he did seriously

52
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,270
ruin my whole plan.

53
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,670
He never makes, but always breaks.

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,670
In just a few months,

55
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,240
our corporate has a reputation crisis.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,360
Imagine that.

57
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,360
A good reputation

58
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,110
is a very important factor

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,600
for a corporate.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,830
You know that

61
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,880
better than I do.

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,960
Huiquan Corporation

63
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,470
is becoming larger.

64
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,470
But if

65
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,910
we want to

66
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,360
stand here permanently,

67
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,910
in addition to

68
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
the internal strength of the corporate,

69
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,190
we also need strong

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,800
external support.

71
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,880
Especially

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,630
we are based in the global market,

73
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,830
so

74
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,030
we need more hot money.

75
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,110
In particular the investment by

76
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,240
multinational groups.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,880
By doing so, we can develop ourselves.

78
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,080
As for that young man,

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,110
I don't count on him.

80
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,750
However,

81
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,000
I really want to hear your opinion.

82
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,030
Especially

83
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,880
some good news.

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,510
Chairman,

85
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
my major

86
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,950
is law.

87
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,880
At present,

88
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,640
my interpersonal relationship
is not extensive.

89
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,550
If you want me to do solutions

90
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,510
or

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,880
strategies for advertising,

92
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,110
I'm really good at that.

93
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,720
But about the investment and

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,600
financing,

95
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,270
I dare not suggest anything.

96
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,920
I don't want to
ruin your important matter.

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,600
Luo,

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,640
I can't find any fault with your talk.

99
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,320
Don't worry,

100
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,640
I just need some positive news,

101
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,160
especially for the public relations.

102
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,920
You can express

103
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,790
your opinion in this aspect.

104
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,350
In fact,

105
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,670
Green Broadcasting

106
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,070
isn't criticized directly.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,790
It is just implicated.

108
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,320
And right now,

109
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,110
domestic live streaming industry

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,070
is developing rapidly.

111
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,600
with a promising future.

112
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,510
Without advertising and investing,

113
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,160
it has drawn attentions
from many international clients.

114
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,480
It's great for us to

115
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,440
purchase Green Broadcasting.

116
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,880
However,

117
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,350
we should solve the problem at hand.

118
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,510
Bring our investment back.

119
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,000
We can

120
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,510
put positive factors on
Green Broadcasting.

121
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,390
This is called that

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,790
look one way and row another.

123
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
That sounds great!

124
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,510
This is really great.

125
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,200
Well,

126
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,270
I have been

127
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,600
always greedy.

128
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,230
I hope you can show me two good outcomes.

129
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,510
I'm not

130
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,320
greedy.

131
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,270
But I will take thing to the extreme.

132
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,670
Yes.

133
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,110
I will add one more outcome.

134
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,040
Give you a final result

135
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,070
like the hop skip and jump.

136
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,550
As a welcome back.

137
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,440
Okay.

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
But I need you

139
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,920
to sign the official letter

140
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,230
I drafted, in the name of your chairman.

141
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,640
No problem.

142
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,390
Okay.

143
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,640
Anything you can do to turn

144
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,350
our Huiquan Corporation around,

145
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,640
then the whole

146
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,000
corporate will be grateful to you.

147
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,640
This

148
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,510
is my duty.

149
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,880
Luo,

150
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
all resources of Huiquan Corporation

151
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,550
will be deployed by you.

152
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,600
I

153
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,440
fully support you.

154
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,580
(Defending the Law)

155
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,270
Master,

156
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,000
we figured it out last time.

157
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,070
Those mobile cards

158
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,440
and the bank cards are all real.

159
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,000
Some of them belong to the victims

160
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,880
Some of them were collected

161
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,950
by Yang Bao from others.

162
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,040
And the superior that he talked about

163
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,640
connected with him in single lines

164
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,230
They are very alert

165
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,320
We imitate Yang Bao's tone,

166
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,390
but the other side is not hooked either.

167
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
I guess they had a code word

168
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,390
to identify each other before.

169
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,070
As for the clues provided
by the other victims,

170
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,550
few are valuable.

171
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
I know.

172
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,670
Illegal network loan dens

173
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,920
are relatively easy to deal with.

174
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,640
I guess the case will be closed soon.

175
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,480
You can't take it lightly.

176
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,200
This illegal network loan
looks on the surface,

177
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,070
only involves illegal business crime.

178
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,070
You need to dig deep.

179
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,670
It is also likely to be suspected

180
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,720
of illegal absorption of public deposits.

181
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,790
If violence is used,

182
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,510
pressure for payment of debt,

183
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,070
it may be suspected of
the underworld crime.

184
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,320
So we must

185
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,720
take it seriously.

186
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,830
How to convict it by then

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
depends on Prosecutor An.

188
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,550
Prosecutor An?

189
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,230
Master,

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,270
How can I find that

191
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,790
the frequency of
you mentioning Prosecutor An

192
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,270
has been more and more recently?

193
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,200
Chief Bai always

194
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,110
instructs me

195
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,440
with authority.

196
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,200
Let us cooperate with each other.

197
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,320
I have to listen to the leader.

198
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:14,790
Oh,

199
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,270
I get it.

200
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,000
By the way,

201
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,110
Yang Bao

202
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,320
didn't explain it all last time.

203
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,110
Can he cooperate with us well this time?

204
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,320
Well,

205
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,670
Yang Bao.

206
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,550
I know what he is like.

207
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,270
He doesn't have that much scheming.

208
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,710
I guess he just went
the wrong way at once.

209
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,670
He didn't say it last time,

210
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
he was either scared

211
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,840
or really forgotten.

212
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,710
He is that

213
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,640
kind of people

214
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,910
who offer bank cards to criminals.

215
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,350
I guess

216
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,230
he doesn't even know what

217
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,910
the phone cards and bank cards were for.

218
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,670
So,

219
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,200
we have to follow him

220
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,520
to find his contacts.

221
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,550
Han Xuan also said it last time.

222
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,350
He borrowed an identity and tried out

223
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,110
the mobile phone login software
when he went back.

224
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,710
Then?

225
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,150
Then the software
could not be downloaded.

226
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,030
It is estimated to be
the overall abandoned.

227
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,230
Now we have to

228
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,320
catch Yao Bao's contacts
as soon as possible.

229
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,200
And check out
who is so-called Xin.

230
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,400
Mayor,

231
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,880
why don't you have a rest?

232
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,150
Sitting in the car and working

233
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,640
with a lower head leads to dizziness.

234
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,760
We should seize every minute.

235
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,440
The work

236
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,350
is really complicated.

237
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,670
The citizens would never guess

238
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,790
that the mayor

239
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,150
is squeezing in time every day.

240
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,470
We don't do things

241
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,550
for the citizens to see.

242
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,110
It is practical to work
for the welfare of the people.

243
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,960
We must respect the Party

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,030
and the people.

245
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,000
We must also honor the
trust our country has placed in us

246
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,200
and our conscience.

247
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,000
No more explanation.

248
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,790
It doesn't have to be
understood by citizens.

249
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,640
Mayor,

250
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,790
I don't understand one thing.

251
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,030
Although

252
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,670
Huiquan Corporation is
a key enterprise in our city.

253
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,910
It's still in the spotlight,

254
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,230
the storm of public opinion.

255
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,960
But we go now,

256
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,000
will not be a little too risky?

257
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,960
Mayor,

258
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,520
I want to say something
that shouldn't be said.

259
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,520
It strikes me that

260
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,350
the less trouble the better.

261
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,960
It is good to have public supervision.

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,030
This can urge us
to do things wholeheartedly.

263
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,640
Chen,

264
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,670
actually

265
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,880
the relationship between
government and corporate

266
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,200
is like the relationship between
fish and water.

267
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,080
The development of our society

268
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,110
needs corporates.

269
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,080
Corporate also

270
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,590
needs the guidance and
support of government.

271
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,640
The corporate

272
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
is the economic unit of a country.

273
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,590
For country,

274
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,880
they pay the taxes.

275
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,910
For people,

276
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,760
they offer job opportunities.

277
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,230
From a horizontal perspective,

278
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,910
they also need to keep
innovating and exploring to

279
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,110
promote the development
of industrial economy.

280
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,110
These years,

281
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,840
the development of Huiquan Corporation
and its contribution to the city

282
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,520
is seen by us.

283
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,030
I don't need to say something.

284
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,670
Moreover,

285
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,670
now all places are

286
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,400
fighting for the Huiquan Corporation,

287
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,350
and want to attract it with

288
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,790
investment promotion.

289
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,440
The corresponding policy
support they offer

290
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,840
is very generous.

291
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,230
In my view,

292
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,000
as a new type of Internet enterprises,

293
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,440
it is very normal to encounter problems.

294
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,200
We should grow up with them.

295
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,440
Help them do a good job

296
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,400
of escort services.

297
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,150
We don't say,

298
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,030
when they're good, we recognize them.

299
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
When they have a problem,

300
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,590
we stay away,

301
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,350
being afraid to be involved with them.

302
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,470
Today Huiquan Corporation is in trouble.

303
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,230
Maybe tomorrow other enterprises
will have problems.

304
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,350
Whichever one they are,

305
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,280
they are enterprises in Jiangcheng.

306
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,400
This can't be dealt with as you said before.

307
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,790
What if

308
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,910
every government official

309
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,880
like what you think.

310
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,760
The official was scared of this and that,

311
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,280
and put his career before anything else,

312
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,790
they would stay away from trouble.

313
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,150
But what do innocent enterprises do

314
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,400
when they run into problems?

315
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,880
When the State empowers us,

316
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,550
it also gives us responsibilities.

317
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,960
I don't care what others think.

318
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
Anyway,

319
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,200
at least start with me,

320
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,030
I should take the

321
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,960
responsibilities.

322
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,880
I also learn to be enterprising

323
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,350
to take a stand and make a point.

324
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,640
I'll repeat it again.

325
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,200
There are no

326
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,470
legal issues with Huiquan Corporation.

327
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,320
We can't follow others

328
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,470
and look on its trouble with indifference.

329
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,200
We shouldn't let things go for themselves.

330
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,670
Chen,

331
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,350
you still have a long way to go.

332
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
Learn about it for yourself.

333
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,400
Mayor, I understand.

334
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,080
I'll add what you said to the script later.

335
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,120
(Report on Improving the Business Law)

336
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:23,140
(Welcome Deputy Mayor Xu
to guide the work.)

337
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,470
Welcome Deputy Mayor Xu
to guide the work.

338
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,520
Mr. Yin.

339
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,790
Welcome Deputy Mayor Xu.

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Welcome to you.

341
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,110
Deputy Mayor Xu,

342
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,670
please come in.

343
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,710
-Please come in.
-Let's go.

344
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,000
It's been years

345
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,230
since you were here.

346
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,080
Yes.

347
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,550
This time,
it is a completely different one.

348
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:55,440
Yes.

349
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,110
Chairman,

350
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
let me introduce to the Mayor.

351
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,550
No.

352
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,710
Let me introduce.

353
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,880
This is Zhao Jikai.

354
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,280
He is the President of Huiquan Technology.

355
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,710
Hello, Deputy Mayor Xu.

356
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,110
Welcome to take time
out of your busy schedule

357
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
to us to guide the work.

358
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,000
Hello.

359
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,960
Where is Mu'en?

360
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,470
Xiao Mu'en!

361
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm here.

362
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,200
Chairman.

363
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,150
This is

364
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,000
Xiao Mu'en.

365
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,590
We purchased

366
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,520
Green Broadcasting some time ago.

367
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,400
We change its name to Huibo.

368
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,200
He is the president of Huibo.

369
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,470
I get it.

370
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,110
He is a great talent.

371
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,960
Hello, Deputy Mayor Xu.

372
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,760
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

373
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,640
Mr. Yin, if you hadn't introduced him,

374
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,200
I'd have thought

375
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,670
he was a recent college graduate.

376
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,030
He is young and talented.

377
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,110
He is even humble.

378
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,000
Deputy Mayor Xu,

379
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm flattered.

380
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,280
I want to introduce another person to you.

381
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,080
he is

382
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,550
legal counsel and renowned scholars

383
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,030
that my firm went to

384
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,400
a lot of trouble to hire, Luo Jiangxiao.

385
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,320
Oh,

386
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:01,840
I knew him.

387
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,350
Professor Luo.

388
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,440
Hello, Mayor Xu.

389
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,590
Hello, Professor Luo.

390
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,030
Mr. Yin,

391
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,000
I finally

392
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,880
find the reason why your Huiquan
Corporation is successful.

393
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,110
It is said that

394
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,030
the competition of the 21st century

395
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,470
is the competition for talents.

396
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,910
That's right.

397
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,520
You already have

398
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,440
a lot of talents.

399
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,960
Talents are difficult to hire.

400
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,840
Not to mention the all-round talent.

401
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,150
Now,

402
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,960
you have invited Professor Luo.

403
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,710
Our Jiangcheng talents

404
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,350
are all here now.

405
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,440
No, no, no.

406
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,080
Well,

407
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,910
I'll have to ask you to

408
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,880
export talent

409
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,550
from your Huiquan Corporation.

410
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,470
I'm serious.

411
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,000
If that's really the case,

412
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,080
it is a great honor
for our Huiquan Corporation.

413
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,910
Okay.

414
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,200
It's a deal.

415
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,640
All right.

416
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,760
Well,

417
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,470
the last time I came here,

418
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,520
it was the groundbreaking

419
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
of this building.

420
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,520
Look,

421
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,880
many years have passed.

422
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,840
Yes.

423
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,670

424
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,550
the development of

425
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,910
Huiquan Corporation depends on

426
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,230
your understanding and support.

427
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,280
From now on,

428
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,200
we hope

429
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,790
you can visit us frequently

430
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,080
and give us more guidance.

431
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,080
You can

432
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,110
continue to work.

433
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,080
In the future,

434
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,590
we have more chances to meet.

435
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,790
Yes.

436
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,320
Chairman,

437
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,960
we invite Mayor Xu into the inside.

438
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,150
Ok.

439
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:23,470
All right.

440
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,200
Mayor Xu,

441
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,640
please continue to visit our building.

442
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,080
Deputy Mayor Xu,

443
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,910

We remain true to our original aspiration.

446
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,150
Yes, I heard about that.

I can't feel it

460
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,230
without being there.

461
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,560

how well your company is doing.

and felt deeply.

465
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,920
The size of Huiquan Corporation

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,248
really blows my mind.

bear in mind that

According to Yang Bao,

481
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,190
every time

482
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,590
he sends the bank cards and
phone cards that he collected

483
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,110
to a normal person,

484
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,230
who gives the things to his contacts.

485
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,230
But every time his contacts

486
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,310
will change a new phone number

487
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,800
to connect with him.

488
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,830
So Yang Bao

489
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
can't connect with his contacts.

490
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,520
Captain He,

491
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,350
we now have caught Yang Bao.

492
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,710
Will this act rashly?

493
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,520
We have his phone now.

494
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,230
If he's lost contact,

495
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,280
or if he wasn't there

496
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,560
when someone sent

497
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,520
to take the cards.

498
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,310
Well, didn't he just run away?

499
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,190
We only know these clues.

500
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,640
Yes, master.

501
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,000
From the double card evidence

502
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,000
collected from Yang Bao's home,

503
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,400
and from the victim of the current crime,

504
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,710
who just bought and sold the cards,

505
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,920
we can only find that

506
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,710
different levels of arrears
across the country.

507
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:37,920
Further down,

508
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,190
we can't find anything anymore.

509
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,640
But it's hard to say
that before the crime happened.

510
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,160
After all,
there are too many people involved,

511
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,040
and we are not easy to grasp.

512
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,000
Yang Bao also confessed a message.

513
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
He encouraged others to join him.

514
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,520
He can receive a hundred

515
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,280
to a hundred and fifty yuan for one person.

516

But selling double cards,

517
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,400
each set

518
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,280
can make three hundred to four hundred.

519
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,280
Right,

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,590
joined a network publicity week

522
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,880
and did anti-fraud publicity work.

523
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,760
Guess what?

524
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,640
In the case of

525
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,400
anti-fraud propaganda posted everywhere,

526
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,310
someone specially with rice,
flour, grain and oil

527
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,280
to do temptation, to cheat
those old people open cards.

528
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,680
They said if you scan the QR code

529
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,230
you will get a 100 yuan gift card.

530
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,920
Fortunately, I was there back then.

531
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,760
With the comrades of the bureau anti-fraud

532
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,350
who participated in the propaganda,

533
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,310
under my guidance,

534
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,640
on the spot we arrested them,

535
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,520
and took them away.

536
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,000
Good for you.

537
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,160
But they are really rampant.

538
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,470
They did fraud in
front of the police.

539
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,160
Just give you credits.

540
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,350
Our court comrade,

541
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,590
not to convict them?

542
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,560
In fact,

543
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,760
I did talk to my friend

544
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,430
in the court about this.

545
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,310
Okay.

546
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:40,710
Han Xuan,

547
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,680
you digressed.

548
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,830
Captain He,

549
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
it seems that

550
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,830
this guy,

551
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
he's not just

552
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,950
a professional buyer.

553
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,920
Perhaps this case,

554
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,000
also is not just

555
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,710
an illegal net loan problem.

556
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,710
Ms. An,

557
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,000
my master and you

558
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,040
think the same thing.

559
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,560
Well,

560
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:56,880
that's fine.

561
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,280
You can read books with me.

562
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,710
Then we can also have a mutual affinity.

563
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,520
Well,

564
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,110
let's make it short.

565
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,430
Go to find his contacts and arrest him.

566
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,640
Maybe

567
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,950
we can get the criminals with the goods.

568
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,350
Regardless of whether it really works,

569
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,470
but definitely not in my case.

570
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,830
The file I wanted last time.

571
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,000
The Procuratorate has zero tolerance

572
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,040
for any illegal behavior.

573
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,230
If the procedure is illegal,

574
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,880
what's the point of

575
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,950
getting the evidence that you can't use?

576
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,190
You're in the operation team.

577
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,190
You're in charge.

578
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:27,640
Well,

579
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,640
I can give you a suggestion.

580
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,640
You can screen

581
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,280
Yang Bao's customers

582
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,110
one by one.

583
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,310
How about this?

584
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,470
The procedure is great.

585
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
But what about the time?

586
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,710
The contacts

587
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,710
might be gone by then.

588
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,160
He Luyuan.

589
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,520
Okay.

590
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:46,950
If you want

591
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,430
to do it in your own way,

592
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,470
I can't stop you.

593
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,520
It's up to you.

594
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,040
But don't let me know.

595
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm so happy

596
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,230
to visit the famous
Jiangcheng's enterprise,

597
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
Huiquan Corporation.

598
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,000
And I have a great opportunity

599
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,400
to have a fact to face

600
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,160
conversations with Mr. Yin
and senior executives

601
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,040
of Huiquan Corporation.

602
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,280
Huiquan Corporation

603
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,590
did have some issues recently.

604
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,310
As a corporate,

605
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,400
it has confronted the public
opinion of the whole Internet.

606
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,800
But it faces the problem

607
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
in a proactive manner.

608
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,590
This can

609
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,800
present Huiquan Corporation

610
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,590
and staff of Huiquan
Corporation's down-to-earth attitude.

611
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,560
I hope you can understand.

612
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,950
In the development of an enterprise,

613
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,400
it is normal to confront issues,

614
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,160
and hear all kinds of voices.

615
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Recently,

616
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
Supreme People's Procuratorate
is exploring

617
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,760
trials to help procuratorial organs

618
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,430
and enterprises in
accordance with the law.

619
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,430
Today,

620
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,160
Prosecutor Guo and I
visit Huiquan Corporation

621
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,230
and want to discuss the
corporate compliance issues with you.

622
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,830
As an Internet enterprise,

623
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,830
the voice of clients

624
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,680
should be heard

625
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,230
and their needs

626
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,800
should be met.

627
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,430
No matter for

628
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,830
Huiquan Corporation

629
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,590
or clients,

630
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,830
compliance at any time

631
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,430
is the bottom line,

632
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,710
is the red line.

633
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,830
It is the right choice

634
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,470
to defend the interests

635
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,040
of all parties with the law.

636
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,190
Now there are many kinds of

637
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,190
illegal activities hidden in the Internet.

638
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,070
Some criminals,

639
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:37,280
using the formal network platform,

640
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,830
did illegal things.

641
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:39,710
So

642
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,680
this requires our government,

643
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,430
enterprises,

644
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,760
and users,

645
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,400
to work together,

646
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,680
be interlinked,

647
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,430
do a good job of connection,

648
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:49,160
and supervision.

649
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,640
Find problems timely

650
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,160
and solve problems in time.

651
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,880
I don't think

652
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,280
it is scary for enterprises to
have troubles.

653
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,680
As long as enterprises can
face up to their own problems,

654
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,680
timely establish enterprise
compliance system,

655
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,310
improve the operation mechanism

656
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,470
and cultivate compliance culture,

657
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,160
they can turn crisis into opportunity.

658
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,280
So,

659
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,040
the purpose of this visit

660
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,430
is to strengthen your confidence

661
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,110
and encourage you

662
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,430
to continue working hard.

663
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:19,710
Okay!

664
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:26,040
Mayor Xu,

665
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,680
I am touched

666
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,190
by your speech.

667
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,680
As an entrepreneur,

668
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,430
to get the trust and
support of the government,

669
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,560
which is a blessing

670
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,160
for me and for all the employees

671
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,190
of our Huiquan Corporation.

672
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,920
We won't let the government down.

673
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,760
We will take the initiative to shoulder

674
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,280
the social responsibility of
the leading enterprises in the industry.

675
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,110
Here,

676
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,400
I will emphasize it again.

677
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,070
We will, as always,

678
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,230
create more value

679
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
for the society

680
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,400
under the guidance of the government.

681
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,920
So I'm taking this opportunity

682
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,070
to report to Mayor Xu

683
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,880
and other leaders.

684
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:10,920
The next stage of Huiquan Corporation

685
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,230
is to promote the

686
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,430
Huibo live streaming as soon as possible.

687
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,560
Let Huibo

688
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,920
become the leader of our industry.

689
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,280
About the game,

690
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,350
we will continue

691
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,310
to fix and improve the game.

692
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,560
The last time we received
a procuratorial proposal

693
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,310
from the procuratorate,

694
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,000
we immediately called a meeting

695
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,560
of the senior executives of the company.

696
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,520
And we made the decision

697
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,520
to stop serving the game.

698
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,560
And on that night,

699
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,520
systematic repairs were carried out.

700
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,070
So for the law and the clients' rights,

701
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,110
that's what we care about.

702
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Clear space,

703
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,760
green game,

704
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,950
we will actively

705
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,110
cooperate with

706
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,640
and humbly accept

707
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,000
the procuratorate's criticism.

708
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,230
Prosecutors Guo,

709
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,590
please don't worry this thing.

710
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,400
Happy life,

711
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,760
healthy growth.

712
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,000
This is the core idea

713
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,470
of Huiquan Group's Gaming Division.

714
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,280
Sounds great.

715
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,680
I will

716
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,710
express my opinion here.

717
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,070
Our departments of government

718
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,230
will care about and

719
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,560
support Huiquan Corporation in practice.

720
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:23,760
Thank you!

721
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,280
Thank you.

722
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,190
I will

723
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,190
repeat my words here.

724
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,880
No cyber crime

725
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,830
will be allowed to breed

726
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,800
or be connived at in any form.

727
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,190
Cybercrime is no small matter.

728
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,800
Now,

729
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,070
Please welcome
Procurator Guo to tell you about,

730
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,560
what is enterprise compliance.

731
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,350
Guo,

732
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,710
share the knowledge with us.

733
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:43,160
Okay.

734
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,590
Corporate compliance,

735
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,710
simply put, is criminal compliance.

736
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,230
Try to avoid that handle a case,

737
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,760
there is an enterprise collapse situation.

738
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,710
Mayor Xu,

739
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,190
it's time for lunch.

740
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,560
You can have a meal

741
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,830
at my enterprise.

742
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,070
No.

743
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,880
We have a rule that
we have to go back for lunch.

744
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,710
But this is time for lunch now.

745
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,710
No.

746
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,710
Mayor Xu,

747
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,800
please don't worry.

748
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,310
It's just in our own canteen.

749
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
Each person's meal fee
is not more than 50 yuan,

750
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,710
which fully meets the standard.

751
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
It is also an inspection experience.

752
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,520
Understand the life

753
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,040
of Huiquan Corporation's employees,

754
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,070
and then look at the

755
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,310
Internet workers,

756
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,280
what they really eat.

757
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,280
What do you think?

758
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,640
Professor Luo is so great at talking.

759
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
I don't even have

760
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,710
a reason to say no.

761
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,710
Fine.

762
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,350
Chen,

763
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,920
Then we will pay them for the meals

764
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,470
according to their standard.

765
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,310
Mayor, don't worry.

766
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,430
Okay.

767
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:45,950
Mayor Xu,

768
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,590
this way, please.

769
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,350
Thank you very much.

770
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,350
Mr. Xiao,

771
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,430
Looks like your live streaming business

772
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,040
is going to be successful.

773
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,640
Help me in the future,

774
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,310
Mr. Zhao,

775
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,760
you are kidding.

776
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,190
You know I'm joking, right?

777
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,830
Mu'en,

778
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,640
my health is

779
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,710
not well recently.

780
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
And I let Jikai

781
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,710
take care of the business
of Huiquan Corporation.

782
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,920
In fact,

783
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:25,160
since we have been a family,

784
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,280
we should meet each other earlier.

785
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,950
But I was very busy before,

786
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,040
so it keeps dragging.

787
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,520
This is my problem.

788
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,710
So today,

789
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,430
we

790
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,520
replace the wine with tea,

791
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,400
and cheers.

792
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,350
Okay.

793
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,680
Tiancheng,

794
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,520
stop playing games.

795
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,280
Come to

796
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,160
meet Mr. Xiao.

797
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,040
Hello.

798
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,640
This is my son,

799
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,070
Yin Tiancheng.

800
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,920
He is familiar with Jikai and others.

801
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:55,880
So you two can know each other.

802
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,640
I introduce my son to you today.

803
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,070
I want you

804
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,350
to teach him some lessons.

805
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,800
So he can learn from you.

806
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,520
No. no.

807
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,710
Mr. Xiao,

808
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,430
Chairman specially called me

809
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,430
to invite you to his house.

810
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,830
Well,

811
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,160
The Chairman's house is not just

812
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,430
for anyone who wants to come.

813
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,190
I've known him for years

814
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,430
before I was invited here.

815
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,310
Jikai.

816
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,680
Yes?

817
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,160
I see what I just poured you wasn't tea,

818
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,830
it was vinegar.

819
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,310
Dad,

820
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,520
what are you talking about?

821
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,640
Jikai is not a petty man,

822
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,640
right?

823
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,280
Chairman.

824
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,920
Today I am very happy.

825
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,190
Thanks for your invitation.

826
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,640
I want to thank
Huiquan Corporation more.

827
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,920
Without Huiquan Corporation,

828
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,000
Green Broadcasting
won't have another chance.

829
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,110
Without Huiquan Corporation's

830
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,560
strong financial support,

831
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,190
I think Green Broadcasting will be

832
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,190
likely to be

833
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,400
eliminated by clients through this

834
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,950
crucial market.

835
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,710
You can identify yourself

836
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,560
and

837
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,640
identify others at the same time.

838
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,800
You take your time

839
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,160
in doing things.

840
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,190
This is valuable.

841
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,160
Now the young people

842
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,920
are impetuous in doing things.

843
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,680
There's no such person as you.

844
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,280
In fact,

845
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,830
when I see you,

846
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I see myself when I was young.

847
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,710
Chairman,

848
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,590
I'm flattered.

849
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,400
I can't compare

850
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,640
with you.

851
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,800
If you say that again,

852
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,110
I'll be ashamed.

853
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,110
Mr. Xiao,

854
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,590
get used to it.

855
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,920
That's my dad's style.

856
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,710
Mu'an,

857
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,310
since you have been my home,

858
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,000
we are a family.

859
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,310
Be causal.

860
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,520
Okay.

861
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,110
I heard you come from Guangdong?

862
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,470
Oh,

863
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:46,880
yes.

864
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,310
I'm from Foshan, Guangdong Province.

865
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,070
Oh,

866
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,000
the people from there love kung fu tea.

867
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,230
Yes.

868
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,230
I can see you are

869
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,590
a tea person, too.

870
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,040
Yes,

871
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,470
you are right.

872
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,830
I love to drink kung fu tea.

873
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,110
People in my hometown

874
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,680
love to drink kung fu tea.

875
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:03,640
I've been

876
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,560
drinking Tie Guanyin since I was a child.

877
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,830
Tie Guanyin tastes warm,

878
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,400
mellow and soft.

879
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,070
It's just like you.

880
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,040
Chairman, I'm flattered.

881
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,190
Well,

882
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,000
unlike Zhao Jikai,

883
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,310
he really

884
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,680
loves the foreign wine.

885
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,590
Now he is an expert of Whisky.

886
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,000
Mr. Zhao maybe have

887
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,070
tea sometimes.

888
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,760
Chairman is right.

889
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,400
I like joining the art

890
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,680
and drinking some Whisky.

891
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,230
Everyone has his own favorite.

892
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:38,640
Come.

893
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,470
Have some tea.

894
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,160
Mu'en,

895
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,710
this time,

896
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,920
I want to communicate with you.

897
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Now Green Broadcasting

898
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,310
has been officially a part

899
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,000
of Huiquan Corporation.

900
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,760
So I want to ask you

901
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,710
that during cooperation,

902
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,680
what aspects should

903
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,560
we improve?

904
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,640
What are shortcomings?

905
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,680
Chairman,

906
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,640
everything is fine.

907
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,110
In Huiquan Corporation, Mr. Zhao,

908
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,520
Mr, Li and Professor Luo

909
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,230
care about me very much.

910
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,230
Mr. Xiao is a real talent.

911
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,680
To be honest,

912
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,520
there are

913
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,830
seven companies
of Huiquan Corporation,

914
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,920
and my dad never cared about

915
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,070
any of them

916
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,800
as much as he cares about yours.

917
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm really flattered.

918
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:32,950
Mr. Xiao,

919
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,710
We're actually about the same age.

920
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,310
Don't be so genteel.

921
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,190
Later we will interact with each other.

922
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,110
If things go well,

923
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,880
we are buddies.

924
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
If not,

925
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,000
we are still colleagues.

926
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,680
Okay.

927
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,280
Mu'en,

928
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,470
are you married?

929
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:50,640
No.

930
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,070
Do you have a girlfriend?

931
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,640
No.

932
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,280
Dad,

933
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,160
don't interfere with him.

934
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,520
Mr. Xiao is so young and talented.

935
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,760
He is not short of girlfriends.

936
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,070
Chairman,

937
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,350
actually Mr. Xiao has a girlfriend.

938
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,350
She is one of the Top Ten Prosecutors

939
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,520
in People's Procuratorate.

940
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,160
An Ni.

941
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
A beauty!

942
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
Okay.

943
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,590
Wait,

944
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,350
how did you know that?

945
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,400
I see you're interested in him, too.

946
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,590
An Ni and Li Yitang are best friends.

947
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,350
I have to know that.

948
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,520
Chairman,

949
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,190
actually Mr. Zhao and Ms. Li...

950
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:23,680
Wait,

951
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,880
don't talk about me.

952
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,800
Don't you have a plan

953
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,560
for the future of Green Broadcasting?

954
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,920
Now

955
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,470
you can report it to the Chairman.

956
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:31,680
Okay.

957
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
No.

958
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,470
I believe in your professionalism.

959
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,800
We can trust each other.

960
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,350
Now that Green Broadcasting belongs to

961
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,800
Huiquan Corporation,

962
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,160
then your proposal

963
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,920
will have no problem.

964
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,310
I will give

965
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,350
special approval to it.

966
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,400
Just do what you want to do.

967
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,710
Chairman,

968
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,520
this is a serious matter.

969
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,710
You should listen to him.

970
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:55,710
Well,

971
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,760
Jikai,

972
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,950
now we are cooperating with each other.

973
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,040
So we have to trust each other.

974
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,190
Mu'en is

975
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,830
more concerned about
Green Broadcasting than us.

976
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,160
And he is more

977
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,640
familiar and professional for it.

978
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,110
Is he going to take
the company for the worse?

979
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:12,950
Yes.

980
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,880
I understand.

981
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,430
Mr. Xiao,

982
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,040
if you have anything with
Green Broadcasting,

983
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:17,590
just tell me.

984
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,560
I fully support you.

985
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,880
Mr. Zhao, thank you.

986
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,190
Chairman, thank you.

987
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,110
You are welcome to come again.

988
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,160
Chairman, have a good rest.

989
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:28,830
Okay, goodbye.

990
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,160
Goodbye.

991
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,680
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

992
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,310
Mr. Xiao,

993
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,430
you study science.

994
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,680
Maybe EQ is not so high.

995
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,070
I can give you a reminder.

996
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,070
To be in the king's company
is tantamount to living with a tiger.

997
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,920
Thanks for Mr. Zhao's notice.

998
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,640
Just like you said.

999
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,350
I am specialized in technology.

1000
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,160
I don't think too much in other aspects.

1001
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,710
You don't have to worry.

1002
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
I hope so.

1003
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,520
I have a question.

1004
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,710
I know it is dangerous to call you.

1005
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,430
But I want to know that

1006
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,870
why do you want me

1007
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,230
to support Xiao Mu'en?

1008
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,600
I spared no effort

1009
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,390
to purchase that company.

1010
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,040
But now I feel like

1011
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,230
I hew my own road.

1012
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,190
The chairman likes Xiao Mu'en

1013
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,630
after meeting him.

1014
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,040
Okay.

1015
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,910
I understand.

1016
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
I will follow your rules.

1017
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,190
This is Guo Jing'an.

1018
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,870
He is Yang Bao's contacts.

1019
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,630
We are going to catch him.

1020
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,800
He lives in an old neighborhood.

1021
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,950
Just the No.2 building.

1022
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
He goes to

1023
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,470
(Guo Jing'an's home)
this store to buy food

1024
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,800
and pick up delivery every night

1025
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,910
from 8:30 to 9 p.m.

1026
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,840
So we

1027
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,000
move tonight

1028
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,280
at 8:00.

1029
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,670
Jia,

1030
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,080
you take a person to go to the store.

1031
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,120
(The store)
If he arrives earlier,

1032
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,150
you can just arrest him.

1033
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,150
Li Kui,

1034
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,560
you take a person to his home.

1035
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,080
Okay.

1036
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,190
Let's split up and get ready.

1037
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,630
-Yes.
-Yes.

1038
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,460
(No.1 building, No.2 building)

1039
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,670
Keep down.

1040
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,430
Captain He.

1041
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,000
Captain He.

1042
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,710
What's your name?

1043
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,800
Guo Jing'an.

1044
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,710
Do you know why we took you?

1045
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,600
I do.

1046
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,320
Because of these things.

1047
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,630
(Huiquan Building)
On behalf of the board,

1048
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,040
(Huiquan Corporation)
I attend this week's regular

1049
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,150
meeting of the elite team.

1050
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,560
Mr. Zhao was supposed

1051
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,430
to host this meeting,

1052
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,670
I'll sit in.

1053
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,230
But today is a little special.

1054
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,470
I will speak first.

1055
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,910
The main thing I want to do is set a goal,

1056
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:48,800
which is a common concern of the board.

1057
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,190
After you agree on it,

1058
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,630
I'll submit it to the board of directors

1059
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,280
for approval.

1060
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,470
The game industry has always been

1061
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,710
a pillar industry for Huiquan Technology.

1062
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
It creates fortune

1063
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,560
for Huiquan Corporation.

1064
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,230
And it creates status

1065
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,040
for Huiquan Corporation.

1066
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,120
Its future is still promising.

1067
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,470
But compared to

1068
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:17,080
the live streaming industry,

1069
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,870
it still has a gap.

1070
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,080
Because

1071
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,870
live streaming platform

1072
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,760
represents the capital market

1073
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,470
and the direction of hot money.

1074
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,520
Luo,

1075
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,000
the first strategy of
the three strategies

1076
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,320
you put forward

1077
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,080
has brought great outcome for us.

1078
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,320
So we'd like to

1079
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,190
hear your plans.

1080
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,840
See how can we cooperate with you.

1081
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,840
In fact,

1082
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,950
I'm not as good as Mr. Yin says I am.

1083
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,710
In short,

1084
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,760
these three strategies go hand in hand.

1085
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,000
First,

1086
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,670
win the support from the government.

1087
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,760
Second,

1088
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,950
adjust the main business.

1089
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,190
Third,

1090
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,710
officially state that our

1091
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,320
national enterprise
enters foreign markets.

1092
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,670
That's right.

1093
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,670
First of all, we need to

1094
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,950
take the top spot.

1095
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,230
In that case,

1096
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,390
we have to adjust our budget.

1097
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,800
Make live streaming

1098
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,600
be the first major business.

1099
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,840
Xiao Mu'en,

1100
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,360
you are experienced in this field.

1101
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,520
Share your opinions with us.

1102
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,390
All right.

1103
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,760
After increasing
the budget of live streaming,

1104
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,390
most of the money

1105
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,230
will be applied to research
and develop new products.

1106
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,470
And we will also hire streamers,

1107
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,430
in that...

1108
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,000
Wait a second.

1109
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:31,870
I think

1110
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,230
money should be

1111
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,000
spent wisely.

1112
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,320
Well,

1113
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,470
whether you go to

1114
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,430
other platforms to recruit streamers,

1115
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,280
or to cultivate our own streamers,

1116
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,910
you need to spend money

1117
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,870
to promote the flow of publicity.

1118
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,560
How about this?

1119
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,360
We can plan

1120
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:48,600
news to catch attention of people,

1121
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,800
and we let them
expand through the network.

1122
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,670
By doing so,

1123
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,670
we can also live up to the hype.

1124
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,150
Don't forget

1125
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,000
our main purpose,

1126
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,870
which is to increase the number of

1127
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,080
clients in market in a short time.

1128
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,360
So we have no time

1129
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,390
to wait for Huibo

1130
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,950
to do research and development,

1131
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,760
have a test,

1132
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,870
go live

1133
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,150
and make advertisement.

1134
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,760
The time is too long.

1135
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Huiquan Corporation can't wait.

1136
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,870
How about this?

1137
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,120
We can give some benefits

1138
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,910
to the clients.

1139
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,600
One yuan for one client.

1140
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:21,910
If they download

1141
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,560
the Huibo App,

1142
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:24,910
they can get the money.

1143
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,080
Mr. Zhao,

1144
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,840
your suggestion is great.

1145
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,040
I will listen to it carefully.

1146
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,670
How about this way?

1147
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,230
The budget is still the same.

1148
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,190
Our target is also the same.

1149
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,280
Everything we just said,

1150
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,840
we can do that.

1151
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,630
Because they don't contradict each other.

1152
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,560
But the advice you just said

1153
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,870
that to catch others attention,

1154
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,870
I don't agree with you.

1155
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,870
Because rationally speaking,

1156
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,910
those who surprise people

1157
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,800
are the people or things
that destroy the view

1158
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
and are different from ordinary people.

1159
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:06,910
Okay.

1160
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,430
I have no problem.

1161
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,520
Our Gaming Division

1162
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,670
will step aside.

1163
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,280
I'm waiting for your good news.

1164
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,230
Preferably

1165
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,390
at next week's meeting,

1166
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,000
you can show your work to everyone.

1167
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,080
Do you have any other comments?

1168
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,230
Luo,

1169
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,280
give some support

1170
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,670
to Xiao Mu'en later.

1171
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,430
If something is wrong,

1172
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,800
report to me directly.

1173
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,150
Okay.

1174
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,760
I know that you are aggrieved.

1175
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
Objectively speaking,

1176
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,430
this is the right decision.

1177
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,630
Think positively.

1178
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,360
The less you work,

1179
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,360
the more time we spend together.

1180
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,520
Right?

1181
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,080
Now in Huiquan Corporation,

1182
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,000
just Luo Jiangxiao

1183
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,630
can affect Chairman's decision.

1184
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,760
I hinted at him many times.

1185
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,910
But he ignored me.

1186
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,910
And now he supports Xiao Mu'en.

1187
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,630
With Professor Luo's character,

1188
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,150
whatever he chooses,

1189
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,600
he only does good to Huiquan Corporation.

1190
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,870
You and Xiao Mu'en

1191
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,560
are the same for him.

1192
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,710
He is not prejudiced.

1193
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:26,470
Yitang,

1194
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,120
do you know

1195
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:29,950
how much it cost me

1196
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,390
to be where I am today?

1197
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,950
Now, in Huiquan Corporation,

1198
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,630
I am under one.

1199
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,800
I'm waiting for succeeding
the position of the chairman.

1200
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,150
But everything has changed.

1201
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,470
So I must keep

1202
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,950
what I have won so hard.

1203
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,320
Luo Jiangxiao

1204
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,870
has to be on my side.

1205
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:50,950
You are the favorite

1206
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,630
student of Luo Jiangxiao.

1207
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,040
Please help me get him on my side.

1208
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:06,630
What's wrong?

1209
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,600
You don't want to do that?

1210
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,670
I understand.

1211
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,190
I'm willing to do it

1212
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:14,950
even if you use me.

1213
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,320
