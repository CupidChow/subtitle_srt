00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:39,659
Ni.

16
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,339
Yes?

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,780
Why are you zoning out
early in the morning?

18
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:44,740
Couldn't you sleep well last night?

19
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,299
No, I didn't sleep well.

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,219
What were you saying just now?

21
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,380
I was saying
that No. 4 Procurator's Office

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,380
has no leader now.

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,140
We need more hands here.

24
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,020
Who do you think

25
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,259
the higher-ups would assign

26
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,299
as the new director here?

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,420
No matter who they send,

28
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,460
just focus on your work and do it well.

29
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,659
Make sure you make
Zhao Jikai's statement

30
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,780
into a report for me today.

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:05,899
Okay.

32
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:11,699
Everyone, please pause for a moment.

33
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,180
I have an announcement.

34
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:15,540
Starting today,

35
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,980
Comrade Liu Jinjiang

36
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,139
will fill in Comrade Wang Heyu's place

37
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,859
as the director of
the No. 4 Procurator's Office.

38
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:23,980
From now on,

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,139
Director Liu is your direct superior.

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,620
Let's give him a big hand.

41
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:29,139
Welcome, Director Liu.

42
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:30,380
Director Liu.

43
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:32,419
Thank you so much.

44
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,100
Thank you and the leaders

45
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:35,299
for trusting me.

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,059
Also, thank you every one of you

47
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,499
for supporting me all the time.

48
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,419
I'm very honored

49
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,620
to be assigned

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,100
as the director
of the No. 4 Procurator's Office.

51
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,219
I'm aware

52
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:45,299
that the No. 4 Procurator's Office,

53
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,180
especially this year,

54
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,859
has encountered a particularly challenging

55
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,659
cybercrime case with many parties involved

56
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,620
and the case is complicated.

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,779
However,

58
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:57,180
we shouldn't

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,020
overlook other cases too.

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,340
I've made a promise

61
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,260
with Prosecutor Guo

62
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,380
that we'll accomplish investigations

63
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,579
on other cases and overcome obstacles

64
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,820
without affecting the progress of Case 7·23.

65
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,380
There's one more comrade,

66
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,419
who made a promise just like I did.

67
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:16,499
You all knew this comrade well.

68
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:18,939
Li Jia.

69
00:03:22,779 --> 00:03:23,460
Li Jia.

70
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:24,980
Why didn't you tell us

71
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,260
after returning from the training?

72
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,620
Well, we have a new case now.

73
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:29,859
And I forgot about that.

74
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,900
I just rushed hotfoot back today.

75
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,059
When I was away for training,

76
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,579
you've been working so hard

77
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,419
with the work.

78
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:38,299
I heard

79
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,620
you've been busy with a big case

80
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:41,340
that you don't even have time to rest.

81
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,380
Now

82
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:43,139
I'm back,

83
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,859
I can share the workload with you all.

84
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,980
You can catch your breath.

85
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,779
That's great.

86
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,020
Comrade Li Jia,

87
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:48,779
well said.

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,659
The ongoing Case 7·23

89
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
is in a critical phase.

90
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,859
An Ni,

91
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:53,579
Han Xuan,

92
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,820
and the rest from the special task force,

93
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,419
don't let up.

94
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,299
You must keep on striving

95
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,740
to win this battle.

96
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,299
It's the most crucial and final battle.

97
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:02,820
Yes.

98
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:04,579
Director Liu.

99
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,460
Talk about perfect timing.

100
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,139
Today, we received an online fraud case.

101
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,299
It's your first case

102
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,579
after coming to No. 4 Procurator's Office.

103
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:12,939
I hope you can

104
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,299
make a good start.

105
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,460
Don't worry, Sir.

106
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,620
I'll accomplish my task.

107
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,579
Don't make that promise so soon.

108
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,340
This is a bit unique.

109
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,139
All the suspects are women,

110
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,900
they are all young mothers.

111
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,979
Young mothers?

112
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,699
Yes.

113
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,220
Li Jia came back

114
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,340
at the right time from Beijing.

115
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Indeed,

116
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:35,379
you came just in time.

117
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,780
Li Jia.

118
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,900
You'll handle this case.

119
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,259
What do you say?

120
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:41,060
Sure.

121
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,099
Come in.

122
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:46,500
Director.

123
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:48,900
These are the documents of some victims.

124
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,419
I've come across the documents.

125
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,099
Here's the thing.

126
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,740
The current society...

127
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,419
Take a seat.

128
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,819
There are many full-time mothers

129
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,900
looking after the children at home.

130
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,979
They don't have jobs,

131
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,500
but they want

132
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,940
to find work they can do at home

133
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,379
to earn some money for their families.

134
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,620
And this is exploited by criminals.

135
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,620
They spread false advertisements online,

136
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
claiming that they offer
high-paying daily job

137
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,579
for handicrafts.

138
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:22,699
They ask for an initial deposit

139
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,340
and they would prevent the victims

140
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,620
from completing the work
within a time limit

141
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,020
and refuse to return the deposit.

142
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,419
With this mere trick,

143
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,819
they've duped
18,000 young mothers nationwide

144
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:36,539
and acquired 15 million
in less than a year.

145
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,500
That's a massive figure.

146
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:40,419
The ringleader would be sentenced

147
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,220
to more than ten years in prison.

148
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,979
I don't quite follow.

149
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,220
You said that the victims
are young mothers.

150
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,099
How come the suspects
are young mothers too?

151
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,859
That's where this case appears unique.

152
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:55,340
The criminals are over forty,

153
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,699
and most of them are young mothers,

154
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,340
some even have a second child.

155
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,660
Young mothers deceived young mothers.

156
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,740
The criminals are spread nationwide

157
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,299
and are still young,

158
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,780
the youngest is 21,

159
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:11,299
and the oldest ringleader is only 26.

160
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,940
These people have low educational qualifications

161
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:15,900
and the family condition isn't well off.

162
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,099
The majority of them only
have elementary education.

163
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,020
So, how did they start
the fraudulent activities?

164
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:25,299
At first,

165
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,740
they were doing online part-time jobs
for daily wages.

166
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:28,699
Afterward,

167
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,579
they weren't convinced of being duped

168
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,819
and wanted to get back their lost money.

169
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,859
So, they developed into
scammers themselves.

170
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:35,900
Eventually, they realized

171
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,139
that this business was too lucrative.

172
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,020
They became greedy and fell in deeper.

173
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,139
Lastly, they initiated

174
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,259
fraudulent activities themselves.

175
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,859
What about their children

176
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,340
if they're detained?

177
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,139
That's where the problems lie in.

178
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,940
The children of the suspects

179
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,419
are ranging from six years old,

180
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,740
the oldest to a few months old, the youngest baby.

181
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:57,299
They came here for questions

182
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:58,579
along with their children.

183
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,699
We have to accommodate
these children too.

184
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,940
Children are innocent.

185
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:06,180
If the mothers were to sentence to jail,

186
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,979
the children will be left uncared.

187
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,539
According to the protocols,

188
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,060
lactating women shouldn't be detained.

189
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,020
But the lactation period
is only one year.

190
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,539
How about those of
two to three years old?

191
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:17,780
How pitiful.

192
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,340
After a careful discussion,

193
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,419
we've decided

194
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,620
to let young mothers who didn't
involve deeply being released on bail.

195
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:29,139
We must consider the children

196
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,699
while dealing with criminals.

197
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,620
This is challenging.

198
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,460
The spirit of
the Supreme People's Procuratorate

199
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:39,340
to show the warmth of the prosecution

200
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:41,379
in every aspect while handling the case.

201
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:42,740
As for how,

202
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
it relies on the wisdom of our prosecutors.

203
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,620
I'll think about this carefully.

204
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:49,780
Here's the thing.

205
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:52,060
We'll meet with these young mothers

206
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,139
to learn about the situation.

207
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,900
Sure.

208
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,780
Thank you.

209
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,620
Wen Juan.

210
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I know why you refuse to plead guilty.

211
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,060
After all, it's a serious
criminal circumstance.

212
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:08,900
Whether or not you admit to it,

213
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,500
the sentence can't be reduced.

214
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,419
That's why you give up on yourself.

215
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,139
Did I get that right?

216
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,620
I didn't do anything wrong.

217
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,180
I'll say the same thing

218
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,780
even if I'm in court.

219
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,220
Judicial personnel like you

220
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,539
can't just put words into our mouths

221
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:28,819
and simply convict us for your own performance.

222
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,699
You said you didn't commit a crime.

223
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,819
What about fraudulent funds
worth 15 million?

224
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,980
The deposits of all victims nationwide

225
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,139
are in the pocket of you
and your accomplice.

226
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,300
Never think that we can't
discover anything

227
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:45,619
from the transaction records
of multiple WeChat accounts.

228
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,100
The prosecute has already obtained a clear record
of the fund flow.

229
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,980
Do you still want to argue,
even with the evidence?

230
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,220
We just provided part-time jobs.

231
00:08:57,619 --> 00:08:58,499
Not only that,

232
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,980
we offered employment training too.

233
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,780
These need operating costs.

234
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,059
Charging the deposit as service charges

235
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:07,100
is reasonable.

236
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,579
Besides, there's nothing wrong

237
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:10,739
with posting handicraft jobs online.

238
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,059
The problem is the task is difficult

239
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,100
and many mothers can't manage that.

240
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:18,020
Because they've overestimated
their ability.

241
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,900
We shouldn't be blamed for that.

242
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,059
Besides,

243
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:22,300
we had a mutual agreement

244
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,379
on non-refundable deposits.

245
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,460
That's consensual.

246
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,819
How come it turns into fraud?

247
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,259
Let me ask you this,

248
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,059
where do you sell

249
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:34,739
the accomplished product to?

250
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:38,540
Who are the upstream companies
that purchase them?

251
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,340
How much is the purchase amount?

252
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:42,619
Tell me.

253
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,619
What are the purchase criteria?

254
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,860
You can't answer any of my questions.

255
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,100
Yet you still deny it.

256
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,860
We've obtained

257
00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:54,179
the chat history of you

258
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:57,819
instructing your subordinates
in fraudulent activities

259
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,540
and how your subordinate
distributed the money

260
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:02,499
to all key members.

261
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,739
All crucial evidence

262
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,259
like bank transaction records

263
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,739
is enough to form a complete chain.

264
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,100
If you refuse to plead guilty,

265
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,579
you'll lose the chance for mitigation.

266
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,220
We'll meet in court.

267
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,619
If you want to push your luck,

268
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:25,980
you'll have to pay for the cost.

269
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,460
Based on the chat history

270
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:30,619
of you and the victims,

271
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,699
the upstream company involved

272
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:34,579
is fake.

273
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:36,179
It's the alternative account

274
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,379
registered from your husband,
Wei Shujie's phone number.

275
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,619
Shouldn't you confess about this?

276
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:45,739
It was me.

277
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,900
I stole his phone.

278
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:49,499
It doesn't concern him.

279
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,340
Don't arrest him.

280
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:56,619
That's it for today.

281
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:58,499
Prosecutor.

282
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,059
Prosecutor.

283
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,460
Please don't arrest him.

284
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,460
Ni.

285
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:04,980
Yes.

286
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,020
Why do you ask for me?

287
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,540
Oh.

288
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,059
If Jia needs aid with
technical issues afterward,

289
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,020
please help her out.

290
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:12,420
Sure.

291
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:15,379
Ni.

292
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:15,900
What's up?

293
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,619
Jia has been in the questioning session
the whole day

294
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,340
and she's not back yet.

295
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,499
She really pushes herself too hard.

296
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:21,220
Yes.

297
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,819
As a young mother,

298
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,619
she has to juggle with work and family.

299
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,900
That's challenging.

300
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,059
So, we should help as much as we can.

301
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,300
Ni.

302
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,220
I heard something legendary happened

303
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,020
when she gave birth to her baby.

304
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,020
It's said that she was
writing complaints at that time

305
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:39,980
and was then sent to the hospital.

306
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,379
The labor process just took an hour.
Is that really true?

307
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,420
Are you a gossip king?

308
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,860
Why are you so interested
in these things?

309
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:46,340
So is it true or not?

310
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,139
Tell me.

311
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,660
It wasn't within an hour,

312
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:50,780
just 50 minutes.

313
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:52,739
That afternoon,

314
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,819
when Jia finished

315
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,059
a complaint that involved twenty people,

316
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:58,499
she handed over the work to a colleague at 4:45 p.m.

317
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,939
Then, she felt unwell and called an ambulance

318
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,819
to go to the obstetrics department.

319
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
At 5:35 p.m.

320
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,259
the baby was born.

321
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,660
This is indeed an incredible speed.

322
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,660
She didn't want labor to go fast.

323
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:11,739
But due to the demanding workload,

324
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,499
she gave birth to the baby prematurely.

325
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,540
The baby was unhealthy when it was born.

326
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,300
Although Jia never said
anything about this,

327
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,220
as a mother, she must've been upset.

328
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,100
No wonder she's so invested

329
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:27,619
in the fraud case
that involved young mothers.

330
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:29,819
I should help her more.

331
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,460
I didn't know

332
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:32,980
you had a kind soul, Han Xuan.

333
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,220
Are you praising me or mocking me?

334
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:36,619
Well, get back to your work.

335
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,379
All right.

336
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,100
Is there someone taking care
of your daughter?

337
00:12:45,753 --> 00:12:47,034
I've sent her to my cousin's place.

338
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,900
She's only four,

339
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,980
but she's smart

340
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:52,980
and mature for her age.

341
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,540
I'm worried that she can
understand our conversation.

342
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:00,059
You're a responsible father.

343
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,699
Please don't make fun of me.

344
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,540
I...

345
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,499
I'll wind up like this

346
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,420
because

347
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:10,179
I'm useless and
I can't provide for my family.

348
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,220
My wife and child
can't live comfortably.

349
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,819
That's why she went into this.

350
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,179
I...

351
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,220
I feel sorry for Juan.

352
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,619
She really loves you.

353
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:22,179
She won't blame you.

354
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,619
The reason you're summoned here

355
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:29,699
is to investigate

356
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:32,259
the account of the fake
upstream company.

357
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,139
Wen Juan said she stole your phone

358
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,579
and created a fake account.

359
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,860
Is this true?

360
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,579
No.

361
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,220
I created that account.

362
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:51,939
I was involved in all of it.

363
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,699
I'm the accomplice.

364
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:55,900
No.

365
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,980
I'm the mastermind.

366
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,179
Juan is just a housewife.

367
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,259
She knows nothing about the fraud.

368
00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:04,499
I instructed her to do that.

369
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,619
We'll verify the thing you said.

370
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,460
Prosecutor.

371
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Please.

372
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,179
I'm willing to bear the conviction.

373
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,739
Please arrest me and release my wife.

374
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:22,579
My child can't be without her mother.

375
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:26,900
(Repent and Reform)

376
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,139
(Repent and Reform)
I'm the mastermind.

377
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,739
He said that
because he wanted to save me.

378
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,220
He has never been in contact
with my subordinates.

379
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,739
He's clueless about the organization.

380
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:42,579
Your husband

381
00:14:42,619 --> 00:14:45,579
has confessed about the organization,

382
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,540
which's consistent with the statement
by the two subordinates.

383
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,379
Besides, the finance personnel

384
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,939
said that you contacted your husband
in this regard

385
00:14:55,819 --> 00:14:57,980
and you have transferred
money to his account many times.

386
00:14:58,379 --> 00:14:59,699
The bank transaction records

387
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:02,900
and chat history align perfectly.

388
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,860
Even if the money
is transferred to you,

389
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,179
it doesn't mean your husband
is out of the fraud.

390
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:10,939
You see,

391
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,100
when you tell a lie,

392
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,499
you have to cover it up
with one thousand lies.

393
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,460
If you truly care for him,

394
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,420
you should tell the entire truth.

395
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,220
I...

396
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:26,460
I will confess.

397
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:27,980
I confess everything.

398
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:30,860
The first person I deceived

399
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,100
was a young mother, Wan Yun.

400
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,939
I met her when I took my daughter
to the doctor.

401
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,220
Yun.

402
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,379
You read that, right?

403
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,780
It's just posting advertisements.

404
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,420
You don't have to do anything else.

405
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,460
You can get 300 yuan in commission

406
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:45,939
for recruiting an agent.

407
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,540
The deposit is just paltry

408
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,860
and no risk at all.

409
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:54,619
At worst, you won't recruit anymore.

410
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,340
(Isn't it similar to
the pyramid scheme?)

411
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,780
(That's illegal, though.)

412
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,499
No, it's not.

413
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,499
We don't sell products or force anyone.

414
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,499
(Well, I need time to consider it.)

415
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,259
Why hesitate, Yun?

416
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,300
What are you doing?

417
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,420
Let's stop here, Juan.

418
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,780
Don't dwell on that 500 yuan.

419
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:16,739
Just consider it a lesson learned.

420
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,139
You said it if it's nothing big.

421
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,540
Go and make 500 yuan now.

422
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,300
That's worth the baby diapers

423
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,619
of one whole month.

424
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,579
Without that money,
what is the baby going to do?

425
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,100
I'll borrow some money from my parents.

426
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:30,499
Enough of that.

427
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,179
Are you going to leech off them
your whole life?

428
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,819
Your parents would nag at us again

429
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,980
for slacking off on studies.

430
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,699
Yun.

431
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,579
After Wan Yun fell for it,

432
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,499
I encouraged her to recruit more agents.

433
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,780
She had a chat group with young mothers.

434
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,579
Soon, she developed a downstream group
with dozens of members.

435
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,220
Then, I guided them in establishing
their own independent group

436
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:02,020
with fraudulent tricks.

437
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,579
You're home, hubby.

438
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,780
Let me show you something exciting.

439
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,979
What's it?

440
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,219

(Transaction History: From Shao Mei)

443
00:17:15,139 --> 00:17:15,979
I just received it.

444
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:20,180
Let me see.

445
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,339
- Let me see.
- Look closely.

446
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:25,099
There are more.

447
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,540
This is so easy.

448
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,660
We have enough money
for milk powder and diapers.

449
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,660
As more and more young mothers

450
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:34,259
paying the service fee.

451
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,979
The money snowballed.

452
00:17:39,499 --> 00:17:41,979
Everyone's greed is then triggered.

453
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,180
And my husband didn't stop me then.

454
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,900
He even helped me

455
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:49,739
by creating accounts
with his number.

456

wasn't deeply involved.

Is everyone here?

(Huiquan Corporation)

510
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,739
Let's start.

511
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:02,099
Today, I received a phone call.

512
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,300
It was from an oversea investor

513
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,379
we've been in contact with
for the past months.

514
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,900
He's not satisfied

515
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:16,499
with the user data and market share of Huibo.

516
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,259
Currently, the tricky problem we have

517
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,420
is with the financing.

518
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,660
(Yin Huiquan)

519
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,499
That's why I gather you all here.

520
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,259
Well.

521
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:27,300
We'll hash this out

522
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,900
to see if there's a better method.

523
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,820
Mu'en. You speak first.

524
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:39,820
Chairman.

525
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,940
Have you ever considered

526
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,580
bringing in other capital?

527
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:45,739
It's been a long time.

528
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,540
To put it bluntly,

529
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,660
had the oversea investor,

530
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,739
who recommended by the shareholder,

531
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:54,780
have intentions to invest,

532
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,339
it wouldn't have taken so long.

533
00:21:58,099 --> 00:21:58,900
Personally,

534
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,540
I don't think he wants to invest in us.

535
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,540
I suggest

536
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,339
that you can give him a deadline,

537
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,139
either he invests or gives up.

538
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,499
Stop leaving us hanging.

539
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:11,060
Well.

540
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,499
What are your opinions?

541
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:18,739
Go ahead.

542
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:19,979
Yes?

543
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,139
You can recommend

544
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,219
other investors.

(Yin Huiquan)

547
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,660
I need you all to know

548
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,580
that Huiquan is a legitimate company

549
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,820
and we have reputations in society.

550
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,979
We respect market rules too.

551
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,379
Therefore,

552
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,859
please rest assured.

553
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,499
If the financing pans out well,

554
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:50,300
I'll allocate 2 percent

555
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,859
of the total funding amount

556
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,900
as your incentive.

559
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,459
Yes.

560
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,259
I have some friends

561
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,739
in the investment industry

562
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:06,540
and they are capable in this regard.

563
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,060
If you agree,

564
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,900
I can talk to them

565
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,139
to see if they're interested.

566
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,420
Sure.

567
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,979
That'll be better

568
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,580
if they're not investors
from our circle.

569
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,139
Because they tend to be demanding.

570
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:21,660
Understood.

571
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:24,099
But I'd like to make this clear,

572
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,499
if the investment succeeds,

573
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,540
I won't take the commission.

574
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,339
I suggest

575
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,900
that the commission

576
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,900
is used for everyone's interest.

582

(Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation)
Hello, everyone.

590
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,099
(Demonstration Base)
Let me present to you the first product,

591
00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:13,339
(Assisting Agricultural Development)
the Deyuan Garlic you see.

592
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,339
Miss.

593
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,020
What's the difference

594
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,499
between this garlic and other types?

595
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,739
Good question.

596
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,420
Deyuan Garlic

597
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,900
is produced from water-rich Tianfu
in Chengdu City.

598
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,619
Not only this renowned garlic
has a long history,

599
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,339
but also has a tasty and spicy taste.

600
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,139
Most importantly,

601
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,459
its allicin content

602
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:33,379
is much higher than common garlic.

603
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,900
I know garlic is good.

604
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,580
But we don't consume it much.

605
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,379
Are there any vegetables

606
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:41,979
that we eat every day?

607
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,020
Let me show you a few others.

608
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,580
For example,

609
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:47,940
it's also originated from Tianfu,

610
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:49,859

Yunqiao Round Radish.

612
00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:53,940
(Yunqiao Round Raddish)
We might encounter questions

613
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,139
during live streaming like,

614
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,099
"Why is this radish delicious?"

615
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:58,339
How do you answer this?

616
00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:00,259
Please tell us.

617
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,979
Yunqiao Round Radish

00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,180
is grown in Chengdu's plain

located at the confluence area
of three rivers.

620
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,660
It's on the first terrace
of the floodplain,

621
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,979
where it's predominantly oil sands

with high sand content.

623

The pH value is between 6.2 to 6.6.

624
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,259
which is high in organic matter.

625
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,379
There's one more vegetable

626
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,219
we often eat,

627
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,339
hotbed chives.

and rich in selenium, phosphorus,
and other nutrients,

How's it, Wan?

644
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:51,940
How do you feel
about the first training?

645
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:55,060
(To be honest, I was nervous.)

646
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,259
(But I think it was a good session.)

647
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,739
(And I found that all students are eager)

648
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,300
(to assist in agriculture.)

649
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,300
They believe

650
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
that the subsidiary
agricultural products

651
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:07,619
are of high quality

652

and it can be widely used.

653
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,060
More to the point,

654
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:13,020
it's eco-friendly,

655
00:26:13,099 --> 00:26:15,300
which aligns with modern demands.

656
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,420
(So, I believe the products
have a large market.)

657
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,060
Certainly.

658
00:26:19,139 --> 00:26:21,700
You're so familiar
with the local specialties

660

Can I visit you sometime later?

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,020
But we've left Jiangcheng.

679
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,499
What?

680
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:04,379
You...

681
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,499
Don't worry, I'm not the same as before.

682
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,180
So, where are you now?

683
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:12,339
What about this?

684
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:13,859
I'll video call you

685
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,139
and show you what I'm doing.

686
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:15,979
(Okay.)

687
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,219
(Hi, Xiaobei. Long time no see. Look at this.)

688
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,499
(Behind me.)

689
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,139
(Can you see those green crops?)

690
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,300
(You know what, these are all lettuce.)

691
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,099
(I'm on a vegetable farm in a village.)

692
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:38,099
I'm working on promoting agricultural products
via live streaming lately.

693
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:38,859
(Afterward,)

694
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,259
(I'll send you a few boxes of vegetables.)

695
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,820
Please give it to Prosecutor An

696
00:27:43,979 --> 00:27:45,900
and Captain He too.

697
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:46,979
Look at this.

698
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,300
Lately,

699
00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:50,940
I've been busy

700
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,700
with packaging,

701
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,180
sales, and production.

702
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,219
My life is fulfilled every day.

703
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,180
No wonder I couldn't reach you.

704
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,459
It turns out you're working on this.

705
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,339
Yes, but it's not just me.

706
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:08,379
My friends and I

707
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,219
have established a company.

708
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:12,859
I also recruited some live streamers.

709
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:15,139
(It's different from the one before.)

710
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,660
This is a proper one.

711
00:28:18,219 --> 00:28:20,940
We help those farmers

712
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:21,979
to promote their vegetables.

713
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,540
That's what we're doing now.

714
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,020
Liang Ying.

715
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,139
I'm happy for you.

716
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,820
Well, we...

717
00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:31,660
Xiaobei.

718
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,180
Honestly, I was sad when I parted with you.

719
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,300
(That's why I came to my friend's hometown
to get some fresh air.)

720
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,780
(But the village and people here)

721
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,940
(give me peace of mind.)

722
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,619
When I enjoyed the sun here,

723
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,339
suddenly I realized what I could do

724
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:53,259
and I wanted to do.

725
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,139
I returned to the network,
which I'm familiar with

726
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,739
to do something within my ability.

727
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:00,540
If I can be helpful to someone,

728
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,379
even better.

729
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:03,940
I'll come and find you.

730
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,780
I can help you. Let's work this out.

731
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,700
(Xiaobei.)

732
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,580
(With responsibility and honesty,)

733
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,099
(I can tell you that we're over.)

734
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:17,259
(Our past relationship belonged only)

735
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,459
(to the chaos days before.)

736
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,580
I'm no longer

737
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,739
the pathetic and desire-driven woman.

738
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,259
I don't rely on you anymore.

739
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:29,180
So my affection for you

740
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:30,619
has gradually disappeared.

741
00:29:30,859 --> 00:29:32,540
(I'm fulfilled every day now.)

742
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,499
(I think I'm doing something meaningful.)

743
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:39,420
(I hope you can find something meaningful
for yourself too.)

744
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,540
I really appreciate what you did before.

745
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,180
I hope we can always be friends.

746
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:49,820
You've found your path.

747
00:29:50,499 --> 00:29:51,180
What about me?

748
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,219
I want a meaningful life too.

749
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,820
(You sure can.)

750
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,700
You're popular online now.

751
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:03,219
I think you can try out something

752
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,619
(like promoting anti-fraud campaigns.)

753
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,540
(You might give it a try.)

754
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,139
(Maybe you can help some people.)

755
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:11,900
(Liang Ying.)

756
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,060
(Hotel Shenzhen wants to discuss
the long-term vegetable supply.)

757
00:30:14,459 --> 00:30:15,379
(Coming.)

758
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:17,060
(Xiaobei, I got to go.)

759
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,580
(I hope you can do better.)

760
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:19,700
(See you next time.)

761
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,420
Yonggang.

762
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:36,099
Yes.

763
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:36,979
Mr. Xiao.

764
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:41,060
Did you really quit gambling?

765
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,700
Yes.

766
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:46,060
You've done well at work recently.

767
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:48,499
Your colleagues have been praising you.

768
00:30:49,339 --> 00:30:49,979
Well done.

769
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:51,259
Mr. Xiao.

770
00:30:51,859 --> 00:30:52,700
You've saved me.

771
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,139
By the way, Mr. Xiao,

772
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,780
have you heard about that?

773
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,339
Rumors are going around
in the company,

774
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:02,820
saying that Chairman values you highly.

775
00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:05,020
Some even say

776
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,420
you'll be cultivated as the successor.

777
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,300
That's great.

778
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:11,459
Finally, the credits return to you.

779
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:16,300
Back then, Zhao Jikai
always took you lightly.

780
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:18,339
Now that the obstacle is gone.

781
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,219
Remember.

782
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,940
Don't talk about this anymore
in the company.

783
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,379
Yes.

784
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:25,900
Oh, Mr. Xiao.

785
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,820
I need your help.

786
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:29,339
Go on.

787
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:33,219
Can I request a portion of my bonus?

788
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,540
No, Mr. Xiao.

789
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,859
Jiao has given birth to a baby.

790
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:39,459
She's weak now.

791
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,940
So, I want to buy her some supplementary

792
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,580
and visit her at her parents' home.

793
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,859
Ever since that incident,

794
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,459
I'm too ashamed to go there.

795
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:49,619
Mr. Xiao.

796
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:53,060
Please put in some good words for me.

797
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Well,

798
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,859
I won't help with that.

799
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,339
You tell her yourself.

800
00:31:59,139 --> 00:31:59,700
Dear.

801
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,259
Why are you here?

802
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,619
Did you leave your parents' house?

803
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:05,060
Do you really

804
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:07,099
want my parents to look after the baby?

805
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,940
You're right.

806
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:09,660
We shouldn't do that.

807
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,420
We shouldn't.

808
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,660
Dear.

809
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,060
I've quit gambling.

810
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,700
I swear

811
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,580
I'll never touch that stuff ever again.

812
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:20,020
Well, no need to swear.

813
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,900
Mr. Xiao has told me everything.

814
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,459
I know you've changed.

815
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,619
Well, that's enough.

816
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,139
Quit that lovey-dovey.

817
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:27,979
It seems

818
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,180
that I have to return this card.

819
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,060
That...

820
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:34,420
What's that?

821
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,020
This is the bank card for my salary.

822
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,180
Mr. Xiao has been keeping it for me.

823
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:42,940
Just in case I make trouble again.

824
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,420
Dear.

825
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,379
You really should thank Mr. Xiao.

826
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:51,300
Besides,

827
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:53,780
I've put in some money.

828
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,580
It's just something little.

829
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,379
You can use the money as you wish.

830
00:32:58,459 --> 00:32:59,259
That won't do.

831
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,180
- No, Mr. Xiao.
- Well enough.

832
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:01,339
Don't reject my kindness.

833
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,780
I wish you happy.

834
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:05,180
Get on with your life well.

835
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,859
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

836
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,259
No, Yonggang.

837
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,660
We should return the money to Mr. Xiao.

838
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,300
We can't take his money.

839
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
We'll keep it first.

840
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,300
Afterward, I'll work harder and
return the money to Mr. Xiao.

841
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,780
I owe him too much.

842
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,339
I owe you even more.

843
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,339
I'm sorry. Something held me up.

844
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,499
Do you need me to be your proxy?

845
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,459
Nice to meet you, Attorney Wu.

846
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:41,540
Li Yitang.

847
00:33:42,739 --> 00:33:44,020
Li Yitang of Huiquan?

848
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,339
You're Zhao Jikai's girlfriend?

849
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,060
Let me introduce myself.

850
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:56,219
Correction.

851
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,780
Now,

852
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,820
I'm not with Huiquan anymore.

853
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:01,420
I'm an attorney,

854
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:02,379
just like you.

855
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,020
You can call me Attorney Li.

856
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,900
By the way, Zhao Jikai

857
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:10,419
is no longer my boyfriend.

858
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:12,459
I've made it clear

859
00:34:12,499 --> 00:34:13,899
to the person who approached me

860
00:34:13,979 --> 00:34:15,979
that I didn't want any contact with you.

861
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
Why do you still come here?

862
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,820
I'm here to help you.

863
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:26,899
You're kidding me.

864
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,140
I'm sorry.

865
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,020
I don't have time for your prank.

866
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,100
A friend of mine

867
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,259
deeply cares about Qian Tianxin

868
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,459
and he entrusted me

869
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,219
to plead down
to a misdemeanor for her.

870
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:47,499
However, due to my identity,

871
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,179
I can't appear in court myself.

872
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,179
I have to count on you.

873
00:35:12,699 --> 00:35:13,659
What do you mean?

874
00:35:15,659 --> 00:35:16,979
This is the first attorney's fee

875
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,659
paid by my friend.

876
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,459
Attorney Wu.

877
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,219
This isn't what a gentleman should do

878
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:25,699
for letting a woman

879
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:27,380
extend her hand like this.

880
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:28,899
Please take it back.

881
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:32,140
Securing the maximum interest
for clients

882
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:34,820
is the bare duty of an attorney,

883
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,419
but only if it's legal.

884
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,100
If you intend to pay me a generous fee

885
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,659
for something illegal.

886
00:35:44,659 --> 00:35:45,219
I'm sorry.

887
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Out of the question.

888
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,739
Attorney Wu, how incorruptible of you.

889
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,020
You made a brilliant argument

890
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:05,739
for Qian Tianxin's case in court.

891
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,259
Sadly, it came up short.

892
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:10,780
I feel sorry for you.

893
00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:12,699
What are you trying to get at?

894
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,580
As far as I know,

895
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:16,659
your specialty

896
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:18,540
is dealing with transnational
criminal cases.

897
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,459
You were hoping
to use Qian Tianxin's case

898
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:24,140
to reach new heights in your career.

899
00:36:24,419 --> 00:36:26,659
Unexpectedly, you failed.

900
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,620
Your client is determined
to plead guilty

901
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:30,820
and even a death sentence.

902
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:33,419
As an attorney,
since you've accepted this case,

903
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:35,219
you shouldn't defy the client's request

904
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,899
and cooperate.

905
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,979
You ended up bearing setbacks.

906
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,659
You're overthinking.

907
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,620
There's nothing like that.

908
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:47,259
You better stop making wild assumptions

909
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:50,020
and pretend like you know.

910
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:50,780
Well.

911
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,340
Did I?

912
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,380
I got the conclusion
after investigating.

913
00:36:54,899 --> 00:36:55,780
Attorney Wu.

914
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,419
I heard that you took

915
00:36:57,459 --> 00:36:58,939
a huge transnational case

916
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,699
at an outrageous price.

917
00:37:01,459 --> 00:37:02,540
The money is such a hot potato.

918
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,979
I'm now in a difficult situation

919
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,179
where my hands are tied.

920
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:06,659
I can't defend for a misdemeanor,

921
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,820
instead, she'll be charged

922
00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:09,219
with a heavier conviction
that she didn't commit.

923
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,820
If things really develop

924
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,659
as they plan out,

925
00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:15,939
I'll become a laughingstock
in the industry.

926
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,620
Alcohol is the truth serum.

927
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:20,300
Attorney Wu,

928
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,300
did you forget

929
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,100
about what you said?

930
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,979
What do you want?

931
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,219
I've said it just now.

932
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:28,699
I want to help Qian Tianxin.

933
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,140
I'd like to ask you a favor.

934
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:33,219
It'll render mitigation

935
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,219
for your client, Qian Tianxin.

936
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,020
Okay.

937
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:36,780
What favor?

938
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:37,860
You tell me.

939
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,620
A.

940
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:43,380
This is the only thing we can do,

941
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,780
we must go all out.

942
00:37:47,659 --> 00:37:49,060
You're not my client.

943
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,179
Why should I follow what you said?

944
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:56,899
Qian Tianxin is your client.

945
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,499
She's willing to die

946
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,060
for someone she cares about.

947
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:03,780
Sadly, the person uses her,

948
00:38:03,979 --> 00:38:05,100
manipulates her,

949
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:08,860
and even threatens the man
who deeply loves her with her life

950
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:10,860
for the sake of his interest.

951
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,979
Do you have the heart

952
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,020
to see your client being deceived
and blindfolded,

953
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,259
taking the charges she never committed?

954
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:23,020
Will you be convinced

955
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,259
that your case ends
in a ridiculous failure?

956
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:26,380
There's one thing you need to know.

957
00:38:26,979 --> 00:38:29,100
My client isn't Qian Tianxin,

958
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,739
but her husband in Country F.

959
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,979
I must respect the will of my employer.

960
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:40,899
I can't simply terminate this proxy.

961
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,340
Frankly, I've been thinking of
a method to satisfy everyone's needs.

962
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,380
I want to seek breakthroughs

963
00:38:45,419 --> 00:38:48,620
for Qian Tianxin's mitigation

964
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,020
from other aspects

965
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,419
despite the crimes she has committed.

966
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:55,820
Even though the hope is slim,

967
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,699
still, I can't violate

968
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:01,820
my bottom line as an attorney.

969
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,820
Attorney Wu,

970
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,580
you're having your head in the clouds.

971
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:09,979
Your employer,

972
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,699
who's in Country F now,

973
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,419
no matter what his hidden intention is,

974
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,620
superficially, he still wants you
to negotiate for a misdemeanor.

975
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,140
So, you're not defying his will.

976
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,739
As long as you keep this from your employer,

977
00:39:23,979 --> 00:39:26,060
you can help both Qian Tianxin

978
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,100
and your reputation.

979
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:29,979
Why not?

980
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:43,380
Okay.

981
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,659
I'm down.

982
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,620
We'll make this

983
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,100
in a handshake agreement.

984
00:39:48,899 --> 00:39:49,659
Mu'en.

985
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,060
How are things going on?

986
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:53,939
Chairman.

987
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,020
As of now,

988
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,580
there are two investing companies...

989
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:56,979
Yes.

990
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,300
Showing interest in us.

991
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,300
They agree to simplify the procedure
and hasten the funding.

992
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:02,899
However, one of them

993
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,140
offers an unreasonable price.

994
00:40:05,659 --> 00:40:08,459
They undervalue our company by 30 percent,

995
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,899
which 15 percentage points

996
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,499
less than our lowest budget.

997
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:14,580
What about another company?

998
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,739
They offer a more reasonable price.

999
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,100
On top of that,

1000
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,179
it can be increased
by 3 to 5 percentage points.

1001
00:40:21,699 --> 00:40:22,899
We may need to negotiate specific terms.

1002
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:25,580
Why hesitate, then?

1003
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,100
We'll go with this company.

1004
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,820
But they have requirements.

1005
00:40:30,899 --> 00:40:32,140
They demand that our company

1006
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,580
must triumph among other companies

1007
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,100
and remain on top.

1008
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,340
They have also proposed two suggestions.

1009
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,459
If we can satisfy that and agree,

1010
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,459
they'll cut short or even skip due diligence

1011
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,459
and offer us the fund
as fast as possible.

1012
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:50,499
Would there be any problem with this?

1013
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,300
After all, they're willing

1014
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:53,699
to give up on such crucial procedures,

1015
00:40:53,939 --> 00:40:56,419
and more, the price is enticing.

1016
00:40:56,739 --> 00:40:58,380
You're right, Mr. Luo.

1017
00:40:58,899 --> 00:41:00,219
I have that concern too.

1018
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:01,060
Chairman.

1019
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:02,459
Mr. Luo is right.

1020
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,939
Let's be patient

1021
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,659
and look for some more companies

1022
00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:07,620
and compare them.

1023
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,259
Luo.

1024
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:15,620
I know the company can offer a good price

1025
00:41:15,899 --> 00:41:17,659
and with preconditions for investment.

1026
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,659
We should listen to Mu'en

1027
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,860
about the specific situation.

1028
00:41:23,659 --> 00:41:24,140
Chairman.

1029
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:28,020
That company demands that we could
triumph in the industry

1030
00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:29,300
and remain on top.

1031
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,780
Specifically, they have two requests.

1032
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:35,860
Firstly, live streamers and e-commerce platforms
we collaborated with

1033
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,100
must undergo exclusivity

1034
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,580
or choose one of two options.

1035
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,659
The second demand

1036
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,300
is to alter the algorithm.

1037
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
Use big data to locate regular users
and charge them with higher prices.

1038
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,140
Chairman.

1039
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:18,219
I think that's radical

1040
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,820
and I worry that may cause unnecessary trouble.

1041
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:22,699
However...

1042
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:25,020
Considering the cooperate's compliance,

1043
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,699
it involves a big risk.

1044
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:28,939
I know what you're talking about.

1045
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,739
But now I'm torn between.

1046
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:33,100
Though I'm the CEO,

1047
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:35,540
I can't make the decision myself.

1048
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,300
Collaborate with them.
