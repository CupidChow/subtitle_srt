Ying.

16
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,371
My name is Liang Ying.

17
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:54,771
Liang Ying,

18
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:57,250
your husband.

19
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,011
The one with the last name Guo.

20
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:01,971
Why did he beat you?

21
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:04,771
Do you really want to hear it from me?

22
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:08,090
I want you to tell me.

23
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:10,370
Fine.

24
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,650
I'll tell you.

25
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:15,971
It's simple.

26
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,090
Because I'm a deceitful person
who sells sex appeal.

27
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:22,851
I am an immoral person

28
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,650
who extorts money
by flirting with men online.

29
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,291
That's enough.

30
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,530
You wanted to know, right?

31
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,051
Actually, I don't hate him one bit.

32
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:36,571
No man can stand it
when their wives work

33
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:38,170
in such a profession.

34
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,890
I don't want to know any more.
So please stop.

35
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,971
I admit every accusation
he throws at me.

36
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:43,131
He's right.

37
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,411
I should be grateful that a man like him
is willing to accept

38
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,491
a woman like me.

39
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,810
I said I don't want to know anymore!

40
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:52,571
So stop talking about it!

41
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:54,170
I am immoral.

42
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,691
This is my life.

43
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,971
Do you think you can get me out of this?

44
00:03:03,931 --> 00:03:04,730
Liang Ying,

45
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:06,971
you're not inferior.

46
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,491
Nor are you immoral.

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,771
You were not born to do this.

48
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,051
You can still choose.

49
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:13,971
End your relationship with him.

50
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:15,610
I don't have any other choice.

51
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:18,771
If I don't stay with him,

52
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,291
could I stay with you instead?

53
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:34,291
Are you willing to accept me?

54
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,971
You're not like me.

55
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,010
You shouldn't do this.

56
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:48,090
The one with choices is you.

57
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:02,010
Today, the main force has arrived.

58
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,691
They're staying at the Summer Hotel.

59
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:04,931
The conditions are better there.

60
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,170
Should we move there?

61
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,370
Moreover, the most important thing

62
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,971
is that there are no wiretaps
in their rooms.

63
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:12,010
I'm not moving.

64
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,771
I'm used to working here.

65
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:15,650
Besides, this place
is closer to the slums.

66
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,291
The slums?

67
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:17,530
Yes.

68
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:19,050
Why do you want to go there?

69
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:19,810
Oh,

70
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:22,530
I forgot to tell you that we met

71
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,650
the former chairman
of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Wang.

72
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,770
Mr. Wang shared some information

73
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,891
about the Qian Tianxin criminal group.

74
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,330
Among them are two brothers,

75
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:30,691
one named Li Guoxun

76
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:31,971
and the other named Li Guoquan.

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,050
They used to work under Chairman Wang

78
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,650
as network supervisors.

79
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,451
But after Mr. Wang went bankrupt,

80
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,691
they work for another new employer,

81
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,210
Qian Tianxin.

82
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,810
They also helped Qian Tianxin

83
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,210
set up a private server.

84
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:44,291
But they found out

85
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,210
that Qian Tianxin was using
this server for fraud.

86
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,370
So they fled.

87
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,530
I suspect that  Li Guoxun

88
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,131
has already been located
by Qian Tianxin.

89
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,330
There's still Li Guoquan remaining.

90
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:54,411
We need to find him as soon as possible.

91
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,090
It's said that he is hiding
in the slum area.

92
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,971
He's a crucial witness

93
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:59,090
to Qian Tianxin's transnational
cybercrime organization

94
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,090
and may have some key evidence.

95
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,090
Whether we can extradite
Qian Tianxin to the country

96
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,330
depends on him.

97
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,810
Are you listening to me?

98
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,691
Qian Tianxin seems
to be quite enthusiastic about charity.

99
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,490
Today, she is hosting a charity dinner

100
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,571
and will be giving a speech.

101
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,930
Despite causing great harm

102
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,810
to many people in the country,

103
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:24,451
she has come here
to portray herself as a philanthropist.

104
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,090
Why do you think those people
listen to her?

105
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:29,851
Is it because she has a few bodyguards?

106
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,930
No. It's because she's willing
to spend money

107
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,411
and has connections with people
from all walks of life.

108
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,770
Everyone thinks highly of her.

109
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:37,770
So they're not following her orders.

110
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,930
But they're helping her willingly.

111
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,370
So do you know
how powerful our opponent is now?

112
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:45,770
So I suggest you
don't go to the slum area.

113
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,891
Compared to a prosecutor from abroad,

114
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:49,291
they rather believe

115
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,770
in their money-saving savior.

116
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,891
After hearing all this,

117
00:05:57,131 --> 00:05:59,250
I actually want to see this savior
with my own eyes.

118
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:00,891
Try and get me in.

119
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,971
Are you out of your mind?

120
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,571
This is very dangerous.

121
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,171
Even if I manage to get
an invitation for you to attend it,

122
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,411
what can you do after going in?

123
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,571
I know I can't do anything to her there.

124
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,571
But I'd like to see

125
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,571
how she managed to do all of this.

126
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:18,291
I also want those in the dark
to understand

127
00:06:18,851 --> 00:06:21,171
that no matter how glamorous
she may appear in front of everyone,

128
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,490
the law will eventually
expose her true nature.

129
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:57,930
Boss!

130
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:58,810
One beer!

131
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,770
Mister, here's your beer.

132
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:21,530
I don't recall us being friends.

133
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,571
Officer Jose, you see,

134
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:29,330
we're both police officers and detectives.

135
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:30,971
Isn't this fate?

136
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,291
I know why you're waiting for me here.

137
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,650
But you guys won't make it.

138
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,650
You're not the first group of

139
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,210
Chinese law enforcement personnel
to deal with her.

140
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,650
But I'm sure you guys won't be the last.

141
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,011
I'm tired of failures.

142
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,770
I'm the police officer
with the highest crime-solving rate.

143
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,891
Do you know

144
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,891
why am I still just a senior inspector
after all this time?

145
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,851
You overthink.

146
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:54,891
I came to see you today

147
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,370
to ask you to help me
get two admission tickets

148
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,090
to Qian Tianxin's charity dinner.

149
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:01,490
Are you crazy?

150
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,011
Do you know what she's capable of?

151
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:04,971
You guys will die.

152
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,770
I know you don't believe

153
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:11,171
that we can accomplish this.

154
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:11,971
You don't believe it.

155
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:13,250
Your colleagues don't believe it too.

156
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,810
Those who could stand up

157
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,851
and testify against Qian Tianxin
don't believe it too.

158
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,370
So we need to give you confidence

159
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:21,770
and make you believe

160
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:23,490
that we can accomplish this matter.

161
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:45,650
Fine.

162
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,731
You'll regret it.

163
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,890
We'll just have to wait and see.

164
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:05,851
So it's 378...

165
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,051
Where did this come from?

166
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,130
This isn't mine.

167
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,330
(Qian Tianxin, you must be surprised.)

168
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,971
(This is the same experience)

169
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:30,611
(you gave me back then.)

170
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:34,130
(You plotted against me
and took everything from me.)

171
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,010
(My wealth, my status,)

172
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,570
(and even my family.)

173
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,090
Are you okay?

174
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,010
You fell into the pool just now,
didn't you?

175
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:10,690
Are you okay?

176
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:13,731
I'm fine.

177
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,851
Well...

178
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:16,090
I missed a step.

179
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:17,890
Missed a step.

180
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:19,731
Did you drink?

181
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:22,090
Why would you drink at this time?

182
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,890
Don't you know how many people
are watching you right now?

183
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:26,530
Who?

184
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,371
Didn't you tell...

185
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:30,690
I went to get these.

186
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:31,731
- Listen...
- What is it?

187
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,650
The admission tickets.

188
00:10:34,731 --> 00:10:35,330
Jose...

189
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,130
Jose can't outdrink me.

190
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,491
The cops here can't outdrink police
from China.

191
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,330
You got the tickets?

192
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:45,130
He...

193
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:45,371
He...

194
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,971
He may be bad at drinking.

195
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,731
But he's still efficient.

196
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:51,690
He used an excuse and snatched it

197
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:52,491
from a business owner.

198
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,570
He snatched one from a business owner.

199
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:00,731
Do you feel sick?

200
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,171
I'll go with you.

201
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:02,411
I...

202
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:02,690
I...

203
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,931
I need to take a shower first.

204
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:05,130
Wait for me.

205
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:06,330
Let me help you.

206
00:11:06,371 --> 00:11:06,971
No need.

207
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:08,090
I'm going to take a shower.

208
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,371
(Bring Hope To Riverrun Slums
Charity Dinner)

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,300
Thanks.

210
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:47,971
This is Ms. Qian.

211
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,330
She has donated five million

212
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,251
for tonight's charity event
for the slums area.

213
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,731
Nice to meet you.

214
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,371
Nice to meet you too.

215
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:54,971
Hello.

216
00:11:55,971 --> 00:11:56,971
Nice to meet you.

217
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:58,210
Thank you.

218
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,530
Thank you for your efforts in helping
the children in the slums

219
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,811
who suffer from hunger and cold.

220
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,330
May god bless you.

221
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:06,570
It's the least I can do.

222
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,371
To be honest,

223
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:10,411
I've experienced hardship
and poverty too.

224
00:12:10,851 --> 00:12:13,890
So I can empathize with
the suffering of these children.

225
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,890
I also hope to
have more opportunities in the future

226
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,931
so I can do more for them.

227
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,811
We always welcome entrepreneurs

228
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,851
with a conscience like you.

229
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:25,210
Ms. Qian, Sanjiang Daily

230
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,690
has awarded you with the title
of Charity Star of Sanjiang.

231
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:32,010
Their reporters hope
you would spare some time

232
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,130
for some photos.

233
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,811
Would you mind?

234
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:36,010
Not at all.

235
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:36,971
I'd be glad to.

236
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,130
Come. Let's take a group photo together.

237
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,251
Ms. Qian. As a Chinese citizen,
why are you so passionate

238
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,491
about charity work in Country F?

239
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:50,051
Could you please share your thoughts?

240
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,450
The whole city of Sanjiang

241
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,171
is talking about your generosity
and kindness.

242
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,971
But some people accuse you
of having unclear sources of wealth.

243
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:02,811
On live camera,
how would you like to respond to them?

244
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,731
Ms. Qian, would you like
to share your thoughts?

245
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,051
First of all,

246
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,371
I want to thank you for your attention
and enthusiasm towards me.

247
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,491
I can answer each of your questions.

248
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,811
As a Chinese person,

249
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:15,450
many people may wonder

250
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:18,210
why I'm so focused on charity work
in Country F.

251
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,650
So they would doubt my motives.

252
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:25,010
Some even have prejudiced
and malicious assumptions,

253
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,090
thinking that I'm only doing this
to please the government

254
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,770
and collude with certain individuals.

255
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,971
As for the reason,
it's some unspeakable purposes.

256
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:36,491
To be honest, I've recently heard

257
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:40,371
some unfounded rumors that
our company's profits

258
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,450
come from criminal activities.

259
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,570
Here, I want to clarify

260
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:47,051
that our company operates strictly

261
00:13:47,051 --> 00:13:49,650
under the laws of Country F.

262
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:51,411
Please take a look

263
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,450
at our company's promotional video.

264
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,811
(Qian Tianxin, you must be surprised.)

265
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,330
(This is the same experience)

266
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,051
(you gave me back then.)

267
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:07,411
(You plotted against me
and took everything from me.)

268
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,251
(My wealth, my status,)

269
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,650
(and even my family.)

270
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,090
(You used my land and property
as your stepping stone)

271
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,371
(to engage in outrageous
and deceitful acts.)

272
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:22,051
(Shameless and deceptive
are what best describe your company.)

273
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,130
(But you don't be too proud.)

274
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,530
(Now, I'm the first one to stand up.)

275
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:32,051
(I believe there will be many more people
you don't want to see)

276
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,731
(will stand up one by one, just like me.)

277
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:37,291
(Qian Tianxin,
your retribution is coming.)

278
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,090
Who did this?

279
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:40,491
I don't know.

280
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:45,530
What's going on,

281
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:45,851
Wei?

282
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,411
Xin, the footage was recorded earlier.

283
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,570
The person wasn't found.

284
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,971
We also received news from home

285
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:56,650
that two people escaped yesterday.

286
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,770
A new online host and Zhang Xiaobei
from the domestic business department.

287
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,171
Over here, people came knocking
giving us trouble.

288
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,051
Over there some escaped.

289
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:06,611
It happens one after the other.

290
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:07,890
It's just too coincidental.

291
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,411
I haven't even been
the Charity Star of Sanjiang

292
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,130
for twenty minutes.

293
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,090
I'm afraid I'll lose the title now.

294
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,650
Xin, I'm sorry.

295
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:20,611
It's my fault.

296
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:22,731
Don't worry.

297
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,971
I'll go and teach them a lesson.

298
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:39,130
Who permitted you to do this?

299
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,210
Have you thought of the consequences?

300
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,890
Do you know that right
after the commotion you created,

301
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,130
someone attacked the task force's base
with two Molotov cocktails?

302
00:15:47,851 --> 00:15:49,171
Today, it's two Molotov cocktails.

303
00:15:49,371 --> 00:15:50,450
What will they throw next?

304
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,210
(I can't even imagine.)

305
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,811
Prosecutor Guo,

306
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,210
if I want the victims and
witnesses to come forward,

307
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,570
I must make them believe that
we're serious about this case.

308
00:15:59,851 --> 00:16:01,130
If we remain low-key,

309
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,130
silent, and restrained

310
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:05,931
in the face of such a powerful figure
like Qian Tianxin,

311
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,251
how can they believe that
we're sincerely pursuing the case

312
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:09,731
and capable of bringing her down?

313
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,130
I don't want to hear any excuses.

314
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,130
(So tell me, is there any effect
after all this commotion?)

315
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:16,690
(Has anyone come forward?)

316
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,770
Ever since you disclosed
the contact number of the task force,

317
00:16:18,971 --> 00:16:20,051
we've been receiving nothing

318
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,330
but threats and abuses
within this past hour.

319
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,291
Do you realize how much trouble
you've caused for the task force?

320
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:28,570
Stay on the line.

321
00:16:28,611 --> 00:16:30,411
It might be another complaint
from the task force.

322
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:33,611
Hello?

323
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,210
Yes, speaking.

324
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,090
(You guys must have a hard time.)

325
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:42,650
Really?

326
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:45,090
How about this?

327
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:45,570
Wait, I...

328
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,890
I'm on the phone
with An Ni at the moment.

329
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:47,931
I'll inform her right away.

330
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:50,010
Okay, sure.

331
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,811
An Ni. The task force

332
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:55,650
just received a call from their hotline.

333
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,811
The caller is Li Guoquan.

334
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:00,731
He requested to speak directly
to a prosecutor from China.

335
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,291
Prosecutor Guo,

336
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,971
did you just say Li Guoquan?

337
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,090
Please give him
my contact information immediately.

338
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,330
I need to speak to him.

339
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,851
Miss Prosecutor,

340
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,011
I watched the live broadcast last night.

341
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,410
You're quite lucky.

342
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,651
(An Ni)

343
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:19,611
I believe you have the guts.

344
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,930
But you guys were pretty reckless
in your actions.

345
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:26,410
How can I trust that you guys are capable

346
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,531
of preventing history from repeating itself

347
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,210
and me from sharing the same fate

348
00:17:30,251 --> 00:17:31,810
as my brother, Guoxun?

349
00:17:32,371 --> 00:17:33,971
I don't have time to joke around with you.

350
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,090
If you want evidence,

351
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:43,090
Money must be needed.

352
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,851
No money, no evidence.

353
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,050
And also,
you have to come here in person.

354
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,930
Alone.

355
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:16,170
You're becoming more
and more unreasonable.

356
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,090
What do you take this place for?

357
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,611
Your security department?

358
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:23,131
There's an old Chinese saying,

359
00:18:23,651 --> 00:18:25,090
"When a person leaves,
the tea gets cold."

360
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:27,531
I'm still here,

361
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,371
and you're already trying
to distance yourself from me.

362
00:18:30,011 --> 00:18:31,090
Senior Inspector Semones,

363
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:33,810
this is making me quite sad.

364
00:18:34,131 --> 00:18:36,131
This is a police station.

365
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:37,771
It's not a place

366
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:40,011
where you can come
and give orders as you please.

367
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:43,930
But that wasn't what you said

368
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,131
when you were on vacation in Boracay

369
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,771
with my online hostess last month.

370
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:50,810
Listen here.

371
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,731
Last night's incident
has already caused quite a stir.

372
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:58,050
Ms. Qian, China's Ministry of Justice

373
00:18:58,131 --> 00:19:00,290
is serious about taking you down.

374
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,410
There's nothing I can do
to help you now.

375
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:08,891
But I'm not here to ask for help.

376
00:19:09,011 --> 00:19:11,011
I'm here to help you instead.

377
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,371
Take it back.

378
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,011
I don't need these.

379
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,371
It's not for you.

380
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,570
I'm giving it to Selena.

381
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:27,690
Say that again.

382
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,050
Your daughter, Selena.

383
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:32,531
It seems like she hasn't been doing well

384
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,450
in high school recently.

385
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:38,410
B+ in four subjects with only one A-.

386
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,851
At this rate, it'll be very difficult for her

387
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:43,971
to get into Ateneo De Manila University
she dreams of.

388
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:47,371
With the salary of a senior inspector,

389
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,170
you won't be able to cover the expenses

390
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:53,651
for the two singing girls you keep in
Yu City every month

391
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,131
if you hire a private tutor.

392
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,851
Right?

393
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:05,330
What exactly do you want to do?

394
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,011
It's simple.

395
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:12,011
An honest and upright police officer

396
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:14,410
with massive expenses like you

397
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,810
really needs a friend like me to help.

398
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:20,651
But not everyone wants

399
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:22,330
to be my friend.

400
00:20:23,011 --> 00:20:25,731
Some people can't wait to see me
make a fool of myself

401
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,891
and ruin my business.

402
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,531
If you want me to take care

403
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,290
of those investigators
from China for you,

404
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,371
that won't be easy.

405
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:48,170
Officer, don't worry.

406
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,210
As your friend, I would never

407
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,371
send a police officer to kill someone.

408
00:20:54,371 --> 00:20:59,210
I only hope you'll do your duties

409
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,810
and eliminate illegal residents
who are causing trouble.

410
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,651
This shouldn't be a problem, right?

411
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,330
All right.

412
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,251
I'll take care of it.

413
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,251
Thank you.

414
00:21:50,731 --> 00:21:52,210
Okay, that's how far you can follow me.

415
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:54,170
I'll let you know
if there's any situation.

416
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,651
Then be careful.

417
00:21:57,531 --> 00:21:59,651
If anything happens,
inform us right away.

418
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:02,611
Excuse me.

419
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,290
Is Li Guoquan staying here?

420
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:24,290
I'd like to know...

421
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,611
Is Li Guoquan here?

422
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:52,410
Hello.

423
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,371
We kept in touch previously.

424
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,450
I'm a prosecutor from
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate, An Ni.

425
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:00,210
Just take a sit anywhere.

426
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:05,491
It's okay.

427
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,371
I can stand.

428
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:08,450
Whatever you want.

429
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,050
Why...

430
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,011
Why are you staying in such a place?

431
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,851
Don't you have
any plans to go home?

432
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,050
Go home?

433
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,570
That's easy for you to say.

434
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:27,330
No one can escape
from Qian Tianxin's grasp.

435
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,531
Even if someone did,

436
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,611
they've confiscated all documents

437
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:34,491
and her informants are everywhere.

438
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,971
Where can I go?

439
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,531
I've been constantly on the run
and hiding all these years.

440
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:45,131
I survive by picking up scraps
from others

441
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,090
that I almost died from dysentery.

442
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:54,570
Do you see that geezer over there?

443
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,851
He's the number one beggar in Sanjiang.

444
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,851
He took me in and found a wife for me.

445
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:06,971
You can say I've repaid his kindness.

446
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:22,851
Actually,
the reason I wanted to reach you guys

447
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,731
is to talk about this matter.

448
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,651
As long as you provide me
with the evidence

449
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,450
of Qian Tianxin's criminal organization
that you have in your possession

450
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,971
and agree to testify in court,

451
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,450
I guarantee that I can help you return
to your previous life.

452
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,050
The life I had before?

453
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,011
You came too late.

454
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:47,450
I can never have
the normal life I had before.

455
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,371
Do you think

456
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,131
you're the first group
to come looking for me?

457
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:54,011
Do you know why
I've been unwilling to cooperate

458
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,491
with officials like you?

459
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:58,690
Yes, you'll capture Qian Tianxin

460
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,050
and take her to court.

461
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:03,290
But with a little manipulation,

462
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:05,170
she can regain her freedom.

463
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,891
You guys will be rewarded
for your achievements.

464
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,491
What about me?

465
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,851
Besides hiding like a rat,

466
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,611
covered in sores,

467
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,891
and being subjected to revenge,

468
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,731
what else do I gain?

469
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,330
Prosecutor An, please tell me.

470
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,371
Why should I risk my life

471
00:26:31,011 --> 00:26:32,810
and testify in court

472
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,290
for your official career?

473
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,011
Why should I?

474
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:45,090
We're also risking our lives

475
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,611
to travel all the way here
to rescue people of your circumstances.

476
00:26:47,771 --> 00:26:52,050
Many people like you
are still living the same life.

477
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:56,570
But no matter what, please believe me,

478
00:26:56,891 --> 00:27:00,090
believe in us,
believe in China's procuratorial organs.

479
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:02,251
We'll definitely keep our word.

480
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,611
Are you willing to believe me?

481
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:23,251
Prosecutor An,
there's something I want to tell you.

482
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:28,290
I have AIDS.

483
00:27:29,491 --> 00:27:31,330
My whole family has AIDS.

484
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:36,131
Are you still willing to shake my hand?

485
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,170
As long as you believe me, I'm willing.

486
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:13,410
Prosecutor An, help me.

487
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,611
I want to go home.

488
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:17,731
I know.

489
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,611
I want to go back.

490
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:22,570
Thank you for believing me.

491
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,330
Thank you for believing in us.

492
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,410
Everyone! Stay where you are!

493
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,531
Officers, arrest him. Cuff him.

494
00:28:54,131 --> 00:28:55,131
Why are you arresting him?

495
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:58,491
I know you're a prosecutor from China.

496
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:00,531
But this is Country F's official matter.

497
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,531
Take him away.

498
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,731
I knew I couldn't rely on you!

499
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,090
I knew I couldn't rely on you!

500
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:09,251
Leave us alone!

501
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,611
Leave us alone!

502
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:11,170
Leave us alone!

503
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,971
He Luyuan, where are you?

504
00:29:13,131 --> 00:29:14,090
Call Raphael immediately.

505
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,410
Contact the higher authorities
in the judiciary.

506
00:29:18,371 --> 00:29:19,570
Leave us alone!

507
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:21,450
Leave us alone!

508
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,731
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

509
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,131
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

510
00:29:31,651 --> 00:29:34,570
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

511
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,371
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

512
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,251
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

513
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,011
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

514
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:41,771
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

515
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:43,651
- Leave us alone!

516
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,170
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

517
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:46,611
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

518
00:29:47,131 --> 00:29:48,410
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

519
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:49,731
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

520
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,170
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

521
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:52,611
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

522
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,410
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

523
00:29:54,651 --> 00:29:55,651
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

524
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:57,371
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

525
00:29:57,731 --> 00:29:58,731
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

526
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,170
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

527
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:01,731
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

528
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:02,930
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

529
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,651
I didn't receive any task
to apprehend illegal residents.

530
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,371
I'm currently assigned to
prevent conflicts

531
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,611
between the impoverished and the police.

532
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:23,651
- Leave us alone!
- Leave us alone!

533
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,251
Report the situation now!

534
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,050
Mr. Zhao?

535
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:44,371
It's really you.

536
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,330
What a coincidence.

537
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:47,731
What are you doing here?

538
00:30:48,531 --> 00:30:50,930
I'm going to Country F for a few days.

539
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:51,731
What about you?

540
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:52,651
Where are you going?

541
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,690
Just traveling around and taking a break.

542
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:57,531
Let me help you carry it.

543
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,410
It's okay.

544
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:06,210
In March 2017,
my brother Li Guoxun and I

545
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:09,050
were recommended by Mr. Wang,

546
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,290
to assemble and
set up servers for Qian Tianxin.

547
00:31:13,611 --> 00:31:16,330
We also designed
a complete account system,

548
00:31:16,651 --> 00:31:18,570
framework, and database for her.

549
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,810
Later on, we discovered
that Qian Tianxin intended

550
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,851
to use this private server

551
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,651
to bypass legal regulations

552
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,410
and engage in illegal online gambling,

553
00:31:29,851 --> 00:31:33,251
online loans,
and money laundering activities.

554
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,851
And...

555
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:39,050
And the flow of funds
was extremely significant.

556
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:41,570
So we decided
to distance ourselves from her

557
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,651
and surrender ourselves
to the authorities.

558
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:47,690
We didn't expect she found out

559
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,690
about our plans in advance

560
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,410
and tried to silence us
by sending people after us.

561
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,210
Over these years,

562
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,410
we've been hiding and moving
from place to place.

563
00:32:01,131 --> 00:32:03,050
This is my first time leaving the slums

564
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,851
and sitting here.

565
00:32:06,651 --> 00:32:09,011
Mr. Jose, can you ask Li Guoquan

566
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:12,651
if he's willing to provide information
on gambling participants, agents,

567
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:13,131
gambling funds,

568
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,531
and data regarding the illegal funds?

569
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,251
Can you do that, Li Guoquan?

570
00:32:21,611 --> 00:32:22,410
No.

571
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:27,330
Qian Tianxin specifically
hired other hackers

572
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:30,251
to design an active
defense system for the server,

573
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:32,611
making it difficult to
breach from the outside.

574
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,210
But as long as I can access the server,

575
00:32:37,131 --> 00:32:39,410
I can retrieve all the data.

576
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,450
These pieces of evidence

577
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:44,651
are enough to put Qian Tianxin
behind bars for several lifetimes.

578
00:32:47,851 --> 00:32:48,891
Thank you so much.

579
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,570
Don't thank me yet.

580
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,290
This matter is not over.

581
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,290
Your priority is to coordinate

582
00:32:54,491 --> 00:32:56,851
with your country's judicial department

583
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,050
to liaise with our higher-level
police department

584
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:00,170
to issue a search warrant.

585
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:01,371
Only then can we go

586
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:03,450
and inspect their servers
at their premises.

587
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,011
We need to act quickly because any delay

588
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,330
could lead to unforeseen consequences,
and we might lose everything.

589
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:09,330
I'll immediately contact
Prosecutor Guo and the others.

590
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,131
Why do you look so worried?

591
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,651
We finally see a glimmer of hope,
don't we?

592
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:18,011
I have a feeling
this is just the beginning.

593
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:42,651
You're up?

594
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,450
Sleep some more.

595
00:33:45,531 --> 00:33:47,011
The embassy is not open yet.

596
00:33:48,531 --> 00:33:50,330
I'm a little hungry.

597
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,371
I'll go and get you something to eat.

598
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:27,731
(This is Sanjiang City
Chinese Radio Station.)

599
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,331
(I'm your host, Tina.)

600
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:31,531
(Yesterday,
an incident occurred at a charity dinner,)

601
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,610
(which caused quite a stir)

602
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,650
(within the local Chinese community
in Sanjiang City.)

603
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,971
(Prominent Chinese businesswoman
Qian Tianxin,)

604
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:40,091
(during an interview with
a television reporter,)

605
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,971
(unexpectedly revealed a video exposing)

606
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:42,850
(the internal workings of her company,)

607
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,690
(alleging that her substantial income)

608
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,130
(comes from criminal activities.)

609
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:47,610
(Less than half an hour later,)

610
00:34:47,971 --> 00:34:49,331
(the Holiday Inn where
the Chinese task force)

611
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:50,731
(was said to be staying)

612
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:52,370
(was targeted in
a Molotov cocktail attack)

613
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,410
(by unidentified individuals.)

614
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,690
(Fortunately, no casualties
or property damage were reported.)

615
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,130
(Currently, it remains unclear)

616
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,571
(whether these two incidents are related.)

617
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,091
Let me go!

618
00:35:17,971 --> 00:35:18,771
Let me go!

619
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,690
You sure have the nerve.

620
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,650
Do you think you can escape?

621
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:28,971
Where's Zhang Xiaobei?

622
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:30,690
I don't know any Zhang Xiaobei.

623
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:32,971
Take her away.

624
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,340
(Don't let her suffer for you.)

625
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,210
Good morning.

626
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,130
Good morning.

627
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,251
Stop with your useless acts!

628
00:36:16,571 --> 00:36:17,930
Do you know
how many police officers were mobilized

629
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,130
and how long
we've been searching for you

630
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,450
because of your suicide attempt?

631
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,811
Your father went on a hunger strike.

632
00:36:22,811 --> 00:36:23,491
If it weren't for An Ni,

633
00:36:23,571 --> 00:36:24,971
we wouldn't even know
if he'd be alive or dead.

634
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:25,890
Luyuan!

635
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,091
I'm sorry.

636
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,850
I'm really sorry.

637
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,370
But I'm begging you.

638
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,450
Can you save Ying?

639
00:36:32,811 --> 00:36:33,930
Who's Ying?

640
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,291
My woman.

641
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:37,091
I can't believe you have a woman.

642
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,491
Who is she?

643
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:40,410
We were both tricked
and brought here together.

644
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:44,130
Get up and speak!

645
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:44,771
No!

646
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,130
I said get up!

647
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:46,890
Don't do this.

648
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,410
What's wrong with you?

649
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:47,971
I won't get up!

650
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:50,210
If you don't save her, I won't get up.

651
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,331
He Luyuan, calm down.

652
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,610
Get up, Xiaobei.

653
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,450
Get up.

654
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:55,890
Get up and explain.

655
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:56,690
Come on.

656
00:36:56,771 --> 00:36:57,771
Get up, okay?

657
00:36:57,811 --> 00:36:58,410
Come on.

658
00:36:58,731 --> 00:36:59,251
Come.

659
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,370
Sit down.

660
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,331
What do you think you were doing?

661
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:06,930
You even did a live stream.

662
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:09,051
Do you know how many people
have you implicated?

663
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,610
Aren't we here to save people?

664
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:17,731
But we're in a foreign country.

665
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:19,210
We don't have jurisdiction here.

666
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,051
When it comes
to arresting or rescuing people,

667
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:21,850
it has to be done
by the local authorities.

668
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:23,571
Don't worry. Just leave

669
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,410
the person called Ying to us.

670
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:26,410
Now, tell me.

671
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,091
How did you manage to come here?

672
00:37:29,731 --> 00:37:31,410
Xiaobei, how about this?

673
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:33,650
Why don't you go to the hotel
where the main force is?

674
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,091
It's not safe here,

675
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,291
since you're an important witness
in this case.

676
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,410
Later, Ling will take you there.

677
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:39,971
Is that okay?

678
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:40,731
Okay.

679
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:42,091
Are you done talking?

680
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:43,811
Tell me.

681
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:45,650
How did you come here?

682
00:37:45,771 --> 00:37:46,491
That's enough.

683
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:47,571
I'm just beating my brother up.

684
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,331
He's not a suspect or a victim.

685
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,170
Just calm down.

686
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,091
Xiaobei, here.

687
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:00,491
Have something to eat.

688
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,091
Take your time to eat.

689
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,650
You can talk about it later.

690
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,491
Let's go into the room.

691
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:08,291
Come.

692
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,410
Eat slowly, don't choke yourself.

693
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,690
I'll go and get the car ready with Ling.

694
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,531
Xiaobei, eat slowly and eat more.

695
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,771
The local police have already refused

696
00:38:53,811 --> 00:38:55,210
to search Qian Tianxin's company.

697
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,251
and the Gambling Commission

698
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,850
has issued a warning to them.

699
00:38:57,971 --> 00:38:59,690
Do you know how influential

700
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,971
the Gambling Commission is in this area?

701
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:03,130
It's not for them to decide
whether or not to search.

702
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:05,571
They're allowing Qian Tianxin
to continue her wrongdoing.

703
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:08,170
Just look at what
Zhang Xiaobei had to go through.

704
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:11,890
Can't Li Guoquan's testimony
prove anything?

705
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:12,890
Stay calm.

706
00:39:12,971 --> 00:39:14,491
I've checked the local laws and regulations

707
00:39:14,571 --> 00:39:16,170
and consulted
the immigration bureau and embassy.

708
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:18,811
They all said that
what they're doing is indeed legal.

709
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:21,610
The Gambling Commission
has no authority

710
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,930
to interfere with this company

711
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:24,011
and its business activities

712
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:25,091
as long as they have their license.

713
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:27,731
Even if Li Guoquan presents
solid evidence now,

714
00:39:27,771 --> 00:39:29,571
we have no way to
search Qian Tianxin's company.

715
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:32,130
Unless we have other criminal evidence.

716
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,370
We have Zhang Xiaobei

717
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,011
and Li Guoquan as eyewitnesses.

718
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:38,571
That won't work.

719
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,091
They need other criminal evidence.

720
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,610
Relying solely on the testimony of
these two individuals

721
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,051
is not enough to convince
the Gambling Commission

722
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:45,731
to revoke Qian Tianxin's license.

723
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,890
What we need now is evidence.

724
00:40:26,571 --> 00:40:28,850
Mister, are you a tourist from China?

725
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:31,251
How about taking a ride with us
to go diving on the island?

726
00:40:31,291 --> 00:40:33,210
I just want to watch the sunrise
on the beach.

727
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:34,930
It'll be cloudy tomorrow.

728
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:36,811
You won't be able
to see the sunrise on the beach.

729
00:40:38,571 --> 00:40:39,170
All right, then.

730
00:40:39,491 --> 00:40:40,331
Take me to the island.

731
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,890
Our ride is over here.

732
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:42,771
Please come with me.

733
00:41:00,571 --> 00:41:02,011
Please get into the vehicle.

734
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,930
Long time no see.

735
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,450
On the way here,

736
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,971
I thought of a hundred ways to meet you.

737
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,850
Each one was prepared for a quarrel.

738
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,291
But now that we've finally met,

739
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:26,450
I don't even have the desire to argue.

740
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:31,370
You're so good at
playing with people's hearts.

741
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,291
I once played with
the hearts of a hundred men.

742
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,210
But you're the only one
I never played with.

743
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,850
Those men were just my tools.

744
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:50,850
But you...

745
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,210
I'm your tool.

746
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,731
No, you're my special existence.

747
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:01,051
Honestly, I once thought about it.

748
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,771
What if we each went our separate ways

749
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,331
and lived our own lives?

750
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,850
But like an obsession, I can't do it.

751
00:42:12,971 --> 00:42:14,210
I can't escape.

752
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,410
I can't let go too.

753
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,971
Did you say the same thing to "A?"

754
00:42:20,531 --> 00:42:22,291
Why are you so devoted to him?

755
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:23,971
Why are you still unwilling

756
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,011
to destroy the evidence
and leave this place at this point?

757
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,370
Why?

758
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,811
Why do you always bring him up
every time we meet?

759
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:32,491
Why do you have to turn

760
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:34,011
a happy occasion into a sad one?

761
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,251
If you really want to know the reason,
I'll tell you.

762
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,850
Because he is right.

763
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,930
Without him, we're nothing if we leave.

764
00:42:41,571 --> 00:42:42,370
Do you understand?

765
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:44,170
When you are brought back
to the country for trial

766
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,690
by An Ni and the others,

767
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,850
when you are imprisoned
in the most secure detention center,

768
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,811
you'll see with your own eyes
how he gradually betrays us.
