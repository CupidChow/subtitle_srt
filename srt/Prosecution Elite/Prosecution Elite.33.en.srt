If only I didn't drink.

If only I didn't wore revealing outfits.

17
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:50,542
Maybe I wouldn't be targeted
if I didn't do so.

18
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:55,823
And, you won't end up like this.

Everything is destined.

20
00:02:09,582 --> 00:02:11,222
I was usually the drunk one.

21
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:14,222
I didn't drink today.

22
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:17,422
And, someone was trying to bully you.

23
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:19,903
Of course I had to intervene.

24
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,422
But you shouldn't suffer because of it.

25
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:26,903
That's wrong!

26
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:29,142
Ling.

27
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:30,942
I...

28
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:33,743
I feel guilty about it.

29
00:02:34,983 --> 00:02:36,662
Now,

30
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:41,103
there's no way for me
to atone for my mistake!

31
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,383
There's no way!

32
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:46,103
I know you're nice to Siyue.

33
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:49,983
You protected him
whenever I gave him a beating.

34
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:53,502
Because of that,

35
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,142
I cannot afford to
let anything happen to you.

36
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:10,302
Ling!

37
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:13,862
Ling?

38
00:03:21,862 --> 00:03:22,502
Siyue?

39
00:03:24,383 --> 00:03:25,942
- Xin.
- Siyue?

40
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:27,383
Stop knocking.

41
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:28,623
She left.

42
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:30,422
She left together with her son.

43
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:32,463
They didn't pack their stuff.

44
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:35,263
They left the rest of their belongings to me.

45
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:36,302
They left?

46
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,662
How could they leave just like that?

47
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,903
It's been over a week since they left.

48
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:46,662
Just let her leave.

49
00:03:47,062 --> 00:03:48,383
This place is literally hell on Earth.

50
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,062
It's best for them to leave.

51
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,183
That's the best choice.

52
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:02,302
Look at you.

53
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:04,623
You left just like that.

54
00:04:07,702 --> 00:04:08,903
How can I return

55
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:12,662
the favor I've owed you?

56
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:15,302
Qian Tianxin.

57
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:17,783
Qian Tianxin?

58
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:25,063
I'll tell you the same thing.

59
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,343
There's nothing for me to tell you.

60
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:31,702
Fine.

61
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,663
I hope you can be as calm as you are

62
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:37,102
when the court announces your verdict.

63
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:39,023
Bring her back.

64
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:58,302
Ni,

65
00:04:59,262 --> 00:05:00,702
aren't we interrogating her

66
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:02,102
to inquire about Zhao Jikai?

67
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:04,343
Why didn't you mention his name at all?

68
00:05:05,743 --> 00:05:07,023
I've done my investigation.

69
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:08,822
There was no monetary transaction

70
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:10,542
between her and Zhao Jikai.

71
00:05:12,663 --> 00:05:14,623
Zhao Jikai only provided her with
the users' personal details

72
00:05:14,663 --> 00:05:15,663
for her to manipulate.

73
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:17,542
She intends to bear
full responsibility for it.

74
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:19,183
I wonder what kind of reaction
she'll have

75
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:21,663
if she finds out that Zhao Jikai
has turned himself in.

76
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:25,463
However, Zhao Jikai only
has limited clues.

77
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:28,142
If Qian Tianxin doesn't tell us
where the money had gone,

78
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:29,663
there's no way we can solve this case.

79
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:31,743
I know.

80
00:05:33,183 --> 00:05:34,183
I know it's difficult.

81
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:38,102
However, when the criminals
get their hands on the money,

82
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:40,343
it's literally impossible

83
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:42,582
to get them back.

84
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:44,663
And, there's only so much we can do.

85
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:47,822
Prosecution and convict them of their crime.

86
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:52,302
However, if we don't get back the money,

87
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:54,862
the victims won't be able to
accept reality.

88
00:05:55,142 --> 00:05:56,542
Sometimes, I wonder

89
00:05:57,463 --> 00:05:59,023
why we work so hard.

90
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:01,223
We can't get back the money.

91
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:03,623
So what if they were punished

92
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,023
because of their crimes?

93
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:08,223
Han Xuan,

94
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:10,862
we're working hard

95
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:13,343
so that the criminals know

96
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:15,542
that the law won't
allow them to get their way.

97
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,663
We'll definitely bring them to justice.

98
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,422
The harder we work, the better the result.

99
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:25,262
If so,

100
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,063
Ni, do you think Zhao Jikai knows

101
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:28,262
where the money had gone?

102
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,862
He has a special relationship
with Qian Tianxin after all.

103
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:33,382
We'll know in a second.

104
00:06:33,822 --> 00:06:34,302
Let's go.

105
00:07:00,142 --> 00:07:02,223
What else do you need me to say?

106
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,382
You're pretty straightforward.

107
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,582
I've already turned myself in.

108
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:08,142
Look at the state I'm in.

109
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:09,982
I have nothing to lose.

110
00:07:11,183 --> 00:07:11,663
Fine.

111
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:13,142
We'll cut to the chase.

112
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,023
Tell me where the money

113
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,582
Qian Tianxin had scammed people of
had gone to.

114
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:17,503
I don't know.

115
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,343
She didn't let me
participate in too much of it.

116
00:07:21,822 --> 00:07:22,623
You guys know this too.

117
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,223
Crime syndicates like these

118
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:25,582
only contact each other in one way.

119
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,343
We do things independently at the same time.

120
00:07:28,183 --> 00:07:29,663
She never tells me anything

121
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,463
that I'm not supposed to know.

122
00:07:32,943 --> 00:07:33,702
Zhao Jikai,

123
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:36,302
within the crime chain,

124
00:07:36,382 --> 00:07:38,582
your relationship with Qian Tianxin
was the tightest.

125
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:40,822
You're telling us that
she told you nothing?

126
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:41,822
Do you think we'll trust your words?

127
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:47,063
I know.

128
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,422
You're prejudiced against me.

129
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:51,102
No matter what I say or do,

130
00:07:51,463 --> 00:07:53,743
you'll think

131
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:56,822
that Qian Tianxin and I

132
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:59,783
have more than just an ordinary relationship.

133
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,262
You will never understand

134
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:02,982
our relationship.

135
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:04,943
You didn't experience

136
00:08:05,743 --> 00:08:07,542
any ordeals in your life.

137
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,463
Qian Tianxin and I

138
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:11,982
started from the bottom.

139
00:08:12,582 --> 00:08:13,903
We got to where we were by taking
one step at a time.

140
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:18,223
We've been through so much together.

141
00:08:19,183 --> 00:08:21,783
We depend on and trust each other.

142
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:23,623
None of us can be replaced.

143
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:26,822
I can even go as far as to say

144
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:30,623
that we can sacrifice ourselves
for each other.

145
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:34,983
If that's the case,

146
00:08:35,663 --> 00:08:37,582
why didn't you get together
with Qian Tianxin?

147
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:39,582
Why must you go
and flirt with Li Yitang?

148
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:43,582
You see, we mustn't be
too stubborn sometimes.

149
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:45,103
I know

150
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:49,343
that once I confirm my relationship
with Qian Tianxin,

151
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:52,502
we'll restrain

152
00:08:53,303 --> 00:08:54,182
and request things from each other.

153
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,182
That will be
the end of our relationship.

154
00:08:58,463 --> 00:08:59,863
Sometimes, one's relationship
can last longer

155
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,702
if it isn't based on love.

156
00:09:04,863 --> 00:09:05,423
And,

157
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,582
you said I flirted with Li Yitang.

158
00:09:08,262 --> 00:09:11,062
Can you be sure
who started the flirting first?

159
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:12,863
Must I be the one

160
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,382
who flirted with her first?

161
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,463
Don't stare at me like that.

162
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:20,863
I know you two are great friends.

163
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:24,463
You don't need to hate me.

164
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:27,023
You don't need to be hostile to me
because I'm your common enemy.

165
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:30,103
My relationship with Li Yitang was over.

166
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,023
To me,

167
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:34,663
Li Yitang was an unexpected occurrence.

168
00:09:35,463 --> 00:09:37,062
Your appearance in her life
was an unexpected occurrence too.

169
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:38,903
I can even go as far as to say

170
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,783
that your appearance
has tainted her life.

171
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,223
Tainted her life?

172
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:47,742
A relationship isn't as simple as you think.

173
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:51,983
Many people often fail due to their relationship.

174
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:53,942
You see, many things

175
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:58,942
are not within the realm of reasoning.

176
00:09:59,622 --> 00:10:01,622
And, there are no solutions to them.

177
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:04,262
Love arises without reason,

178
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,023
and deepens with each passing moment.

179
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:07,262
Love knows no reason,

180
00:10:07,702 --> 00:10:08,702
and remains unwavering until death.

181
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:11,702
After hearing that,

182
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:13,702
I feel sorry for Li Yitang.

183
00:10:14,382 --> 00:10:16,582
In front of you,
she has no EQ to speak of.

184
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:18,622
She has her own ideas.

185
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:21,942
And, she isn't as stupid as you say.

186
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,182
Let's forget about Li Yitang for now.

187
00:10:24,262 --> 00:10:26,023
She can deal with her own affairs.

188
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:28,343
According to the information we have,

189
00:10:28,622 --> 00:10:30,023
Qian Tianxin isn't A.

190
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:32,023
That's right.

191
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:34,303
Does that mean you know who A is?

192
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,142
I only know

193
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,783
that Qian Tianxin isn't A.

194
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:43,622
Zhao Jikai,

195
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,863
since we managed to crack

196
00:10:45,903 --> 00:10:47,582
this intricate crime syndicate,
which you're a part of,

197
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:50,062
we'll find out who A is eventually.

198
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:52,582
If you tell me his identity in advance,

199
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:54,343
at least you can win a chance

200
00:10:54,382 --> 00:10:55,903
to obtain leniency.

201
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:58,702
I've already told you enough.

202
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:00,822
Moreover, I truly have no idea.

203
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,742
Li Yitang always said

204
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:05,582
that you were very capable in your job.

205
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:09,423
I believe that the truth
will be revealed one day

206
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:11,863
as long as you're around.

207
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:18,262
You didn't tell us where the money went

208
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:19,863
or who A was.

209
00:11:20,702 --> 00:11:21,502
However,

210
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:24,423
your doings in Huiquan were premeditated.

211
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:26,582
You didn't do them on a whim, right?

212
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,463
I've told you everything
about the crimes I did.

213
00:11:33,783 --> 00:11:35,223
Answering you right now

214
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:39,223
will not change the severity of my sentence.

215
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:41,382
I have nothing to say.

216
00:11:47,463 --> 00:11:49,942
You're just as silly as Li Yitang.

217
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:54,103
It's no wonder you two are buddies.

218
00:11:55,023 --> 00:11:55,942
However,

219
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:59,262
your taste in men is inferior to her.

220
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,502
What do you mean by that?

221
00:12:04,062 --> 00:12:04,622
It's nothing.

222
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:06,742
I was just expressing my sentiment.

223
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:08,783
You're inexperienced

224
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:11,382
when it comes to relationships.

225
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:16,023
You still have a shallow understanding of men.

226
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:17,142
You're narrow-minded.

227
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:19,663
When it comes to this,

228
00:12:20,423 --> 00:12:23,062
you should truly learn from Li Yitang.

229
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,220
(Payee  Grand total)

230
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:44,783
I'm running out of ideas.

231
00:12:45,023 --> 00:12:46,423
My computer is dying on me.

232
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:48,182
I've analyzed and compared
all the suspicious data I have.

233
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:49,423
I couldn't find out
where the money went.

234
00:12:50,863 --> 00:12:51,983
What about Zhao Jikai?

235
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:54,023
Did you not obtain any
useful clues from him?

236
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:58,702
Seems like they can't find
a breakthrough point here.

237
00:12:58,742 --> 00:12:59,783
We can only depend on ourselves now.

238
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,663
But it's not like I didn't gain anything
out of my interrogation.

239
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,182
What's on your mind?

240
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:09,343
I do have something
that I'm suspicious about.

241
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:11,863
However, I cannot confirm my suspicion yet.

242
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:14,983
What about this?

243
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,622
Give me some time to
straighten out my thoughts.

244
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:18,622
I'll tell you guys
if I achieve any progress.

245
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:25,822
Did you find it?

246
00:13:26,023 --> 00:13:27,303
Look, I already...

247
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:28,863
Why don't you try another port?

248
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,543
I'm sure all of you know

249
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:36,423
(Luo Jingxiao)
that Professor Luo has left the company.

250
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:41,020
Here, I will make
an official announcement.

251
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,023
Professor Luo has indeed resigned from his post.

252
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,020
(Xiao Mu'en)

253
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:51,543
Everyone, pull yourself together.

254
00:13:52,742 --> 00:13:54,783
I have a piece of great news.

255
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:56,783
The investment we've attracted

256
00:13:56,983 --> 00:13:58,942
will be transferred
to our bank account soon.

257
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:01,783
The foreign investment group

258
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:02,942
that we had introduced to Mr. Xiao

259
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:05,702
has signed the agreement officially.

260
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:15,582
Mu'en, brief everyone about the situation.

261
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:16,983
Yes, Chairman.

262
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:18,262
Everyone,

263
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,983
due to Huibo's outstanding performance,

264
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:25,223
Huiquan Group has received the acknowledgment
of new investors.

265
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,702
And, they've signed
the investment agreement.

266
00:14:27,903 --> 00:14:29,702
Last time, I was lucky enough

267
00:14:29,742 --> 00:14:31,622
to attend the shareholder cum director
meeting together with Chairman.

268
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:33,382
The shareholders and directors

269
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,023
were very satisfied with the result.

270
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:36,863
They agreed and acknowledged

271
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:38,182
the joining of the new investments.

272
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:39,262
The new shareholder

273
00:14:39,622 --> 00:14:42,863
will become the second major shareholder
of our company.

274
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,702
I hope everyone can
keep up the good work

275
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:46,903
so that the company
can reach new heights.

276
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:53,663
Besides that,

277
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:54,942
I will use this opportunity

278
00:14:54,983 --> 00:14:56,382
to make another announcement.

279
00:14:56,622 --> 00:15:00,983
I've decided to transfer 5%
of my shares in Huiquan

280
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:04,582
to Mr. Xiao voluntarily as his reward.

281
00:15:05,343 --> 00:15:06,182
But Chairman...

282
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:07,742
Don't reject my request.

283
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,903
This is the acknowledgment

284
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:11,942
Huiquan Group gives toward
successful people.

285
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:14,303
We must be truthful in speech
and firm in action.

286
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:17,663
- Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.
- Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.

287
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:18,903
Thank you.

288
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:22,223
Mu'en,

289
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:26,023
you're my lucky star indeed.

290
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:27,382
Thank you, Chairman.

291
00:15:27,663 --> 00:15:28,502
Here.

292
00:15:29,903 --> 00:15:30,702
Let me offer you a toast.

293
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:31,663
You flatter me.

294
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,783
Chairman, I should
offer you a toast instead.

295
00:15:34,303 --> 00:15:34,863
No.

296
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,023
I have to offer you a toast first.

297
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,103
I'm not offering a toast to you solely
because of Huiquan.

298
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,262
I'm offering a toast to you
as thanks too.

299
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:42,702
Here.

300
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:43,463
Cheers.

301
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,382
May you stay healthy.

302
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:46,023
May we stay healthy.

303
00:15:53,903 --> 00:15:55,382
You can't hold your liquor well, huh?

304
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:56,182
Sorry about that.

305
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:57,942
I don't take baijiu often.

306
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,502
Mu'en,

307
00:16:00,182 --> 00:16:02,262
you're a great boy indeed.

308
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:05,343
It's just that your lifestyle
is too simple.

309
00:16:06,463 --> 00:16:07,262
Look at you.

310
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:10,223
Tea is the only beverage you take.

311
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:12,903
You don't smoke, drink,

312
00:16:13,103 --> 00:16:14,783
or have any bad habits.

313
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,502
Let me tell you something.

314
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:19,303
Not only do you need to excel in work,

315
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:21,582
but you also need to enjoy life.

316
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,423
Don't learn from me.

317
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,023
You'll regret it when you grow old.

318
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:29,903
Yes, Chairman.

319
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:32,783
Chairman, I'm sure you were a workaholic

320
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:34,502
when you were young.

321
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:38,062
You see,

322
00:16:38,903 --> 00:16:40,822
there's a reason
why people like me are successful.

323
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:44,463
I think you know that too.

324
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:46,702
You have to suffer the hardships
that other people cannot.

325
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:49,783
You have to endure things
that other people cannot.

326
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:52,262
You have to do things
that other people cannot.

327
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:53,142
Of course,

328
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:56,463
that doesn't mean we can
do things that are illegal, am I right?

329
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,783
After that, you'll be able

330
00:16:57,903 --> 00:17:00,023
to enjoy the success
that other people crave.

331
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:02,382
Chairman, you're right.

332
00:17:02,942 --> 00:17:03,822
If you desire something,

333
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,982
you should strive for it.

334
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:08,023
Chairman, I will keep it up.

335
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:08,502
Good.

336
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:25,183
Mu'en, I'm old now.

337
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:27,982
From now on,

338
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:30,063
the world will belong
to youngsters like you all.

339
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,982
Huiquan Company is a high-tech company.

340
00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:35,663
Now,

341
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:38,663
I'm building a modern
entrepreneurial management system.

342
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,342
I won't let that useless son of mine

343
00:17:42,063 --> 00:17:45,102
taint the reputation of my company.

344
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:47,342
However,

345
00:17:48,903 --> 00:17:50,423
I'm selfish to a certain extent.

346
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:54,342
I feel like I've let him down.

347
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,823
Even if he's not in Huiquan,

348
00:17:58,543 --> 00:18:02,703
he can still inherit my shares and my seat.

349
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:06,462
We have a deep affinity.

350
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:10,303
And, you're an outstanding employee too.

351
00:18:10,502 --> 00:18:14,783
That's why I want you to teach my son.

352
00:18:14,903 --> 00:18:17,102
I want my son to work beside you.

353
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:21,742
Teach him how to work.

354
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:28,023
Chairman, I'm incapable of that.

355
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:30,543
As the saying goes,
fathers know their sons best.

356
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:32,703
You're a veteran yourself.

357
00:18:32,742 --> 00:18:34,222
Why don't you teach him yourself?

358
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:40,462
He has a rebellious mentality.

359
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,462
The more I want him to do something,

360
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,183
the more he'll reject it.

361
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:47,862
I have no way to teach him.

362
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:50,783
How's your relationship
with your father?

363
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:54,262
It's pretty good.

364
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:55,502
Basically, he lets me do my own thing.

365
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:57,903
Chairman, I understand.

366
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,982
I will make arrangements for that.

367
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,943
If so, when do you plan
to send him to the company?

368
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:08,262
I haven't told him about it yet.

369
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:10,382
I need to discuss it with him first.

370
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:13,342
What about next week?

371
00:19:13,622 --> 00:19:14,183
Okay.

372
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:16,063
I will make arrangements for it.

373
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,622
Chairman, here's another toast to you.

374
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:18,783
To you.

375
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:19,423
Okay.

376
00:19:19,903 --> 00:19:20,262
Here.

377
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:22,622
Cheers.

378
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:43,462
Mister, we're here.

379
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:54,982
Mister, that's too much.

380
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:56,382
Keep the change.

381
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:57,222
Thank you, mister.

382
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,423
Dad,

383
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,703
you're still awake at this hour?

384
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,583
Are you suffering from insomnia again?

385
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:21,502
Enunciate your words properly.

386
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,102
Look at you.

387
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:30,063
You go out every day.

388
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:32,823
It's either you waste your time
with all those bad influences

389
00:20:33,423 --> 00:20:34,823
or you get yourself drunk.

390
00:20:35,742 --> 00:20:36,982
Look at the time.

391
00:20:38,703 --> 00:20:40,222
This won't do.

392
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,102
I know what you're going to say.

393
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:45,342
That's highly inappropriate of you.

394
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:50,583
But Dad, speaking of which,

395
00:20:51,342 --> 00:20:54,102
have you fulfilled
the duties of a father?

396
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:57,222
You only have feelings for your work.

397
00:20:58,462 --> 00:20:59,903
You don't feel anything for me.

398
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:01,982
What have you done for me

399
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,583
except for giving me money?

400
00:21:05,342 --> 00:21:07,703
What gives you the right
to criticize me?

401
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:10,222
How could you speak to me
in that manner?

402
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,023
Are you trying to drive me to my grave?

403
00:21:12,943 --> 00:21:14,663
Look at how the other youngsters

404
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:15,903
are striving to improve themselves.

405
00:21:16,903 --> 00:21:18,142
You were born with a great background.

406
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:19,982
Even so, you don't cherish it.

407
00:21:20,342 --> 00:21:21,502
No choice.

408
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:23,823
I was born lucky.

409
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:27,543
You have to be in charge of me
since you gave birth to me.

410
00:21:27,862 --> 00:21:29,703
He's hopeless indeed.

411
00:21:32,023 --> 00:21:34,462
You don't take after me at all.

412
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:38,023
Since young,

413
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:42,862
you always expected me to be number one
in everything I did.

414
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:44,502
That's too tiring.

415
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,423
I can never achieve that.

416
00:21:46,742 --> 00:21:47,342
And,

417
00:21:49,222 --> 00:21:51,382
you're asking the wrong person.

418
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:52,862
You should ask my mother
whether I take after you or not.

419
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:54,783
You scoundrel!

420
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:56,423
How could you say that?

421
00:21:57,423 --> 00:21:58,303
Hold it right there!

422
00:21:59,262 --> 00:22:00,183
Listen up!

423
00:22:00,742 --> 00:22:01,903
From tomorrow onward,

424
00:22:02,382 --> 00:22:04,102
I will suspend all of your cards.

425
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:06,823
You have to head to Huiquan

426
00:22:06,982 --> 00:22:10,382
and learn from Xiao Mu'en.

427
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,583
Xiao Mu'en again?

428
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,502
You always talk about him.

429
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:17,502
Since you like him so much,

430
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,382
why don't you acknowledge him
as your son instead?

431
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:22,222
And, I'm Yin Tiancheng.

432
00:22:22,502 --> 00:22:23,783
You want me to work under him?

433
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:24,663
He doesn't deserve it.

434
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:25,703
You!

435
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:32,982
Dad?

436
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,102
Dad, don't scare me.

437
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,262
You're so useless.

438
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,382
I worked hard my entire life

439
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:54,222
for your sake, you know?

440
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,543
You have all the resources in the world,

441
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,742
yet you don't want to utilize them.

442
00:23:01,142 --> 00:23:03,342
You're really driving me
to my grave here.

443
00:23:04,423 --> 00:23:05,462
Fine, let's make it this way.

444
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,102
I won't work under him

445
00:23:07,142 --> 00:23:08,502
for over a month.

446
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:19,903
Look.

447
00:23:20,543 --> 00:23:21,622
- Sir.
- You're busy enough.

448
00:23:21,742 --> 00:23:23,303
Didn't I tell you not to come?

449
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:24,382
You still insisted on coming here.

450
00:23:24,423 --> 00:23:25,063
It's fine.

451
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:26,183
I was planning to visit you

452
00:23:26,262 --> 00:23:28,543
when I was sending Xiaoting home last time.

453
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,903
However, it was pretty late.

454
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:30,982
That's why I didn't interrupt you.

455
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,102
Where's Xiaoting? Isn't she at home?

456
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:36,742
She went to look for Zhang Xiaobei.

457
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:38,502
She said...

458
00:23:38,703 --> 00:23:39,543
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

459
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:41,023
She wanted to learn

460
00:23:41,183 --> 00:23:42,262
and improve together with him.

461
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,862
Sorry for the embarrassment.

462
00:23:46,462 --> 00:23:48,063
Sir, don't say that.

463
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:49,663
You're being too courteous here.

464
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:53,502
Thank you for understanding me.

465
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:54,943
Right now, me and my daughter

466
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,742
are just like friends.

467
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:58,303
It's all thanks to you.

468
00:23:58,423 --> 00:23:59,183
That's not it.

469
00:23:59,423 --> 00:24:00,783
I did nothing.

470
00:24:00,862 --> 00:24:02,342
It was mainly because
Xiaoting was sensible.

471
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:03,222
She has grown up too.

472
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:04,622
By the way,

473
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,823
I heard from Xiaoting that you resigned.

474
00:24:08,303 --> 00:24:08,663
Yeah.

475
00:24:09,063 --> 00:24:09,982
I resigned not long ago.

476
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:11,462
What's with the sudden decision?

477
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:14,903
After giving it some thought,

478
00:24:15,342 --> 00:24:17,222
I thought it was satisfying enough
for me to experience it once.

479
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:19,102
I don't want to work all my life.

480
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:21,023
It's time for me to rest.

481
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:22,142
You're right.

482
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,462
Now, you can travel around the world

483
00:24:24,502 --> 00:24:25,903
and take pictures of
all those beautiful places.

484
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:29,543
Why don't I hold
a class reunion for you?

485
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:30,622
Let's gather.

486
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:31,943
No need for that.

487
00:24:32,063 --> 00:24:33,102
No, thanks.

488
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:35,943
I'm doing fine right now.

489
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:37,543
Alright then.

490
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,622
How have you been lately?

491
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:44,462
You must be doing well, huh?

492
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:45,982
I'm still in the same state.

493
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:51,342
Is Xiao Mu'en still trying to court you?

494
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,023
Sir, that's a sudden question.

495
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,742
Actually, I clarified things

496
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:00,023
with Xiao Mu'en long ago.

497
00:25:00,102 --> 00:25:01,903
I told him that
we could only be friends.

498
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:07,903
That personal issue

499
00:25:08,502 --> 00:25:09,783
is related to the rest of your life.

500
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:12,063
You need to take it seriously

501
00:25:12,903 --> 00:25:14,102
and try to resolve it
as soon as possible.

502
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,342
You have to act prudently.

503
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:19,663
Do not rush things.

504
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:25,703
I think I get what you mean,
yet I think I don't.

505
00:25:27,382 --> 00:25:28,663
It's nothing.

506
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:31,862
I always tell Xiaoting the same thing.

507
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:35,862
When is Xiaoting coming back?

508
00:25:35,982 --> 00:25:37,622
Why don't we have a meal together?

509
00:25:45,222 --> 00:25:45,823
Mr. Liu,

510
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:47,502
this place is nice indeed.

511
00:25:48,023 --> 00:25:49,303
You have great taste indeed.

512
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,462
If I must say, Mr. Liu,

513
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,583
you do enjoy life to the fullest.

514
00:25:55,703 --> 00:25:57,183
You're fine with having worldly desires,

515
00:25:57,862 --> 00:25:59,462
yet you can abstain from them
without any trouble.

516
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:03,102
Mr. Xiao, I had a deep impression of you

517
00:26:03,342 --> 00:26:05,502
during the board
of directors' meeting last time.

518
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:08,262
Although you're an R&D man at heart,

519
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:12,462
you're flexible with the way you do things.

520
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:17,543
Mr. Liu, please take care of me
in the future.

521
00:26:19,462 --> 00:26:21,262
I've benefited from

522
00:26:21,703 --> 00:26:22,742
the foreign investment we received too.

523
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:25,183
The other shareholders and I

524
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:27,423
had sold some of our shares

525
00:26:28,823 --> 00:26:29,982
and got some cash in hand.

526
00:26:31,262 --> 00:26:32,903
Mr. Xiao, thank you so much.

527
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:35,903
Please tell us if you have such

528
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,063
great bargains again in the future.

529
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:39,303
Not at all.

530
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:40,382
You flatter me.

531
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,663
I remembered that I had a feeling

532
00:26:43,783 --> 00:26:45,023
when I first saw you.

533
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:48,903
I felt that we would have
a pleasant cooperation in the future.

534
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,303
Is that so?

535
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:52,783
Tell me about it.

536
00:26:54,622 --> 00:26:55,823
You see, some words

537
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:58,222
cannot be said out loud.
They can only be implied.

538
00:26:58,703 --> 00:26:59,663
However, Mr. Liu,

539
00:26:59,903 --> 00:27:02,303
I believe that you'll understand it

540
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:05,262
when you see this.

541
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:39,703
No wonder you asked me out.

542
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:41,502
I thought you had
a lucrative deal for me.

543
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:44,583
Speak.

544
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:46,342
What are you up to?

545
00:27:48,222 --> 00:27:48,823
Mr. Liu,

546
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,703
you misunderstood me.

547
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:52,303
I bought these pictures

548
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,222
from my friend who was working for the media.

549
00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:59,462
You can treat it as if
I've solved this issue for you.

550
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:02,663
Rumor has it that
you're scared of your wife.

551
00:28:02,862 --> 00:28:04,262
However, I think that's a good thing.

552
00:28:04,982 --> 00:28:06,102
Men who are afraid of their wives

553
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:07,423
are good men.

554
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,583
They respect women.

555
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:10,382
What do you think?

556
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:13,943
As for women like them,

557
00:28:14,423 --> 00:28:15,943
they're but fleeting moments.

558
00:28:16,382 --> 00:28:17,183
I understand.

559
00:28:19,142 --> 00:28:20,903
But Mr. Liu, this is my suggestion.

560
00:28:21,622 --> 00:28:22,462
I don't think

561
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:24,823
you should let your wife see them.

562
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:27,102
If she knows about it,

563
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:28,982
she'll be heartbroken.

564
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:30,823
You'll be worried about her by then.

565
00:28:31,703 --> 00:28:35,142
Now, the marriage law punishes those
who commit adultery quite seriously...

566
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:36,183
Mr. Xiao,

567
00:28:36,543 --> 00:28:37,943
let's stop beating around the bush.

568
00:28:38,462 --> 00:28:40,462
I never owe people any favors.

569
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,862
What do you want me to do?

570
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:47,462
Here,

571
00:28:48,663 --> 00:28:50,382
I have an agreement.

572
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:53,703
(Agreement of persons acting in concert)
Mr. Liu, please check it for me.

573
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:56,740
(Agreement of persons acting in concert)

574
00:29:04,742 --> 00:29:05,903
Mr. Liu, in the future,

575
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:08,063
no matter if it's a major
or minor issue,

576
00:29:08,943 --> 00:29:13,423
I hope you can maintain solidarity with me.

577
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:16,183
Only the two of us?

578
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:17,183
That's pointless.

579
00:29:19,982 --> 00:29:22,703
You don't need to worry about that.

580
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,580
(Part B: Mr. Liu)

581
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,540
(Huaxin Villa)

582
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:45,783
Tang!

583
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:49,502
Li Yitang!

584
00:29:53,102 --> 00:29:54,183
She's not around.

585
00:29:54,222 --> 00:29:55,423
What should we do?

586
00:29:56,222 --> 00:29:58,303
She's not at home or
at Zhao Jikai's house.

587
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,862
Where can she go?

588
00:30:00,023 --> 00:30:00,903
What did she say

589
00:30:00,943 --> 00:30:02,703
when you called her?

590
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:05,023
She said she was busy,
and she hung up on me.

591
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:07,982
I think she just wants to be alone.

592
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:10,663
I don't know.

593
00:30:10,823 --> 00:30:12,703
I feel jittery.

594
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:14,943
Say, she won't do anything silly

595
00:30:15,183 --> 00:30:18,102
because of this matter, right?

596
00:30:18,462 --> 00:30:21,183
Dear, stop scaring yourself.

597
00:30:21,622 --> 00:30:23,142
Li Yitang has a good grasp
of her abilities.

598
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:25,342
I don't think
she'll get herself in trouble.

599
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:26,063
Yeah.

600
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,862
You love to imagine things, don't you?

601
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:29,823
I think she went out to take a breather.

602
00:30:30,183 --> 00:30:30,903
Don't overthink it.

603
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:32,102
I hope so.

604
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,102
Why are you rubbing your eyes?

605
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:37,543
It's nothing.

606
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,023
I said I wanted to
atone for my mistake, right?

607
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,142
I wanted to repay Mr. Xiao's favor
and make it up to you.

608
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:43,663
I've been working overtime
quite a lot lately.

609
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:44,663
That's why my eyes were dry.

610
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:46,102
Make it up to me?

611
00:30:46,423 --> 00:30:48,703
You can never make it up to us
in this lifetime.

612
00:30:49,063 --> 00:30:50,502
I'll buy you some eye drops later.

613
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:51,903
Mr. Xiao looks cultured

614
00:30:51,943 --> 00:30:53,303
when he wears spectacles.

615
00:30:53,622 --> 00:30:55,342
But he looks like a nerd
when he wears spectacles.

616
00:30:55,823 --> 00:30:57,063
You have no idea.

617
00:30:57,262 --> 00:30:59,903
Mr. Xiao wore spectacles
in order to look cool.

618
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:01,303
His eyes are fine.

619
00:31:01,862 --> 00:31:02,222
Huh?

620
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:04,183
He doesn't have near-nearsightedness?

621
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,023
Don't you know?

622
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:05,982
No, he doesn't have it.

623
00:31:06,303 --> 00:31:07,943
One time, when I was in his office,

624
00:31:08,023 --> 00:31:09,142
I saw him looking for documents.

625
00:31:09,502 --> 00:31:11,222
The letters on it were tiny.

626
00:31:11,262 --> 00:31:12,222
I couldn't even see them.

627
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:13,583
But he wasn't affected

628
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:14,583
even though he didn't
wear his spectacles.

629
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:17,823
I thought he had bad eyesight

630
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:18,823
since he was wearing spectacles.

631
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:19,742
Me too.

632
00:31:19,783 --> 00:31:20,262
Yeah.

633
00:31:20,663 --> 00:31:21,502
I think only people

634
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:22,142
who worked under him

635
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:23,462
could find out things like that.

636
00:31:23,742 --> 00:31:24,502
Yeah.

637
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:25,342
Two years ago,

638
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:27,622
Mr. Xiao said he wanted me
to start a business together with him.

639
00:31:28,063 --> 00:31:29,543
Back then, I was just laid off.

640
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:33,142
Programmers our age were basically unwanted.

641
00:31:33,303 --> 00:31:34,303
It's all thanks to Mr. Xiao.

642
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:37,622
I was also addicted
to gambling back then.

643
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:39,423
You still dare to say that?

644
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:42,543
It's all thanks to Mr. Xiao.

645
00:31:42,982 --> 00:31:44,023
I had no idea what would happen to me

646
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:45,783
if he didn't help me out back then.

647
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:48,342
Enough. Stop being sentimental
in front of another person's house.

648
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:49,423
Do something practical.

649
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:50,943
Take your wife out for some good food.

650
00:31:51,462 --> 00:31:52,262
Let's go.

651
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,663
Don't worry about it. Let's go home.

652
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:02,262
I couldn't sleep

653
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:05,063
after you left.

654
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:09,502
I remembered that I wrote down
Zhou Ling's contact number.

655
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:11,703
I searched through
all the shelves and cabinets

656
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,142
in order to find it.

657
00:32:14,663 --> 00:32:16,222
And, I finally found it.

658
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:24,462
Here you go.

659
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:27,342
This is Zhou Ling's contact number.

660
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:31,543
I finally found it.

661
00:33:01,342 --> 00:33:02,142
Hello?

662
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:05,783
Is this Ms. Zhou?

663
00:33:10,102 --> 00:33:11,742
Sorry about that. I must be mistaken.

664
00:33:12,262 --> 00:33:13,423
Okay. Goodbye.

665
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:26,663
Hello?

666
00:33:26,903 --> 00:33:29,102
Is this Ms. Zhou?

667
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:31,703
Hello?

668
00:33:33,823 --> 00:33:35,222
Hello? Can you hear me?

669
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:39,183
Hello?

670
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,740
(Huiquan)

671
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:29,662
Aren't you guys exhausted?

672
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,262
Stand up and do some stretches.

673
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,662
Young Master Yin, you can go ahead.

674
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:34,462
We're busy with work.

675
00:34:34,502 --> 00:34:35,103
We can't join you.

676
00:34:35,143 --> 00:34:35,902
Please forgive us.

677
00:34:36,222 --> 00:34:37,502
Don't call me that.

678
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:39,422
It's not like
I'm the remnant of feudalism.

679
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,902
We emphasize equality

680
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:43,422
in a network-based company like Huiquan.

681
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:45,662
From now on, call me Tiancheng.

682
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:46,383
Okay.

683
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:48,982
What about this?
I'll buy you guys coffee.

684
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,262
Is anyone willing to run the errand?

685
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:54,502
I'll go. What do you want?

686
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:56,143
Forget it. I'll buy them myself.

687
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:57,863
I'll buy them for you guys.

688
00:34:58,662 --> 00:34:59,343
Wait for me.

689
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:14,383
What are you doing?

690
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:15,063
Sorry about that.

691
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:16,262
You thug!

692
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:17,583
How dare you molest me?

693
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:19,742
Who are you calling a thug?

694
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:20,543
You!

695
00:35:21,502 --> 00:35:22,422
Explain yourself.

696
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:23,462
I didn't even touch you.

697
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,583
I did nothing.

698
00:35:24,742 --> 00:35:25,702
You're still pretending?

699
00:35:26,343 --> 00:35:27,303
Everyone, look at him.

700
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,942
He molested me in broad daylight.

701
00:35:29,662 --> 00:35:30,823
He's shameless!

702
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:32,303
You better explain yourself.

703
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:33,543
Of course you won't admit it.

704
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:34,343
He's from Huiquan.

705
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:34,783
Stop filming me.

706
00:35:34,823 --> 00:35:35,623
He's from Huiquan.

707
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:36,702
What a jerk.

708
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:38,422
You better mind your words.

709
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:39,422
What? You want to beat her up?

710
00:35:39,462 --> 00:35:40,462
Call the cops. Stop filming him.

711
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:40,982
I'll call the cops.

712
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:41,982
Don't think that you can escape.

713
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:43,623
You can only leave
after explaining yourself.

714
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:44,143
Stop filming me!

715
00:35:45,182 --> 00:35:46,383
The cops will be here soon.

716
00:35:46,422 --> 00:35:47,662
You'll be humiliated.

717
00:35:47,702 --> 00:35:48,383
Don't think that you can escape.

718
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:49,103
We have evidence.

719
00:35:49,182 --> 00:35:50,303
Of course you won't admit it.

720
00:35:50,303 --> 00:35:51,742
(Look at this man, Yin Tiancheng)

721
00:35:51,742 --> 00:35:52,902
He already called the cops.

722
00:35:52,982 --> 00:35:53,902
Don't think of running away.

723
00:35:54,783 --> 00:35:55,982
He touched her butt.

724
00:35:56,182 --> 00:35:57,103
(Yin Tiancheng, the employee of Huiquan)
We'll expose a pervert like you!

725
00:35:57,103 --> 00:35:57,942
(He harassed me and didn't admit)
We already called the cops!

726
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:59,623
(Let him know the consequence of harassment)
Don't think of running away.

727
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:02,422
Mr. Xiao.

728
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:03,823
Mr. Xiao.

729
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:04,462
Hi.

730
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:04,902
Mr. Xiao.

731
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:06,023
- Mr. Xiao.
- Mr. Xiao.

732
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:09,023
Mr. Xiao.

733
00:36:09,422 --> 00:36:09,982
Mr. Xiao.

734
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:11,742
Where is he?

735
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:14,502
He went to buy coffee.

736
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:15,742
Buy coffee?

737
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:23,422
Don't tell me he was
buying coffee for you guys?

738
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:26,702
That's right.

739
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:27,543
You guys are something else.

740
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:31,143
How could you make the prince
buy coffee for you all?

741
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:34,583
Listen up.

742
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:37,303
You guys should assist him
with his work.

743
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:39,662
It's his first day at work after all.

744
00:36:39,942 --> 00:36:40,543
Understood?

745
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:41,662
Understood.

746
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:42,583
Alright, get back to work.

747
00:36:42,702 --> 00:36:43,742
Okay, please take care.

748
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:44,583
Mr. Xiao, take care.

749
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:46,462
Let go of me!

750
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,143
The cops will be here soon. Don't move.

751
00:36:48,262 --> 00:36:49,462
So what if the cops are coming?
I did nothing wrong.

752
00:36:49,543 --> 00:36:50,343
Who called the cops just now?

753
00:36:50,383 --> 00:36:51,023
The cops are here.

754
00:36:51,262 --> 00:36:51,942
What's the matter?

755
00:36:52,702 --> 00:36:54,702
This guy molested that lady.

756
00:36:54,783 --> 00:36:55,702
And, he doesn't want to admit it.

757
00:36:55,783 --> 00:36:56,942
Did you guys witness it personally?

758
00:36:57,702 --> 00:36:58,262
I didn't.

759
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:00,543
The lady accused him of it.

760
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:01,823
What's going on?

761
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:03,583
Sir, I did nothing.

762
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:05,623
I was carrying the drinks
with both hands.

763
00:37:05,742 --> 00:37:07,343
I have no way to molest her.

764
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:09,623
Who knows what you used to touch me?

765
00:37:09,902 --> 00:37:10,982
Disgusting.

766
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,303
Say that again?

767
00:37:12,343 --> 00:37:12,702
Enough.

768
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:13,383
Enough.

769
00:37:13,902 --> 00:37:15,143
I'll check the surveillance camera.

770
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:16,942
The truth will be revealed by then.

771
00:37:21,182 --> 00:37:24,063
What a scandal.

772
00:37:25,023 --> 00:37:26,222
What the heck is this?

773
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:28,063
This is wrong.

774
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:30,863
He's fine after doing that?

775
00:37:31,702 --> 00:37:32,502
What is it?

776
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,662
This is too much.

777
00:37:35,783 --> 00:37:37,583
We're friends for many years.

778
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:39,502
You guys don't need

779
00:37:40,023 --> 00:37:41,863
to talk behind my back.

780
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,182
Yin,

781
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:47,422
you ask for it yourself.

782
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:50,182
You better

783
00:37:51,422 --> 00:37:53,982
don't get angry.

784
00:37:55,343 --> 00:37:56,623
Get angry?

785
00:37:56,982 --> 00:37:58,462
You think too highly of me.

786
00:37:58,863 --> 00:38:00,863
I've been through
all kinds of situations.

787
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:05,422
Your son was touching a woman's butt

788
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,182
in broad daylight.

789
00:38:08,222 --> 00:38:09,262
Nonsense!

790
00:38:10,143 --> 00:38:12,182
I'm sure it was the work
of a media outlet.

791
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:15,502
Can't you guys even differentiate
between true and fake news?

792
00:38:16,702 --> 00:38:17,982
This is real!

793
00:38:18,742 --> 00:38:19,623
Take a look if you don't believe me.

794
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,693
(Yin Tiancheng, the employee of Huiquan)

795
00:38:28,693 --> 00:38:31,128
(He harassed me and didn't admit)

796
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:34,380
(Let him know the consequence of harassment)

797
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:35,262
You see?

798
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:36,902
Huh?

799
00:38:38,343 --> 00:38:39,422
Yin,

800
00:38:39,462 --> 00:38:42,543
you're better than us in every aspect.

801
00:38:43,143 --> 00:38:44,383
But look at your child.

802
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,662
Now, we don't compete in terms of
wealth or fame.

803
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:51,823
Now, it's our children.

804
00:38:52,182 --> 00:38:52,742
I quit.

805
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:57,103
That's where true wealth lies!

806
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,343
What a shame.

807
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:03,143
Bad news travels fast, huh?

808
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:04,222
My goodness!

809
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:06,662
Look!

810
00:39:06,942 --> 00:39:07,902
Yin Tiancheng is famous now.

811
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:09,182
I didn't expect him
to be someone like this.

812
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:11,702
Not only is he ignorant and incompetent,
but he's also a pervert.

813
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:13,222
But his profile picture
looks pretty good.

814
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:15,502
Huiquan is on the Hot Search again.

815
00:39:15,702 --> 00:39:17,103
You missed the point.

816
00:39:17,543 --> 00:39:20,383
A scandal like this happened
when he went out to buy coffee.

817
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:22,023
He's the harbinger of doom.

818
00:39:27,422 --> 00:39:29,262
Here, I bought random drinks.

819
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:30,462
I don't know what you guys wanted.

820
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,863
Thank you.

821
00:39:33,902 --> 00:39:34,262
Here.

822
00:39:35,702 --> 00:39:36,502
Thank you.

823
00:39:38,942 --> 00:39:40,103
Have it while it's hot.

824
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,262
Young Master Yin, I'm sorry.

825
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:44,502
My tummy feels uncomfortable.

826
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,343
I don't think I can take coffee.

827
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:48,303
Thank you so much.

828
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:49,942
Distribute them.

829
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:52,222
Thank you so much.

830
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,752
(You are not that kind of person.
Tiancheng, you did it wrong.)

831
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:13,833
(Someone did it on purpose.)

832
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,840
(You and Huiquan are famous now,
but they are all criticizing you.)

833
00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:23,063
What's with the weird attitude?

834
00:40:24,742 --> 00:40:26,942
I didn't do anything.

835
00:40:27,303 --> 00:40:29,583
The cops already
checked the surveillance camera.

836
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,383
That woman already apologized to me.

837
00:40:33,823 --> 00:40:36,063
If you don't trust me,
you can ask the staff in the cafe or the police.

838
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:37,383
We didn't say anything.

839
00:40:37,462 --> 00:40:38,222
Please calm down.

840
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:40,103
If so, why are you guys keeping quiet?

841
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:43,783
Don't tell me you guys think
that I molested her?

842
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:44,863
We didn't.

843
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:45,462
We dare not do so.

844
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,063
You dare not do so?

845
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,543
Who do you guys take me for?

846
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:53,222
Do you think I'm that desperate?

847
00:40:53,262 --> 00:40:55,182
I thought you guys were top students?

848
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:56,383
Can you use your brain for once?

849
00:40:56,543 --> 00:40:57,863
We didn't say anything.

850
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:02,063
Fine.

851
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:06,222
All of you don't dare to say it, huh?

852
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,103
I understand now.

853
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:20,182
He's infuriated.

854
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:20,942
Yeah.

855
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:22,383
Why is he so anxious?

856
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:23,942
I'm impressed.

857
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,543
He can't take it already?

858
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:26,383
He left.

859
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:34,863
What's the matter?

860
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:36,462
(Hello, Mr. Xiao.)

861
00:41:36,623 --> 00:41:37,942
(This is a call from Mr. Ding.)

862
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:43,422
Answer it.

863
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:49,182
Hello, Mr. Ding.

864
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:54,462
(Mr. Xiao, are you sure Yin Huiquan can still be
in charge of the company?)

865
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,863
I don't think he should remain
as the chairman.

866
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,623
Look at what his son has done.

867
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:03,063
(How can he manage Huiquan like this?)

868
00:42:03,343 --> 00:42:05,343
(In the past, many things had happened.)

869
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:07,823
We thought they were just
mere coincidences.

870
00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:09,103
We thought we were just unlucky.

871
00:42:09,662 --> 00:42:10,462
But look at what happened.

872
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:12,583
He has no excuses now.

873
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:13,623
Hmph.

874
00:42:14,543 --> 00:42:16,262
Who gave him the power

875
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:18,222
to mess around in the company?

876
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:21,262
(As the vice chairman,)

877
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:22,662
(I need to do something about it.)

878
00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:26,422
And, the directors and I

879
00:42:26,902 --> 00:42:29,222
want him to be removed
from his position

880
00:42:29,462 --> 00:42:30,982
(as the chairman.)

881
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:31,823
Mr. Ding,

882
00:42:32,303 --> 00:42:35,742
don't be angry. Actually, this matter

883
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:38,543
isn't directly related to
Chairman himself.

884
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:40,422
You guys are being unfair

885
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,422
to the chairman here.
