15
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:40,133
(Defendant)
Hold on.

16
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:43,412
The old man's hands look like
those of a woman,

17
00:01:43,813 --> 00:01:44,612
(Presiding Judge)
they are fair.

18
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,493
But that doesn't necessarily mean
the person is a woman.

19
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:52,533
(Public Prosecutor)
Men can also have fair and delicate hands.

20
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:55,372
Besides, even if the old man

21
00:01:56,253 --> 00:01:57,813
is disguised by a woman,

22
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,332
it doesn't prove that
it's my client. Right?

23
00:02:02,573 --> 00:02:05,253
So, Paul's identification of my client

24
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,132
as the mastermind of
the murder isn't valid.

25
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,413
Qian Tianxin admitted

26
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:13,292
that she met with Paul that day.

27
00:02:13,613 --> 00:02:15,893
(Statement)
Her transcript and statement

28
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:19,012
have explained all details of
the meeting with Paul,

29
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:21,093
which enhances her presence there.

30
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:23,173
Well.

31
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:28,533
Please read the statement of my client.

32
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:34,932
Paul and I agreed to meet at 3:15 PM.

33
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:35,973
on July 15th, two years ago.

34
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:37,613
He was seven minutes late.

35
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:39,973
The meeting place is
at Marie Payne Coffee Shop,

36
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:44,973
located at No. 117 of Carey-Layes Avenue
in Port Selva,

37
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:47,093
which is less than
an hour's drive from Pasak.

38
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,253
We ordered two cups of Latte
from Country A.

39
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:53,453
My client's statement is untrue.

40
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:55,453
I have reasons to suspect

41
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:57,333
that her confession to the murder

42
00:02:57,613 --> 00:02:59,652
was coerced by the judiciary.

43
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,693
It's illegally obtained evidence.

44
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:04,572
Defense attorney, you're making
an unwarranted accusation.

45
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:06,053
You're saying
that the statement is untrue.

46
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:07,372
Please be specific.

47
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:08,333
Okay.

48
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:14,732
Marie Payne Coffee Shop is
an open-air cafe, right?

49
00:03:15,173 --> 00:03:18,012
According to the weather reports,

50
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:23,693
on July 15th, two years ago,
it was raining.

51
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,132
A heavy downpour.

52
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:28,533
The data shows that it lasted for a day.

53
00:03:28,572 --> 00:03:31,613
The precipitation level is above 200 mm.

54
00:03:32,732 --> 00:03:33,652
Think about this.

55
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:38,572
Both my client and Paul couldn't be

56
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,693
drinking the afternoon tea
in an open-air cafe

57
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,132
when it was raining heavily, right?

58
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:42,893
Yes.

59
00:03:43,093 --> 00:03:44,772
I found out this long ago.

60
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:46,772
And I asked Qian Tianxin.

61
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,572
She said she couldn't recall
the exact time.

62
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:51,453
Paul didn't remember the exact date too.

63
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:53,333
Fine.

64
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,852
They don't remember the specific date.

65
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:58,932
After all, it was two years ago.

66
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:02,413
It's understandable for a busy

67
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:03,852
middle-aged women

68
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:07,212
and has a lot on her plate to
forget the date.

69
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:13,253
However,
I think you've overlooked one thing.

70
00:04:13,973 --> 00:04:21,413
On July 15th, it's not only a rainy day,

71
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:30,172
it's also the traditional festival
in Country A, San Isidro Festival.

72
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:34,452
If so, the entire nation holds

73
00:04:34,492 --> 00:04:36,212
grand parades on that day,

74
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:39,253
who could forget such a date?

75
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:40,533
Really?

76
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:45,052
I just found out about this.

77
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:46,452
I'll send it to you.

78
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,133
Well, An Ni.

79
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:04,853
You shouldn't have made this mistake.

80
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:08,372
We almost file a charge
against the wrong person.

81
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:11,212
Actually, I...

82
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,212
I did have doubts before.

83
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:16,813
But all the evidence we have now

84
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:18,253
points to Qian Tianxin.

85
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,052
Well.

86
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:22,652
Luckily, we've discovered this.

87
00:05:24,093 --> 00:05:25,452
It's a lesson learned.

88
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,693
We shall analyze the case carefully.

89
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:30,813
I just don't get it
why did she take the blame for A

90
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:32,133
even at the cost of her life.

91
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:33,892
I'll interrogate Qian Tianxin tomorrow.

92
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:35,533
Wait a moment.

93
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,212
She's determined to bear the crime

94
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:38,533
even in the face of death.

95
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,652
It just won't work for her.

96
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:45,932
Well, I think you should start
with the accessories for their statement.

97
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:49,372
Let's go.

98
00:05:51,293 --> 00:05:52,293
Thank you, Director Wang.

99
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:53,013
No problem.

100
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:53,772
Thank you so much.

101
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:54,533
Jia.

102
00:05:56,813 --> 00:05:57,612
Good job.

103
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:01,212
Han Xuan.

104
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,652
I need you to do me a favor tomorrow.

105
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:04,612
Look into...

106
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:11,853
Han Xuan.

107
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:16,133
Is it done?

108
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:18,973
Please look into

109
00:06:19,013 --> 00:06:20,013
every member of Qian Tianxin's gang

110
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:20,892
for me tomorrow.

111
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:22,052
Both local and overseas members.

112
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:25,372
I thought we'd completed that.

113
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:26,253
This is tedious.

114
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:28,612
Play to your strengths.

115
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:31,733
I don't believe that
they left no information on the internet.

116
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:36,492
Pack up and get home to rest. It's late.

117
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:44,853
What's wrong, Ni?

118
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:48,693
Zhang Xiaobei's father passed away.

The murderer of Wanru

00:06:58,212 --> 00:06:59,573
hasn't been punished yet.

123
00:07:00,973 --> 00:07:02,932
You should hang in for a while.

124
00:07:07,452 --> 00:07:09,172
Why did you leave so soon?

125
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:17,693
Dad, you've gone now.

126
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:25,573
I'm alone in this world from now on.

127
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:26,492
I'm all alone.

128
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:31,052

Xiaobei.

130
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:36,133
Okay, well.

131

What are you talking about?

144
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:22,332
They identified you as
the fugitive in Country A

145
00:08:22,372 --> 00:08:23,093
based on your photos.

146

According to the list you provided,

00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:40,373
the following individuals

150
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:41,692
are missing from today's arrest,

151
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,132
Wang Defa, Li Nan, and Li Shande.

152
00:08:44,493 --> 00:08:45,533
So, what's the situation now?

153
00:08:47,173 --> 00:08:48,452
They didn't return.

154
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,373
I guess they fled
after catching wind of this.

155
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:51,613
Among these people,

156
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:53,373
if they hold a fake identity,
a fake passport,

157
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:55,132
or even their identity and
passport are genuine

158
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:56,493
but belong to other Asian countries,

159
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:57,853
it'll be hard to capture them.

160
00:08:58,053 --> 00:08:58,812
Are there any significant figures

161
00:08:58,853 --> 00:08:59,812
among them?

162
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:01,533
No, they're just cooks,

163
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:02,853
janitors, drivers, and the like.

164
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:05,572
Inside the evidence collected by Wanru,

165
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:06,812
their photos are in it.

166
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:08,413
We can capture them at a later stage.

167
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,733
As of now, extraditing those arrested is
a tricky business.

168
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:11,812
To cooperate with Country A

169
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,452
in the criminal justice process,

170
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,173
we need to provide the accurate identity
information about the suspects.

171
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,493
But we'll never know the true identities

172
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,933
of online fraudsters
until they're captured.

173
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:21,493
Everything is interconnected,

174
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:22,652
and yet it leads to no clue.

175
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:23,493
True.

176
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,613
The extradition is complex.

177
00:09:26,652 --> 00:09:27,933
But you can leave it to us.

178
00:09:28,212 --> 00:09:29,212
For the devotion of
mutual legal assistance treaty

179
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:31,652
between two states, they'll assist us.

180
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,132
Did you really think you could escape?

181
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,613
One's luck can't always be so good.

182
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:43,973
That's why you're sitting here today.

183
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:49,332
I was so clueless and
I shouldn't have taken any chances.

184
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:50,733
Miss Prosecutor.

185
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:52,533
Please spare me one more chance.

186
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:53,132
I'll come clean.

187
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,373
I'll tell you everything.

188
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:57,252
Well, you may start with the experience

189
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:57,973
since you joined
Qian Tianxin's fraud team.

190
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,692
Xuan. Why don't we listen to his story

191
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:02,933
of these past years?

192
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,853
You can start from the first day

193
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:06,012
you arrived in Country A.

194
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:07,452
You can repeat it several times too.

195
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:08,332
We're all listening.

196
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,053
Are you fooling me?

197
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,613
You want reduced punishments,

198
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:14,853
and yet you're trying to hide something.

199
00:10:15,212 --> 00:10:17,293
Listen to this. Truth confession.

200
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,812
Not only admitting your own conducts

201
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,452
but also disclosing the conduct
of your accomplice that you know.

202
00:10:21,493 --> 00:10:23,812
Otherwise, it won't be considered
a voluntary confession.

203
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:28,613
Prosecutor, what do you want from me?

204
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,572
Every single detail of your experience

205
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,533
when you joined
Qian Tianxin's fraud team.

206
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,533
I'm just a small fish in the organization.

207
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:41,933
I used to be a cook in Country A

208
00:10:42,012 --> 00:10:43,692
and a lecturer in Country F.

209
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:46,572
From a cook to a lecturer.

210
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:47,973
What an impressive promotion.

211
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,493
No wonder you returned
to the fraud team,

212
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:51,332
even though you've already left.

213
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,812
I'm not taking the credit.

214
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:57,012
It was an arrangement
from the higher-up.

215
00:10:58,053 --> 00:10:59,533
They provided me
with precise information.

216
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:02,772
Precise?

217
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:08,373
Let's talk about the accuracy rate
of your information.

218
00:11:08,772 --> 00:11:10,252
Since you were a lecturer,

219
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,252
I suppose it should be 80 percent, right?

220
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:13,733
More or less.

221
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,533
It's more than less or less than more?

222
00:11:17,173 --> 00:11:18,572
Do you think I have this gift?

223
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:21,812
Stop making fun of me.

224
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:23,973
There are several departments
in the organization.

225
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:25,933
If the departments obtain
accurate information,

226
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:28,212
the success rate can be up to
85 percent and above,

227
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,892
if not, they have to cast a wide net

228
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,933
and the accuracy reduces.

229
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:36,012
You've been serving

230
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:36,892
Qian Tianxin's fraud team for some time.

231
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,053
You should be a senior inside.

232
00:11:39,373 --> 00:11:41,572
Have you heard of
Qian Tianxin's superior?

233
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,053
Xin has many henchmen around her.

234
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:49,053
Besides, why would she

235
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:51,212
speak her heart to me?

236
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:54,093
Is there anything you want to say?

237
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,733
No. I'll speak up if there's any.

238
00:11:57,053 --> 00:11:58,652
I want a mitigation, after all.

239
00:11:59,613 --> 00:12:01,853
Whether or not you speak the truth,
you know it.

240
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,132
Xuan, let's call it a day.

241
00:12:09,373 --> 00:12:11,452
Hu Dewang mentioned that
Qian Tianxin possesses

242
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:12,413
the personal information data

243
00:12:12,452 --> 00:12:13,933
is categorized as precise and ordinary.

244
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:15,212
People like Guo Jing'an

245
00:12:15,252 --> 00:12:17,692
usually obtain personal information
of ordinary individuals

246
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:18,452
who aren't well off,

247
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:21,772
which hold no value for the fraud gangs.

248
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:24,332
Qian Tianxin confessed
about the AI voice scam

249
00:12:24,373 --> 00:12:25,572
and filtered victim clusters.

250
00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,413
They're actually seeking "pigs".

251
00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,772
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack,

252
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:30,853
they keep testing people
who take up the calls.

253
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:32,892
The next step is
to cultivate those "pigs".

254
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,373
During the process,

255
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:35,692
they would encounter many challenges,

256
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,373
let alone the final step
of butchering the targeted "pigs".

257
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,212
Plus, the public security system

258
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:39,973
has successfully intercepted

259
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:41,452
online fraudsters these years,

260
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,572
preventing victims from wiring money.

261
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:47,212
This indicates that the success rate of
the pig-butchering scam isn't high.

262
00:12:47,772 --> 00:12:50,452
However, Hu Dewang said that
the success rate

263
00:12:50,493 --> 00:12:51,652
was up to 85 percent.

264
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:53,733
Meaning to say, the accuracy rate
of the personal information

265
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,053
Qian Tianxin confessed

266
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:56,892
is more than meets the eye.

267
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:58,892
She must be hiding something.

268
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,812
We must get to the bottom of this.

269
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,613
Only then can we eradicate the criminals

270
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,973
from the root.

271
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:09,373
That's a lot of work to do.

272
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,572
The fraud success rate
of Qian Tianxin's fraud team

273
00:13:11,613 --> 00:13:14,373
at targeted victims exceeds 85 percent.

274
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:16,533
Without the aid of precise network data,

275
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,173
it's impossible to achieve this.

276
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:20,332
There must be
a highly intelligent criminal

277
00:13:20,373 --> 00:13:22,053
who's proficient at networks
behind this.

278
00:13:22,373 --> 00:13:23,973
But Qian Tianxin
doesn't fit this criterion.

279
00:13:24,332 --> 00:13:27,413
So, I suspect that Qian Tianxin is merely
a subordinate leader.

280
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:30,173
There's someone superior hidden behind.

281
00:13:32,613 --> 00:13:34,252
Merely based on this, you concluded

282
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:36,373
that A is someone else.

283
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,652
Over the years,
habitual criminals like Qian Tianxin

284
00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:41,853
remain silent until the trial begins.

285
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:45,132
But Qian Tianxin flat-out admitted

286
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:46,132
that she was A.

287
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:49,613
Her intention to protect someone behind
is too obvious.

288
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:57,572
Is it possible that the network expert

289
00:13:57,652 --> 00:14:02,093
isn't Qian Tianxin's superior
but her partner?

290
00:14:04,772 --> 00:14:07,053
You're saying that
she's protecting her accomplice.

291
00:14:08,812 --> 00:14:09,933
I wouldn't rule out this possibility.

292
00:14:12,012 --> 00:14:15,093
Qian Tianxin has complicated backgrounds.

293
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,613
Anything can happen to her.

294
00:14:21,212 --> 00:14:23,493
However,
without a complete chain of evidence,

295
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,572
whether or not Qian Tianxin is A
remains doubtful.

296
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,493
The thing is we can't charge her

297
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,652
with Zhang Wanru's murder in this trial.

298
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:31,892
Yes.

299
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:34,613
Any other discoveries?

300
00:14:35,413 --> 00:14:36,252
Besides, speaking of Hu Dewang,

301
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:38,892
he is evasive during the interrogation.

302
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,652
I suspect he's hiding something.

303
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,973
We need some more time
to take the words out of his mouth.

304
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:45,973
We can't afford to delay further.

305
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,212
Qian Tianxin and her gang

306
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:50,173
have harmed too many people.

307
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,572
Everyone is hoping
to bring her to justice.

308
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,772
We must proceed with the trial
as soon as possible.

309
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:55,853
Go and prepare now.

310
00:14:55,892 --> 00:14:56,252
Okay.

311
00:14:57,012 --> 00:14:58,053
I'll get going, Prosecutor Guo.

312
00:15:41,892 --> 00:15:44,853
Don't worry. Everything is all set.

313
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:46,853
Qian Tianxin will be fine.

(Recently, the massive transnational

so do everything.

Yang Wei, and Hu Dewang

368
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:57,773
established a criminal organization
in Country F

with the aim of illegal possession.

370
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,093
They committed cybercrime

371
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,292
and swindled money
from Chinese citizens,

372
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:06,052
in which an exceptionally large
amount is involved.

373
00:20:06,253 --> 00:20:09,052
They violated Article 266

374
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,613
of The Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China.

375
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:12,212
The criminal facts are clear,

376
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,052
with solid and sufficient evidence.

377
00:20:14,532 --> 00:20:17,052
They should be convicted of
the crime of fraud.

378
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,853
The defendants Qian Tianxin and Yang Wei

379

restricted the personal freedom
of others with physical violence.

380
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:26,332
They violated Article 238

of The Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China.

with solid and sufficient evidence.

384

They should be convicted

385
00:20:33,253 --> 00:20:34,613
of the crime of false imprisonment.

386
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:35,893
(Law Clerk)
The defendant Qian Tianxin

387
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:37,572
colluded with others in Country A

388
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:39,292
to intentionally kill a Chinese citizen.

389
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:42,653
She violated Article 232

390
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,412
of The Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China.

391
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:45,932
The criminal facts are clear,

392
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,812
with solid and sufficient evidence.

393
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:49,692
She should be convicted

394
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,172
of the crime of intentional homicide.

395
00:20:55,973 --> 00:20:57,932
Of course, I know An Ni very well.

396
00:20:58,572 --> 00:21:00,532
She'll be prepared for anything.

397
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:03,212
She's determined to send
Qian Tianxin to jail.

398
00:21:09,773 --> 00:21:11,172
Defendant Qian Tianxin,

399
00:21:12,093 --> 00:21:14,212
do you have any objections

400
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:15,332
to the facts stated in the complaint?

401
00:21:16,812 --> 00:21:18,532
I plead guilty and repent.

402
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:22,212
I admit all the criminal facts.

403
00:21:23,613 --> 00:21:26,572
I organized criminal gangs
engaging in cybercrime

404
00:21:27,013 --> 00:21:29,532
in multiple locations
in Country A and Country F.

405
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:30,613
During this period,

406
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:32,853
I organized cases
of intentional injuries,

407
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,212
false imprisonment,

408
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,613
and illegal frontier crossing.

409
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:39,133
Not only that, I personally planned out

410
00:21:39,613 --> 00:21:40,692
an intentional homicide.

411
00:21:40,973 --> 00:21:42,412
Concerning An Ni is well-prepared,

412
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:46,932
it's too late to find loopholes from her.

413
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:48,373
As for Qian Tianxin,

414
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:53,332
she will surely take
the fall for you all.

415
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,853
This trial is a foregone conclusion.

416
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:59,692
Yes, I killed Zhang Wanrun.

417
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:02,572
In Port Selva of Country A,

418
00:22:02,812 --> 00:22:05,133
I hired a local driver, Paul.

419
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,412
Defense attorney of Qian Tianxin,

420
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:09,452
do you have any objections

421
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:10,452
to the facts stated in the complaint?

422
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,932
Revered Presiding Judge and judges,

423
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,532
I'm assigned as the defense attorney,

424
00:22:18,973 --> 00:22:21,013
entrusted by the defendant Qian Tianxin.

425
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,493
I've come across the case files,

426
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:25,812
met with the defendant

427
00:22:25,932 --> 00:22:26,812
as well as run court investigations.

428
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:30,093
I have gained a clearer understanding
of this case.

429
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:33,893
I have listened carefully

430
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,292
to the complaint declared
by Prosecutor An Ni.

431
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:37,253
Qian Tianxin has admitted

432
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:40,253
the criminal facts of cybercrime

433
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,332
and has pled guilty.

434
00:22:41,452 --> 00:22:42,332
As the defense attorney,

435
00:22:42,692 --> 00:22:46,973
I have no objections to the alleged
criminal facts and charges.

436
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:50,893
However, I believe the charges of
false imprisonment

437
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:52,853
and intentional injuries

438
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:55,733
consist of certain factual ambiguity.

439
00:22:59,052 --> 00:22:59,773
Presiding Judge.

440
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:01,893
We request to call my witness,

441
00:23:01,932 --> 00:23:03,532
Zhang Xiaobei to testify.

442
00:23:04,253 --> 00:23:04,893
Proceed.

443
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,172
I'm Zhang Xiaobei.

444
00:23:19,292 --> 00:23:20,493
I was hellbent on making a fortune

445
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:23,412
and fell for the false recruitment
ads online.

446
00:23:23,493 --> 00:23:24,932
I was duped into coming
to Country F for work.

447
00:23:25,853 --> 00:23:27,733
I fell prey to Qian Tianxin's fraud team.

448
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:29,773
(Witness)
Qian Tianxin confined

449
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:32,773
workers from our country in her territory.

450
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:34,292
Every day, she made us

451
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,973
pretend to be ladies online
to commit fraud.

452
00:23:36,253 --> 00:23:37,532
We worked endlessly day and night.

453
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:41,733
If someone disobeyed
or showed slight resistance,

454
00:23:42,373 --> 00:23:44,332
she would instruct her men

455
00:23:44,572 --> 00:23:46,093
to torture them severely.

456
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:47,692
We'd be locked in dog cages,

457
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,653
or, at worst, in water dungeons.

458
00:23:50,292 --> 00:23:51,253
Punishments like starvation,

459
00:23:51,412 --> 00:23:54,653
whips, iron rods, cut off our fingers,

460
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,932
or cripple us, she would retort

461
00:23:57,973 --> 00:23:59,373
to any gruesome methods possible.

462
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,853
It was a hellish life there.

463
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:04,172
We were forced

464
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:06,212
to deceive money
from fellow Chinese citizens

465
00:24:06,253 --> 00:24:08,253
and gullible netizens like us,

466
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:11,532
which is actually against
our good conscience.

467
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:13,692
Witness Zhang Xiaobei.

468
00:24:14,692 --> 00:24:15,853
Do you have anything else to add?

469
00:24:16,253 --> 00:24:18,973
That's all for my testimony.

470
00:24:19,932 --> 00:24:23,773
I solemnly swear that
told the whole truth.

471
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:25,332
If there are any falsehoods,

472
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:27,412
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

473
00:24:29,613 --> 00:24:30,932
Witness testimony completed.

474
00:24:31,332 --> 00:24:32,653
Defendant Qian Tianxin,

475
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:36,253
do you have any objections?

476
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:39,093
I have nothing to say

477
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:40,572
about the accusations made by others.

478
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:45,853
But Zhang Xiaobei and
I have personal grudges.

479
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,253
All of his testimony is
a slander against me.

480
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:53,812
Qian Tianxin.
You committed loads of terrible things.

481
00:24:53,853 --> 00:24:55,052
Why would I have to slander you?

482
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,412
Witness, control your emotions.

483
00:24:57,613 --> 00:24:58,973
Zhang Wanru.

484
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,373
I'll avenge my sister today!

485
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:03,332
Let go!

486
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:05,733
Bailiff. Maintain order in the courtroom.

487
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:07,212
Bring the witness out.

488
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:07,853
Qian Tianxin!

489
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:09,572
You can never run from the law!

490
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:10,412
Just you wait!

491
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:17,253
Chairman. It's better this way.

492
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,893
This is helpful for
our upcoming interview that's scheduled.

493
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:25,093
Defendant Yang Wei,

494
00:25:25,412 --> 00:25:26,452
do you have any objections

495
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:28,452
to the facts stated in the complaint?

496
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:31,292
No. I plead guilty.

497
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:34,093
Defendant Hu Dewang,

498
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:37,412
do you have any objections

499
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:38,212
to the facts stated in the complaint?

500
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,572
I have no objections to it.

501
00:25:41,052 --> 00:25:41,572
However,

502
00:25:42,532 --> 00:25:48,812
I'd like to disclose an important clue
to the court and seek leniency.

503
00:25:51,013 --> 00:25:51,733
Why?

504
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:55,812
But An Ni will never expect this,

505
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:58,613
not even Qian Tianxin will expect this,

506
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:00,692
that we would meddle in this way.

507
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:03,812
I know An Ni too well.

508
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:06,172
I know how to deal with her.

509
00:26:07,212 --> 00:26:09,052
She demands perfection

510
00:26:09,373 --> 00:26:11,893
and because of her pursuit of justice,

511
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:13,973
it helps us to defeat her.

512
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:19,572
Hu Dewang.

513
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:21,093
You're spewing nonsense.

514
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:23,013
I've already admitted my crime.

515
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:25,773
I made all the arrangements.
I'm the boss.

516
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,093
How dare you speak nonsense in court?

517
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,572
Do you want additional charges
or a longer sentence?

518
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:34,373
Why?

519
00:26:37,292 --> 00:26:37,973
Silence.

520
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,653
Defendant Hu Dewang
will be questioned separately.

521
00:26:41,093 --> 00:26:43,052
Other defendants
may leave the courtroom.

522
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:00,653
Defendant Hu Dewang,

523
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:04,373
did you turn state's evidence
during the investigation

524
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:06,212
or prosecution stages?

525
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:07,212
No, I didn't.

526
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:10,133
The reason why I provide
the clue in court

527
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,452
is to show my cooperation to
reduce my punishment.

528
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:15,133
Recount the situation
you want to disclose.

529
00:27:17,733 --> 00:27:18,773
When I was in Country A,

530
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:22,493
I heard that there was a branch leader
in Country F named Boss Zhang.

531
00:27:23,133 --> 00:27:24,572
This person never showed up.

532
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:31,172
Qian Tianxian is his lackey and mistress.

533
00:27:32,532 --> 00:27:34,733
He was in charge of all my ship tickets

534
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:36,613
from Country A to Country F,

535
00:27:37,133 --> 00:27:39,572
(Defendant)
but I've never seen him.

536
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:44,093
All of his instructions were given
through Qian Tianxin.

537
00:27:44,452 --> 00:27:50,773
Hence, I believe he's
the actual mastermind behind in Country F.

538
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:52,853
Defendant Hu Dewang,

539
00:27:53,212 --> 00:27:56,052
please elaborate on further information
about Boss Zhang.

540
00:27:56,572 --> 00:27:58,412
I've said this
in the interrogation before.

541
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:01,613
I'm just a small fish of low levels.

542
00:28:01,773 --> 00:28:04,093
I have no access to higher-level matters.

543
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:07,853
But I heard that all of the money

544
00:28:08,412 --> 00:28:09,853
was taken by Boss Zhang.

545
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:12,812
(I hope the prosecutor
can follow this trail)

546
00:28:13,452 --> 00:28:16,452
(and catch a bigger fish and
the real mastermind.)

547
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:19,093
The clue doesn't reveal much.

548
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:21,212
Where can we find this Boss Zhang?

549
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:28,572
The case of Country F
has several characteristics.

550
00:28:29,172 --> 00:28:32,452
First of all, the case materials

551
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:35,692
don't show any evidence related to A.

552
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:41,332
The defense attorneys
may not know about A.

553
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:44,493
Secondly,
the fund flow remains ambiguous.

554
00:28:45,452 --> 00:28:48,452
The whereabouts of
the illicit funds of Group F is unknown.

555
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:50,692
I think the defense attorneys

556
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:54,172
would understand this
after reviewing the case files.

557
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:59,532
Hence, Hu Dewang didn't mean to turn A in.

558
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:02,932
Once doubts and hesitation
are discerned in court,

559
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:06,452
it may affect the trust of the judges.

560
00:29:06,733 --> 00:29:07,532
Presiding Judge,

561
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:10,013
I request to question
Defendant Hu Dewang.

562
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:11,052
Proceed.

563
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:13,412
Defendant Hu Dewang,

564
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:16,373
why didn't you turn state's evidence

565
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:18,212
during the investigations
and prosecutions stages?

566
00:29:18,493 --> 00:29:19,733
I've said it many times,

567
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:21,373
I just didn't remember it.

568
00:29:21,812 --> 00:29:22,212
Okay.

569
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:23,613
Defendant Hu Dewang,

570
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:27,253
please recount everything you know
about Boss Zhang

571
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,893
from the beginning to the end.

572
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:30,332
Something's wrong.

573
00:29:30,373 --> 00:29:33,133
Obviously, someone sets An Ni up.

574
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:33,893
Set her up?

575
00:29:37,013 --> 00:29:40,452
An Ni is extremely particular on the case.

576
00:29:41,093 --> 00:29:43,733
She looks into every detail
meticulously.

577
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:46,853
But phantom defense is supposedly

578
00:29:46,893 --> 00:29:48,493
something unwarranted.

579
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:49,973
Just like the phantom,

580
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:52,532
it doesn't exist in this world.

581
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:55,812
It leads you to nowhere
however you investigate.

582
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:57,692
How now?

583
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:02,412
Heyu. You got to remind An Ni.

584
00:30:03,773 --> 00:30:05,613
Maybe give her a call.

585
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:08,373
No. It's in the middle of the trial,

586
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:11,133
we need to abide by the court rules.

587
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:14,212
If one disrupts the court session,

588
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:16,493
they'd be removed from the courtroom

589
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:19,412
or be detained by
the Ministry of Justice, at worst.

590
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:25,253
No further question
from the prosecution, Presiding Judge.

591
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:26,932
Presiding Judge.

592
00:30:27,853 --> 00:30:30,292
I request to ask Defendant Hu Dewang
a few questions.

593
00:30:31,172 --> 00:30:31,733
Proceed.

594
00:30:33,052 --> 00:30:33,572
Hu Dewang.

595
00:30:33,812 --> 00:30:36,093
I'm the defense attorney

596
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:37,013
of Defendant Qian Tianxin.

597
00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:39,532
I have several questions for you.

598
00:30:39,812 --> 00:30:41,212
Please answer with honesty.

599
00:30:41,452 --> 00:30:41,932
Yes.

600
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:42,532
First of all,

601
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:46,172
when did you get to know Qian Tianxin?

602
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:50,133
I met her when I was in Country A.

603
00:30:50,493 --> 00:30:54,292
Did you see or know that Qian Tianxin

604
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:58,373
embezzled the illicit funds involved in the case?

605
00:30:58,493 --> 00:31:00,292
I don't know.

606
00:31:01,253 --> 00:31:02,253
When you were in Country A,

607
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:04,692
did you see or know that Qian Tianxin

608
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:06,692
was involved in murder conduct?

609
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:08,493
I don't know.

610
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:09,452
No more questions.

611
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:11,812
Bring all defendants in.

612
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:25,692
Defendant Qian Tianxin,
please state your defense.

613
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,172
Everything that happened

614
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:32,853
in Country A and Country F
was arranged by me alone.

615
00:31:33,613 --> 00:31:36,692
I instructed the murder of Zhang Wanru.

616
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:38,973
I'm not an accessory.

617
00:31:39,853 --> 00:31:41,572
Defense attorney of Qian Tianxin,

618
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,773
please state your defense.

619
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:46,973
Qian Tianxin didn't deny her conduct

620
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,733
of the cybercrime and she pled guilty.

621
00:31:48,932 --> 00:31:49,853
As her defense attorney,

622
00:31:50,052 --> 00:31:52,932
I have no objections to
her criminal facts and charges.

623
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:54,932
However, taking the court findings today

624
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:59,532
into consideration, there's no proof

625
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:06,052
that my client has taken in
all the illicit funds for personal gain.

626
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,373
My client has no direct influence
in the case.

627
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:11,093
She should be considered
as an accessory.

628
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:15,773
Besides, given the court findings,

629
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:18,332
the accusations of false imprisonment

630
00:32:18,373 --> 00:32:22,932
and intentional injuries
remain factually ambiguous.

631
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:24,493
Concerning factual ambiguity

632
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:25,613
and lack of evidence,

633
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:27,052
she shouldn't be convicted.

634
00:32:28,052 --> 00:32:30,613
I suggest she's convicted as
an accessory to fraud

635
00:32:30,812 --> 00:32:33,532
and sentenced to three years
in prison with probation.

636
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:35,172
We're willing to pay an additional fine.

637
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:38,853
Defendant Hu Dewang,

638
00:32:39,253 --> 00:32:40,532
please state your defense.

639
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,733
I plead guilty and
I made a voluntary confession,

640
00:32:44,093 --> 00:32:46,373
I hope for judicial leniency.

641
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:49,532
Defense attorney of Hu Dewang,

642
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:50,853
please state your defense.

643
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,373
Revered Presiding Judge and judges.

644
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:58,452
We're assigned as the defense attorneys

645
00:32:59,052 --> 00:33:01,373
entrusted by the family
of the defendant.

646
00:33:01,853 --> 00:33:03,812
We've come across the case files,

647
00:33:04,052 --> 00:33:06,332
met with the defendant
as well as run court investigations.

648
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:10,013
We have no objections to Hu Dewang's
criminal facts and charges.

649
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:12,692
However, as an accessory,

650
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:15,493
Hu Dewang pleads guilty and
has made a voluntary confession.

651
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:18,452
We suggest probation with a fine.

652
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:21,093
Prosecutor, please state your defense.

653
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,692
First of all,
I will start with Qian Tianxin's defense.

654
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,733
Firstly, although the illicit fund flow
is ambiguous

655
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,973
through the evidence rendered just now,

656
00:33:30,253 --> 00:33:34,093
victims' statement,
the transaction records and

657
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,212
chat messages provided by the victim.

658
00:33:35,412 --> 00:33:39,292
Statements made by numerous accomplices
who're the low-level runners

659
00:33:39,332 --> 00:33:40,452
aiming to conceal committed crimes,

660
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:44,853
customer service statements
of the defendants, and the chat messages

661
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:48,412
for identifying victims provided

662
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:49,932
by the customer service department.

663
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:51,653
The evidence mentioned above

664
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:55,052
justified all charges in the complaint.

665
00:33:55,493 --> 00:33:58,373
Secondly,
statements given by the defendants

666
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,812
justified the said illicit fund

667
00:33:59,853 --> 00:34:01,973
is being transferred
into the bank account of the fraud team

668
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:05,412
and is allocated
by Defendant Qian Tianxin,

669
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:06,692
and the fund disappeared.

670
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:10,732
Therefore, it indicates Qian Tianxin
played a significant role in the fraud case.

671
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:13,052
Thirdly, the evidence proved

672
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:16,173
that Qian Tianxin engaged
in the murder of Zhang Wanru

673
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:18,213
by transmitting information

674
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:21,252
and she is considered as the accomplice
to the intentional homicide.

675
00:34:21,373 --> 00:34:23,893
To sum up,
I suggest compounded sentences,

676
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:26,052
sentence Qian Tianxin to death.

677
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:28,093
Next, I'll proceed to respond

678
00:34:28,133 --> 00:34:29,453
to the defense attorney of Hu Dewang.

679
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,332
Firstly, the statements provided
by Hu Dewang on the court

680
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:33,332
are contradictory.

681
00:34:34,012 --> 00:34:35,252
During the interrogation just now,

682
00:34:35,453 --> 00:34:36,373
according to Hu Dewang,

683
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:39,252
his description of Boss Zhang

684
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:43,292
shows that Boss Zhang would
simply reveal his information

685
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,133
to the members of a lower level.

686
00:34:45,332 --> 00:34:47,772
In contrast, his description
of Qian Tianxin displays

687
00:34:47,933 --> 00:34:50,613
her dominance over the entire fraud team

688
00:34:50,853 --> 00:34:53,012
with strict discipline and clear hierarchy.

689
00:34:53,693 --> 00:34:57,093
Therefore,
there's impossible for Boss Zhang

690
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,572
to rule over Qian Tianxin.

691
00:34:58,812 --> 00:35:00,572
Hu Dewang was lying.

692
00:35:00,653 --> 00:35:02,492
There's someone higher up.

693
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:05,173
Qian Tianxin,
I bet you don't know about this.

694
00:35:05,532 --> 00:35:06,812
When I brought you coffee that time,

695
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:08,613
I overheard

696
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,693
that you told a Chinese customer

697
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:13,413
that our organization,
including the Southeast Asia countries,

698
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:14,893
Country A and Country C,

699
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:17,572
the highest leader of all named A.

700
00:35:18,012 --> 00:35:21,213
So, A is the mastermind
you're supposed to catch.

701
00:35:21,572 --> 00:35:22,252
Hu Dewang.

702
00:35:22,572 --> 00:35:23,732
What a load of bull.

703
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:27,093
Your Honor, he fabricated the story.

704
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:31,252
Mastermind?

705
00:35:40,812 --> 00:35:41,453
(Jiangcheng Satellite TV)
Chairman Yin.

706
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,613
Why did you sit in today?

707
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:47,693
We, Huiquan,

708
00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:53,972
are a private high-tech company
in the city and we pay a lot of attention

709
00:35:54,373 --> 00:35:55,453
on cybercrime cases.

710
00:35:56,012 --> 00:35:59,613
We came here to observe
how those criminals

711
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:03,093
took advantage of the internet

712
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:07,693
so that we could
get enlightened and be alarmed.

713
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:09,173
This is also a warning

714
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,893
for our future new product development

715
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:15,413
on enhancing the firewall precisely

716
00:36:15,732 --> 00:36:17,653
as well as our self-defense awareness.

717
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:21,173
We're part of the people and we detest

718
00:36:21,653 --> 00:36:25,373
the crimes committed

719
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,173
by Qian Tianxin and her fraud team.

720
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:29,492
I fully support the court

721
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:31,653
for their impartial verdict.

722
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:34,972
What's your comment
on Zhang Xiaobei's testimony

723
00:36:35,012 --> 00:36:35,812
against Qian Tianxin?

724
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:39,732
We, Huiquan, have suffered

725
00:36:40,893 --> 00:36:42,332
hurtful treatment online

726
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:44,532
because of Zhang Xiaobei.

727
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,613
We came here

728
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,853
to show our support and
attention to this incident.

729
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:53,133
Zhang Xiaobei testified
against Qian Tianxin

730
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:55,893
because it's objective statements.

731
00:36:56,093 --> 00:36:59,332
And this means that the culprit

732
00:37:00,012 --> 00:37:03,133
of the harm inflicted on him
over the years is actually Qian Tianxin.

733
00:37:03,732 --> 00:37:05,693
I hope that Zhang Xiaobei

734
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:08,173
can move on as fast as possible

735
00:37:09,252 --> 00:37:11,732
and return to his bright and merry life

736
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:14,373
he used to be.

737
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:16,453
What would Huiquan do

738
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:18,572
to assist Zhang Xiaobei?

739
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,853
We'll approach him as soon as possible

740
00:37:21,693 --> 00:37:22,972
and ask for his permission.

741
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,373
Of course, we'll try
to satisfy his needs.

742
00:37:26,492 --> 00:37:27,213
Chairman Yin.

743
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,173
It's said that Huiquan has
encountered a financial pinch lately.

744
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,012
Is this true?

745
00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:33,812
Friends of the press,

746
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:36,772
please ignore the rumors
and don't spread them.

747
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:39,492
Huiquan Corporation

748
00:37:39,532 --> 00:37:41,133
is a responsible high-tech enterprise.

749
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,052
We received massive governmental support

750
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:46,812
and favors and aid from the capitals.

751
00:37:47,492 --> 00:37:50,292
Besides, all of our employees
are dedicated.

752
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:54,213
The company is healthy and enduring.

753
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:55,933
No worries.

754
00:37:57,252 --> 00:37:59,492
We have to leave for other business now.

755
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:00,332
Thank you so much.

756
00:38:00,933 --> 00:38:01,732
- Chairman Yin.
- Chairman Yin.

757
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:02,732
Is what you said factually true?

758
00:38:02,772 --> 00:38:03,572
Chairman Yin.

759
00:38:09,653 --> 00:38:10,693
That's enough, Hu Dewang.

760
00:38:11,012 --> 00:38:11,693
Stop shaking your leg.

761
00:38:11,732 --> 00:38:12,613
It's annoying.

762
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:13,893
I can't help it.

763
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,613
I'm nervous and I can't control it.

764
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:18,772
Hu Dewang.

765
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,532
How dare you lied right to my face?

766
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,972
What did you say to me before the trial?

767
00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:25,532
You told me you'd never heard of A.

768
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,613
I just remembered that.

769
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:30,173
You're still lying now.

770
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:32,213
It seems like you don't care
about mitigation.

771
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:33,492
You want harsher punishments, don't you?

772
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,373
Prosecutor, you don't have proof.

773
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:39,893
Don't simply accuse me of any crimes.

774
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:41,373
I have my own attorney.

775
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:42,693
You do.

776
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:44,613
Do you mean the renowned Barrister Jin?

777
00:38:45,052 --> 00:38:46,492
Can you afford to hire him?

778
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:51,292
My wife and neighbors chipped in.

779
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:52,252
And my friends too.

780
00:38:52,693 --> 00:38:53,093
Fine.

781
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,492
Assuming you're telling the truth.

782
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:55,332
I'll look into this myself, anyway.

783
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:56,933
I've been thinking

784
00:38:58,213 --> 00:38:59,853
about the reason why you did so.

785
00:38:59,893 --> 00:39:01,413
In fact, two people
will benefit from this.

786
00:39:01,532 --> 00:39:03,613
Qian Tianxin and you yourself.

787
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:05,812
But I doubted this
after giving it careful thought.

788
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:09,292
If you wanted to be absolved
from the crime, you would've confessed,

789
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:11,532
instead of confessing earlier today.

790
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:12,933
I've told you several times.

791
00:39:12,972 --> 00:39:14,373
I just remembered it.

792
00:39:14,772 --> 00:39:16,173
Attorney Jin has been reminding me

793
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:18,213
that I could only get mitigation
if I confess something crucial.

794
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,572
That's why I kept on
trying to recall things.

795
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,213
Attorney Jin has a reputation
for being difficult to hire.

796
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:27,373
It makes no sense for him
to travel all the way here to defend you.

797
00:39:28,093 --> 00:39:30,133
Even if he plans to gain fame on this,

798
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,332
Qian Tianxin is a better choice, not you.

799
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,653
Are you entitled to interfere with
the attorney I hired?

800
00:39:37,693 --> 00:39:39,413
Isn't that my freedom to do so?

801
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:39,772
Yes.

802
00:39:39,972 --> 00:39:41,012
You have the right to do so.

803
00:39:41,653 --> 00:39:43,613
But if you make false confessions,

804
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:44,812
I'm entitled to it.

805
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:49,213
Prosecutor,
you don't have evidence against me.

806
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:51,453
Don't make any judgments yet.

807
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:55,613
No fabricated confession, coerced
confession, or self-incrimination.

808
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:59,772
What a scripted line. You came prepared.

809
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:02,572
In fact, it doesn't really matter
whether you confess or not.

810
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:04,012
Let me tell you the laws.

811
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:04,732
To render a conviction,

812
00:40:04,972 --> 00:40:06,453
evidence is more crucial
than confession.

813
00:40:07,252 --> 00:40:10,732
The one Attorney Jin helps
is Qian Tianxin, not you.

814
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:12,853
Of course, if you confess the truth,

815
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:14,052
it helps in mitigation.

816
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:16,492
But if the confession is false,
it goes otherwise.

817
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,373
You know what to do.

818
00:40:28,012 --> 00:40:30,653
Fine. I'll confess.

819
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:33,812
I didn't want to mention A at first

820
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:35,492
because I didn't want
to complicate things.

821
00:40:36,213 --> 00:40:37,933
But Attorney Jin told me
to reveal this person.

822
00:40:38,213 --> 00:40:40,933
He said that
as long as I listened to him,

823
00:40:41,292 --> 00:40:42,572
my family would receive a sum of money

824
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,572
that could sustain their lives
till I was released.

825
00:40:45,812 --> 00:40:46,532
In this case,

826
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,893
you did hear about A from Qian Tianxin.

827
00:40:50,453 --> 00:40:50,972
Yes, I did.

828
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,492
As clear as day.

829
00:40:55,572 --> 00:40:57,572
What else do you know about A?

830
00:40:59,572 --> 00:41:00,972
I'm just a nobody.

831
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:05,853
Qian Tianxin wouldn't reveal
anything important to me.

832
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:09,332
(Weekly Business Meeting)
Everyone.

833
00:41:10,173 --> 00:41:11,772
Given the current market shares,

834
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:14,213
Huibo is going to dominate the industry

835
00:41:14,812 --> 00:41:17,133
with a little more effort.

836
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:21,373
Only by doing so,
can we earn favor of the capitals.

837
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,772
Because those investors

838
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:27,093
only invest in leading companies.

839
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:33,893
Xiao Mu'en.
Do you have different thoughts on this?

840
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:44,732
Chairman.
It might not sound pleasant to you.

841
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:46,252
But for the sake of the company,

842
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:48,532
I must be real with you.

843
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:51,413
Previously, the company

844
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:54,613
has poured in money for the expansion.

845
00:41:55,173 --> 00:41:58,173
We've shelled out
to expand the client pool

846
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,052
and compete for users

847
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:01,492
as well as the publicity.

848
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:04,613
To build our core competency,

849
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,012
we have paid

850
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:09,492
famous live streamers highly
from outside.

851
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,572
Besides, we cultivated
novice live steamers too.

852
00:42:12,093 --> 00:42:13,052
If there's one day

853
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:14,732
something happens to me,

854
00:42:15,252 --> 00:42:17,213
protect yourself and A.

855
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,052
Listen to A.

856
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:26,213
You sound like
you're determined to protect him,

857
00:42:26,893 --> 00:42:28,012
even though you might be going to jail.

858
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:30,933
We must be realistic.

859
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:33,572
We're pulling the chestnuts
out of the fire in a dreadful situation.

860
00:42:34,213 --> 00:42:36,173
Sometimes, opportunities and risks

861
00:42:36,213 --> 00:42:37,052
come in an equivalent cost.

862
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:38,173
(Let's end it now.)

863
00:42:38,373 --> 00:42:39,093
(We've had enough money)

864
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:40,572
(that supports our entire lives.)

865
00:42:41,213 --> 00:42:43,012
(I've been in too deep long ago.)

866
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:45,252
(We must come alive to the reality.)

867
00:42:45,693 --> 00:42:47,173
I'll ask you this one last time.

868
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:49,732
If something happens one day,

869
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,532
between me and him,

870
00:42:55,213 --> 00:42:56,052
