00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,081
How did you uncover

16
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,880
their address on the internet?

17
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,681
We have ways

18
00:01:47,081 --> 00:01:49,001
to restore the deleted conversation

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,920
and any cached data.

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,880
Let me seriously

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,001
introduce myself.

22
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:03,160
I am an expert on the dark web.

23
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:05,401
I once worked

24
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:06,200
as a spy in the dark internet

25
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,761
and no one found out.

26
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,561
I can enter and leave it

27
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:11,360
undetected.

28
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:14,481
Are you bluffing or serious?

29
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:17,681
It's true. It's all in the file.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,440
Look up Han Xuan.

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,600
- All right.
- I'll bring them to you next time.

32
00:02:27,561 --> 00:02:28,600
- Mr. Xiao?
- Prosecutor An!

33
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:30,681
Why are you here?

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,481
To pick you up.

35
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,121
Jiao must...

36
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,800
I could take the cab.

37
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:37,681
I'm here already.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,321
All right, thank you.

39
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,401
Can I say something?

40
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,600
Sure.

41
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:45,600
Well,

42
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:48,160
we have known each other
for a while now.

43
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:49,561
Can you stop calling me

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,561
Mr. Xiao in private?

45
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:51,401
It feels

46
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,761
it's too formal.

47
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,201
Just call me Xiao Mu'en.

48
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:55,921
Sure, Xiao Mu'en.

49
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:57,641
Hop in.

50
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,201
Thanks.

51
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,841
Sorry. Did I startle you?

52
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
I didn't know

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,561
you listen to symphony, Mr. Xiao.

54
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,800
Aren't you a science person?

55
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,481
Didn't we agree

56
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,160
to stop using

57
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:30,160
Mr. Xiao?

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,761
Okay.

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,880
You have great taste, Xiao Mu'en.

60
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:36,960
Indulge my curiosity, Prosecutor An.

61
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:39,240
In your mind, what kind of music

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,641
does a science person

63
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
listen to?

64
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,481
You told me to stop using Mr. Xiao,

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,960
but you call me Prosecutor An.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
Is that right?

67
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,481
My bad.

68
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:48,880
I think a science person

69
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,281
will listen to folk music.

70
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:55,481
Why is that?

71
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,800
Most people from prestigious universities

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,800
become singers

73
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:02,921
and sing folk music.

74
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:05,080
What about you?

75
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,000
What kind of music do you listen to?

76
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,201
I usually...

77
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:13,160
I'm not going to tell you.

78
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,041
Take a guess.

79
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,361
Heavy metal?

80
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:25,120
Wow, good.

81
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,201
I see I'm a rock dude

82
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,120
in your eyes.

83
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,241
No, no.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,160
I don't mean that.

85
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:32,081
No, it's great.

86
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,560
I can be your buddy.

87
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:35,801
No, but uhm, I enjoy listening
to Xiangsheng.

88
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,880
Xiangsheng?

89
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:39,000
That's not music.

90
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:40,641
Why not?

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,880
It has got rhythm. It has got lyrics.

92
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:44,880
It's music.

93
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,560
- Right?
- You're not wrong.

94
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,641
No? No?

95
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:54,761
- It's delicious.
- It's hot, blow it.

96
00:04:56,361 --> 00:04:57,081
I like

97
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,641
what I'm seeing in your family.

98
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:01,000
Yonggang, don't ruin it.

99
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:02,801
It's all thanks to you two.

100
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,361
Yonggang, say a toast.

101
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:05,041
Right.

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
No need. We're family.

103
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,440
- Mr. Xiao.
- Yonggang.

104
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,120
An Ni.

105
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,961
Do you like it?

106
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,321
Do you?

107
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,400
You're looking at orange juice?

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Want some orange juice, Ning?

109
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:18,801
Go get yourself a baby, since you like children.

110
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,361
You like babies too, don't you,
Mr. Xiao?

111
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,280
I knew they were

112
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,801
trying to set us up.

113
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,160
Ignore her, Mr. Xiao.

114
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,280
Feed your child already.

115
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,840
She's staring at you.

116
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:31,641
Come.

117
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:32,921
Aunt An Ni told me to feed you.

118
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,400
Look.

119
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,241
Sheesh.

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,481
She's full.

121
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,880
She's sleepy.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,280
Right, sleepy.

123
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,801
Come.

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,000
Let me tuck you in.

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,840
Stay there.

126
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,361
I'll handle it.

127
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:43,201
You haven't eaten.

128
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,041
- Eat.
- Okay.

129
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,600
- Daddy will tuck you in.
- It's time to sleep.

130
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:47,921
Go take a nap.

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,361
She's so upset.

132
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,041
You'll sleep soon, baby.

133
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,020
It's okay.

134
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:57,761
Go to bed.

135
00:05:57,961 --> 00:05:58,600
Bye.

136
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,241
Bye.

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,081
He'll be back soon.

138
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,961
Easy.

139
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,361
Here, cheers.

140
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,521
I need a drink.

141
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,120
He has been trying lately.

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,961
Didn't you give him 30,000 yuan

143
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,880
as bonus?

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,720
He spent 25,000 of it to buy me a bag.

145
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:19,600
He shouldn't have done that.

146
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,041
But I do hope

147
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:22,801
that he can stay this way.

148
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,560
I don't want anything else.

149
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,481
Mr. Xiao, please take care of him.

150
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
I will.

151
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,120
Another toast to you, Mr. Xiao.

152
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,880
Don't forget him if you get a bonus.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,921
Sure.

154
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,120
I can tell

155
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,321
Yonggang turned over a new leaf.

156
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,880
He learned his lesson.

157
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,961
I hope he stays this way.

158
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,921
That's easy.

159
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:53,400
I just need fresh ingredients.

160
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,440
Then, I'll steam it for 15 minutes

161
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,921
before pouring hot garlic oil on it.

162
00:06:59,081 --> 00:06:59,921
Let me

163
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,081
cook for you

164
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,041
one day.

165
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:02,921
Sure.

166
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,880
I'll invite Xiaojiao and Yonggang.

167
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,481
Okay.

168
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,481
I have arrived.

169
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,761
This wonderful day ends here.

170
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:13,521
Rest early.

171
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:14,400
I'll go back now.

172
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
Sure, Mr. Xiao.

173
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,481
Go back.

174
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,801
I want to walk for a bit

175
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,160
to help me digest.

176
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,521
I'll keep you company.

177
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,521
Okay.

178
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,160
I do need to get my sports in for today.

179
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,041
You do sports usually?

180
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,400
I go to the gym after work

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,801
if I have time.

182
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,321
No wonder.

183
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,761
You walk a lot too.

184
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,720
Because you always take the most steps

185
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:37,241
on my WeChat friend list.

186
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,081
Really? I'll work harder then.

187
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
You are too busy

188
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,241
to exercise, aren't you?

189
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,600
Yeah.

190
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:47,600
I still suggest you

191
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:49,600
do some exercise.

192
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,280
Health is priceless.

193
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:53,961
Okay.

194
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,600
I will remember your advice, Mr. Xiao.

195
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,641
By the way,

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,801
I watched the press conference.

197
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,521
Your speech was amazing.

198
00:08:05,641 --> 00:08:06,521
It's concise and comprehensive.

199
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:10,840
It's my job.

200
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:14,041
No, you clearly

201
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,440
put effort into it.

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,160
Sometimes, I feel bad

203
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,600
for those

204
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,641
who work in IT.

205
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
You have to be competitive

206
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,000
and you also have
to practice discretion.

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,321
It's risky.

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
Anything can happen

209
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,961
in an instant.

210
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,040
Don't jinx it, please.

211
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:34,521
However, if we do everything right,

212
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:36,440
then we have nothing to fear.

213
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,680
My company is not good enough.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,161
Not good enough?

215
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,961
Mr. Xiao,

216
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,040
you work so hard every day.

217
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,920
Just how lofty is your goal?

218
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,161
That's a good question.

219
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:55,321
Your company was acquired by Huiquan.

220
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,641
Isn't that good enough?

221
00:09:00,521 --> 00:09:01,920
Truth be told,

222
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,401
I was forced to relinquish

223
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,880
Green Broadcasting.

224
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,081
There are two reasons.

225
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:11,480
One,

226
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,480
my longtime employees

227
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,360
deserve a break and a huge payout.

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,880
Ambition

229
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:21,521
cannot fill your stomach.

230
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,920
And they have a family to feed.

231
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,040
Two,

232
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,081
to keep a fledgling company

233
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,120
like Green Broadcasting

234
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,680
alive,

235
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,721
we need

236
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,521
investors like Huiquan.

237
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:39,521
Green Broadcasting

238
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,480
is my brainchild.

239
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:43,880
I hate to let it go.

240
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,480
But it's the best option for its future.

241
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:49,880
I see.

242
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,120
I thought people in IT were filthy rich.

243
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,321
Only by funding more capital

244
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,360
that we can innovate.

245
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:00,081
Green Broadcasting

246
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:02,161
is just a platform

247
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,440
for its users to entertain themselves.

248
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,641
There are many users.

249
00:10:07,961 --> 00:10:11,040
But the ones making bank
are the streamers and the e-merchants.

250
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,961
Our profit

251
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,961
comes from the ads and the subscription.

252
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,360
If you take into account
the maintenance cost,

253
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,641
we earn peanuts.

254
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,680
We are poor.

255
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:20,040
You forgot

256
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,841
certain communities.

257
00:10:22,281 --> 00:10:23,961
Some people splurge

258
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,321
or even take out loans

259
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:26,920
to donate.

260
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,560
They should be stopped, I agree.

261
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,321
That explains a lot of things.

262
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,761
Zhao Jikai

263
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:35,920
only wears branded goods

264
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,680
but you prefer to dress plainly.

265
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:41,680
Different pursuits, I assume.

266
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:44,841
Is my attire that repulsive?

267
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,321
I didn't say that.

268
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I was joking.

269
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,761
What if you find yourself

270
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,920
at odds with the vision

271
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,060
Huiquan has
regarding Green Broadcasting?

272
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:55,940
What will you do?

273
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,081
Or what if you regret selling it?

274
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,120
What will you do?

275
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,440
I will always prioritize

276
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:02,920
my users.

277
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,521
Certain lines cannot be crossed.

278
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,761
No exception.

279
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,880
You're so serious.

280
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,601
Is that bad?

281
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,440
No,

282
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,161
it's wonderful to have this resolution.

283
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,440
I was just surprised
by how serious you look.

284
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,961
Anyway,

285
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,401
you are very inquisitive today.

286
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,120
Is that your work habit?

287
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,161
Afraid now?

288
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:28,721
Afraid of?

289
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,161
You?

290
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,721
Only guilty people are afraid of you.

291
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:33,961
And I

292
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,360
have done nothing wrong.

293
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:38,641
Yes, you're right.

294
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,281
That's why you should never overeat.

295
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,200
(Mr. Xiao)

296
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,880
Darling, Mr. Xiao's calling you.

297
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,961
Mr. Xiao,

298
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
aren't you supposed to walk An Ni home?

299
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,641
Why did you come back?

300
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Did you leave something at my place?

301
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:06,641
Oh. Okay.

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,721
I'll come down now.

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,521
Okay.

304
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,201
What's the matter?

305
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:15,440
Mr. Xiao came back

306
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,920
and wanted to talk to me.

307
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,521
It's better to talk here then.

308
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
It's late.

309
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:22,721
I should go down and meet him.

310
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,521
All right.

311
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,321
Mr. Xiao, don't just stand here.

312
00:12:40,321 --> 00:12:41,841
Let's chat at my place.

313
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:46,401
Yonggang.

314
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:48,721
No need to come to the office tomorrow.

315
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,440
You're fired.

316
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,161
Wait.

317
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,601
Why?

318
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,521
As my boss, you can fire me,

319
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:02,360
but you need to give me a justification.

320
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:04,321
My team has been toiling

321
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,800
to develop the latest version

322
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,880
of Huibo.

323
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,321
We work overtime every day and you're...

324
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,120
Dismissing you

325
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,040
has nothing to do with your work capability.

326
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,920
I'm dismissing you because you've been gambling.

327
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,880
Mr. Xiao, I don't gamble anymore.

328
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:21,800
I quit gambling, Mr. Xiao.

329
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,761
You quit, huh?

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, let me ask you this.

331
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,641
How did you get the money
to buy your wife the purse?

332
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,841
No, I...

333
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,480
I couldn't help myself, Mr. Xiao.

334
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,081
Mr. Xiao.

335
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,961
I'm a jerk.

336
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,401
I'm an animal, Mr. Xiao.

337
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,281
I'm the greatest fool.

338
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,401
Drop the act already!

339
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:46,401
How many times has it been?

340
00:13:46,761 --> 00:13:48,000
Have you really quit gambling?

341
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,360
Mr. Xiao.

342
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,360
You know my situation.

343
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,281
It's been really stressful lately.

344
00:13:58,841 --> 00:13:59,761
I have to feed

345
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,841
my wife and my baby.

346
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,961
I don't want them to suffer.

347
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:05,401
I don't want them to worry

348
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:07,401
about food.

349
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,201
Mr. Xiao, don't fire me, please.

350
00:14:09,321 --> 00:14:10,800
If you fire me,

351
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
I don't know where to go.

352
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:15,000
I...

353
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:18,521
Yonggang.

354
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,201
There is no shortcut.

355
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,761
You work for me for many years.

356
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,161
I don't want to be this harsh

357
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,480
but I can't bring

358
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,601
myself to see you fall like this.

359
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,161
This will be last your warning.

360
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,521
Stop gambling.

361
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:43,161
It's my last warning.

362
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,081
Don't let me down.

363
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,641
Don't let your wife down.

364
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,360
Hey.

365
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,601
It's me, dude.

366
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,120
How's everything?

367
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,841
Weren't you trying
to increase your wager?

368
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,800
(The result will be out soon.)

369
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,281
I quit.

370
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,321
(What? You quit?)

371
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:31,360
What do you mean?

372
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:33,240
I already started the game for you.

373
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,601
I have insider news.

374
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:37,401
(My friend told me.)

375
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,560
I said, I quit!

376
00:15:39,601 --> 00:15:41,321
Don't you understand?

377
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,470
(Procuratorate)

378
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:00,401
Ni,

379
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,641
you're in a great mood.

380
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
So? Is it official yet?

381
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:06,240
What?

382
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,240
With the young entrepreneur, Xiao Mu'en.

383
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,081
Perhaps you should

384
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,440
go to hospital to check.

385
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:13,920
But you two...

386
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,750
(Xiao Mu'en)

387
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,040
See? Admit it already.

388
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,360
He confessed.

389
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:23,680
He sent it by mistake.

390
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
We're friends. How can he send this?

391
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,161
Wow, look.

392
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:28,680
Tech-savvy guys are different.

393
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,321
They impress girls with technology.

394
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,281
I actually quite like Mr. Xiao.

395
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,321
He's a gentleman.

396
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,721
And at your age, dating is more

397
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,360
grounded.

398
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,321
Really?

399
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,761
If you like him that much,

400
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,961
date him then.

401
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,601
Come to the police station
with me later.

402
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:48,201
Again?

403
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,761
Is there an issue?

404
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,360
No.

405
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,680
What was that text? Geez.

406
00:17:01,081 --> 00:17:02,161
You're back.

407
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:03,641
Anything from the Tech Department?

408
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
They are unable to glean

409
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:07,920
anything from what

410
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:08,920
Zhu Xin

411
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,920
told us.

412
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,760
This is what we have now.

413
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,481
Look.

414
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,601
Some are for one-time use only.

415
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,721
In other words,

416
00:17:15,841 --> 00:17:18,321
you get an error 404

417
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,361
when you click on it.

418
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,081
Some can self-destruct.

419
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:24,920
If an expert

420
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,481
removes the pre-installed trojan,

421
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,841
it will delete everything

422
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,321
and damage your equipment.

423
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:32,721
And some cannot

424
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:34,321
be identified.

425
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,560
You cannot do anything with it.

426
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:37,680
This kind of evidence

427
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,440
originates from a foreign server

428
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,721
or a VPN.

429
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,640
We can trace it,

430
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:44,800
but we cannot

431
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:46,321
dig further

432
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
to find more information.

433
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,001
Explain, please?

434
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:50,881
In conclusion,

435
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,680
all evidence indicates

436
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:54,760
that the culprit is someone

437
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,841
or a group well-versed
in data encryption

438
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,881
who wants to cover their track.

439
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:01,241
In a word,

440
00:18:01,361 --> 00:18:03,160
we can see them, but we can't catch them

441
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,001
and track them, we have no ways.

442
00:18:05,961 --> 00:18:07,800
So Zhu Xin confessed

443
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,560
for nothing?

444
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,280
Master, relax.

445
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm not done yet.

446
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,400
We got something too.

447
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,001
We have leads

448
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:17,300
on Zhu Xin's agent.

449
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:18,090
(Serve the Party and People,
Fairness and Transparency)

450
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,040
Can't you tell me everything in one go?

451
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
I picked it up from you.

452
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,001
Pick up something else.

453
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:32,881
Madam Zhan,

454
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,881
I have to temper your expectations.

455
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:36,961
Holding

456
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:38,640
a hearing

457
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:40,560
doesn't mean you will have

458
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,001
what you want.

459
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:43,361
It just means that your case

460
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,121
is grounds for a proper

461
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,040
investigation.

462
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,721
We are here

463
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,721
to defend justice.

464
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,640
And to do that, we need to rely on the laws.

465
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,361
Prosecutor An, are you trying

466
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,481
to tell me

467
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:58,640
that my demand will not be met?

468
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,680
Madam Zhan, calm down, please.

469
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:02,040
I just want you

470
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,280
to be prepared.

471
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,241
I will do my best

472
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,760
to use laws

473
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,520
to defend your rights.

474
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,881
But if the outcome is different
from your expectation,

475
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,760
I want you to accept it with composure.

476
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,640
We can then discuss the next step.

477
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,280
That's all.

478
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,400
So even you can't win this case?

479
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,081
Xiaohu died for nothing then.

480
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:27,881
Please have faith in us, Madam Zhan.

481
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,481
We have

482
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:30,881
your best interest at heart.

483
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,760
But here, people only look

484
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:34,601
at the evidence and proper procedures.

485
00:19:34,721 --> 00:19:36,881
This isn't just about Xiaohu.

486
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:38,601
Giving citizens

487
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:40,081
a safe internet space

488
00:19:40,361 --> 00:19:41,160
is a very

489
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,081
challenging task for us.

490
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,201
But...

491
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,481
But...

492
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,560
So what should I do then?

493
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:51,560
Obtain Xiaohu's game account.

494
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,160
Only by retrieving his account

495
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,201
that we can prove

496
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:56,640
if game addiction plays a part
in Xiaohu's death.

497
00:19:57,081 --> 00:19:58,481
Having evidence will help us

498
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:00,201
produce a better judgment.

499
00:20:01,001 --> 00:20:01,800
Madam Zhan.

500
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,361
Do you believe

501
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,440
in justice? In me?

502
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,881
I do.

503
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:09,560
Then tell them you agree

504
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
to settle and get Xiaohu's account back.

505
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,001
Let me handle the rest.

506
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:15,680
But if

507
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,841
they refuse?

508
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
They will not.

509
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,800
(Hearing,
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)

510
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,760
The hearing begins now.

511
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,881
Attending party one, Zhan Mei.

512
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,201
Attending party two, Huiquan Technology.

513
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,321
Zhan Mei does not agree

514
00:20:30,321 --> 00:20:32,520
with the appeal's result

515
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,601
and requested to hold this hearing

516
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,920
in this establishment.

517
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:40,081
The dispute provides enough grounds
to hold this hearing

518
00:20:40,601 --> 00:20:41,841
and it is decided

519
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:44,881
that the hearing will take place
in Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

520
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,081
I am the Prosecutor-General,

521
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:48,321
Guo Hongjiang,

522
00:20:48,601 --> 00:20:50,721
who will preside over this hearing.

523
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:53,400
First and foremost, I thank

524
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
the three jurors for their time.

525
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,241
(Hearing, Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)
Both parties may now

526
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,361
lay out their demand.

527
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,601
Plaintiff, you first.

528
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,961
I'm here for my son.

529
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,361
If they won't give me an answer,

530
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:10,081
I will keep pestering them.

531
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,520
For days. For months. For years.

532
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:14,440
I will spend the rest

533
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:16,721
of my life fighting

534
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,881
this legal battle against Huiquan.

535
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:21,481
You didn't commit a tort.

536
00:21:21,841 --> 00:21:23,001
But it must be something.

537
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,201
You need to be held accountable.

538
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:28,601
Huiquan needs to be held accountable.

539
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
Defendant, anything you'd like to add?

540
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,190
(Defendant)

541
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,841
(Defendant)
Nothing.

542
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:36,001
The judges

543
00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:38,201
have made everything clear.

544
00:21:38,201 --> 00:21:40,601
There is no need to waste time
on this debacle.

545
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,280
And if I may say so,

546
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,321
although Huiquan is being sued here,

547
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,640
we reserve the right
to take legal action.

548
00:21:49,721 --> 00:21:52,160
I believe our legal department

549
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,241
will protect our own interests.

550
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,881
Of course, I believe in the law

551
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,520
and the judiciary body,

552
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
such as Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

553
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,961
Huiquan bears no liability

554
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:02,841
and will not pay for any damages.

555
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,640
Please continue, Prosecutor Guo.

556
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,121
We have listened

557
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:10,400
to the arguments put out
by both parties,

558
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,440
especially Madam Zhan Mei's.

559
00:22:12,881 --> 00:22:13,601
In the meantime,

560
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:16,601
we also explained to Madam Zhan

561
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
the relevant laws.

562
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:20,920
We confirm that the court proceedings

563
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,280
are legit

564
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,680
and the application of laws

565
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,961
is appropriate.

566
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,361
So

567
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:29,920
can we call it a day?

568
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,241
Please stay, defendant.

569
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,520
Madam Zhan Mei would like

570
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,040
to retrieve his son's game account.

571
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,721
Game account?

572
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,520
This is a hearing to confirm

573
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,241
that Huiquan did not commit a tort.

574
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,601
Huiquan will not indulge
in the unreasonable demand

575
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:48,760
of someone who disrespects
the court decision.

576
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:51,680
As the mother, Madam Zhan Mei

577
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,640
is well within her rights to retrieve
her son's game account.

578
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,680
The whole saga has become

579
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,481
a hot topic in society.

580
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,601
If you force me to surrender

581
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:05,800
Shi Xiaohu's game account

582
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:09,121
just to find out
that Huiquan is innocent all this time,

583
00:23:09,481 --> 00:23:10,280
the rumor

584
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,800
would have destroyed a local company

585
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,400
like Huiquan.

586
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,680
It is a simple request.

587
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:17,920
Turning it down

588
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,920
will only make Huiquan
look more suspicious,

589
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,520
thus creating more rumors.

590
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,361
This is

591
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,881
Shi Xiaohu's death certificate
from the hospital.

592
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:27,001
Shi Xiaohu was a university student.

593
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,160
Zhan Mei is his guarding

594
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:31,961
and his only next-of-kin.

595
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,121
His next-of-kin has the rights

596
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:36,560
to request digital assets

597
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,640
pertaining to Xiaohu's game account.

598
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:40,321
According to applicable laws,

599
00:23:40,321 --> 00:23:40,920
Huiquan

600
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,760
must surrender Shi Xiaohu's game account

601
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,721
to his mother.

602
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,520
According to the game's user agreement,

603
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,121
all account information belongs
to the game developer.

604
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:49,881
So in the event of death,

605
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:50,841
the account information

606
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:52,881
cannot be handed out
to the victim's family.

607
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,601
The inheritance law
in the Civil Code states

608
00:23:54,721 --> 00:23:56,481
that estate refers to the assets left

609
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
following the death of a natural person.

610
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,721
That includes

611
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,680
Shi Xiaohu's game account.

612
00:24:01,961 --> 00:24:04,680
In addition, Shi Xiaohu used
the account regularly.

613
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,280
Which means the game account

614
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,520
now constitutes
a property of significant

615
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,721
sentimental values to the heir.

616
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,560
Prosecutor An,

617
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,721
you claim that the game account

618
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,520
contains significant sentimental values
to the heir.

619
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,400
Please allow me

620
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,961
to confirm this with Madam Zhan Mei.

621
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,201
Madam Zhan, may I know

622
00:24:22,201 --> 00:24:24,440
why you wish to inherit

623
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,081
Shi Xiaohu's game account?

624
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,881
I miss him.

625
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,400
Okay.

626
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,721
Have you played online games before?

627
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,601
Or have you

628
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:37,440
played any other online games?

629
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:41,040
No.

630
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,321
In that case,

631
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,241
how do you plan to commemorate

632
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,440
your son with his game account?

633
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,040
"She is like a prison warden.

634
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:52,841
She won't let me play.

635
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,321
I want to leave this home,

636
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:56,881
my mom,

637
00:24:57,321 --> 00:24:58,841
and this world."

638
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,081
You did everything

639
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:02,881
to stop Xiaohu from playing.

640
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:04,121
And now,

641
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,881
you're claiming that you want his game account
to commemorate him.

642
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:09,800
Isn't it far-fetched?

643
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,400
You just disclosed the account owner's

644
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,081
information without his consent.

645
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,481
The information is stored
in Huiquan's server

646
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,081
so it is part of Huiquan's assets.

647
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:19,640
We did not violate any laws here.

648
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:23,081
Besides, this line is his signature.

649
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:24,280
Anyone who meets him in the game

650
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
will see this.

651
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,361
It's not sensitive information

652
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,721
so there's no infringement of privacy.

653
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,400
Respectfully, Miss Li,

654
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,881
you asked me why

655
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:39,121
a non-gamer like me

656
00:25:39,321 --> 00:25:42,920
wants to retrieve my son's account.

657
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,160
I guess

658
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:46,920
I have two reasons why.

659
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:50,121
First, I'm not a saint.

660
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,560
I just want

661
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,961
to log

662
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,081
into his account,

663
00:25:57,961 --> 00:25:59,560
to see the fictitious world

664
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,680
that he cherished so much.

665
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:03,481
What's so good about it?

666
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:07,800
Yes, my son is gone.

667
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:11,121
Maybe

668
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,721
I was too harsh on him.

669
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:15,920
Maybe I was like a warden.

670
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:18,001
I admit that.

671
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,400
I have no one now.

672
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,160
If the game gave him solace,

673
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,601
then count me in.

674
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:29,520
I want to revisit

675
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:33,001
what he saw,

676
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:36,321
to experience his joy

677
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:38,160
and pain.

678
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,040
This is my only wish

679
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:43,201
as a mother.

680
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:49,680
Second,

681
00:26:51,201 --> 00:26:53,001
Xiaohu is an expensive lesson.

682
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,001
I want

683
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:56,881
to log into his account to see

684
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:58,640
if there is anything useful.

685
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:00,440
If he has online friends

686
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,680
who are in similar situations,

687
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,400
I want to talk to them.

688
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,800
(Juror)
To guide them away from the wrong path.

689
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,800
To save them

690
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:11,961
and their family.

691
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,400
That is my goal.

692
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:23,241
There are three criteria to fulfill

693
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,001
for an individual
to inherit digital assets.

694
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,321
Other than the sentimental values

695
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,400
claimed by the plaintiff just now,

696
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,280
the digital asset

697
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,481
also has to possess
some economic values.

698
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,201
Verified accounts or independent

699
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:38,560
news accounts have commercial values

700
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,881
and thus, can be inherited.

701
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,201
Shi Xiaohu bought skins

702
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,361
and costumes in the video game

703
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:46,721
so his account
possesses economic values.

704
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,800
Prosecutor An.

705
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,881
Please do not interrupt my speech.

706
00:27:49,961 --> 00:27:52,400
Besides, you do not have Xiaohu's

707
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,440
game account

708
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,961
so please do not fabricate facts

709
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,321
without proper investigation.

710
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:00,881
I'll continue.

711
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,440
The third criterion, also the most
important one,

712
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,081
is whether the asset is part

713
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:07,640
of the individual's social interactions.

714
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,721
Numerical digital assets

715
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,481
such as virtual currency or coupons

716
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,280
can be inherited.

717
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,601
But parasocial digital assets,

718
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:19,400
such as social media accounts,
cannot be inherited.

719
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,121
In a video game,

720
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,841
we create an avatar.

721
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:25,001
It's like an extension of us,

722
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:26,640
but in a virtual world.

723
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,201
It is part of our social interactions.

724
00:28:28,361 --> 00:28:30,440
It is not an object.

725
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,361
It's more like a persona

726
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,440
and persona cannot be inherited.

727
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,721
When it comes to the law,
appealing to emotions

728
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:39,361
doesn't mean you're
automatically in the right.

729
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:55,040
We can all see how much

730
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,121
Madam Zhan Mei loves her son here.

731
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:58,160
I have said what I needed to say

732
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,881
but that is not enough

733
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,961
to convince Miss Li.

734
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,201
Shi Xiaohu's suicide

735
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:05,640
is an independent event.

736
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,280
It has nothing to do with Huiquan.

737
00:29:07,321 --> 00:29:08,160
Prosecutor An,

738
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:10,560
if you want our server data,

739
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,560
you can have it.

740
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
We won't stop you.

741
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,920
But that will take some time.

742
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:18,280
Besides, Zhang Xiaobei is missing

743
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,560
and our lead is pointing to Huiquan.

744
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:21,721
Like Shi Xiaohu's case,

745
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,280
the disappearance of Zhang Xiaobei

746
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,481
has nothing to do with us.

747
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,680
We are not liable.

748
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,321
If Madam Zhan Mei

749
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:30,280
insists on retrieving

750
00:29:30,321 --> 00:29:32,760
her son's account data,

751
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,121
we will stand our ground.

752
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:36,680
Are you sure?

753
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:38,520
You do not have evidence

754
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,640
that indicates that Shi Xiaohu's account

755
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,081
possesses economic values.

756
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,520
If I do?

757
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:45,321
According to three criteria,

758
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,640
Madam Zhan Mei can inherit
her son's digital asset.

759
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,881
You do not have access

760
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,640
to Xiaohu's game account.

761
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,841
How can you prove that his account

762
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,481
has economic values?

763
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,841
Three minutes ago,

764
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,121
someone topped up 3,000 yuan

765
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,241
to Shi Xiaohu's game account.

766
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:04,721
Can you please verify?

767
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:06,721
If you can't verify,

768
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,400
we will initiate
the necessary procedures.

769
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,440
Are you willing to settle?

770
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,680
Yes, I  believe you.

771
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:31,440
What about you, Defendant?

772
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:33,680
Yes.

773
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,150
(Civil Settlement Agreement)

774
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,440
I know

775
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,520
Zhan Mei came to you.

776
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,280
Yitang.

777
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,721
Zhan Mei lost her son.

778
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,440
She just wants closure.

779
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,640
And you know

780
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:13,321
the tortious claim is right.

781
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,160
The procuratorate has the duty

782
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:16,680
to protect the local university students.

783
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,601
We will step in to help.

784
00:31:19,881 --> 00:31:22,601
You did well today.

785
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:23,800
It's been

786
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,520
a while since we last fought each other
like this.

787
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,081
I think the previous time was

788
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:30,241
when we were at university?

789
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:32,201
Time flies.

790
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:34,400
An Ni.

791
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,040
I know you

792
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:37,800
as much as you know me.

793
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:39,241
You are a prosecutor.

794
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,481
Your job is to be neutral

795
00:31:41,481 --> 00:31:42,841
and objective.

796
00:31:43,241 --> 00:31:46,241
But you always make the same mistake.

797
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:48,440
You empathize.

798
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,001
It was your idea
to get his account data, wasn't it?

799
00:31:52,321 --> 00:31:53,280
I know you think

800
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,440
that I'm impartial to Zhan Mei.

801
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,721
However,

802
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,440
I need her son's game account
for something else too.

803
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,800
For other investigations.

804
00:32:01,841 --> 00:32:02,721
Like Zhang Xiaobei?

805
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,881
Put yourself in my shoes.

806
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,920
Zhang Xiaobei is framing Huiquan,

807
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:11,321
he baseless

808
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:13,481
pinned a label on Huiquan.

809
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:16,601
And it is my job

810
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:18,321
to clear Huiquan's name.

811
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
If Huiquan is innocent,

812
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,920
you have nothing to fear.

813
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:23,321
This could be your chance

814
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:24,881
to prove your innocence.

815
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,680
It's not that simple.

816
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,201
It's about principles.

817
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,481
I don't want

818
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,440
to set a precedent.

819
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,841
Li Yitang,

820
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,881
that will happen

821
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:35,001
sooner or later.

822
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,841
It's not something you can agree
or refuse.

823
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:39,040
Zhan Mei has the rights
to retrieve her son's account data.

824
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,721
She can contest it in the court

825
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:42,400
and she will probably win.

826
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,520
If things go out of control

827
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,001
and someone spins a story,

828
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:46,201
Huiquan will look

829
00:32:46,201 --> 00:32:47,640
even worse.

830
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:49,361
Why don't you engage proactively

831
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:50,481
and bring out the integrity

832
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:52,280
that I know Huiquan has?

833
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:56,081
So this is what

834
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,001
the hearing

835
00:32:58,001 --> 00:33:00,440
is about.

836
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,800
I knew it. It is such a minor issue

837
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,280
but you jumped through hoops

838
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:06,961
to bring us together.

839
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:10,400
It was all part of your plan.

840
00:33:10,841 --> 00:33:12,400
Of course, I have to be prepared

841
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,601
against someone smart like you.

842
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:18,121
Either way, congratulations.

843
00:33:18,841 --> 00:33:20,321
Zhan Mei

844
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:22,241
picked the right person.

845
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,040
You found my weakness.

846
00:33:24,201 --> 00:33:25,841
Things would be so different

847
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:28,841
if it was another prosecutor.

848
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,920
You're not mad?

849
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,201
Work is work.

850
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,121
You're still my friend.

851
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,040
Let me see you off.

852
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:45,121
So many journalists.

853
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:46,241
You brought them here?

854
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,881
I thought you brought them here.

855
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:50,241
I asked Zhao Jikai
to keep a low profile.

856
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:51,241
It's not Huiquan.

857
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:52,400
Look.

858
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,321
There are too many of them.

859
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:54,680
I'll ask Han Xuan to deal with them.
Wait for me.

860
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,481
Have you lost your mind, Li Yitang?

861
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,601
How could you give Shi Xiaohu's account

862
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,160
to Zhan Mei just like that?

863
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:09,841
Just let her file a lawsuit against us.

864
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,081
We have both resources and time.

865
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,121
So let's just entertain her

866
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:13,720
and see if she can win one.

867
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:15,800
Listen here, Li Yitang.

868
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,401
This is not the time

869
00:34:17,401 --> 00:34:18,800
when you show your kindness, okay?

870
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,641
Where are your professional ethics?

871
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,881
What are you even thinking?

872
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:27,040
I'm doing all this for your sake and Huiquan's.

873
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,560
Zhan Mei ever

874
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,520
got the better of you.

875
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:30,720
If we were to involve in a lawsuit against her,

876
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,121
we would lose it for sure.

877
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,520
Besides, I'm a lawyer.

878
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:36,000
It remains my job to respect basic facts
from an objective perspective.

879
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,720
I don't care the outcome, okay?

880
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,000
I just know that you

881
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
caused the butterfly effect.

882
00:34:40,681 --> 00:34:41,401
And that

883
00:34:41,401 --> 00:34:42,520
gives the law enforcers

884
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,401
an excuse

885
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,401
to bother me

886
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:45,361
every day.

887
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,081
You're not helping.

888
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,841
You're making everything worse.

889
00:34:49,081 --> 00:34:49,960
Chairman

890
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,161
is coming back soon.

891
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
How am I supposed

892
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,720
to clean up this mess?

893
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,000
Officers will come in and out

894
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:57,681
of our office every day.

895
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:59,200
Do you know how ugly it will be?

896
00:34:59,921 --> 00:35:01,441
The rumor will be the death of us!

897
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,841
Who handles this hot mess? You?

898
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,040
Jikai.

899
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,681
What is going on?

900
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:13,361
Why are you

901
00:35:13,401 --> 00:35:15,441
so riled up over this matter?

902
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,321
I am your employee,

903
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,000
but I'm also your girlfriend.

904
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,401
Have you put yourself in my shoes?

905
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,800
What about me?

906
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,641
Take my spot then if you can.

907
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:33,520
I don't know you, after all.

908
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:42,520
Come back!

909
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:42,841
(Huaxin Villa, No. 20)
Come back!

910
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:46,260
(Huaxin Villa, No. 20)

911
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,280
Darling, I'm back.

912
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,881
Come to eat, the food is ready.

913
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:19,401
Cabbages again?

914
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:20,681
We have cabbages every day.

915
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,441
Can't we change things up?

916
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,601
What's wrong with cabbages?

917
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,081
In case you do not know,

918
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,841
cabbages and zucchinis are cheap.

919
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:30,881
So we'll have vegetables.

920
00:36:30,881 --> 00:36:32,641
It's just to fill our tummies.

921
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:35,641
What's wrong?

922
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,480
Bad day at work?

923
00:36:37,641 --> 00:36:40,321
Nothing.

924
00:36:40,921 --> 00:36:42,401
I just feel useless.

925
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:45,200
You have to worry about food.

926
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,200
You dummy.

927
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,401
I shouldn't have gambled.

928
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:53,921
Our money is spent in the gambling.

929
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,200
What is that?

930
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,921
Private savings.

931
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,841
I know.

932
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:16,040
But where did you get the money?

933
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,641
I saved up, it's not from others.

934
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,401
You gave me some money.

935
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:23,000
My parents gave me some money.
My part-time job earned some money.

936
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,800
I saved them all.

937

(Jiangcheng Development Bank Current deposit)
So don't stress yourself out.

938
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:31,601
I didn't want to tell you
because this is for emergency.

939
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:35,040
Once Jianing gets into pre-school,

940
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:36,040
I'll open a store

941
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,720
while you work.

942
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:39,800
We'll take turns picking her up
from school.

943
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:41,520
When we're free, we can have

944
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,760
a movie date.

945
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
Think on the bright side.

946
00:37:44,841 --> 00:37:47,000
Don't give yourself too much stress.

947
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:49,681
Okay.

948
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,000
Oh, no! I forgot about the pot.

951
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,881
What's the matter?

952
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,960
Why are you crying?

953
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:09,441
Did someone bully you?

954
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:11,441
Zhao Jikai.

955
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,200
What happened?

956
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,960
Tell me. I'll talk to him for you.

958

Are you free tonight?

959
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,601
Will you come to my place?

960
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,480
I need you.

961
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,720
Sure. I'll keep you company.

962
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:28,800
But you can't drive like that.

963
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
Let me drive.

964
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,321
Isn't Zhao Jikai a doting boyfriend?

965
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,200
What got into him?

966
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:59,040
I guess Xiaohu's case,

967
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,000
Zhang Xiaobei's accusation,

968
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,881
and the merger with Green Broadcasting

969
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:05,601
overwhelmed him.

970
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,200
I can understand

971
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:09,040
why he's so uptight.

972
00:39:10,401 --> 00:39:12,040
You're still falling into love.

973
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,000
You understand his plight
but do you truly know him?

974
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:18,441
He had an inspiring journey.

975
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,121
Do you know what he used to do?

976
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:23,081
What?

977
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
Having part-time jobs?

978
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:26,681
Bingo.

979
00:39:26,681 --> 00:39:28,000
You can't be serious.

980
00:39:28,881 --> 00:39:30,441
He didn't go to university.

981
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,040
He comes from a poor family

982
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,280
so he had to drop out

983
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:35,921
after high school.

984
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:36,881
Back then,

985
00:39:36,881 --> 00:39:39,441
his peers went to university

986
00:39:39,601 --> 00:39:41,520
while he started working.

987
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:42,760
He

988
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
waited tables,

989
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:46,841
cleaned toilets, and worked as a valet.

990
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:48,240
In spite of that,

991
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,520
he was looked down

992
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:51,441
upon.

993
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,921
He was working so hard

994
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:55,760
every day

995
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,441
that he hardly slept.

996
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:02,081
One time, Jikai had a gathering
with his friends.

997
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:05,240
A childhood friend of his,

998
00:40:05,641 --> 00:40:07,681
who later went
to study computer science,

999
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,401
returned to his hometown.

1000
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:12,121
His friend was successful

1001
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,280
and he bought his parents

1002
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,000
two houses.

1003
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,280
They all had

1004
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:17,560
a wonderful night.

1005
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,000
They got a bit rowdy

1006
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:21,361
so they got into a fight

1007
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:23,040
with the customers next to them.

1008
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,841
A burly man

1009
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:26,321
from the next table

1010
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:29,040
attacked Jikai's childhood friend.

1011
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,601
Jikai's friends

1012
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:32,081
are all white collars

1013
00:40:32,121 --> 00:40:33,601
so they were no match
against the burly man.

1014
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,601
However, if no one stepped in,

1015
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:37,960
his childhood friend would be

1016
00:40:38,121 --> 00:40:39,480
heavily injured.

1017
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,000
Being the good friend

1018
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,321
that Jikai is,

1019
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:45,000
he defended his childhood friend.

1020
00:40:45,161 --> 00:40:47,441
And because of that,
he was under arrest in the police station

1021
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,641
He wasn't proud of it

1022
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,480
so he didn't tell me more.

1023
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
I did ask him

1024
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:55,161
why he stepped in

1025
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,960
to protect his childhood friend.

1026
00:40:57,441 --> 00:41:00,040
He said he did poorly in school

1027
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,240
and only his childhood friend
showed him respect.

1028
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,841
After Jikai dropped out,

1029
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:05,681
no one contacted him.

1030
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:08,681
Jikai only knew about the gathering
when his childhood friend told him.

1031
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:10,441
Jikai was grateful

1032
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:11,520
to his childhood friend.

1033
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,641
And then?

1034
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:19,641
And then, it was a lesson of irony.

1035
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,800
In fact,

1036
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:21,921
Jikai's childhood friend

1037
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,800
didn't really care about him.

1038
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,081
His friend

1039
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:28,881
was just using him as a prop.

1040
00:41:28,881 --> 00:41:30,720
Jikai was there to show how generous
his friend was.

1041
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
Jikai then

1042
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,841
became a bit discouraged.

1043
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:37,520
He doubted himself.

1044
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:39,841
He distrusted others.

1045
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
His brother couldn't bear
to see him like this

1046
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,321
so his brother brought him to Macau, China.

1047
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,441
Internet

1048
00:41:46,441 --> 00:41:48,480
was all the rage in Macau, China back then.

1049
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,240
Jikai met a business owner.

1050
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:52,441
That business owner

1051
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:54,121
liked Jikai a lot so he employed Jikai.

1052
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,441
Jikai saw the opportunity.

1053
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:56,841
He saved up

1054
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,401
and gathered his own team.

1055
00:41:59,641 --> 00:42:02,441
Jikai knew his childhood friend
was developing a game.

1056
00:42:02,441 --> 00:42:03,321
So he did the same.

1057
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,321
A Scorpio man
would never let go of grudges.

1058
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,401
And indeed,

1059
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,881
Jikai's game company

1060
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,361
prospered.

1061
00:42:14,641 --> 00:42:17,800
He made a name for himself
with video games.

1062
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,480
He became more and more successful.

1063
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:29,480
And then?

1064
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:30,480
That's all.

1065
00:42:31,121 --> 00:42:33,121
You know what happened next.

1066
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:35,280
