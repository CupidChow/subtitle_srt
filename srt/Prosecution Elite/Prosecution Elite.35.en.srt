I am a public figure loved and followed
by millions of fans.

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,359
Your action doesn't seem adequate.

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,800
You deceived and used them.

18
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,279
Why would they still adore you?

19
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,480
Do you have any idea

20
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,359
about the damage
you've dealt to the brand?

21
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,639
Officer,

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,440
I know I did the wrong thing.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,440
At first, I thought I was

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,959
only selling counterfeit cosmetics,

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,639
that nothing serious
would come out of it.

26
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:06,559
What could possibly go wrong?

27
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,279
Listen up.

28
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:09,120
Regret doesn't undo your crime.

29
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,000
You need to come clean.

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,319
Perhaps you might get some clemency.

31
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:13,519
Yes, of course.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,840
I'll tell you everything.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,799
I don't just sell
fake Maininice products.

34
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,959
I also sell other counterfeits.

35
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,120
But I didn't produce

36
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,719
any of these fake products.

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,920
They were provided
by other manufacturers.

38
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,159
We are only salespeople.

39
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,239
Our job was to sell the products.

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
How do the manufacturers contact you?

41
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,599
Through my colleagues.

42
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,599
I bet you're in cahoot with them.

43
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,239
After every live stream,

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,120
the link to the fake products

45
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,400
and replays were deleted.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes.

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,360
We thought internet regulation
had a limited time frame,

48
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,719
that they wouldn't come after us.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,319
If they can't track us down now,

50
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,239
they certainly can't
track us down in the future.

51
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,519
Now, tell us the job distributions.

52
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,000
Well? How was the trip?

53
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,319
What did you do over there?

54
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,840
Not bad. I was there to verify something.

55
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,360
Is everything settled?

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,200
Yeah, almost done.

57
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,040
Do you want some water?

58
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,879
I have some here.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,360
Sure, thank you.

60
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,480
What's wrong? Feeling tired?

61
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,439
It's nothing. Perhaps I've

62
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
spent too much reading this paper.

63
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:58,879
I'm feeling lightheaded.

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,120
You should lie down for a bit.

65
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,679
I'll wake you up when you're home.

66
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,840
Sure. Thank you so much.

67
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,439
Take a nap.

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,800
He Luyuan's operation was live-streamed.

69
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,159
Thankfully, He Luyuan kept a level head.

70
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,080
He turned the live stream
into a legal awareness segue.

71
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,640
The people are discussing the matter.

72
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:38,960
They are passionate about this.

73
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,319
Here's what I think.

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,559
He Luyuan and his team
will continue the investigation.

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,760
Meanwhile, we'll prepare

76
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,839
to issue a prosecution directive

77
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,080
to the streaming platform Huibo.

78
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:56,119
An Ni got the plan drafted out.

79
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,279
We started from four aspects.

80
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,279
To establish a sound
criminal compliance regulation,

81
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
improve risk prevention
and control systems,

82
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:07,599
better employee training and education,

83
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,319
and foster awareness
of property rights protection.

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,159
Good.

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,760
That is good.

86
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,839
I expected nothing less
from one of the Top Ten Prosecutors.

87
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,520
But we must go into the details.

88
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,559
It's me.

89
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,719
Okay, I got it.

90
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,960
I'll go back to the office later.

91
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:52,399
Yes.

92
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,879
Bye.

93
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,599
Sorry to wake you up.

94
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,200
I fell asleep.

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,879
How long have we been here?

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,240
Just a while ago.

97
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
You were sleeping so soundly,

98
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,599
so I didn't want to wake you up.

99
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,240
Sorry about that.

100
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,360
I'll give you a hand.

101
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,599
Thanks.

102
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,080
Should I see you off upstairs?

103
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:44,279
Never mind, I can take it from here.

104
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,559
Thanks for the help.

105
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,240
Alright.

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,680
Bye.

107
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:49,319
Bye.

108
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,240
Get a nice sleep.

109
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,119

Asleep?

It wasn't easy to get him to sleep.

116
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,640
I can take it from here, get some rest.

How about this?

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,999
My baby, what's wrong?

123
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,999

Hush, hush, don't cry.

129

I don't think you get a lot of messages.

130

it's either An Ni or Li Yitang.

Hush.

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,199
You should take a look.

171
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,159
(Tang!)

172
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Xiaojiao, don't cry.
You have to stay calm.

173
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
I'll be there right now.

174
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,040
Officer.

175
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,040
We found her.

176
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,440
Okay. That's all we want.

177
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,159
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

178
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:00,759
We're glad she's found.

179
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,680
He Luyuan, hold on.

180
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,320
What's the hurry?

181
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,680
But honestly,

182
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,519
it feels nice when you come after me.

183
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,279
There's no time for jokes.

184
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,240
Take this.

185
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,639
Liu Yanfei and the six accomplices

186
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,839
are charged with
violating the Trademark Law.

187
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,800
The Procuratorate will await the completion
of your investigation

188
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,360
before deciding whether
to criminally prosecute them

189
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,560
for the offense
of selling counterfeit goods

190
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:31,719
of registered trademarks.

191
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,519
This is a list of evidence outlines

192
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,599
I prepared based on
my practices and habits.

193
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:36,719
Take a look.

194
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,040
See if it's be useful.
And of course, it's my own suggestion.

195
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,599
You don't necessarily
have to follow it.

196
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,120
Of course I'll use it.

197
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,639
Ms. An, the great prosecutor
prepared this specially for me.

198
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,599
One, how did
the counterfeiting operation

199
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,399
evolve from selling counterfeit goods

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
to manufacturing them?

201
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,279
Two, the suspects intentionally

202
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,000
delete the live stream videos,

203
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,759
are there any other internal
chat records within the organization?

204
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:00,639
The witness' statement and suspects...

205
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,199
Are you mocking me?

206
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,680
I'm studying it.

207
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,959
Three, the syndicate...

208
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,120
Yonggang?

209
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:15,839
What?

210
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,440
What is it?

211
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:20,639
It's Yitang.

212
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,639
Yitang is in trouble.

213
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:27,560
Yonggang.

214
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,639
Did Tang...

215
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,399
Did she take her own life?

216
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:35,279
Because of Zhao Jikai,

217
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,399
she chose to end her life...

218
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,800
Honey,

219
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:41,000
enough with the wild guesses.

220
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:42,639
Yitang will be alright.

221
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,120
Trust me on this. Don't cry.

222
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,639
You're crying your eyes out.

223
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,599
I'm so scared.

224
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,399
Don't worry too much. Hush.

225
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,199
What happened?

226
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
I don't know.

227
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,639
They say they got
a voice message from Yitang.

228
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,959
What was the message?

229
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:13,399
It was a message for Xiaojiao.

230
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,040
She said my name.

231
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:17,800
But...

232
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,079
She said your name in
a voice message for Xiaojiao?

233
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,920
Doesn't she have your contact?

234
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,880
Either she deleted it

235
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,719
or blocked me.

236
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,320
Something is still off.

237
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,120
Given your relationship,

238
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,680
she should have memorized your number.

239
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I find it strange as well.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,320
First, we must get to the hospital.

241
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,399
Alright.

242
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,450
(Huiquan)

243
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,279
Mr. Liu.

244
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,079
As the vice chairman,

245
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,759
(Yin Huiquan)
you summoned the entire board

246
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:06,920
(Yin Huiquan)

247
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,680
(Yin Huiquan)
for a board meeting.

248
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,000
(Yin Huiquan)

249
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,320
What is it that you want to discuss?

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,240
The board meeting is about

251
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,920
impeaching Chairman Yin Huiquan.

252
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,800
Xiao Mu'en shall be the new chairman.

253
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,320
I beg your pardon?

254
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,399
Having hearing trouble now?

255
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,639
You're old, after all. I understand.

256
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,360
(Liu Kunyu)
This is a board meeting

257
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,040
(Liu Kunyu)
to impeach you, Yin Huiquan.

258
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Are you

259
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
on his side?

260
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,599
Everyone left when one fell from grace.

261
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,000
You took advantage of my downfall.

262
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,320
I haven't met my demise just yet,

263
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,880
but you've already lost your patience.

264
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Chairman Yin.

265
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,320
We worked together.

266
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,800
We hope to save you some dignity.

267
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,000
The decision today

268
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,680
doesn't affect your status
as a shareholder of Huiquan.

269
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,159
Besides,

270
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,000
we are responsible
for all the shareholders.

271
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,079
Why should I go?

272
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,079
I, Yin Huiquan,

273
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,159
have dedicated my entire life to
Huiquan Corporation.

274
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,759
You are throwing me under the bus.

275
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,199
I will never back out.

276
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,399
Unless I willingly do so,

277
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,279
no one can kick me out!

278
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,880
There are rules to everything.

279
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,000
This is a legitimate procedure.

280
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,120
This meeting is effective.

281
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,800
You have no right to object.

282
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
Xiaojiao, don't cry.

283
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,920
Now I feel like crying as well.

284
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,639
How did this happen?

285
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,399
She was all right when she called me.

286
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,599
She said she'd meet up with me
after she came back.

287
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,199
How did this happen?

288
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,480
An Ni, I am so scared.

289
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,719
This is my fault.

290
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,399
Had I known she wanted to contact me,

291
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,719
had I called her...

292
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
Perhaps none of these
would have happened.

293
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,839
What happened to you two?

294
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,279
Are you the patient's family?

295
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,399
Yes. Her parents are abroad.

296
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,839
We are her close friends.

297
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,599
You can tell us about her condition.

298
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:03,320
Is she married?

299
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,240
We need her husband at the hospital.

300
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,719
No.

301
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,560
This can be troublesome.

302
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,599
At a time like this,

303
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:12,519
is there no one who can sign for her?

304
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,320
What is the signature for?

305
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Is it about something urgent?

306
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
The thing is,

307
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,639
after the toxicology test,

308
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,040
we can basically confirm

309
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,680
the patient is suffering from a cerebral stroke

310
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,279
caused by acute diazepam poisoning.

311
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,320
She was sent here in time,

312
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,920
but the patient could still

313
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,000
be in a deep coma
for an extended period.

314
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,199
We'll do our best.

315
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
As for you,

316
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,519
you must be prepared

317
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,959
for the possible sequela
from the brain condition.

318
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,800
What was the thing you mentioned?

319
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,000
What was the name again?

320
00:16:42,719 --> 00:16:43,680
It's also known as Valium.

321
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,719
It's a common anxiolytic.

322
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,480
But overdosing can cause acute poisoning.

323
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,680
Does she have a history
of taking diazepam?

324
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,360
No.

325
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,639
Does she suffer from epilepsy?

326
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
Depression or insomnia?

327
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,120
Not at all.

328
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,959
We've all known each other for ages.

329
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:05,200
She's always been an optimistic person.

330
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,119
She wouldn't take the drug.

331
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,639
Doctor, you have to help her.

332
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:13,040
You mentioned something about a sequela.
We can't have that.

333
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,879
She is a lawyer.

334
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,119
She needs her brilliant mind.

335
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,920
If anything happens to her,

336
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,600
it will be too much for her.

337
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,680
Under the lead
of the current chairman,

338
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
what has Huiquan become?

339
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,920
Had Mr. Xiao Mu'en not
given us his full support,

340
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,239
salvaged the situation,

341
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,840
and dedicated his heart
and soul to the company,

342
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:48,119
Huiquan would have crumbled
from the inside and out!

343
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,920
I appointed him to be our president.

344
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:53,800
Yes, that is true.

345
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,239
But he's the one
who delivered the results.

346
00:17:57,479 --> 00:17:59,840
He's resolved numerous issues for you.

347
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,560
If he could get anything done,

348
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,200
why would we need you

349
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,519
to be the chairman and give us orders?

350
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,999
What is the point?

351
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,479
We've made it perfectly clear.

352
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,040
Let's save each other some dignity.

353
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:17,239
Mr. Liu.

354
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,040
Did you call for this impeachment?

355
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,080
You should ask yourself

356
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,279
why we are impeaching you.

357
00:18:26,479 --> 00:18:29,239
What's the point in pointing fingers?

358
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,119
Mr. Ding.

359
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,720
Don't bother arguing with him.

360
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,800
Let's get down to business.

361
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,239
You said you wanted sound reasons.

362
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,119
I'll start by stating mine.

363
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:43,200
If the other board members

364
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,519
have anything to mention,

365
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,600
feel free to talk about it.

366
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,920
Let's make everything clear

367
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,519
for Chairman Mr. Yin Huiquan

368
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,920
who will soon be impeached.

369
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,519
I hope you listen closely and judge

370
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,600
if our reasons are sound.

371
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:04,680
First off,

372
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,920
for the past three years
after you got reelected,

373
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,479
especially lately,

374
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,279
you've blindly expanded the company,

375
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,840
spending a huge fortune on signing up
streamers and exclusivity agreements.

376
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,600
To collect user data,

377
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,279
you'd even boost views using deception.

378
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,879
Our subsidiary Huibo Broadcasting

379
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,840
was openly investigated
for anti-monopoly.

380
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:30,639
We could receive a fine
of astronomical sums.

381
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,840
We don't know that yet.

382
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,759
It's about as certain as it can get.

383
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,920
One decision will
decide the fate of us all.

384
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,440
The entire corporation will suffer

385
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,639
financial losses
and damage to our reputation.

386
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,800
Secondly, you've caused several PR crises.

387
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:51,080
The pooling of funds
was halted many times.

388
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,040
The company was forced to lay off
employees to cut down the cost.

389
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,920
I doubt you have a way

390
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,680
to absolve yourself of this now.

391
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,359
In the end,

392
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:03,639
it was Mr. Xiao Mu'en
who resolved the situation.

393
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,960
It's the only correct decision you've made.

394
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:09,119
You were right to
have appointed Xiao Mu'en.

395
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,040
As for you, even now

396
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,800
you still fail to give the board
and the shareholders

397
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,639
a viable reason.

398
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,080
Thirdly, you're guilty of cronyism.

399
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:23,399
You hired Zhao Jikai

400
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,999
to be the president of this company.

401
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,239
Huiquan Games' stats were plummeting.

402
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,399
You must answer for these.

403
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,639
After Zhao Jikai's case,

404
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,879
the company almost fell apart.

405
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,519
Not only did you not stop,

406
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,920
you never tried
to salvage the situation.

407
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:41,680
You even allowed your son,
Yin Tiancheng,

408
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,800
to bring more
negative impacts to the company.

409
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,479
The media began to question

410
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,320
the corporate culture of Huiquan.

411
00:20:50,479 --> 00:20:53,879
Huiquan doesn't belong to your family.

412
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,320
It belongs to the shareholders.

413
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:58,320
You do not own get to decide for the board.

414
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:00,680
We decide by voting.

415
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,999
Yin Tiancheng is innocent.

416
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,519
This board meeting is about us.

417
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,349
Keep him out of this!

418
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,800
(Liu Kunyu)

419
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,279
How can we know if he is truly innocent?

420
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,239
After all, it wasn't the first time
you'd used money

421
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,479
to clean up after your delinquent son.

422
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,879
Who cares about his innocence now?

423
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,720
And lastly, you've always
acted on your own.

424
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:29,720
You never communicated

425
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,999
with the shareholders and board.

426
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,800
You never respected our opinions.

427
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,239
You'd even go as far
as silencing other shareholders.

428
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Your actions have violated

429
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:42,639
the rights and interests of the company.

430
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Besides,

431
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:47,879
you've overstayed your service.

432
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,840
The election was held
once every three years.

433
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,639
Your service should have ended
at the end of last year.

434
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,600
Whatever reason you have,

435
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,200
you must no longer act as

436
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,279
the chairman of Huiquan.

437
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,399
How is the investigation?

438
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,999
We are obligated to
keep it confidential.

439
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:08,680
I understand.

440
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,399
But I believe

441
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:22,840
we'll get the answer very soon.

442
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,639
Poor Tang.

443
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,479
She had a promising future ahead.

444
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,800
What will it be like for her now?

445
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,560
Please wake up.

446
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,320
Xiaojiao, from this day on,

447
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
unless the authority

448
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,999
talks to you about the incident,

449
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,320
do not mention Yitang's condition to anyone else,

450
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:45,200
including the poisoning.

451
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,800
Be sure to inform Yonggang as well.

452
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,440
Yes.

453
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,159
I told Mr. Xiao. Is that alright?

454
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,999
Yonggang was here the whole day.

455
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:53,920
He didn't go to work.

456
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,879
I thought it'd be best to explain it.

457
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,999
Would that affect your investigation?

458
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,759
Excuse me, it's time for her medication.

459
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:03,680
Are you working?

460
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,279
Could you watch her for me?

461
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,440
I didn't bring anything with me.

462
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:07,920
I must head home for a while.

463
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,239
Sure.

464
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:11,519
- Stay safe.
- I'll be right back.

465
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,399
Mr. Liu.

466
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,359
Your train of thought

467
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,800
has been very clear today.

468
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,920
I'm confused.

469
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,320
When you were the vice chairman,

470
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,960
you were always in a daze.

471
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:35,479
How interesting.

472
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,879
Now I get it.

473
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,879
You people came prepared.

474
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:46,399
You've totally set me up.

475
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
Alright.

476
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,920
Enough chitchat.

477
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,800
The board members have been
dissatisfied with you for a long time.

478
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,119
The sales number didn't go up.

479
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:58,879
The finances and
management were full of flaws.

480
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,920
And the future and development
of the corporation?

481
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,600
It was a total mess.

482
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:08,040
If you continue to be Huiquan's chairman,

483
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:09,999
the company is good as doomed.

484
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,239
You can either step down

485
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,119
or be impeached.

486
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:19,119
Pick your poison.

487
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,239
Mr. Yin.

488
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:24,279
It's time to back down.

489
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:25,920
In this day and age,

490
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,720
old men like us are irrelevant.

491
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,720
We must face reality
and give the opportunities

492
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,320
to those who deserve it.

493
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,320
This isn't in the company's
article of association.

494
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,759
I will not agree to this.

495
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,320
Do we have to spell it out for you?

496
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:48,600
You went against the company

497
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,040
and got in the way
of the company's interests.

498
00:24:55,879 --> 00:25:00,519
Even if two-thirds of you vote to impeach me,

499
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:03,119
you will still need

500
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:06,080
the approval by convening
the shareholders' meeting

501
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,840
for a resolution.

502
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:13,680
But you should be aware of

503
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:17,279
who is the biggest shareholder.

504
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,080
I know.

505
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,239
You hold 26 percent of the shares.

506
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,600
That's a lot.

507
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,279
If you're aware of that,
what's the point of this meeting?

508
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,639
It's futile.

509
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,080
As we mentioned,
you acted on your own will.

510
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:33,279
We certainly got that right.

511
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,040
See? You wouldn't let us finish.

512
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,519
Listen up.

513
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,279
They have all signed

514
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,040
the agreement
of persons acting in concert.

515
00:25:42,399 --> 00:25:45,519
You all signed the agreement?

516
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:53,680
It seems you put in a lot of effort
without my knowledge.

517
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,800
What else have you done?

518
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:00,279
Come on, bring it to the table
and show me.

519
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,040
Be patient.

520
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,920
We can talk it out.

521
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,840
We are all civilized people.

522
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:07,519
Civilized?

523
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:09,200
Hah!

524
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:13,999
Are you serious?

525
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,279
You call yourselves civilized?

526
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,800
We are not in a meeting.

527
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,519
We're not in an office.

528
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,399
This is an arena!

529
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,759
You're after my life!

530
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:30,239
You called this civilized?

531
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,040
Forget about being civilized!

532
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:35,519
It's survival of the fittest!

533
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:37,119
Yin Huiquan.

534
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,479
If you insist...

535
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,519
My pal.

536
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,440
Let's all calm down.

537
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:44,720
All we here

538
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,879
are prestigious businessmen.

539
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,720
Can't we talk it out nicely?

540
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,279
Did you hear Ma?

541
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,200
He's much smarter than all of you!

542
00:26:53,999 --> 00:26:54,800
Mr. Yin,

543
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,399
don't make it difficult for me.

544
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,999
Given the predicament Huiquan is in,

545
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
we all have a lot of complaints.

546
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:24,200
Mu'en.

547
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:29,399
The second biggest shareholder

548
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,479
holds 20 percent of the shares.

549
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,840
- Yes.
- Now that we've given you

550
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,279
the authorization,
and you signed to receive it,

551
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,999
and with the 5 percent
that I'm giving you,

552
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,519
we have 51 percent
of the shares in total.

553
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:49,960
We can still come out on top.

554
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,519
What? Can't you see
we're having a meeting?

555
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,239
Mr. Xiao, it's urgent.

556
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:59,600
The Procuratorate just sent
the urgent documents.

557
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:02,800
The Procuratorate? What are these?

558
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:04,720
It's the prosecution directive

559
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,479
against Huibo Broadcasting

560
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,399
over the selling of counterfeit
products by Meow-Meow Cat.

561
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,040
Fine, I got it.

562
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,479
I'll take care of this afterward.

563
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,200
Tell the prosecutors

564
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,479
we're taking this seriously.

565
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,359
We'll cooperate.

566
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,239
Yes, Mr. Xiao.

567
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,200
I, Yin Huiquan,

568
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,239
didn't fail you.

569
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,639
When Huiquan was at its prime,

570
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,279
I made sure

571
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,680
everyone here got the reward he was due.

572
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:53,119
Even the shareholders

573
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,080
have made a fair
amount of fortune from us.

574
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:01,680
Now that Huiquan ran into some problems,

575
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,600
you lost your patience.

576
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,320
All of you banded together

577
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,920
to kick me out.

578
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,519
Tell me,

579
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,239
did our bond mean nothing to you?

580
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,920
When we first started this business,

581
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,479
we can be united

582
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,080
to make it through this trying time.

583
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,800
Glory shall be ours again.

584
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,720
What have you become?

585
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,639
I don't get it!

586
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,920
Yeah.

587
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,119
Could it be

588
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,399
that you have someone

589
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,519
more qualified to be chairman?

590
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,399
Mr. Yin.

591
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,999
The board members

592
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,720
want what's best for the company.

593
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,600
Fine.

594
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:28,479
Fine.

595
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,560
Alright.

596
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
But I'm warning you.

597
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,440
I'm warning all of you

598
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,680
that I won't back down so easily.

599
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,999
You think by working together,

600
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:53,239
you could bring me down.

601
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,479
You are mistaken.

602
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,639
Until the official decision is convened,

603
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,239
I am still the chairman of Huiquan.

604
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:05,800
Despite knowing you might rig

605
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,440
the shareholders' meeting,

606
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,560
but you can't break the law.

607
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,960
This is a country of law!

608
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,879
I won't give up.

609
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
You'll regret this.

610
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:32,920
I'm at the hospital,

611
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,119
keeping Yitang company.

612
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,239
What about your best friend?

613
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
Xiaojiao went home to get stuff.

614
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,279
She will be back soon.

615
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,920
How is the investigation?

616
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,239
(I asked the technology department)

617
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,920
to analyze his hair sample.

618
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:44,879
They found that

619
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,320
Li Yitang has been taking diazepam regularly.

620
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,159
That's not possible.

621
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,479
Li Yitang would never take that kind of drug.

622
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,680
I know her too well.

623
00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:56,879
That doesn't mean

624
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,519
you can watch her
every second of her life.

625
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,680
I've seen plenty of such cases.

626
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:03,840
(People take diazepam
because of relationship problems.)

627
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,080
He Luyuan.

628
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,800
Yitang is someone

629
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,440
who will give up everything for love,

630
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:10,920
but the man she loves is
still in the detention center.

631
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,159
(As Zhao Jikai's attorney,)

632
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,239
she would never take her own life now.

633
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,879
(Given the huge dosage,
maybe she consumed it by accident.)

634
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,119
Either she took it herself,

635
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,999
or someone fed her the drug.

636
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,119
Someone drugged her.

637
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,920
If she had been taking the drug unknowingly,

638
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,879
the only person who could have done so
without her knowing

639
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,279
was Zhao Jikai.

640
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,440
(But now that we've apprehended Zhao Jikai,)

641
00:32:39,479 --> 00:32:41,200
the only person who could have

642
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,600
drugged her so discreetly

643
00:32:42,879 --> 00:32:44,680
has to be someone she really trusts.

644
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,119
Alright, I'll make it brief.

645
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,879
(investigate everything,
including the hypothesized time of consumption)

646
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,440
based on the dosage and symptoms described
by the doctor

647
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,239
and the message she left Xiaojiao.

648
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,999
And the transportation she took

649
00:32:57,999 --> 00:32:59,320
after she got off the flight.

650
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:00,519
The people she talked to on the way

651
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,359
and the stops she made,

652
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,479
and even the things she bought,

653
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,320
make sure you don't miss any details.

654
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,279
I sent my men to check

655
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,600
the surveillance camera of her house.

656
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,479
She came back in a black car.

657
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,999
We are now searching for the owner of that car.

658
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,040
An Ni?

659
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:15,440
It's Xiao Mu'en.

660
00:33:15,999 --> 00:33:17,119
He came by to visit Yitang

661
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,119
after learning about the incident.

662
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,399
I have to hang up.

663
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,800
Okay. Carry on.

664
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,519
Thank you for visiting Yitang.

665
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,600
It's nothing.
We are colleagues, after all.

666
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,399
Did the doctor mention

667
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:46,159
when she will come to?

668
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
I'll inform you when she does.

669
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,840
Okay.

670
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,920
Seeing her lying unconscious on the bed

671
00:33:57,879 --> 00:34:00,159
really pains me.

672
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:02,999
Don't worry.

673
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,600
I believe she will get well very soon.

674
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,800
Don't worry. I'll manage.

675
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:13,880
Well?

676
00:34:13,959 --> 00:34:16,320
Do you have any suspects yet?

677
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:19,360
Oh, my apology.

678
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:20,679
I shouldn't have asked.

679
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,279
It's okay. I know the way.

680
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,560
I should get going.

681
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,759
Take care.

682
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,479
Stay safe.

683
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,239
Bye.

684
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,479
(Today...)

685
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,040
Chief Bai and I called

686
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,479
for this emergency meeting

687
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,120
because Zhao Jikai's girlfriend,

688
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,800
Li Yitang, was poisoned yesterday.

689
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,320
She was rushed to the hospital in time,

690
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,919
but she is still in critical condition.

691
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,880
An Ni and He Luyuan

692
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:03,919
have informed Chief Bai and me.

693
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,519
I think the matter

694
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
requires a special task force.

695
00:35:10,279 --> 00:35:12,840
I hope you give it your best to
investigate and find the culprit

696
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,239
as soon as possible.

697
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,400
Chief Bai.

698
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:19,120
This is a serious crime.

699
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,199
So far,

700
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,279
we have no evidence

701
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,600
that indicates Li Yitang was harmed

702
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:27,704
by the fraud syndicate
operated by Qian Tianxin

703
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,719
in Country F.

704
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,679
But after analyzing a series of evidence,

705
00:35:32,999 --> 00:35:33,999
we can confirm

706
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,439
the victim was drugged
by an escaped fugitive.

707
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,679
The lead reported by our two comrades

708
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,160
has proven to be valuable.

709
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,959
The timing of Li Yitang's poisoning

710
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:49,719
is uncanny and sensitive.

711
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,199
The two of them will explain the details.

712
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,040
An Ni?

713
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,759
As you all know,

714
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
we may have apprehended Qian Tianxin,

715
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:05,560
but our case in Country F

716
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,199
hasn't been closed just yet.

717
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,080
We also have no idea
where the illicit funds flow to.

718
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Not to mention that A

719
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,279
has been an uncertainty for us.

720
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,160
Li Yitang went to Guangdong.

721
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,959
Before she left,

722
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,279
she met Zhao Jikai as his attorney.

723
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:22,959
What we have so far
is a photo in Li Yitang's phone

724
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,479
showing a phone number with two digits

725
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,640
that are unclear, and it is peculiar that

726
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,320
there are different sequences of phone records

727
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
with the same number being dialed.

728
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,560
Aside from these,

729
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,959
we've found nothing unusual.

730
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,800
We are tracking down Li Yitang's movements

731
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,080
after she arrived in Jiangcheng.

732
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,400
We'll send you the results
once we get them.

733
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,080
As for her trip to Guangdong,

734
00:36:45,479 --> 00:36:46,800
whether we investigate it ourselves

735
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,080
or ask for help from
Guangdong's local police,

736
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:50,880
it will take some time.

737
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:53,759
As for the suspicious
phone numbers in her phone

738
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,360
and the owners of those numbers,

739
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,199
we might need time to track them down.

740
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,919
We will continue to question Zhao Jikai

741
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,919
and hope to have some breakthrough.

742
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,040
The lead with the phone numbers is important.

743
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,679
How long do you think it will take?

744
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:11,600
There are over 100 phone numbers.

745
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,199
It will take at least two to three days

746
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,199
if we don't wish to alert the suspects.

747
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
You have 24 hours.

748
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:21,959
Sure, no problem.

749
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,120
How did it go?

750
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,959
We found the car that sent
Li Yitang home.

751
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:29,999
It's right next to me.

752
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,160
You lost the car owner?

753
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,279
(It's worse than that.)

754
00:37:32,479 --> 00:37:33,679
The car was reported lost

755
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,239
three days ago in the next province.

756
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:36,560
We check the surveillance camera.

757
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,479
The driver covered his face.

758
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,479
We couldn't get a good look.

759
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,679
That's even more peculiar.

760
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,120
If that person was covering his face,

761
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,199
why would Li Yitang trust him
and get into his car?

762
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,279
I think they know each other.

763
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,199
Otherwise, given the suspicious appearance,

764
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:52,439
would she have gotten into the car

765
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,800
if she didn't know the driver?

766
00:37:56,279 --> 00:37:57,080
Hello?

767
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,080
Do you have a suspect?

768
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:01,759
He Luyuan.

769
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:05,560
Now that the culprit destroyed

770
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,759
every lead that we could find and track down,

771
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,759
(I suggest we expand the search radius.)

772
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,120
Let's go beyond the
time frame of the incident.

773
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,320
The timeline should be just a few days ago.

774
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,479
(Find out who met Li Yitang,)

775
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,880
(especially what happened
before and after she met Zhao Jikai.)

776
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,679
I doubt Li Yitang

777
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,800
would go to Guangdong
under these circumstances.

778
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,239
She must have learned something
or someone related to Zhao Jikai's case.

779
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,010
(Detention center)

780
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,719
Zhao Jikai, when you last met Li Yitang,

781
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:38,360
did you have any speech of aggression?

782
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,279
That day,

783
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:46,400
Li Yitang said she'd be my attorney.

784
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,759
The conversation was between her and me.

785
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,600
Ms. An,

786
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,679
you don't have the right to know.

787
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:59,120
After that conversation,

788
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,919
Li Yitang went to Guangdong.

789
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Do you know why she went there?

790
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,679
Li Yitang is a free person.

791
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,600
She can go wherever she wants.

792
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,880
I can't keep her here.

793
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:13,080
Do you know Li Yitang

794
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,439
has been taking diazepam regularly?

795
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,759
I gave her the drug.

796
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,840
Back then,

797
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,279
every time I contacted Country F,

798
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,439
I'd give her the drug.

799
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,800
The doctor says milk helps you sleep better.

800
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,120
Come on, finish this.

801
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,719
From now on,

802
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,120
you have to
drink milk every night. Okay?

803
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,199
Okay.

804
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,880
She OD'd on diazepam and is now in the ICU.

805
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:55,679
Is she alright?

806
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,640
She's in the hospital.

807
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,279
Foolish girl.

808
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:25,999
If you ever see Li Yitang,

809
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,400
tell her

810
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,080
not to do anything reckless.

811
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:34,800
I've never loved her.

812
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:39,360
My heart never had a place for her.

813
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,320
Tell her to stay away from me.

814
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,959
Stay out of my life.

815
00:40:45,479 --> 00:40:47,160
Stay out of your life?

816
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,759
Aside from the work you confessed,

817
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,519
what other things do you not
want her to be involved in?

818
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:00,919
That's all.

819
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,400
Captain He.

820
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,479
You must be the lawyer, Mr. Wu.

821
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,479
Yes, Captain He.

822
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:11,880
I am He Luyuan.

823
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,640
Let's sit down.

824
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:18,120
You came before we even summoned you.

825
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,919
Lawyers sure are impressive.

826
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,800
The legal awareness is much higher.

827
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,999
Stop poking fun at me, Captain He.

828
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,120
I've been struggling
because of this case.

829
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,239
I have to confess.

830
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,800
You knew we were looking for you.

831
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,160
No.

832
00:41:33,439 --> 00:41:35,479
I wanted to come here last night.

833
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:37,719
Last night, someone told me

834
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:39,439
Li Yitang was rushed to the hospital.

835
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,439
I couldn't fall asleep the whole night.

836
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:45,719
If I ever tell you the truth,

837
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,439
I'll be betraying my employer and client.

838
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,400
I will never find another job as a lawyer.

839
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,479
But if I don't confess,

840
00:41:55,999 --> 00:41:57,999
someone's life is at stake.

841
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,840
I'll fail as a man of law.

842
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,560
I gave it a long thought.

843
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,479
I had to come here.

844
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:03,999
What did you do for Li Yitang?

845
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,919
I was blinded by greed.

846
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,800
I listened to Li Yitang.

847
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,759
I told Qian Tianxin

848
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,199
about Zhao Jikai's surrender.

849
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,959
She gave me nothing but an address.

850
00:42:16,999 --> 00:42:20,959
And it seemed she had made a tough decision

851
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:22,279
before telling me the address.

852
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:24,239
That was all that she had ever told me.

853
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:26,519
You gave Li Yitang the address

854
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,640
you got from Qian Tianxin?

855
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,320
Yes.

856
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,519
A lawyer should never disclose
the client's information to anyone.

857
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,239
However,

858
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,320
Li Yitang was indeed
helping Qian Tianxin.

859
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,239
I did it for my personal agenda.

860
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:45,279
Qian Tianxin's gave a bad statement.

861
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,040
So I told myself

862
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,239
to consider Li Yitang my assistant.

863
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,400
But I didn't know

864
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,959
I'd put her in harm's way by doing so.

865
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,880
Alright.

866
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:55,800
Repent after we put you in court.

867
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,560
Give me the address.

868
00:43:00,999 --> 00:43:02,519
Captain He, there's one more thing.

869
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,199
I must inform you personally.
