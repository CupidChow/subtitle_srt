Li Quan

16
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:41,883
is not

17
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,283
the top leader

18
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:45,643
of Case 7·23's criminal syndicate
in Country A.

19
00:01:46,444 --> 00:01:49,044
The mastermind is someone else.

20
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:50,243
I only concealed

21
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:53,444
one person's name.

22
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:54,883
Give me the name.

23
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:57,484
It's A.

24
00:01:57,643 --> 00:01:58,523
Comrade An Ni,

25
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:00,963
How about this?

26
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:02,804
Why don't you give everyone
a brief explanation

27
00:02:02,883 --> 00:02:04,484
of the current information
we have on "A"?

28
00:02:05,444 --> 00:02:06,243
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:07,084 --> 00:02:07,804
You can brief while seated.

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,600
(An Ni)

31
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:15,444
To be honest, it's rather embarrassing.

32
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:16,683
Two years ago,

33
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:17,923
we've been dealing

34
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,324
with Li Quan, the main culprit

35
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:20,964
and the others involved in Case 7·23

36
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:23,123
throughout the entire process
of their extradition from abroad

37
00:02:23,324 --> 00:02:25,123
and subsequent prosecution.

38
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:26,724
But until today,

39
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:27,604
we've only been able

40
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:29,043
to confirm two crucial pieces
of information.

41
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:31,884
Zhang Wanru was murdered,

42
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:34,324
and it was orchestrated by "A."

43
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:37,283
However, all we have

44
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,244
about "A"

45
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,244
is by this code name

46
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:44,123
and the mastermind of this syndicate.

47
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:45,763
We have no personal information

48
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,084
about the age,

49
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,364
gender,

50
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:51,283
nationality, or residency.

51
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:54,283
Just two hours earlier,

52
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:56,084
I visited Li Quan at No. 2 Prison again.

53
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:57,724
Now,

54
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,283
we obtained
a completely new lead on Paul.

55
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:01,283
I think we can Initiate a new round

56
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:03,324
of intensive investigation into Li Quan

57
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,884
in hopes of uncovering a breakthrough

58
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:07,123
that could lead us to "A."

59
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,244
He Luyuan,

60
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,444
what does that gesture mean?

61
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:18,164
Prosecutor An is impressive.

62
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:20,483
Two years ago, we already suspected

63
00:03:20,524 --> 00:03:21,923
that Comrade Zhang Wanru's death

64
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,043
was suspicious.

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,123
You've spent two years

66
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,084
proving our initial suspicions.

67
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:29,843
Captain He,

68
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:31,563
I know you've been resenting

69
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:32,724
about that incident all this time.

70
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,403
I hope you focus on the matter at hand
and not on individuals.

71
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:35,884
When I halted the investigation
at that time,

72
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:38,164
whether from a legal
or procedural perspective,

73
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,524
there was no issue whatsoever.

74
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:41,324
I can confidently say that at any time.

75
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:43,324
If you want to reason with me,

76
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:44,004
get personal with me,

77
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,604
and argue with me. It's fine with me.

78
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,683
But that's a different discussion altogether.

79
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:48,763
Today,

80
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:50,563
we're discussing
the revival of Case 7·23.

81
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,643
An Ni,

82
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:54,403
Captain He hasn't said anything.

83
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:55,483
Why are you constantly firing at him

84
00:03:55,524 --> 00:03:56,643
like a machine gun?

85
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,680
(Bai Zhaoxi)

86
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:04,563
Comrades,
I want to remind everyone here.

87
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:06,923
Today is the first day

88
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:09,123
our task force is established

89
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:11,483
and our first joint meeting.

90
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,084
In the past,

91
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:14,604
no matter how many conflicts,

92
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:16,363
differences of opinion,

93
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,764
or grievances you have had

94
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,924
from your previous work,

95
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:21,523
I need you to put them all aside

96
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,083
when you're here.

97
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:27,644
Today, we are discussing
the reopening of Case 7·23.

98
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:28,563
The decision was made jointly

99
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,563
by the Ministry of Public Security

100
00:04:30,724 --> 00:04:32,283
and the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

101
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:35,644
We request the comrades
from the Procuratorate to supervise.

102
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,563
As for comrades
from the Public Security Bureau,

103
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,363
listen carefully.

104
00:04:40,724 --> 00:04:42,683
You must give
your full cooperation unconditionally.

105
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,563
Since you've joined this team,

106
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,044
you must obey this collective,

107
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:49,164
understood?

108
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:50,764
Urgent report.

109
00:04:51,403 --> 00:04:52,204
Chief,

110
00:04:52,403 --> 00:04:54,403
the criminal police has urgent matters
to discuss with Captain He.

111
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:55,644
What is it about?

112
00:04:55,683 --> 00:04:56,724
The traffic police received a report

113
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:58,683
from the public two days ago

114
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:00,484
about a vehicle falling into the water.

115
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:01,963
Initially, they thought

116
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,604
it was due to the driver's error.

117
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:05,683
But after they hauled the vehicle
from the water...

118
00:05:05,884 --> 00:05:07,083
The case wasn't as simple
as they thought.

119
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:08,083
Yes, the forensic report

120
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,324
has come out.

121
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,044
We found that the brakes weren't caused

122
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:14,683
by normal wear and tear.

123
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:23,523
Sir,

124
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,444
I didn't mean
to disrupt today's meeting.

125
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:28,283
Since it's a case,
I need to go and handle it.

126
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:30,724
Before I leave,
I want to make a statement.

127
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:33,004
Comrade Zhang Wanru

128
00:05:33,123 --> 00:05:35,083
was my good colleague and friend.

129
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:39,004
It's my duty to seek justice for her

130
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,324
and let her rest in peace.

131
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:43,083
I'll fully cooperate.

132
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:47,924
Chief Bai, may I?

133
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:57,963
Captain He.

134
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:02,963
Do you have any instructions for me,
Prosecutor An?

135
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,803
When you're trying to quit smoking,
chew something in your mouth.

136
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,204
So your temper won't be so bad.

137
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:08,123
Take it.

138
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,243
When Wanru was alive,

139
00:06:21,403 --> 00:06:23,204
she had feelings for this guy.

140
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,644
But this brat only focused on his work,
not love.

141
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:29,683
Get it now?

142
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,670
(Jiangcheng's Intermediate People's Court)

143
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,843
- She is out.
- Here she comes.

144
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:38,484
Hello.

145
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:39,803
Can you accept our interview?

146
00:06:41,604 --> 00:06:43,363
Lawyer Li, is there

147
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:44,083
anything you want to say
about this lawsuit?

148
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,644
Lawyer Li, Huiquan has won the case.

149
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:47,164
Would they still be willing

150
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,123
to pay Madam Zhan 50,000 yuan
as compensation?

151
00:06:48,204 --> 00:06:49,683
Lawyer Li, please answer.

152
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,724
- Please, Lawyer Li.
- Lawyer Li.

153
00:06:50,803 --> 00:06:52,004
Lawyer Li, please answer.

154
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,324
Please say something.

155
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:00,444
First,

156
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,004
Huiquan Corporation

157
00:07:02,044 --> 00:07:03,843
is a law-abiding private enterprise.

158
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:05,444
None of its products

159
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,963
has any legal or regulatory violations.

160
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:10,604
Second, regarding Madam Zhan Mei's son,

161
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:12,403
Shi Xiaohu's suicide

162
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:14,683
has nothing to do
with Huiquan's products.

163
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:16,363
The recent court judgment

164
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,924
fully explains this

165
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,604
from a legal perspective.

166
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:20,963
That's all I have to say.

167
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:24,403
- Lawyer Li!
- Lawyer Li!

168
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:25,924
- Lawyer Li!
- Lawyer Li!

169
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,040
(Archive Bag)

170
00:07:32,204 --> 00:07:34,764
Madam Zhan, what's your next plan

171
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:36,444
now that you've lost
in your second appeal?

172
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:38,204
Madam Zhan, why isn't your attorney,

173
00:07:38,243 --> 00:07:40,164
Mr. Li Xiaohui, present in court today?

174
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:41,924
Instead, an intern
from his law firm showed up.

175
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:45,123
I beg you, please spare me.

176
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:46,924
I lost in the second appeal.

177
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:48,523
I...

178
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,444
I really don't want to say anything.

179
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:53,843
But

180
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:55,123
I...

181
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:56,523
I won't give up.

182
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,764
I'll never give up.

183
00:07:59,083 --> 00:07:59,884
Let's go.

184
00:08:00,044 --> 00:08:01,523
Excuse us, please make way.

185
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:08,843
Madam Zhan,

186
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:11,724
please buy a burial plot for Xiaohu
as soon as possible.

187
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:13,324
It's not appropriate
to leave him like this.

188
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:23,843
Yitang,

189
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:25,843
you're calling me
amidst your busy schedule.

190
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,204
Is it time for you to ask me out
for a meal again?

191
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:28,563
(I'm not as busy as you.)

192
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,523
And I'm not calling to ask you out
for a meal today.

193
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,004
I'm busy dating.

194
00:08:34,004 --> 00:08:35,123
(I just wanted to remind you)

195
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:35,723
(to spare some time)

196
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:37,884
(to call Jiao
and check on your goddaughter.)

197
00:08:38,524 --> 00:08:39,764
(If you keep being so busy,)

198
00:08:40,004 --> 00:08:40,844
(she'll only remember me)

199
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,123
(as her only godmother.)

200
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,444
You obviously have other intentions.

201
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,123
Reminding me to visit our goddaughter
is just an excuse.

202
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,084
You just want to show off your love
in front of me.

203
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:49,884
So what is it?

204
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,683
(For heaven's sake.)

205
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:53,803
(Please scroll up
and read the chat records.)

206
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:56,123
(Five days ago, we agreed)

207
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:57,444
(that everyone would attend)

208
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:59,084
(our company's press conference
tomorrow evening.)

209
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,483
Your press conference?

210
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:03,483
I might be a little...

211
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:04,803
(You must come.)

212
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:05,723
No excuses.

213
00:09:05,884 --> 00:09:07,084
Don't tell me you're too busy with work.

214
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:09,524
Or else I'll come
to the prosecutor's office to find you.

215
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:11,964
It's decided then. See you tomorrow.

216
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,163
Bye.

217
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,644
Why are you so proactive

218
00:09:15,844 --> 00:09:17,483
about meeting your friend?

219
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:20,444
It takes me
several days just to see you.

220
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:25,123
Why are you being so sour about it?

221
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:26,683
Why are you jealous of my friend?

222
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:28,644
We're different,

223
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:30,084
it's different from men.

224
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:32,563
There are plenty of men in the world.

225
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:34,483
But there's only one An Ni.

226
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,563
We may not be related by blood.

227
00:09:36,603 --> 00:09:37,603
But we've become closer

228
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:39,884
than sisters a long time ago.

229
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:42,644
You know what?

230
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,043
I just love your carefree attitude.

231
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,524
Seriously, the more you're like that,

232
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:49,884
the more I'm fascinated.

233
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:51,723
If you were the type of person

234
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:53,243
who gets carried away with love,

235
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:55,363
I might find it boring.

236
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,163
I'm serious.

237
00:09:59,964 --> 00:10:03,163
That's why men like you are really...

238
00:10:09,964 --> 00:10:11,284
Well, I have to go now.

239
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:12,043
I have a meeting
with the game department

240
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:14,043
at 8 o'clock.

241
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,084
The new game is about to be launched.

242
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,563
It's my ultimate battle, after all.

243
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:18,563
I have to go now.

244
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:21,004
See you.

245
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:22,404
Be careful.

246
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:35,483
We're here.

247
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:42,324
Lawyer Zhao,
thank you for sending me home.

248
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,084
Madam Zhan, don't mention it.

249
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:47,764
We didn't really help much
in the second appeal.

250
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:50,324
Besides, Lawyer Li said

251
00:10:50,444 --> 00:10:51,243
that our firm

252
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:53,243
won't take your case anymore,

253
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:54,723
regardless of whether you want
to continue or not.

254
00:10:56,243 --> 00:10:57,084
I understand.

255
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:59,243
I don't want

256
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:01,204
to cause you any more trouble
with my case.

257
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:03,043
But you're a good person.

258
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:04,644
I still have to thank you.

259
00:11:05,084 --> 00:11:06,123
I won't take up any more of your time.

260
00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:07,324
I need to go upstairs.

261
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:08,683
There are many creditors waiting

262
00:11:08,764 --> 00:11:10,043
for me at home.

263
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:16,004
Madam Zhan,

264
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,524
it's not my place to say this.

265
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:22,923
But I think it's not easy for you.

266
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:24,803
If you gather

267
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:26,043
any new evidence in the future,

268
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,644
I suggest you go
to the prosecutor's office

269
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:29,004
and file an appeal.

270
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,764
Thank you.

271
00:11:59,764 --> 00:12:00,524
Dad,

272
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:02,603
why are you home early today?

273
00:12:03,084 --> 00:12:04,603
Xiaoting, you're back.

274
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:09,603
I only had one class in the morning.

275
00:12:09,884 --> 00:12:11,683
In the afternoon,

276
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:13,004
I had lunch with my superior.

277
00:12:13,404 --> 00:12:14,123
I'm free in the afternoon.

278
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:16,844
So I came home to edit
an expert argumentation article.

279
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,123
Expert argumentation?

280
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:19,603
What kind of big project is it?

281
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:23,964
It's about a company's PR issue.

282
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,404
They want the experts to hold a meeting

283
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,204
and provide some arguments.

284
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:30,483
Which company?

285
00:12:30,844 --> 00:12:31,683
Is it Huiquan?

286
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:34,764
How did you know?

287
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,363
A company that's recently suffering
from a PR crisis.

288
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:39,723
and they need experts
like you to step forward.

289
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:41,644
So it can only
be Huiquan Corporation, right?

290
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:47,964
Yes, it's Huiquan Corporation.

291
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:49,524
Have you heard about this matter too?

292
00:12:50,923 --> 00:12:52,363
I just came back from the court.

293
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,764
Shi Xiaohu's mom,
Madam Zhan lost her second appeal.

294
00:12:55,084 --> 00:12:56,243
Listen to me carefully.

295
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,444
Don't get involved

296
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:00,043
in Huiquan's affairs.

297
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:03,243
There are plenty of news stories

298
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:04,683
for you to comment on,

299
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:06,964
but Huiquan's matter

300
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:08,524
runs deep.

301
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:11,683
Dad, did you take money from them,

302
00:13:11,683 --> 00:13:13,683
or do they have something against you?

303
00:13:14,524 --> 00:13:16,483
How could you say that about me?

304
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,084
You're the only one

305
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:20,723
who knows me best.

306
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:22,964
Look

307
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:26,363
at how many people
are lining up to give me money

308
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,844
just for my reputation.

309
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:31,683
Look at our house.

310
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:34,764
If I were willing to accept money,

311
00:13:34,844 --> 00:13:36,363
would it still be like this?

312
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:38,884
Dad, I only said one sentence,

313
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,483
and you've said so much.

314
00:13:40,483 --> 00:13:42,243
Only people
who feel guilty will behave this way.

315
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:45,803
I'd like to say

316
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:46,844
the same thing to you too.

317
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,363
Don't get too close to Huiquan's matter.

318
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:50,444
It runs deep.

319
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,363
You're retiring in three days,

320
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:54,844
and I hope your prestigious reputation

321
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,284
will stand strong forever.

322
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,043
Don't let it be tarnished in the end.

323
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:01,524
Xiaoting,

324
00:14:02,644 --> 00:14:04,524
it makes me sad

325
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,483
for questioning me in such a way.

326
00:14:09,043 --> 00:14:11,084
I protected you too well

327
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:13,163
that you don't even know

328
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:14,923
the situation of our family.

329
00:14:16,163 --> 00:14:17,923
When your mom was alive,

330
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,363
it wasn't just about prolonging
her life with medication.

331
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:25,884
It was about spending money
to keep her alive.

332
00:14:26,123 --> 00:14:28,324
(One shot a day,
costing ten thousand yuan each.)

333
00:14:28,404 --> 00:14:30,483
(Do you understand
the significance of the situation?)

334
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:34,163
(My income as a professor)

335
00:14:34,764 --> 00:14:36,324
(is our only source of income.)

336
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:39,884
(Being a cyber law expert)

337
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:41,884
(is free.)

338
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:44,644
(Assisting friends
with their legal consultations)

339
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,324
(is also done without charge.)

340
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:53,123
(However, times have changed.)

341
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,324
(The expenses for your mother's
medical treatment,)

342
00:14:57,284 --> 00:14:57,964
(funeral,)

343
00:14:58,603 --> 00:14:59,444
(and purchasing a burial plot)

344
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,363
(had exhausted our family's savings.)

345
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:04,324
(Look,)

346
00:15:05,483 --> 00:15:06,644
(you're still not married yet.)

347
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:08,683
I'm retiring soon.

348
00:15:08,964 --> 00:15:11,363
We need to consider your future.

349
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:13,284
Dad,

350
00:15:13,404 --> 00:15:15,163
I understand what you're saying.

351
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:17,363
But I don't need all these.

352
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,084
I can support myself too.

353
00:15:19,884 --> 00:15:23,043
I just hope you won't be dragged down
because of me.

354
00:15:24,363 --> 00:15:25,284
Do you really think

355
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:27,923
I'm someone who is solely driven
by personal gain?

356
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:30,563
My decision to join Huiquan

357
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,444
is based on my consideration
as a legal professional.

358
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:35,723
Look,

359
00:15:36,563 --> 00:15:39,243
we're living
in the era of globalization.

360
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:42,884
China's economic development
is closely tied to international trade.

361
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,034
(An amount of 200,000 yuan has been transferred
to your bank account.)

362
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:08,130
(Beneficiary Account:
Huiquan Network Technology Co., Ltd.)

363
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:21,204
Master, the investigation record
is already out.

364
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:23,163
You didn't have to come in person.

365
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:25,923
This work wasn't done right.

366
00:16:27,043 --> 00:16:28,123
Show me the report.

367
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:34,884
Look, the report states that
a month ago,

368
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:36,884
this car went to the 4S dealership
for major repairs

369
00:16:36,923 --> 00:16:38,123
and had its brake pads replaced.

370
00:16:38,683 --> 00:16:39,803
But this doesn't look like

371
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:41,683
a job done by a 4S dealership.

372
00:16:41,683 --> 00:16:42,964
The brake caliper
wasn't even properly attached.

373
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:46,524
So what would it look like
if it was done by a 4S dealership?

374
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:05,363
Hello, is this the technical team?

375
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:08,644
Hello, Captain Wang.

376
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,843
I'm sure things are hectic on your side.

377
00:17:15,684 --> 00:17:17,363
But I need a favor from you.

378
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,044
Go out and check

379
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:20,884
if any repair shop

380
00:17:20,884 --> 00:17:22,924
has replaced the brake pads

381
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:25,044
of a Mercedes S-Series
within the past month.

382
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,243
Used, on the left front.

383
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,483
Why are you here messing around
instead of reviewing the case files?

384
00:17:46,404 --> 00:17:47,603
I can't believe you forgot.

385
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:49,203
You kept asking me

386
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:50,963
to develop
an information screening system.

387
00:17:52,164 --> 00:17:54,559
I stayed up several nights
to develop it.

388
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,640
(Jiangcheng Prosecutor's Office
Case File Information Integrated Processing Platform)

389
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:56,963
Take a look.

390
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,243
You actually developed the system.

391
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:00,404
I'm impressed.

392
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:01,924
You're not
a computer genius for nothing.

393
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,044
Look.

394
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:06,004
We currently have
too little known information.

395
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,603
There must be details we haven't noticed

396
00:18:07,644 --> 00:18:09,123
that require repeated screening.

397
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:10,644
With the system's unlocking

398
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:11,524
and integration capabilities,

399
00:18:11,603 --> 00:18:12,884
we can achieve twice the result
with half the effort.

400
00:18:13,203 --> 00:18:13,884
This way,

401
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:14,963
we can meticulously screen through

402
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,004
all the records

403
00:18:16,044 --> 00:18:17,243
from the beginning.

404
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:19,644
Screen through them again?

405
00:18:20,564 --> 00:18:22,164
Why is my life so hard?

406
00:18:23,044 --> 00:18:24,164
As prosecutors,

407
00:18:24,164 --> 00:18:25,603
we have special requirements
in handling cases.

408
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:27,843
Our eyes must be sharper
than anyone else's,

409
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,083
our minds must be more meticulous,

410
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:30,764
our hands more diligent,

411
00:18:30,804 --> 00:18:32,243
and our endurance greater
than anyone else's.

412
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,963
As the saying goes,
"finding a needle in a haystack."

413
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,764
Do you think we can find the needle?

414
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:38,804
Well, I do.

415
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:43,684
When you said
those few sentences just now,

416
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:45,804
I could see a halo behind you.

417
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,644
Okay, stop with these useless things.

418
00:18:47,644 --> 00:18:48,684
Where are the copies?

419
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,684
Oh, they're over there.

420
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:22,963
Professor Luo,

421
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,164
my apologies

422
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:26,483
for being late for our first meeting.

423
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:27,483
Mr. Yin,

424
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:28,764
you're too kind.

425
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:31,564
You're 15 minutes earlier

426
00:19:31,564 --> 00:19:33,404
than the appointed time.

427
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:35,924
I've long heard about Mr. Yin
from the Huiquan Corporation

428
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,083
to be kind

429
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:38,203
and graceful.

430
00:19:38,603 --> 00:19:41,083
Meeting you today proves
that your reputation is well-deserved.

431
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:42,323
It's a pleasure to meet you.

432
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:45,483
It seems
that fate has brought us together.

433
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,644
Let's sit at the table,
have a drink, and talk.

434
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:49,603
Okay.

435
00:19:49,804 --> 00:19:50,363
Come.

436
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,243
Please take a seat.

437
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,710
(Forensic Identification Center)

438
00:19:54,004 --> 00:19:57,644
What do you expect us to do now?

439
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,203
Fangfang!

440
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:02,603
Fangfang!

441
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,243
Captain He,
the family of the deceased is here.

442
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,483
This is the deceased's husband,

443
00:20:06,723 --> 00:20:07,164
Mr. Zhu Xin,

444
00:20:07,203 --> 00:20:08,203
and these are the deceased's parents.

445
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:09,363
Mr. Zhu,

446
00:20:09,843 --> 00:20:11,243
he's from Criminal Investigation Division,

447
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:11,963
Captain He.

448
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:15,004
Mr. Zhu.

449
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:16,044
How will we live

450
00:20:16,044 --> 00:20:17,164
- My condolences.
-in the future?

451
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:20,044
Condolences won't help.

452
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:21,963
How can I find solace?

453
00:20:24,564 --> 00:20:25,764
It has been two days.

454
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:29,164
First, they said my wife died
in a car accident.

455
00:20:32,804 --> 00:20:34,203
Then they said it wasn't an accident.

456
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:36,684
And now they say it was murder.

457
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:39,004
Look at how my wife's body was shattered.

458
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,843
There's not even a complete corpse left.

459
00:20:41,963 --> 00:20:43,404
Now, you guys want to dissect her body

460
00:20:44,164 --> 00:20:45,603
and use her for experiments?

461
00:20:47,404 --> 00:20:48,203
Mr. Zhu,

462
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:50,603
we understand your feelings.

463
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,404
But we're doing this

464
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:54,843
to quickly uncover
the truth of the case.

465
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:57,404
It is our duty and responsibility
as the police.

466
00:21:00,764 --> 00:21:02,044
My parents-in-law don't agree.

467
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:04,044
They don't believe this.

468
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,963
They don't want Fangfang
to suffer a second time.

469
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:09,764
Leave a complete body.

470
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:15,284
Mister, madam.

471
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:16,603
Don't say anything.

472
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:18,363
We don't agree.

473
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:20,564
We have suffered enough.

474
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:25,963
Fangfang was a woman.

475
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,884
You're going to strip her naked
and cut her open.

476
00:21:30,284 --> 00:21:31,243
I'm not going to let you do that!

477
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:37,564
Mister, madam.

478
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,764
I understand how you feel.

479
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,843
Our preliminary investigation tells us

480
00:21:43,044 --> 00:21:44,443
that it's highly likely
that someone tampered

481
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,404
with the car your daughter driving.

482
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:49,203
This could very well
be a premeditated murder.

483
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:52,243
Don't you want to know
who the killer is?

484
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:53,603
Murder?

485
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,963
Then go and catch the killer.

486
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:57,404
Go quickly!

487
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,004
Fangfang!

488
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:06,564
Fangfang!

489
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:10,843
Mr. Zhu,

490
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:13,284
can I talk to you in private?

491
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:21,004
There, there. Stop crying.

492
00:22:26,644 --> 00:22:27,804
I may not be able to answer

493
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:29,804
the questions you want to ask me

494
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:31,564
because I don't know anything.

495
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:32,603
It's okay.

496
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:34,603
Let's just chat casually.

497
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:36,924
How many cars do you have at home?

498
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:37,363
Three.

499
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:38,723
One is mine,

500
00:22:39,044 --> 00:22:40,083
one for my wife,

501
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,644
and one that is unused.

502
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,083
The car involved in the incident

503
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,603
was the one your wife
usually drove, right?

504
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:48,044
My wife's car was sent
for maintenance two days ago.

505
00:22:48,044 --> 00:22:49,764
She was driving the unused one.

506
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:54,164
How long has that car been unused?

507
00:22:58,004 --> 00:22:59,843
It must have been over a month.

508
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:02,044
That car is fairly new

509
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:03,564
and it hasn't been driven much, right?

510
00:23:04,164 --> 00:23:06,323
Is it a problem that it's a new car?

511
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:08,603
No, there's no problem.

512
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:11,924
Do you know

513
00:23:12,363 --> 00:23:14,203
why your wife went to Mount Yunding?

514
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:15,524
I don't know.

515
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:16,884
She didn't tell me.

516
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,404
It's not even a tourist spot.

517
00:23:19,644 --> 00:23:21,684
It was raining heavily
and she went alone.

518
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,203
What exactly are you trying to ask?

519
00:23:27,804 --> 00:23:29,203
Have you been to Mount Yunding?

520
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:30,483
No, I haven't.

521
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,603
I have finished asking my questions.

522
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:40,243
But I would like to ask for your help.

523

In the case
of an unidentified cause of death,

524
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:43,164
the Public Security Organs
has the authority

525

to perform a compulsory autopsy.

So I would appreciate it

00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:51,924
as someone who runs a business,

570
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,243
I've always

571
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:54,723
had great respect

for knowledgeable
and cultured individuals.

573
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,164
Knowledge is always
the primary productive force,

574
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:03,004
and this is an eternal truth.

575

I'm sure you know

576
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:07,243
that Huiquan Corporation's game

577
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:09,764
has caused some controversy
in society recently.

578
00:25:10,164 --> 00:25:10,764

may be a big and influential company.

But there are still potential risks
in many areas.

582

00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:28,884
and create new projects.

674
00:28:29,284 --> 00:28:31,644
Just like the slogan
of our Huibo App this time,

675
00:28:31,924 --> 00:28:33,004
"It's not innovation,

676
00:28:33,123 --> 00:28:34,123
it's disruption."

677
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:35,804
How exactly is it disruptive?

678
00:28:36,123 --> 00:28:37,684
I shouldn't jump to conclusions.

679
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:40,083
Now, let's invite
our Senior Vice President

680
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,123
of Huiquan Corporation's
Gaming Division,

681
00:28:42,243 --> 00:28:43,004
Mr. Zhao Jikai

682
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:43,684
to the stage.

683
00:28:50,644 --> 00:28:51,443
Thank you very much

684
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:54,483
for the opening remarks

685
00:28:54,603 --> 00:28:56,164
from our legal director and host,

686
00:28:56,164 --> 00:28:58,123
Miss Li Yitang.

687
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:59,164
This is how Huiquan Corporation

688
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,363
invests every penny

689
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:03,323
into research and development,

690
00:29:03,804 --> 00:29:05,243
striving to make each product

691
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:07,004
the best it can be.

692
00:29:07,123 --> 00:29:08,164
Just like the App

693
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:09,884
that will be launched tonight,

694
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:12,483
Huibo.

695
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:13,684
I know everyone

696
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:15,723
must be curious

697
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:17,764
about this brand-new

698
00:29:18,243 --> 00:29:19,723
online live-streaming App.

699
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:21,218
What unique experiences

700
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,884
and innovations

701
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:24,243
of this App

702
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:26,924
will bring us?

703
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:28,963
Here,

704
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:31,483
I would like to invite Mr. Xiao Mu'en,

705
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,044
the Chief Executive Officer

706
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:34,963
and Chief Technology Officer
of Huibo Tianxia,

707
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:35,884
a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Huiquan Corporation up here.

708
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:37,363
Mr. Xiao Mu'en.

709
00:29:37,483 --> 00:29:38,443
Please come to the stage, Mr. Xiao.

710
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,083
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

711
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:54,603
Hello, everyone.

712
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:56,723
I'm Xiao Mu'en.

713
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,804
My previous company, Green Broadcasting,

714
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:03,404
was a technology company.

715
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,564
We had no money or platform.

716
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:08,363
In order to survive

717
00:30:08,363 --> 00:30:09,764
and grow,

718
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:11,404
we needed to find a big company

719
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,004
that could support us in all aspects

720
00:30:14,123 --> 00:30:15,723
and help us develop ourselves.

721
00:30:17,564 --> 00:30:18,404
Huiquan Corporation

722
00:30:19,044 --> 00:30:21,323
was our unique choice.

723
00:30:22,723 --> 00:30:23,404
Today,

724
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,603
we have two agendas.

725
00:30:24,804 --> 00:30:25,644
The first one is

726
00:30:25,644 --> 00:30:28,004
the strategic collaboration

727
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,323
between Huiquan Corporation
and Green Broadcasting.

728
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:31,044
Second,

729
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:33,764
the launch

730
00:30:34,203 --> 00:30:35,044
of the Huibo APP.

731
00:30:35,284 --> 00:30:36,363
I hope

732
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:38,243
that our Huibo App,

733
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:39,684
once launched,

734
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:41,564
it'll create a sensation
on the internet.

735
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:08,083
Jiao.

736
00:31:08,884 --> 00:31:11,564
My dear,

737
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,764
you look so beautiful.

738
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:15,243
What do you think?

739
00:31:15,284 --> 00:31:15,963
I think it's amazing.

740
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:16,804
I may not understand.

741
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:18,804
But I want to download the APP soon.

742
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:19,884
Really?

743
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,723
Of course,
have I ever lied to you before?

744
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,323
Someone is looking at you.

745
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:26,524
Mr. Zhao.

746
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:27,764
Long time no see.
You look more handsome now.

747
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:29,963
Are you trying to flatter me?

748
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:30,684
Thank you.

749
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:32,323
Thank you for coming to support us.

750
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:33,963
What do you mean by support?

751
00:31:34,004 --> 00:31:35,524
The press conference has ended.

752
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:36,764
We're now one family.

753
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:38,603
Chen Yonggang

754
00:31:38,684 --> 00:31:40,363
is a part of Huiquan now.

755
00:31:40,963 --> 00:31:41,684
You're right.

756
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:43,083
We're getting closer and closer.

757
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:44,963
See,

758
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:47,924
your thinking is meticulous indeed.

759
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:49,123
If I want to leave you,

760
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:50,164
what am I going to do without you?

761
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:54,564
All right.

762
00:31:54,603 --> 00:31:55,564
Just kidding.

763
00:31:55,644 --> 00:31:57,363
Then on behalf of Huiquan Corporation,

764
00:31:57,884 --> 00:31:59,684
we welcome the representatives
of the family members.

765
00:31:59,924 --> 00:32:00,603
Thank you.

766
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:01,684
Welcome.

767
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:02,564
Ah, family.

768
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:03,443
By the way,

769
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:04,404
we must take care

770
00:32:04,443 --> 00:32:05,644
of An Ni's matter today.

771
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,483
So that she doesn't hold us back
all the time.

772
00:32:08,884 --> 00:32:09,723
Excuse me for a moment.

773
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,564
Mr. Xiao.

774
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,203
Excuse me for a moment.

775
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:18,564
- Please continue.
- Okay.

776
00:32:19,843 --> 00:32:20,483
Mr. Zhao.

777
00:32:21,843 --> 00:32:23,884
Let me introduce you to my best friend,

778
00:32:23,963 --> 00:32:24,684
Wang Xiaojiao.

779
00:32:24,764 --> 00:32:25,203
Nice meeting you.

780
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:25,684
Xiaojiao,

781
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,004
I don't have to introduce him
to you, right?

782
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:29,804
He's Yonggang's direct superior

783
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,483
and the top person in Huibo,

784
00:32:31,564 --> 00:32:32,083
Mr. Xiao Mu'en,

785
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:32,524
Mr. Xiao.

786
00:32:33,764 --> 00:32:34,363
Hello, Mr. Xiao.

787
00:32:34,564 --> 00:32:35,363
How do you do?

788
00:32:35,404 --> 00:32:36,603
You must be Yonggang's wife.

789
00:32:36,644 --> 00:32:37,164
Yes.

790
00:32:37,284 --> 00:32:37,884
Nice to meet you.

791
00:32:37,924 --> 00:32:39,524
My husband always talks about you.

792
00:32:39,684 --> 00:32:41,203
He said you're very talented.

793
00:32:41,243 --> 00:32:42,804
Now that I've met you,
I can see that's true.

794
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:43,884
You're too kind.

795
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:45,963
Yonggang and I are like brothers
who have fought side by side.

796
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:47,164
We're one family.

797
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:48,603
So please take care of him

798
00:32:48,644 --> 00:32:50,004
- in the future.
- Of course.

799
00:32:50,524 --> 00:32:51,164
Mr. Zhao,

800
00:32:51,443 --> 00:32:52,243
you guys can continue.

801
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:53,764
I have a few clients on my side

802
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:54,924
that I must attend to.

803
00:32:55,164 --> 00:32:56,243
I'll buy you all for a meal
another time.

804
00:32:56,363 --> 00:32:56,843
Okay.

805
00:32:56,884 --> 00:32:57,804
Why another time?

806
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:58,924
Let's strike while the iron is hot.

807
00:32:59,004 --> 00:33:00,404
Xiaojiao has a family dinner tonight.

808
00:33:00,524 --> 00:33:01,404
You must come.

809
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:01,804
Yes.

810
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:03,644
Is it suitable for me to go?

811
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:04,524
Yes.

812
00:33:04,603 --> 00:33:05,404
It's more than suitable.

813
00:33:05,924 --> 00:33:07,004
(Huiquan caused harm to others.)

814
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:09,203
(You should pay the same price!)

815
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,000
(Seeking wealth at the cost of lives,
blood debts must be repaid)

816
00:33:14,004 --> 00:33:14,924
(Huiquan caused harm to others.)

817
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,164
(Blood for blood!)

818
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,203
(An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth!)

819
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:25,323
(Huiquan caused harm to others.)

820
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:27,564
(You shall pay the same price!)

821
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:28,404
(An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth!)

822
00:33:28,404 --> 00:33:29,603
Excuse me.

823
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:31,884
What's going on?

824
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:32,963
I have no idea.

825
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:33,884
Close it down.

826
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:35,164
(Huiquan caused harm to others.)

827
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,004
(You shall pay the same price!)

828
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:43,603
Ladies and gentlemen!

829
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:44,963
Everyone!

830
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,123
Hello?

831
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,004
Please let me explain.

832
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:49,363
Please let me explain.

833
00:33:49,764 --> 00:33:51,164
Dear guests and friends,

834
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,963
the incident just now was unexpected.

835
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:55,123
I believe

836
00:33:55,323 --> 00:33:56,884
someone with ulterior motives

837
00:33:57,004 --> 00:33:58,044
- is trying to sabotage the collaboration
- Go to check the situation.

838
00:33:58,164 --> 00:34:00,564
between Huiquan Corporation
and Green Broadcasting,

839
00:34:00,924 --> 00:34:03,363
as well as the launch of the Huibo App.

840
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:05,524
Here,

841
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:07,564
I can assure everyone

842
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:08,963
that we will investigate

843
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:10,683
this matter thoroughly.

844
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:13,163
Furthermore,

845
00:34:13,963 --> 00:34:15,084
whether

846
00:34:15,604 --> 00:34:18,004
it's Huiquan Corporation
or Green Broadcasting,

847
00:34:19,124 --> 00:34:21,604
including our newly developed Huibo App,

848
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:23,443
we act

849
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:24,723
with integrity

850
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:27,124
and fear no false accusations or traps.

851
00:34:27,963 --> 00:34:29,403
As the saying goes,

852
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:31,524
if you have nothing to hide,

853
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:33,044
you have nothing to fear.

854
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:36,524
Thank you.

855
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:39,203
Thank you for everyone's presence.

856
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:41,004
Thank you for your support
and understanding.

857
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:42,524
Next,

858
00:34:42,564 --> 00:34:45,443
I have one more request
I want to ask of you.

859
00:34:46,243 --> 00:34:48,364
You have witnessed
the unexpected incident just now.

860
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:50,084
I hope

861
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:51,163
that all of you,

862
00:34:51,243 --> 00:34:54,203
including the journalists present today,

863
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:56,643
refrain from disclosing

864
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:58,723
or publishing any information

865
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,124
until the public relations department

866
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:01,804
of Huiquan Corporation issues

867
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:04,243
an official statement.

868
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:06,443
Of course, I have no authority
to demand this.

869
00:35:06,643 --> 00:35:08,243
But it's my personal plea.

870
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,804
Consider this

871
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:11,963
for a moment.

872
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,004
In just a few seconds,

873
00:35:14,163 --> 00:35:15,483
you cannot possibly grasp

874
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,044
the full picture
of the entire situation.

875
00:35:17,643 --> 00:35:20,643
If you release information
without complete understanding,

876
00:35:21,723 --> 00:35:22,963
your action

877
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:24,243
may inadvertently

878
00:35:24,364 --> 00:35:27,163
cause significant harm
to Huiquan Corporation.

879
00:35:27,723 --> 00:35:29,163
So once again,

880
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:30,524
I sincerely thank you all.

881
00:35:30,643 --> 00:35:31,923
Thank you.

882
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:34,324
Thank you.

883
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:35,203
Gosh!

884
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:35,923
An Ni,

885
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:37,764
you're finally here.

886
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:39,163
It's just a press conference.

887
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:40,163
The press conference was ruined.

888
00:35:40,163 --> 00:35:40,963
Something bad happened just now.

889
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:41,764
What happened?

890
00:35:41,844 --> 00:35:43,923
In any case,
it's not something I can explain.

891
00:35:43,963 --> 00:35:45,004
That doesn't matter. What matters

892
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:46,963
is we're introducing you to someone.

893
00:35:46,963 --> 00:35:47,364
We arranged a blind date for you.

894
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:48,564
Calm down.

895
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,883
Don't rush to reject me yet.

896
00:35:50,004 --> 00:35:51,643
It was captivating.

897
00:35:52,163 --> 00:35:54,163
(The incident just now was unexpected.)

898
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:55,764
(I believe)

899
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:59,203
(someone with ulterior motives...)

900
00:35:59,203 --> 00:36:00,604
This is really interesting.

901
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,324
I'll go and get him.

902
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:09,364
Tang.

903
00:36:11,243 --> 00:36:12,963
Another good friend of mine is here.

904
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,443
Let's go and get to know her.

905
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:20,963
You're finally here, Miss Prosecutor.

906
00:36:21,243 --> 00:36:22,564
Did anything happen?

907
00:36:22,804 --> 00:36:23,764
Nothing for now.

908
00:36:23,883 --> 00:36:25,163
We'll talk when we go back.

909
00:36:28,124 --> 00:36:28,564
Ms. Li,

910
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:29,804
this is...

911
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:30,883
Oh, I almost forgot.

912
00:36:31,163 --> 00:36:32,044
This is An Ni.

913
00:36:32,044 --> 00:36:33,124
Our best friend.

914
00:36:33,443 --> 00:36:34,764
He's the one I told you about,

915
00:36:35,163 --> 00:36:35,923
Xiao Mu'en,

916
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:36,723
Mr. Xiao.

917
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:39,524
You're a prosecutor?

918
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:40,044
Yes.

919
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:41,963
I'm An Ni
from Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

920
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:43,883
How do you do, Ms. Prosecutor?

921
00:36:43,923 --> 00:36:44,284
It's nice meeting you.

922
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:45,084
Nice to meet you too.

923
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:52,683
Master.

924
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:53,683
You're back.

925
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:54,883
Did you find anything?

926
00:36:55,564 --> 00:36:57,844
Yuan Fangfang was involved
in two accidents

927
00:36:58,084 --> 00:36:59,804
within half a year
while driving her own vehicle.

928
00:37:00,163 --> 00:37:01,483
One incident
was hitting an electric pole.

929
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:03,883
The other was a tire blowout
on the highway.

930
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:05,804
It's quite fortunate that she survived.

931
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:10,044
Considering she took antidepressants
for a long time,

932
00:37:10,084 --> 00:37:12,723
such reactions are normal.

933
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:14,524
Now,

934
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:16,364
within Yuan Fangfang's social circle,

935
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:17,883
there are three suspicious individuals.

936
00:37:17,883 --> 00:37:19,284
One is her husband, Zhu Xin.

937
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:22,203
Another is her cousin,

938
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:24,643
Yuan Qi, who is in a property dispute
with her over their ancestral home.

939
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:26,443
If Yuan Fangfang dies,

940
00:37:26,443 --> 00:37:28,723
the house will go to Yuan Qi,

941
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:30,844
making him a prime suspect.

942
00:37:31,044 --> 00:37:32,844
There is also her lover.

943
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:35,084
But what benefit

944
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:38,044
does her death bring to her lover?

945
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:43,844
Does Yuan Fangfang have insurance?

946
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:44,683
Yes.

947
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:47,883
Zhu Xin bought a personal accident
insurance policy for her.

948
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:49,243
But this insurance

949
00:37:49,284 --> 00:37:50,883
was purchased many years ago

950
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:52,163
without payment interruption.

951
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,284
From this perspective,

952
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,203
Zhu Xin seems to be free from suspicion.

953
00:37:56,604 --> 00:37:57,324
You're right about that.

954
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:08,044
When did Zhu Xin purchase the insurance
for Yuan Fangfang?

955
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:09,324
And

956
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:11,243
when did Yuan Fangfang

957
00:38:11,243 --> 00:38:13,004
start her relationship with her lover?

958
00:38:14,883 --> 00:38:15,683
Master,

959
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:17,403
are you suggesting

960
00:38:17,883 --> 00:38:20,163
that Zhu Xin knew
about their relationship

961
00:38:20,243 --> 00:38:21,683
and had premeditated plans?

962
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:24,844
Raise your hand.

963
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:26,963
Jianing, you must be hungry.

964
00:38:27,124 --> 00:38:29,163
I'll make you pancake.

965
00:38:30,483 --> 00:38:31,284
All right.

966
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:35,124
We'll get to eat soon.

967
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:37,443
Is the water boiling?

968
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:38,604
Oh, it is.

969
00:38:41,004 --> 00:38:42,643
It must be Mommy.

970
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:43,284
Let's go

971
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:46,284
and open the door for Mommy.

972
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,243
Yonggang!

973
00:38:51,044 --> 00:38:52,044
You ignored my messages on WeChat

974
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:52,883
and my calls.

975
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:54,804
Are you avoiding me?

976
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:55,804
I had no choice

977
00:38:55,923 --> 00:38:57,643
but to come and find you at your house.

978
00:38:59,364 --> 00:39:00,483
This little girl is adorable.

979
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:01,284
What's her name?

980
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,124
This has nothing to do with my family.

981
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:04,163
Wait here.

982
00:39:04,203 --> 00:39:05,604
I'll put her down and talk to you.

983
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:18,084
Are you out of your mind?

984
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:19,844
Why did you show up at my house?

985
00:39:20,844 --> 00:39:22,683
Is this a debtor's retaliation?

986
00:39:23,723 --> 00:39:25,604
Have you forgotten how much you owe me?

987
00:39:25,883 --> 00:39:27,443
What you owe
doesn't include the fees yet.

988
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:32,044
If it weren't for you taking me
to gamble,

989
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,243
I wouldn't be in this situation.

990
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:38,324
That's not what you said

991
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:40,643
when you were winning.

992
00:39:45,403 --> 00:39:46,643
In any case,

993
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:49,443
you have to pay off

994
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:51,004
this gambling debt,

995
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:51,604
right?

996
00:39:51,604 --> 00:39:54,044
If you don't like me showing up
at your house,

997
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:56,203
I can visit you at your office.

998
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:57,243
Am I right?

999
00:39:57,683 --> 00:39:58,324
But

1000
00:39:58,483 --> 00:39:59,963
everyone wants to keep their dignity.

1001
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:01,683
Since we're friends,

1002
00:40:01,723 --> 00:40:03,044
I can't do that to you,

1003
00:40:03,643 --> 00:40:04,443
right?

1004
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,124
I came here

1005
00:40:09,044 --> 00:40:11,084
to give you a way out.

1006
00:40:11,683 --> 00:40:14,883
There's a game tonight at 8 o'clock.

1007
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:16,163
The bookmaker

1008
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,284
is a friend of mine.

1009
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:18,844
So I have an insider.

1010
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,284
I don't have any money left.

1011
00:40:21,564 --> 00:40:22,243
Oh,

1012
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:23,564
that's your problem.

1013
00:40:23,764 --> 00:40:24,324
In any case,

1014
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:25,324
I told you

1015
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:26,844
about this game.

1016
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,483
Whether you're joining the game,

1017
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:31,643
it's up to you.

1018
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:35,804
Tonight at 8 o'clock!

1019
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:53,883
Master,

1020
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:55,044
it's here.

1021
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:20,443
Why are you here at this late hour?

1022
00:41:21,443 --> 00:41:22,844
We wanted to talk

1023
00:41:22,923 --> 00:41:24,923
to your parents-in-law
to get some information.

1024
00:41:27,844 --> 00:41:29,604
I have sent them home.

1025
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:32,604
Should I pick them up?

1026
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:34,764
No need.

1027
00:41:34,764 --> 00:41:36,044
Then we'll talk to you first.

1028
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:38,243
I'm worried they might get agitated.

1029
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:39,683
I see.

1030
00:41:40,643 --> 00:41:41,804
You want to talk to me.

1031
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:44,844
Okay.

1032
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:46,004
Come in.

1033
00:41:55,923 --> 00:41:57,124
Were you watching a movie?

1034
00:41:58,483 --> 00:41:59,683
I don't have the mood to watch.

1035
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:00,923
Do you want some?

1036
00:42:01,844 --> 00:42:02,643
It's all right.

1037
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,124
This is good.

1038
00:42:18,723 --> 00:42:20,764
In times like this,
we should look ahead.

1039
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:22,243
Watching a comedy

1040
00:42:22,604 --> 00:42:23,284
at this moment

1041
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:25,883
can help you get out
of this emotional state.

1042
00:42:27,124 --> 00:42:29,044
I've watched this movie.
It's quite funny.

1043
00:42:30,403 --> 00:42:33,044
While you're in a good mood watching
the comedy,

1044
00:42:34,443 --> 00:42:35,764
I want to talk to you about something.

1045
00:42:37,604 --> 00:42:39,923
Do you still remember
the day I asked you

1046
00:42:40,844 --> 00:42:42,804
why your wife went to Mount Yunding?
