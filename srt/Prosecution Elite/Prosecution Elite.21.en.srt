15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,641
I have the evidence provided by Mrs. Gomez.

16
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,361
And it's the original copy
of her marriage certificate

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,641
to her Chinese husband, Liu Yi.

18
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:48,840
Defense Attorney,

19
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
do you have any objection
regarding this piece of evidence?

20
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,601
No, Your Honor.

21
00:01:58,361 --> 00:01:59,321
Defense Attorney,

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,321
will you defend your client?

23
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
No.

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
My client pleads guilty

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,441
and I respect her decision.

26
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,240
What kind of lawyer is that?

27
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,480
According to the mutual legal

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,760
by Country F and China,

30
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:27,480
Chinese prosecutor, An Ni,

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,081
may testify in this trial.

32
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,001
Witness An Ni, please speak.

33
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:37,400
Thanks, Your Honor.

34
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:38,880
Qian Tianxin,

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,880
also known as Mrs. Gomez,

36
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:42,281
pleads guilty to bigamy.

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,120
She came clean because she felt culpable

38
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,641
toward her spouse.

39
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:49,760
What I fail to understand is why,

40
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,521
during her five-year marriage to Mr. Gomez,

41
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,600
she didn't divorce her Chinese husband.

42
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:01,120
That is my client's choice.

43
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,721
During these five years,

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,100
she loves her husband in Country F Mr. Gomez,

45
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,760
but she still harbors feelings
toward her Chinese husband.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,561
She is stuck in this dilemma

47
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,081
until today.

48
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:19,721
In that case,

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,680
why didn't Qian Tianxin come clean to Mr. Gomez

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,361
and ask for his forgiveness?

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,201
You claimed that she was in a dilemma

52
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:33,161
so why did she choose to settle this in court?

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,441
Mrs. Gomez is a pious woman.

54
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,880
She believes that she needs to be judged

55
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,480
by the law for her sins.

56
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,161
Okay.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,201
Qian Tianxin confessed.

58
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:48,361
But a marriage certificate from her alone

59
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:52,680
is not enough to charge her for bigamy.

60
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,040
Unless Qian Tianxin is also willing

61
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:58,441
to provide information
of her Chinese husband, Liu Yi.

62
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:00,001
Miss An Ni,

63
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,721
you are putting my client
in a difficult spot.

64
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:05,161
Allow me to remind you again

65
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,480
that only Country F's prosecutors

66
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,721
can indict Mrs. Gomez,

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,760
not us.

68
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,441
It's okay.

69
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,921
Despite your incapability
to provide this detail,

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,280
our officers have done

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,040
a background research on Liu Yi.

72
00:04:23,401 --> 00:04:24,521
Your Honor, please have a look.

73
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:27,681
Based on our investigation,

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,600
Qian Tianxin's marriage in China is invalid

75
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,241
so this matrimony is not recognized.

76
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,681
Her marriage to Mr. Gomez is thus effective

77
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:39,121
and she committed no bigamy.

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,961
Look.

79
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,241
This is her document.

80
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,241
Defense Attorney.

81
00:04:47,401 --> 00:04:49,440
Do you have any explanation

82
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,201
for this turn of events?

83
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Your Honor.

84
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:55,841
We do not agree with the prosecutor's claim.

85
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:56,921
She claimed

86
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,961
that Mrs. Gomez's previous marriage was invalid.

87
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,921
However,

88
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:06,681
one document is not

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,241
convincing enough.

90
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:09,521
Defense Attorney,

91
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:11,201
this is the official record

92
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,081
from the Civil Affairs Bureau.

93
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:14,121
It's not just any document.

94
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:15,280
In every nation,

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,081
marriage has to be recorded

96
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:19,241
and acknowledged.

97
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,160
I can explain it to you

98
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,600
if you need more details.

99
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:23,720
Your Honor,

100
00:05:23,961 --> 00:05:27,201
this witness is trying
to waste my client and my time

101
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:28,320
and disrupt the judiciary process.

102
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,921
Please remove her from the witness stand.

103
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,560
Witness, please continue.

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,521
Liu Dafu was born in Qixian, Shanxi.

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,801
In 1991,

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,841
he married Miss Zhang and he has kept

107
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:44,160
his marital status until now.

108
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,401
Later on, he changed his name to Liu Yi.

109
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,121
He went to Guangzhou
to conduct his business.

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,241
In 2016,

111
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:52,401
Liu Yi married Qian Tianxin in Guangzhou

112
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,000
but he hadn't divorced Miss Zhang.

113
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:56,361
Therefore,

114
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,880
his marriage to Qian Tianxin is invalid.

115
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,000
Impossible.

116
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,681
You can tell lies but no one else can?

117
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,401
Your Honor holds

118
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:12,401
the official record from China now.

119
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:14,921
Your marriage to Mr. Gomez is very much legal.

120
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,801
You are very certain of your claim.

121
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,280
Tell me.

122
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:28,440
Where is this Liu Yi then?

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,560
Is he dead or alive?

124
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,880
Prosecutor An,

125
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:34,440
have you contacted her Chinese husband?

126
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,241
Any updates, Captain He?

127
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,081
Your Honor,

128
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,361
due to the tight time frame,

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
we are still in the process
of reaching out.

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,641
Your Honor, with due respect,

131
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:46,720
the witness claims that my client,

132
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:47,921
Mrs. Gomez,

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,081
did not commit bigamy.

134
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Yet, she failed to provide

135
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,760
any information about his whereabouts.

136
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:53,961
How can I be sure

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,121
that she did not fabricate an identity?

138
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,401
The so-called Chinese husband

139
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
is not here to tell us the truth

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,081
so her claim is utterly unfounded.

141
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,000
Defense Attorney,

142
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,921
although we are still trying to contact Liu Yi,

143
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,921
his marital record

144
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,000
is in Your Honor's hands.

145
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,641
It already proves

146
00:07:13,681 --> 00:07:15,961
that the union between Miss Qian Tianxin
and Mr. Liu Yi

147
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:18,081
is not recognized by the Chinese law.

148
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:20,361
Your Honor,

149
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Prosecutor An claims

150
00:07:23,081 --> 00:07:25,000
that Mrs. Gomez's marriage in China
is not recognized.

151
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:27,961
Yet, they cannot present solid evidence,

152
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,921
save for a document from China.

153
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,521
No evidence.

154
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,361
No Mr. Liu Yi to come to testify here.

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,681
I cannot help but doubt her claim.

156
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,040
Silence!

157
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:55,320
As a judge for several decades,

158
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,040
this is my first time facing this.

159
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,081
The defendant tries to indict his client

160
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:06,600
while the plaintiff tries to prove
that the accused is innocent.

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,280
Do you know which side are you on?

162
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,201
I am merely fulfilling my client's demand.

163
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,081
As a prosecutor,

164
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,560
it is my job to defend the truth.

165
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,961
Since the Chinese prosecutors

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,201
cannot provide more evidence

167
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:50,081
to prove that Mrs. Gomez's marriage

168
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:52,000
in China is ineffective,

169
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:55,601
we now declare...

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
Your Honor.

171
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,240
There is also

172
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,240
one more piece of evidence.

173
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,721
Your Honor,

174
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:01,760
please believe me.

175
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,440
The evidence is still on its way.

176
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:05,481
It will not take too long.

177
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:06,440
Once it's here,

178
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:08,000
I will submit it right away.

179
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:08,961
Captain He.

180
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,161
What's the situation?

181
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,161
We found Liu Yi

182
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,680
but he refuses to testify.

183
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,521
Why not?

184
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:15,721
Imagine.

185
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,641
He had an affair with Qian Tianxin.

186
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,521
And his family was destroyed.

187
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,760
To testify against her now

188
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,240
is to announce this story to everyone he knows.

189
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,560
What do we do now?

190
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,240
Wang.

191
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
Are you at the scene?

192
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,641
Put your phone on speaker.

193
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,521
Your Honor.

194
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,920
The truth cannot be more apparent.

195
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:45,000
I don't understand why

196
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,120
we should continue this trial.

197
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:48,120
I think the plaintiff

198
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
is just trying to waste

199
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,201
my client's time out of spite.

200
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,000
I do not know

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,721
if there are any grudges between

202
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:00,000
Prosecutor An and my client.

203
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,481
Why are you pestering my client

204
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,560
for something
that is already clear enough?

205
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,081
You're wasting my client's time

206
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:09,000
and this constitutes harassment.

207
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,000
Defense Attorney.

208
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,560
Please calm yourself.

209
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,800
The witness cannot demand
an adjournment.

210
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:22,401
But as a prosecutor,
what is your opinion?

211
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,360
To obtain the full picture of the case,

212
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,120
I suggest we adjourn the session.

213
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,201
For how long?

214
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:36,000
Does everyone here have to wait for you?

215
00:10:36,521 --> 00:10:38,560
Your Honor, may I speak?

216
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,481
You may.

217
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:41,081
The evidence we have now

218
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,081
casts doubt on the defendant.

219
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,401
If the defense lawyer

220
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:46,161
has questions regarding my testimony,

221
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,041
you should consult the witness,

222
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:50,320
instead of asking Your Honor
to dismiss its admissibility.

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,601
Agreed.

224
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,961
Defense Attorney,

225
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:57,440
you are allowed to question

226
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:59,240
the witness.

227
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,120
And the plaintiff can question
the accused too.

228
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:05,521
Would you like to question the witness,
Defense Attorney?

229
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:06,521
Yes.

230
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,880
You may proceed.

231
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:11,961
Witness An Ni,

232
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,401
what is your relationship
with Qian Tianxin?

233
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,401
Nothing whatsoever.

234
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,920
Are you prosecuting Qian Tianxin

235
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,041
in China?

236
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
My establishment has not been granted

237
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
the permission to arrest Qian Tianxin

238
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,360
so I cannot prosecute Qian Tianxin.

239
00:11:32,961 --> 00:11:34,961
Did you come here

240
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,680
to demand

241
00:11:36,961 --> 00:11:39,000
that my client be extradited?

242
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,160
(China-Country F Treaty on Mutual
Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters)

243
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:42,521
(China-Country F Treaty on Mutual)
According to Section 3, Article 1

244
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,401
(Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters)
of the mutual legal assistance treaty

245
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,000
signed by both nations,

246
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:47,760
extradition cannot be applied

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,641
to this case.

248
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I am testifying today

249
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:53,000
not because I want Qian Tianxin
to be extradited,

250
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,320
but because I want to assist

251
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:57,401
the court to find out the truth.

252
00:11:57,961 --> 00:11:59,560
But if my client is not guilty,

253
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,521
you will have grounds

254
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,961
to demand Country F

255
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,800
to extradite her.

256
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,360
The defense attorney

257
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
laid out an irrelevant hypothesis

258
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:09,360
and I refuse to comment.

259
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:11,800
(Hi, Mr. Liu.)

260
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:14,521
(I am He Luyuan, from Jiangcheng PSB
Criminal Investigation Division.)

261
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,041
(I am calling from the court)

262
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,401
(of a certain nation in Southeast Asia.)

263
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:21,440
(I am trying to demand the local government
extradite Qian Tianxin.)

264
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,880
(However, to escape from extradition,)

265
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:24,401
(Qian Tianxin claimed that she committed
the crime of bigamy.)

266
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,961
(If she is found guilty,)

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,880
(she cannot be extradited)

268
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,641
(and won't be punished for her crime.)

269
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
(Is this what you want to see?)

270
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,320
(Mr. Liu Yi.)

271
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:39,161
(Who ruined your life?)

272
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,880
Who gave you this life of fugitive?

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,961
(Do you want Qian Tianxin to scam more people?)

274
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,560
(Mr. Liu Yi, your testimony is very important to us.)

275
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:53,680
(And we need it urgently.)

276
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:54,800
Your Honor,

277
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,880
I would like to question Qian Tianxin

278
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,481
regarding her Chinese husband.

279
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,320
Objection.

280
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:02,601
Mr. Prosecutor,

281
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,481
what are you trying to insinuate

282
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:08,800
by using my client's previous name?

283
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:11,120
Let me rephrase.

284
00:13:11,401 --> 00:13:12,920
I would like to question Mrs. Go...

285
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:14,201
I can't help

286
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:16,320
but think that you
have an ulterior motive.

287
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,880
Mr. Prosecutor,

288
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:19,920
Mrs. Gomez pleads guilty.

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,281
As a prosecutor,

290
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,120
you went out of your way

291
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,320
to clear her name.

292
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:28,240
You colluded with your Chinese counterparts

293
00:13:28,281 --> 00:13:29,880
so that Mrs. Gomez can be extradited.

294
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,961
Is this what a prosecutor should do?

295
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:34,481
Colluding with others to get Mrs. Gomez extradited.

296
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:35,880
You are abusing your power

297
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,641
against an innocent individual

298
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:40,201
and I find that tyrannical.

299
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,320
Defense Attorney,

300
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,440
please mind your word.

301
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,281
Or you will be punished

302
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,000
for making spurious claims

303
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:49,521
in court.

304
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:50,641
Miss An Ni,

305
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,680
please present

306
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,440
your evidence already.

307
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:56,721
All right, Your Honor.

308
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,760
The back story of Miss Qian Tianxin

309
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,240
is still shrouded in mystery.

310
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:04,641
Before I submit my evidence,

311
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,880
I want to confirm something.

312
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:09,760
Miss Qian Tianxin,

313
00:14:09,961 --> 00:14:14,081
is it true that Mr. Liu Yi is your ex-husband?

314
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:19,440
Isn't it written on the complaint?

315
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,240
Do you have to ask me that question?

316
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,281
Is it true that you still keep the vow

317
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,721
you swore the day you gained

318
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,680
Country F's citizenship?

319
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,760
A vow is a vow.

320
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,201
You cannot take it back.

321
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,560
Good.

322
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:39,081
I'm glad we have come to this understanding.

323
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:40,521
Mrs. Gomez,

324
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:43,041
this is your final reminder.

325
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,841
You have taken an oath here
and are willing

326
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,120
to shoulder the consequences of perjury.

327
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,000
Enough.

328
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,240
Stop wasting our time.

329
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,961
Can Miss An Ni

330
00:14:57,201 --> 00:15:00,320
provide the so-called evidence?

331
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:01,601
If not,

332
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:04,560
please announce your judgment, Your Honor.

333
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
Be patient,

334
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,360
Defense Attorney.

335
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,961
We just submitted a video.

336
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,680
Your Honor,

337
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:16,920
may we play the testimony in public?

338
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:17,961
Yes.

339
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:21,401
(Your Honor, I am Liu Yi.)

340
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,800
(My real name is Liu Dafu.)

341
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:26,800
(IC, Name: Liu Dafu)
(This is my IC.)

342
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,880
(On July five years ago,)

343
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
(Qian Tianxin and I fell in love)

344
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,920
(and we got married.)

345
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,081
(Little did I know)

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,401
(that she would disappear)

347
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:44,601
(after she took all my money.)

348
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,601
(Fortunately, I did save something
for myself.)

349
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,281
(I didn't marry her for real.)

350
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,281
(Because it was all
an extramarital affair.)

351
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:54,880
I married her under the name of Liu Yi.

352
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,281
So my marriage to her
is not legally binding.

353
00:15:57,521 --> 00:16:00,880
I heard that she will be charged for bigamy.

354
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:04,320
I hereby declare

355
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:08,320
solemnly to the court

356
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:11,880
that my marriage

357
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:17,041
to Qian Tianxin, is illegal.

358
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
Therefore, she did not commit bigamy.

359
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:27,440
(Qian Tianxin stole my life savings from me.)

360
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,120
(She left me with nothing)

361
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:32,281
(but debts and a fugitive life.)

362
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,401
(Qian Tianxin.)

363
00:16:35,641 --> 00:16:36,841
(You have committed enough crimes.)

364
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,440
(You cannot go unpunished.)

365
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,081
(I was too hung up with my pride)

366
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:42,201
(but now, I fear no one.)

367
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:43,961
(I will drag you with me,)

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,081
(no matter the cost.)

369
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:46,560
Qian Tianxin.

370
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,120
You're not the smartest in the room.

371
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:52,680
You are outwitted by me.

372
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,440
I am not Liu Yi.

373
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,961
I am Liu Dafu.

374
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:00,521
I already have a family.

375
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,120
And my marriage to you

376
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,800
is but a lie.

377
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,081
No man will ever

378
00:17:06,121 --> 00:17:07,721
take his mistress seriously.

379
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,121
So know your place

380
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,961
because my wife is much better than you.

381
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,400
My wife was with me
when I declared bankruptcy.

382
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm penniless

383
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,800
but I have my family.

384
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:17,640
Qian Tianxin,

385
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,280
what do you have?

386
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,721
Nothing.

387
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,520
Today, in front of everyone,

388
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,440
I will reveal your hypocrisy.

389
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,721
You shall be locked behind bars.

390
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,121
A liar like you

391
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,121
will not destroy another family again.

392
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:33,001
(Never.)

393
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,920
You can't.

394
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,761
Stop it.

395
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,841
Wait.

396
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,601
We still stand a chance.

397
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,081
Tell them to stop playing the video!

398
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,440
Your Honor,

399
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,481
Qian Tianxin's husband,

400
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:41,881
Liu Yi,

401
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,241
is in the video.

402
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,440
Silence!

403
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,241
Miss An Ni,

404
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,961
do you have other evidence?

405
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,920
Yes.

406
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:56,241
While we were watching the video,

407
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:56,920
our police officers

408
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,361
were gathering Liu Yi's fingerprint

409
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,440
and managed to confirm

410
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,201
that the person in the video
is indeed Liu Yi.

411
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,800
Our officers will transcribe

412
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:07,180
the video content.

413
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,081
We will send the materials to you via fax,

414
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:13,920
as well as the testimony from Liu Yi's
current spouse.

415
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,440
Other relevant documents

416
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,081
will also be delivered
via due procedures.

417
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:18,400
Objection!

418
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,640
Evidence gathered by the Chinese

419
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,520
law enforcers cannot be admitted to a court
in Country F.

420
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:22,680
Defense Attorney,

421
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:24,920
control your emotions.

422
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:26,961
Miss Qian Tianxin,

423
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:30,241
anything you would like to say regarding

424
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:33,201
the evidence presented
by the Chinese prosecutors?

425
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,881
I'm sick of this fiasco.

426
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:43,320
Let's cut to the chase.

427
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,800
Say what you want already.

428
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,241
Don't do all this to humiliate me.

429
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:52,361
Miss An Ni, go ahead.

430
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,241
Unleash everything on me.

431
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:58,640
My testimony concludes here.

432
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,520
To ensure proper court proceedings,

433
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:02,680
I would like to withdraw
from the witness stand.

434
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,841
You may.

435
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:10,160
Prosecutor, deliver the evidence.

436
00:19:16,881 --> 00:19:17,601
Now,

437
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,500
based on the information
taken from the Immigration Office,

438
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,361
defendant, Qian Tianxin,

439
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,640
concealed her true marital status

440
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:30,081
and married one of our own

441
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,680
to obtain Country F's citizenship.

442
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,081
My client's previous marriage in China

443
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,721
is not recognized but that doesn't mean

444
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
her marriage here isn't.

445
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,121
Therefore,

446
00:19:43,361 --> 00:19:44,721
she did not make any false claims.

447
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,800
The evidence presented

448
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,520
already suggests that Qian Tianxin

449
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,721
was not aware of the illegitimacy

450
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,440
of her marriage back in China
when she applied

451
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:55,040
for Country F's citizenship.

452
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
That means she did try

453
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,121
to conceal her marital status

454
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,361
so that she could marry our citizen

455
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,520
to gain our citizenship.

456
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:03,721
This is unfair.

457
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,601
They have colluded with each other.

458
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,081
The Chinese prosecutors want to prove

459
00:20:08,121 --> 00:20:10,520
that my client did not commit bigamy

460
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,121
so that she will not be indicted here.

461
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,881
And the other prosecutors

462
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,520
try to void my client's citizenship

463
00:20:16,721 --> 00:20:18,721
so that she can be extradited to China.

464
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,440
They plot everything

465
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,400
from the beginning.

466
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,040
Defense Attorney, please focus on the case.

467
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Do not throw out irrelevant hypotheses.

468
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,841
Plaintiff, please present your demand.

469
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,400
The accused, Qian Tianxin,

470
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:46,320
obtained Country F's citizenship

471
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:47,800
via false claims

472
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:54,121
and thus, should be deported.

473
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:58,160
Any final statement, defendant?

474
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:03,320
Defendant,

475
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:05,680
do you want to remain silent?

476
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:15,920
I have nothing to add.

477
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,280
All rise.

478
00:21:23,121 --> 00:21:25,640
As the defendant's marriage

479
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,481
in China is not recognized,

480
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,761
she then did not commit

481
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,520
the crime of bigamy.

482
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,680
However, the defendant's Country F

483
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:43,001
citizenship will be stripped as she

484
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,560
only obtained it by making false claims.

485
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:51,280
The defendant, Qian Tianxin,

486
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:56,201
has overstayed her visa

487
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,721
and will be deported
to her home country.

488
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:29,481
Have some water.

489
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,481
Thanks.

490
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,520
Enjoying the view,

491
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:49,361
Prosecutor An?

492
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,160
From the moment I was taken

493
00:22:54,201 --> 00:22:55,800
to the airport,

494
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:59,601
your eyes never leave me.

495
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:01,800
Are you serious?

496
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:04,680
It's her job to stare at you.

497
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,361
She's being professional.

498
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,520
Can I use the bathroom?

499
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:19,961
Captain He,

500
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,841
the suspect wants to use the bathroom.

501
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:22,601
Go.

502
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:34,640
Frisk her.

503
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,361
Turn around.

504
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,400
Straighten your arms.

505
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,841
Master.

506
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,560
Jot it down.

507
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:00,081
Noted.

508
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,841
You still want to use the toilet?

509
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:15,520
Don't worry.

510
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
It'll be fine.

511
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,481
Go in.

512
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,081
They are here.

513
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,320
My colleagues, good job.

514
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:10,800
You accomplished the mission

515
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:12,361
despite the difficulties.

516
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:15,640
I will commend all of you.

517
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:20,201
Prosecutor Guo, we did it.

518
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,601
I'm proud of you.

519
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,241
Sir,

520
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
we have brought all suspects

521
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,560
and evidence back.

522
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,361
We await your order.

523
00:25:34,081 --> 00:25:34,881
Well done.

524
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,841
You can now gloat over it.

525
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,160
Come back.

526
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,361
After meticulous concertations
with the judiciary department of Country F,

527
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:53,320
(International Criminal Syndicate)
41 members of a criminal syndicate,

528
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,800
(Dismantled By Jiangcheng Police)
including its head, Qian Tianxin

529
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:57,400
have been extradited.

530
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,320
Currently,

531
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,040
Qian Tianxin is being held in custody

532
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,961
in Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau.

533
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,881
The case is pending
further investigations.

534
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,241
Qian Tianxin.

535
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,160
You cannot escape
the long arm of the law.

536
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:15,721
We have finally met.

537
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:21,881
I anticipated this.

538
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,081
But not this soon.

539
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:30,040
Take her away.

540
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:34,481
Hi, I am a journalist
from provincial TV.

541
00:26:34,481 --> 00:26:35,560
Prosecutor An,

542
00:26:35,601 --> 00:26:37,601
can you give us a rundown

543
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,841
of the case?

544
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:39,920
Hi, Captain He.

545
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,400
I'm from Jiangcheng TV.

546
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:42,400
Can you tell us

547
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,320
about the problems you faced

548
00:26:44,361 --> 00:26:45,280
during the investigation?

549
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
Prosecutor An, Captain An,

550
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:47,920
this is an international case

551
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:50,160
that involves a lot of money.

552
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:52,481
Do you have a word or two

553
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,920
to tell our audience?

554
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,800
Hi, everyone.

555
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:57,881
I'll give a few comments.

556
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:01,361
The investigation is still ongoing.

557
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,721
The latest update

558
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,761
will be released to the public

559
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,520
(via our official channels.)

560
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,241
Qian Tianxin,

561
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:07,160
this is our job badge.

562
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:10,081
Today, you will be interrogated.

563
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,841
Name?

564
00:28:15,881 --> 00:28:16,680
Qian Tianxin.

565
00:28:17,841 --> 00:28:18,640
Nationality?

566
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:20,560
Chinese.

567
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,761
Li Gui.

568
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,361
Please read out the rights of accused persons.

569
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:28,800
According to the Criminal Procedure Law

570
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,841
of the People's Republic of China,

571
00:28:29,961 --> 00:28:31,440
you have the following rights.

572
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:32,201
Cut it out.

573
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,640
No need to recite them.

574
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,201
I know already.

575
00:28:35,361 --> 00:28:36,761
I know you're busy

576
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:40,601
so let's skip the formalities.

577
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,721
Qian Tianxin.

578
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,680
You might be familiar with the procedures

579
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,560
but if you want to get out,

580
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:48,961
you cooperate with us

581
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,001
and tell us what you did.

582
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,560
Oh, my fellow officers.

583
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,400
Don't waste your time.

584
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:58,440
We know each other for long enough.

585
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:00,560
So don't threaten me.

586
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,440
Don't worry.

587
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:04,280
I'll come clean.

588
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,881
I'll tell you

589
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
what you know

590
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,320
and what you don't know.

591
00:29:09,761 --> 00:29:10,761
All right?

592
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:11,841
Okay.

593
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,640
Let's begin.

594
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,721
I plead guilty to all charges.

595
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:24,640
The criminal syndicate is mine.

596
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,680
The organized scam? I did it.

597
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,761
The online casino is also mine.

598
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,841
I trafficked humans,

599
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:34,841
detained them illegally,

600
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:36,721
and laundered money.

601
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:39,361
Relax.

602
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,520
I'll give the details

603
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,280
one by one.

604
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Let's start with cyber fraud.

605
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:52,280
Although you had been trying
to hunt me down,

606
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,400
it is surprising how little

607
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,081
you know about my modus operandi.

608
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:59,920
You only scratched the surface.

609
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:04,481
My business model is very simple.

610
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:07,121
Regardless of your social background,

611
00:30:07,601 --> 00:30:10,481
gender, or education level,

612
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,560
everyone has a weakness.

613
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:17,841
They can all fall victim to my scheme.

614
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,761
You just need to

615
00:30:20,241 --> 00:30:22,881
identify the weakness.

616
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:27,361
Single men are the easiest.

617
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,841
They think with their lower half.

618
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,001
The quickest way is to bait them

619
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,520
with our female streamers.

620
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,361
They will then have cam sex.

621
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,160
And if

622
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,680
(Don't forget to follow me)
we don't have enough female streamers,

623
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:42,761
we'll just slot in one
of the staff members,

624
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,761
(Watch Live)
who'll use a voice changing software

625
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,961
and play a pre-recorded video.

626
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:49,040
In other words,

627
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:51,841
most of the victims are having

628
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,800
cam sex with a guy.

629
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:56,280
And if they refuse to bite the bait?

630
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,241
Impossible.

631
00:30:59,841 --> 00:31:01,481
If they are not enticed by it,

632
00:31:01,761 --> 00:31:02,961
it just means

633
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,040
that they are not just horny,

634
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,361
but also greedy for money.

635
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:09,001
Then we just have to switch our tactics.

636
00:31:09,081 --> 00:31:09,601
Wang.

637
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:11,640
I have good news for you.

638
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:14,601
Remember the 10,000 yuan investment

639
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:17,180
you placed into my sister's platform?

640
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,020
Guess how much is your return?

641
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,560
In three days,

642
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:22,440
you got 2,400 yuan.

643
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:23,560
I'm serious.

644
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:24,961
It's not a joke.

645
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,601
Oh.

646
00:31:26,601 --> 00:31:26,961
(Language: Arts of Persuasion)

647
00:31:26,961 --> 00:31:28,481
(Language: Arts of Persuasion)
This is insider news

648
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,040
(Language: Arts of Persuasion)
so don't tell anyone.

649
00:31:30,481 --> 00:31:32,721
The last round will have

650
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:34,440
three times the ROI.

651
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,201
However,

652
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,361
the deadline is midnight.

653
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,001
There aren't
a lot of available spots left

654
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:41,881
so Wang,

655
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,001
you have to act now or never.

656
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:47,481
But of course,

657
00:31:47,761 --> 00:31:51,361
some want bigger thrills.

658
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,640
Gambling online gives them an irregular shot

659
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:00,121
of endorphin.

660
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:03,160
They will spend their days

661
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,361
gambling or thinking about gambling.

662
00:32:05,761 --> 00:32:07,800
Even though they know it's a trap.

663
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,001
Maybe they will regret it

664
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:10,721
the next morning.

665
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,241
But at night,

666
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,640
the temptation returns.

667
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:20,601
Hey.

668
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:21,640
It's me.

669
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:24,440
Is there a game?

670
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,881
I'll wager.

671
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:26,761
I'll continue.

672
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:29,800
Women are easy victims too.

673
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,481
Especially single or emotionally unfulfilled women.

674
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:35,601
We have trained people

675
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:38,601
to project different personas.

676
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:40,121
And we will select the persona

677
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,520
that will please the woman in particular.

678
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,361
Miss...

679
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,400
What the...?

680
00:32:48,481 --> 00:32:49,560
What's wrong with you?

681
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:51,400
Why are you doing this?

682
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:54,160
Why can't I transfer money to my boyfriend?

683
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,481
You have no right to criticize me.

684
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:56,320
Miss.

685
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:56,761
Hurry up now.

686
00:32:56,761 --> 00:32:57,961
I think your boyfriend is a scammer.

687
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,160
When those women fell victims,

688
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,841
they are dead loyal.

689
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,241
Even when the police
knock on their door,

690
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,201
they won't change their mind.

691
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,721
My boyfriend is working in Malaysia.

692
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:11,160
He needs money now

693
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,560
and you're here endangering
his business.

694
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:13,320
Are you going to compensate him?

695
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:13,881
Miss.

696
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,241
I'm pretty sure he is a scammer.

697
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,481
- Don't touch me.
- We're doing this...

698
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:17,800
Don't waste my time.

699
00:33:17,841 --> 00:33:19,241
Transfer the money now.

700
00:33:19,361 --> 00:33:21,601
People always think
they are smart enough

701
00:33:22,361 --> 00:33:23,800
not to fall
for the oldest trick in the book.

702
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:26,400
Well, they overestimate themselves.

703
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:29,440
They are not up against a scammer.

704
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:31,841
They are up against
a network of scammers.

705
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:35,841
When my staff member finds

706
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:37,800
a hard-to-please target,

707
00:33:38,241 --> 00:33:40,841
he will distribute

708
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:42,920
the conversation among the chat groups.

709
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,361
In groups,

710
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,001
everyone will try to formalize a response
to click with the victim.

711
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,241
Here in reality,

712
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,881
your spouse doesn't have time for you.

713
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,721
But we're different.

714
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,800
Someone will give you attention 24/7.

715
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,440
No one can resist that.

716
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,801
But how did you lure them out of China?

717
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,321
That's even easier.

718
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,640
Young people nowadays

719
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,761
dream of traveling.

720
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:22,400
They think there are more opportunities
abroad

721
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,600
and they will be surrounded
by pretty ladies.

722
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,160
Just offer them a promising job

723
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:28,640
and a free plane ticket

724
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:30,721
and they rush over here in an instant.

725
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,440
Listen to me, son.

726
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,201
Don't go.

727
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,160
What's so bad about it?

728
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,120
It's all a lie. Can't you see?

729
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:42,481
You will have to work as a scammer.

730
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:43,961
It's a crime.

731
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:45,360
It gives me money.

732
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:46,360
My son.

733
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:47,840
Stop nagging me.

734
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,041
(Most of the time,)

735
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,761
(our workers were previously
our scam targets.)

736
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,400
(We milked them dry)

737
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,561
(so we persuaded them to leave China.)

738
00:34:57,281 --> 00:34:58,880
(Once they arrive at our place,)

739
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,801
(we tell them to scam other victims.)

740
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,481
(That's how we find new blood.)

741
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:09,041
And so, my company grew stronger.

742
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,640
Besides, those who are mired in debts

743
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:14,360
are banned from traveling anyway.

744
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:17,201
For example,

745
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,920
Zhang Xiaobei.

746
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,961
Qian Tianxin.

747
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,400
Two years ago, on July 23rd,

748
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:29,801
there was a murder in Country A.

749
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,041
You did it, didn't you?

750
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,160
July 23rd? Country A?

751
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,440
It doesn't ring a bell.

752
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:40,840
What about the person, A?

753
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,400
Have you heard of him?

754
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:48,521
No, not at all.

755
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:51,321
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)
Li Quan.

756
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:51,801
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)

757
00:35:51,801 --> 00:35:54,400
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)
We have good news for you.

758
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:58,281
(Jiangcheng No. 2 Prison)
We have arrested Qian Tianxin

759
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,241
so you don't have

760
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:01,920
to worry that she will harm you or your family.

761
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,561
She's in a sticky situation.

762
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:08,360
I knew this day would come.

763
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:12,120
We also have two questions for you.

764
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:13,880
One,

765
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:18,120
do you know who A is?

766
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:19,241
Two,

767
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,041
do you know who orchestrated

768
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:24,840
the murder of Zhang Wanru?

769
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:29,201
A... huh?

770
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,201
I believe I have said this before.

771
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,001
A was frequently mentioned

772
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:38,201
by Xin and other colleagues,

773
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,360
but I do not know

774
00:36:41,561 --> 00:36:42,920
what he looks like.

775
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,120
As for the murder of Zhang Wanru,

776
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
it has nothing to do with me.

777
00:36:49,521 --> 00:36:51,680
My job was to relay

778
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:54,201
the documents to my superior, Zhou.

779
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,880
I don't know

780
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:58,561
if Xin or other people were involved.

781
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:01,840
Killing a police officer is a serious crime.

782
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,080
I'm sure A was there
to oversee the operation

783
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,080
and he didn't tell us anything.

784
00:37:08,481 --> 00:37:09,321
Qian Tianxin.

785
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,080
The members of your criminal syndicate

786
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:19,400
all claimed that you are the mastermind.

787
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,680
If you work for A,

788
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:24,801
does this mean

789
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,680
that A entrusts everything to you?

790
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:33,321
Is it true?

791
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,481
You're currently the prime suspect

792
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:40,400
of this international crime.

793
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:02,160
Man, you left me with no choice.

794
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,400
Fine.

795
00:38:06,041 --> 00:38:07,321
I'll confess.

796
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,281
It's not like I have much to lose.

797
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,761
I'll be dead anyway.

798
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:19,840
Confessing to another murder

799
00:38:20,321 --> 00:38:21,481
won't change the outcome.

800
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,920
Think carefully before you answer.

801
00:38:22,961 --> 00:38:24,481
I am asking you a serious question.

802
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,241
No need to raise your tone.

803
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,680
I am a woman of my word.

804
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,281
I admit that I am A.

805
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:41,001
(Qian Tianxin: I am A)
I orchestrated that murder in Country A.

806
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:44,761
You couldn't catch me

807
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,721
and that was on you.

808
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,080
As for the female officer...

809
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,041
Yes,

810
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,120
I hired someone to kill her.

811
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,640
Before the hitman left,

812
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:01,721
I told him to train

813
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:03,961
his eyes on the female officer,

814
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,321
to floor the pedal so hard

815
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,801
that the female officer performed

816
00:39:09,241 --> 00:39:11,761
a somersault mid-air.

817
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,761
What's the matter?

818
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Qian Tianxin confessed that she is A.

819
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,241
I submitted her statement
to Prosecutor Guo.

820
00:39:39,521 --> 00:39:40,840
This is the footage
of the interrogation.

821
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,600
Have a look and see if you want
to add other questions.

822
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,521
So our theory is right?

823
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
She is A?

824
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,481
Should we celebrate?

825
00:39:55,281 --> 00:39:56,321
We should.

826
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,801
But not today.

827
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,440
You must be tired
from the interrogation.

828
00:39:59,521 --> 00:40:00,761
I'll go home after I watch this.

829
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Don't stay up too late.

830
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:03,321
Okay.

831
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,840
He Luyuan.

832
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,241
Thank you.

833
00:40:08,721 --> 00:40:10,120
It's my job.

834
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,041
(I am A,)

835
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,201
(the culprit of Case 7·23)

836
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:56,600
(that you want to arrest.)

837
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:01,440
(We do have a branch)

838
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,801
(in Country A.)

839
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,201
(It's actually a small place)

840
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,321
(but that officer)

841
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:11,321
(knew what she shouldn't have known.)

842
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:13,961
(She wanted to take out our branch)

843
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:15,160
(in Country A.)

844
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,801
(And she somehow learned my secret)

845
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,241
so to protect myself,

846
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,561
I killed her.

847
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,080
How did you meet Paul?

848
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,600
Where and when?

849
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,120
I want the address and the time.

850
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,880
On the afternoon
of July 15th two years ago.

851
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:40,801
(Around 3:15 p.m.)

852
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:45,001
(I remember Paul
was late for seven minutes)

853
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,281
(so we met at 3:22 p.m.)

854
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,801
(Where?)

855
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,120
We met at a port around an hour away

856
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,961
from Pasak.

857
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,120
Which street? Which district?

858
00:41:58,201 --> 00:41:59,400
Officer He,

859
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:01,961
is that necessary?

860
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:03,481
It was two years ago.

861
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,521
How am I supposed to remember the street name

862
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,080
or the district from two years ago?

863
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,680
If you are A

864
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,880
and did hire someone
to kill Zhang Wanru,

865
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,840
(you will remember)

866
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,201
(this important detail.)

867
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:20,321
Let me recall.

868
00:42:20,561 --> 00:42:25,761
(I think it's No. 117, Carey-Layes Avenue.)

869
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:28,801
We were in a cafe called...

870
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,600
Marie Payne.

871
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,440
Yes.

872
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,801
Marie Payne.

873
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,080
I remember there is

874
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,041
a famous touristic site
opposite the coffee shop.

875
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,201
(It's the Granotta Monument)

876
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:47,440
in Port Selva.

877
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,120
It's in full view of my position in the cafe.

878
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,640
(What did you order?)

879
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
(Nothing in particular.)

880
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,801
Just two flat white coffee of Country A.

881
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,160
Monument...
