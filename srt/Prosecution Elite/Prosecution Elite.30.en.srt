=Episode 30=

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,680
I've just arrived downstairs
from my home.

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,920
If it's not important,

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,720
let's talk about it tomorrow.

18
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,479
Ni, it's too late to
wait till tomorrow.

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,159
Really. I'm not kidding around with you.

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,640
It's a big deal.

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,759
You know that Zhao Jikai's
illegal online loan case

22
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,720
has been very strange

23
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,280
and there are many unreasonable points.

24
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,199
We haven't been able to
come up with an explanation.

25
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,879
But just now,
I've got it all figured out

26
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,080
and I have to tell you face to face.

27
00:01:59,159 --> 00:01:59,680
Okay.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,239
I'm coming over now.

29
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,559
I need this loan urgently.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,239
Yes.

31
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,920
Please do all you can to ensure that.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,199
Okay.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
I'll be waiting for your good news.

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,520
Okay.

35
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:16,679
Bye.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,920
Mr. Yin, you want to see me?

37
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,280
Mu'en, yeah, I want to see you.

38
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,479
I asked you to come here

39
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,880
to inform you of something.

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
I've given the order.

41
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:30,160
I've told them to get
the new CEO's office ready

42
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,199
as soon as possible.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,520
I've thought about it twice

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,399
and I've decided to use
Zhao Jikai's office for it

45
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,679
because it is large
and has a good layout,

46
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,039
and it is also very easy for you
to communicate with me

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,119
because it is close to my office.

48
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,240
Mr. Yin, there's no need for that.

49
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,959
I can work from anywhere.

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Stop refusing.

51
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,959
You just don't like to

52
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,720
talk about things.

53
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,959
It's okay if you don't speak up.

54
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,679
But I would be remiss as a boss

55
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,920
if I didn't notice it.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,000
Think about it.

57
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,160
If I don't make life easier
for the new CEO,

58
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,039
how can he generate new profits?

59
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,720
Besides, we have a good rapport

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,880
and I liked you from
the moment I saw you.

61
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,759
Thank you for your appreciation, Mr. Yin.

62
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,759
It's my pleasure.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
I still remember one of the remarks

64
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,280
you made to us at a meeting

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,119
that still sticks in my mind.

66
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,080
You said that doing business
is like conquering a city,

67
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,280
we have to be steady,

68
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
cautious, step by step.

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,479
You also said that when
it comes to emergencies,

70
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,880
we must be calm and collected.

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,360
Sow a mindset and
you will reap a thought,

72
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,119
sow a thought and
you will reap a deed,

73
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,360
sow a deed and
you will reap a destiny.

74
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,160
Mr. Yin, don't worry.

75
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:57,039
I will definitely keep my faith,

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,160
keep my original intention,
and resolutely grow together with Huiquan

77
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,119
through thick and thin.

78
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,080
I believe my judgment is correct.

79
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,759
Thank you, Mr. Yin.

80
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,959
Ni, you're finally here.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,399
Hurry up.

82
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,479
Sit down.

83
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,479
What's the matter?

84
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,719
I am not here to chat with you.

85
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:21,439
Go ahead, what is wrong with Zhao Jikai?

86
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,080
It's really about the case.

87
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,640
Look, Zhao Jikai and Hei

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,360
have been interrogated repeatedly.

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,360
And the Public Security Organs
have failed to find

90
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,719
other people involved
in the illegal online loan

91
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,840
and related evidence
based on their confessions

92
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
Do you know why?

93
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
Zhao Jikai didn't tell the whole truth.

94
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,719
Yes.

95
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,520
But now, I'm proud to say

96
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,279
that I've got it all figured out just now.

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
What is it with you now?

98
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,999
You're looking into
illegal online loans?

99
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,080
I didn't think about
looking into it at first,

100
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,360
but I came across information
about illegal online loans a while ago

101
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,920
when I was playing that game

102
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,840
to test the trigger mechanism,

103
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,279
and I was very curious.

104
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,759
Then I looked into it deeper,
and guess what?

105
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,840
I found out a big secret.

106
00:05:08,944 --> 00:05:09,218
(Dear valued user,)

107
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:09,699
(you have run out of coins
during the game)

108
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,180
(and this will affect the rest
of your gaming experience.)

109
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:10,867
(You may consider topping up or
taking a loan from our company)

110
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:11,245
(to get your game to the next level.)

111
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:11,380
(Enter)

112
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,199
Hello.

113
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:13,719
(Hello.)

114
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:16,039
You sent me the email in my game,
didn't you?

115
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:16,800
(Yes.)

116
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,439
Is it true what you say
about fast loan?

117
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,800
(It's true, Handsome.)

118
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:21,759
(It's not a scam.)

119
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,840
(Our company offers fast loans
with zero collateral,)

120
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,719
(no credit and no conditions.)

121
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,920
(Just fill out a form with
your relevant information)

122
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,360
(and you're good to go.)

123
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,960
(As for the interest rate,)

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,840
(we charge a slightly higher rate,)

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,960
(but this is the price for a fast loan.)

126
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,680
(And you don't have to
worry about this at all.)

127
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,640
(If you are unable to repay
your loan at that time,)

128
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,120
(we will design a repayment plan
to suit you.)

129
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,599
(It's very safe.)

130
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,360
Did you take out a loan from them?

131
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,840
I wanted to see what they were up to

132
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:54,879
when they told me

133
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,080
they were offering fast loans
with zero collateral.

134
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,400
As soon as I got the money,
I understood everything.

135
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,240
This online loan company

136
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,719
is not only unqualified

137
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,719
but also illegal and
charges interest in advance.

138
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,560
Look at my contract,
I loaned 10,000 yuan,

139
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,879
they gave me 8,000 yuan,
directly deducted 2,000 yuan,

140
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,759
and there are other processing fees
and verification fees.

141
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,759
Guess how much the APR exceeds?

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,920
70 percent.

143
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,120
70 percent?

144
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,520
This is far exceeding
the national maximum annual interest rate.

145
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,520
This is just one aspect
of their law breaking.

146
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,719
The best thing about them is
their ability to get the money back

147
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:29,120
and the flow of funds.

148
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,520
This was actually one of the questions

149
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,680
I had back then.

150
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,680
You see, like these online loans,

151
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,400
they usually profit
from high interest rates.

152
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,960
Although they have their own way of
collecting debts,

153
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:42,080
if they target these young people

154
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,080
who have no ability to repay,

155
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,439
it will inevitably cause their

156
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:46,479
financial chains to break down.

157
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,400
And Zhao Jikai set up a system

158
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,080
to filter out these young gamers

159
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,479
as their target group.

160
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,759
I don't believe any money lender
would be willing

161
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,960
to loan money to these
young people who can't repay it.

162
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,240
I thought the same as you at first.

163
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,279
So I deliberately
got them to filter me out

164
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,120
and then I borrowed 10,000 yuan
from one of them

165
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,520
and then deliberately
didn't pay the money back.

166
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,120
I didn't answer their calls,

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,439
and I didn't reply to their messages.

168
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:12,759
I just wanted to know

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,159
what they would do if they came across

170
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,520
a non-payer like me.

171
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:23,840
Stop right here.

172
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,719
What... What do you want?

173
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,039
You're Han Xuan, right?

174
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,999
Do you know that you are overdue

175
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:33,080
for the money you borrowed?

176
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,439
You didn't answer our calls,

177
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,520
and you didn't reply to our messages.

178
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,360
You want to renege?

179
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,599
Didn't customer service tell you
what we would do

180
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,479
if you couldn't pay back the money
when you first borrowed it?

181
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,279
They did.

182
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,640
Which company do you work for?

183
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,999
It's none of your business.

184
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,520
Someone hired us to collect your

185
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,680
last month's debt anyway.

186
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,680
You must pay me back today,

187
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:57,840
with interest, not a penny less.

188
00:07:58,774 --> 00:07:59,520
Mister, I...

189
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,920
I really don't have the money
at the moment.

190
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,999
You're trying to
get tough with me, right?

191
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,080
Listen, don't give me that.

192
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,999
It's useless.

193
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,120
There were many people who made excuses

194
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,240
but in the end,
they had to repay the money.

195
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,960
I don't care if you are going to
ask for money from your parents,

196
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,520
borrow from your friends,
or beg your grandparents,

197
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
you have to pay back the money today.

198
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,840
Did you hear me?

199
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,080
Mister.

200
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:26,319
I... I really don't have friends.

201
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:27,080
Alright.

202
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,599
You don't have friends, right?

203
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,159
Then we'll undress you
and take a picture of you

204
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,360
and post it all over this building.

205
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,599
Do you know what I do for a living?

206
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,920
I don't care about your job.

207
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,719
Even if you are from
the Public Security Bureau,

208
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,880
you still have to pay back the money.

209
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:42,599
You don't want to
pay back the money, right?

210
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,920
Undress him.

211
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
Mister, how about this?

212
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,120
Name a way to make money,

213
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,519
and I'll pay you back. I'll do anything.

214
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,079
The more you tell,
the more exciting it gets.

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,079
And then what did they do to you?

216
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,079
And that brings us
to the point of the story.

217
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,959
Ni, look.

218
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,079
This game,
which is the one I played a while ago,

219
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:09,680
contains a profession called Dealer.

220
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,719
They pay cash for the

221
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,120
rare equipment and trinkets

222
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,839
that players get
by playing group missions.

223
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,760
These rare equipment and trinkets

224
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,719
are hard to come by

225
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,079
so they are very expensive.

226
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,519
Besides, this game also
has a treasure access restriction,

227
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,519
which means

228
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
you have a limit on the number of times
you can enter a group mission per day.

229
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,599
You will have to buy points in order to

230
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,839
enter the group mission again.

231
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,880
And, you also need an entry ticket
to enter the group mission.

232
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:32,959
The key point is that
if you don't have good equipment

233
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,079
after you enter the group mission,

234
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,079
you can't beat the monsters,

235
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:36,399
let alone get any equipment.

236
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,800
You'll have to spend money
on equipment again.

237
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,680
Where can you buy the equipment?

238
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:40,519
From Dealer.

239
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,800
So it means that
whatever you do in this game,

240
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,000
you need to spend money.

241
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,639
No wonder some impulsive youngsters

242
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,479
want to buy gaming equipment

243
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,599
even if they have to take out loans.

244
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,320
Ni, do you remember what I said earlier?

245
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,000
The rare equipment and
trinkets in this game

246
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,279
are hard to come by
so they are very expensive.

247
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,719
What does this tell us?

248
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,440
If you're lucky,

249
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
you'll get some equipment

250
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,519
in one group mission,

251
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,440
and then you can sell it to Dealer

252
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,120
and clear your debt.

253
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,399
If you are unlucky,

254
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,399
you will not get any equipment

255
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,200
in a thousand group missions,

256
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,320
and you will work for nothing.

257
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,719
Well, isn't this Internet gambling
in disguise?

258
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:14,519
Yes.

259
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,120
I got it.

260
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,959
The so called Dealer is actually

261
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,279
using the game equipment

262
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,120
as a virtual weight.

263
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,880
They are both a market maker

264
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,320
and a loan shark,

265
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,079
making profits from both sides

266
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,839
and losing nothing on both.

267
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,440
So they don't have to worry about

268
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,399
cost recovery at all.

269
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:38,719
Besides, Ni, one thing is different.

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,440
In gambling, you can't clear your debts

271
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,519
if you have large sums of them, can you?

272
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:43,839
Yes.

273
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,039
Games are different.

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,920
Once you buy the equipment from Dealer,

275
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
the equipment is yours

276
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,039
and you can keep playing until you get

277
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,680
the rare equipment

278
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:53,039
and sell it to Dealer
to offset your debt.

279
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,719
Then, Dealer will sell
the equipment to new players,

280
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,120
so the interest will keep rolling in

281
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,479
and they will never lose money.

282
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,599
So that's how you paid back the money?

283
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,440
Yes.

284
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,279
No wonder.

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,839
It's no wonder

286
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,120
that Zhao Jikai set up
a system of filtering only

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,880
those players who are young

288
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,839
and impulsive spenders.

289
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,599
They usually come into contact
with Dealer

290
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,880
because they like to play games,

291
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,320
and they buy equipment

292
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
because they like to
spend money on impulse,

293
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,639
they take out loans because
they don't have money.

294
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,000
All these three are essential.

295
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,680
If all three of these
conditions are met,

296
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,839
one basically becomes
Zhao Jikai's victim.

297
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,159
Ni, although Zhao Jikai and Hei
have been arrested,

298
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,039
their loan companies and
debt collection agencies

299
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,200
are still operating and
continue to victimise young people.

300
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,639
Is Prosecutor Guo still in his office?

301
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:48,680
Yes.

302
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:49,880
Let's go and report to him.

303
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,519
(Attorney General's Office)

304
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,089
I have repeatedly emphasized

305
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,279
in interviews that we should not assume

306
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,200
that because young students
do not have the ability to repay,

307
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,719
they will not be targeted
by illegal online loans.

308
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,000
It is precisely these college students

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,599
and young people who have no jobs

310
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,039
and no ability to repay

311
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,120
that are more likely to be targeted

312
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,399
by these illegal online loans

313
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,360
due to their lack of social experience,

314
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,360
their lack of resistance

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,920
to temptation or their tendency

316
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,800
to spend impulsively and recklessly.

317
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,240
Behaviour such as this

318
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:33,920
has become a social phenomenon

319
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,360
of widespread concern in society.

320
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,360
So we must be vigilant

321
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,479
and do a good job of
popularising the law in this aspect.

322
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,279
Prosecutor Guo,
according to our understanding,

323
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,959
these illegal online loans have good

324
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,519
cost recovery methods such as,

325
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,079
holding nude photos as collateral,

326
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,079
non-stop phone calls, threats,

327
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,440
cyber violence, etc.

328
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,279
But these young people are not prepared

329
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,880
for the threats and the various tactics,

330
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,360
and they will do their best

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
to pay back the money.

332
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,000
For example,
asking their parents for help,

333
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,279
borrowing money from their best friends

334
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,719
or even selling their bodies
to pay back the money.

335
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,839
But with Zhao Jikai, these young people

336
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
have become slaves to the game,

337
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:16,920
tools to extract virtual value for him.
It's outrageous.

338
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:24,039
Han, do a summary of
the information you have collected

339
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,240
in the recent period

340
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,760
to the Public Security Organs
to guide them

341
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,760
to investigate further in this aspect.

342
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,200
Not only Zhao Jikai, but also all those
who are related to him,

343
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,959
especially those behind the scenes,

344
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,839
must be tracked down and arrested.

345
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,760
Yes, sir.

346
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,360
Alright.

347
00:13:41,402 --> 00:13:44,502
(Huiquan Building)

348
00:13:49,108 --> 00:13:56,208
(CEO's office)

349
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:06,618
(CEO's office)

350
00:14:13,243 --> 00:14:16,743
(Are you busy? Can you answer a call?)

351
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:30,160
(Voice or video call)

352
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:30,940
(Voice call)

353
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,360
(Hello.)

354
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,399
(what are you calling me for?)

355
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,880
Busy lady, am I interrupting your work?

356
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,279
It's like this.

357
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:45,680
My company has promoted me
to the position of CEO

358
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,039
and I would like to celebrate

359
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,440
by inviting you over for a meal.

360
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,200
Xiao Mu'en, is it inappropriate for you

361
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,519
to invite me to your home?

362
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,279
What's inappropriate?

363
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,079
Yonggang and Xiaojiao are coming.

364
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,279
Alright, I got it.

365
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,639
You just think

366
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,839
you have to repay
every kindness you receive.

367
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,479
You have to cook a meal yourself

368
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,680
so you feel better, don't you?

369
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
(Yeah, think about it,)

370
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,240
(we always eat the same thing
when we eat out.)

371
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,920
(It's not as good as eating at home.)

372
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,039
What do you think?

373
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:11,760
(Alright then.)

374
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Now that you've got a good reason,

375
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,719
I'll ask Xiaojiao when they'll be free.

376
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,959
Okay.

377
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:19,079
You decide the date.

378
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:20,000
Let me check.

379
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,800
I'll check if I'm free on Saturday night.

380
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:26,039
But Saturday is the 12th, right?

381
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,560
Gosh, I may have to come to
the procuratorate on Saturday,

382
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,440
but there's not that much of a rush.

383
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,120
How about this?

384
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,959
How about we set it for Saturday night?

385
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,560
Okay, Saturday then.

386
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,193
I am delighted to welcome you.

387
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,760
Alright, stop that.

388
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,639
I have to go now.

389
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,026
(Xiao Mu'en)

390
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,159
Xiaojiao, Yitang

391
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,719
has been in a bad mood lately

392
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:15,519
and is upset with me.

393
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,839
She won't reply to my messages.

394
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,120
Please show her more concern for me.

395
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,079
Right.

396
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
Right, Xiaojiao.

397
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,159
We're going to
Xiao Mu'en's house for dinner

398
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,639
this Saturday night, right?

399
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:28,519
Captain He.

400
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,200
Captain He.

401
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,072
You haven't had a good rest
in the past two days, have you?

402
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,000
Here's is Tang Yuan in Sweet Rice Wine.

403
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,839
It helps to replenish your vital Qi

404
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,240
and calm your mind.

405
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,839
Do all you men look at my face

406
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,519
and think I'm deficient in Qi?

407
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,880
What do you mean by we men?

408
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,639
Who else?

409
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:51,800
Forget it.

410
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,839
Xiao Mu'en?

411
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,159
Is he as down-to-earth as I am

412
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,800
with all that stuff?

413
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,959
Come on.

414
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:00,399
Try it.

415
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,279
Try it.

416
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,279
What's with the big vinegar smell?

417
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,519
Did you add vinegar?

418
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,239
There is no way I would add vinegar
into Tang Yuan in Sweet Rice Wine.

419
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,840
Taste it for yourself. Is it sour?

420
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,840
You fool me.

421
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:20,639
Dig in now.

422
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:23,359
Thank you.

423
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,879
If you have a throat problem,

424
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,999
go and get some medicine.

425
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,480
(Don't worry, leave it to me.)

426
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,200
(By the way, see you on Saturday night.)

427
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,016
(Upholding the law)

428
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,680
Why are you crying?

429
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:59,279
Don't cry.

430
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,800
You shouldn't have come here.

431
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:09,119
Zhao Jikai, how can you be so sure

432
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,119
that I will leave you alone?

433
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,800
You should live your own life.

434
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,359
Forget about me.

435
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,639
Forget about you?

436
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,239
Can you forget about me?

437
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:31,999
Right.

438
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,840
You've already forgotten about me

439
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,840
by making this choice, haven't you?

440
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:41,800
What did I have to ask?

441
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,800
I resigned from Huiquan

442
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,080
and got back to my old job.

443
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
You are my first client

444
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
since my reinstatement.

445
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:02,840
I received the legal fees you paid me.

446
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,600
I've checked.

447
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,800
you've given me so much money,

448
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,999
this means it's very important to you.

449
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:19,800
I'll do my best to fight the case for you.

450
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:26,080
Stop persisting.

451
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,879
Don't waste any more time on me.

452
00:19:29,999 --> 00:19:33,080
You should do whatever you want
with that money.

453
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,879
Haven't you always liked islands?

454
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,680
Mauritius, Fiji,

455
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,866
you can go anywhere you want.

456
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:45,639
What does this card's pin number

457
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,239
5-2-1-1-8-4 mean?

458
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:58,800
You're overthinking it.

459
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,720
I love you forever.

460
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,480
I wished so many times

461
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,999
that you would seriously

462
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,320
look me in the eye and tell me

463
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,159
that you loved me,

464
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,600
but you never did that.

465
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,119
But it's okay.

466
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,519
I understand you.

467
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:28,840
I know you are not used to being direct,

468
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:32,239
and so is this.

469
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,999
This is more profound than those.

470
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,600
Besides, it is enough for me

471
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,119
to know that I love you.

472
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
I have a big heart

473
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,279
that can fit everything.

474
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,320
Let's talk about your case.

475
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,080
I will devise the best possible
defence plan for you.

476
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,800
You want to know about my case so badly?

477
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,080
Alright.

478
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,320
I am suspected of violating, trading

479
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,879
and providing personal information

480
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:24,720
of people to a fraudulent group.

481
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,960
I am also suspected of being involved in
illegal online loans.

482
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:32,440
This is what I left as a way out

483
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:34,840
for me and Qian Tianxin.

484
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,279
I have never told anyone about this.

485
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:43,399
The case occurred because

486
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,320
I planted a filtering program

487
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,840
in the update package of

488
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,879
the new games of Huiquan

489
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,440
in order to make it easier for me

490
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,119
to pinpoint the customers I needed.

491
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,519
From Shi Xiaohu to Zhang Xiaobei,

492
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,920
I did it all by myself.

493
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,320
Do you hear me clearly?

494
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,639
There is no place for you
in the way out I have left.

495
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,879
Zhao Jikai, you're heartless.

496
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:14,519
Now you've finally realised
you love the wrong person.

497
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,080
It's not too late for you
to leave me now.

498
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,159
Stop getting in the way of my business.

499
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,600
Can you tell me why you chose to

500
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,840
turn yourself in?

501
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,320
What did you do that day?

502
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,999
Xiao Mu'en, what are you doing?

503
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:48,879
Even though you're A,

504
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,600
you can't kill people at will.

505
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,279
I haven't done anything wrong to you.

506
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,359
Do you still think
you are dying unjustly?

507
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,800
Back then,
if my auntie hadn't trusted you

508
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,399
and said you'd be good for the job,

509
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,800
I wouldn't have agreed
to let you join us.

510
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:06,560
Your auntie?

511
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,680
Are you talking about Qian Tianxin?

512
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,600
Yes.

513
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,879
The one you call Xin is my auntie.

514
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,999
Do you think you're the only one
who cares about her?

515
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:25,840
According to my plan,

516
00:23:25,879 --> 00:23:27,480
everyone would have
gotten through it safely.

517
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,239
But you are not fit to
achieve great things.

518
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,960
By committing a crime

519
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,680
with your own hands for a small gain,

520
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,279
you have not only
cut off one of my lines

521
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,119
but you have also brought
trouble to my auntie.

522
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,680
I didn't.

523
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,359
No.

524
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:40,320
I didn't.

525
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,639
You won't admit it?

526
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,359
It's you.

527
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,759
It was you who sent your beloved Xin
to death row with your own hands.

528
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,440
No.

529
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,080
Xiao Mu'en. I didn't.

530
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,080
Xiao Mu'en.

531
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,200
Xiao Mu'en.

532
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,600
Please let me go.

533
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,720
For the sake of Xin, please let me go.

534
00:23:59,399 --> 00:24:00,440
I'll do anything you say.

535
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,600
Really. I'll do anything you say.

536
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,680
Please let me go.

537
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,320
Let me go.

538
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:16,320
Zhao Jikai, now,

539
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,480
I'll give you two options.

540
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:19,960
Okay.

541
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,600
First, die.

542
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,960
Second, turn yourself in.

543
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,080
For what you've done,

544
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:34,320
the maximum jail term
is three to five years.

545
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,840
When you get out in a few years,

546
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,279
I'll prepare enough money for you

547
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,039
to spend the rest of your life

548
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:43,840
travelling the world with Li Yitang.

549
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:52,039
Zhao Jikai, do you think you can hide

550
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
your little tricks

551
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,039
from the investigation of
public security and prosecution?

552
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,879
My auntie is willing to die for me.

553
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,119
It was a choice she had made
many years ago.

554
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,039
But as long as I am alive,

555
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,320
she will not be condemned to death.

556
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,119
Because the prosecution
knows she is not A.

557
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:14,279
She treats you really well.

558
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,279
Do you think you would
have had the chance

559
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,720
to see my face today

560
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,920
if she hadn't begged me in front of me

561
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,440
to spare your life?

562
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,440
Of course you can also turn me in.

563
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,480
But if I die, Li Yitang

564
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,999
will have to die with me.

565
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,399
I'll see who you choose

566
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,279
between these two women.

567
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:43,920
Remember,

568
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:49,119
don't bring any more trouble
to the company, to Yin Huiquan.

569
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:50,399
Yin Huiquan?

570
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,399
Why?

571
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,720
What do you want?

572
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,600
You are not qualified to know.

573
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,600
If you want everyone to live,
do as I say.

574
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,200
I can't say that.

575
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:12,800
I guessed it.

576
00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:16,480
I guessed that you...

577
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,639
You always have nothing to tell me.

578
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,239
Since there is no place for me

579
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:34,080
in the way out you have left,

580
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,600
I can't make a fool of myself anymore.

581
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:42,279
Anyway, I still want to give myself

582
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,519
an explanation and put an end
on our relationship.

583
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,519
I've figured it out.

584
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,960
After the last two things are done,

585
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,920
we'll owe each other nothing.

586
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:01,720
Okay.

587
00:27:02,239 --> 00:27:04,039
I'll forget you completely.

588
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,320
I'll forget all about you.

589
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:21,320
First, I will still

590
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:25,840
spend every penny you give me on you.

591
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,039
Second, I need to find out

592
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,519
who the boss is that
you and Qian Tianxin

593
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:37,519
are so devoted to defending.

594
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,119
He's called A, right?

595
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,399
Don't do anything stupid.

596
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,239
There are things you shouldn't know.

597
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:45,600
Zhao Jikai.

598
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:46,800
What's wrong?

599
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:50,720
Nothing.

600
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,639
This is the last time I call your name.

601
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,399
Goodbye.

602
00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:02,999
Listen to me.

603
00:28:02,999 --> 00:28:04,320
Don't do anything stupid.

604
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:32,277
(An Ni)

605
00:28:32,316 --> 00:28:33,116
(Profile settings)

606
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:42,425
(Add to blacklist)

607
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,080
Bye.

608
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,080
Li Yitang, stop there.

609
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,279
What's wrong?

610
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,800
Li Yitang, you've got no shame.

611
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,920
No wonder so many people out there
gossip about you,

612
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,440
saying that you're a money digger.

613
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,920
They're absolutely right.

614
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,840
Didn't you say you wanted to date me?

615
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,680
How come you're dating someone else?

616
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:07,080
Alright.

617
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:08,846
You don't want to date me, do you?

618
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,239
Then don't ask me to take you

619
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,440
to dinner at the Crown Restaurant.

620
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,800
That's a month's worth
of my living expenses, you know?

621
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,639
Come on. Give me the money today.

622
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:16,440
Come on, give it to me.

623
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:19,840
Hey you, when did I ever say I wanted

624
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:21,119
to be your girlfriend?

625
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,440
Will you stop
getting ahead of yourself here?

626
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,639
Alright.

627
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,279
Everyone, look here.

628
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,519
Li Yitang cheated me of food and drink
and my feelings.

629
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,359
Can you stop shouting here?

630
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:32,480
Why can't I?

631
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:36,239
Hey you,
you are also a law student, right?

632
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:37,920
Why do you have no
legal knowledge at all?

633
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,720
The school is a public place.

634
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:41,480
It is an offence to publicly insult

635
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:43,680
or defame someone in a public place.

636
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,359
Alright. I'll let you go today.

637
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,639
Just you wait.

638
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:02,960
Hey.

639
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Thank you for coming
to my rescue just now.

640
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,239
I don't even know your name

641
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,840
after all the time
we've been in class together.

642
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,639
Don't mention it.

643
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,759
I just don't like to see people
slandering others at will.

644
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,639
What if I told you he wasn't slandering?

645
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,960
I did have a meal with him.

646
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,560
But there are so many guys
who ask me out.

647
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,359
Who says I have to be their girlfriend

648
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:24,600
if I have a meal with them?

649
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,560
He's too full of himself
for that kind of thinking.

650
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,359
What do you think?

651
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:33,759
You don't like to hear that, do you?

652
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,399
I'll stop if you don't like it.

653
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:44,720
Do you really believe

654
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,800
what that guy just said?

655
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,800
My God, you're too simple.

656
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:54,440
Maybe you don't know me well enough.

657
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,159
I know you well.

658
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,440
You're Li Yitang.

659
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,999
You transferred from the Department of
Business and Management

660
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,039
to the Faculty of Law

661
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,080
at 3:30 PM on 22 April this semester,

662
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,399
starting with Civil Law.

663
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,200
You change your outfit every day.

664
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,759
I haven't seen you
repeat those clothes either.

665
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,279
You always choose
the most expensive food

666
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,560
in the canteen, you never worry about

667
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,999
the price or the amount
of food you can eat.

668
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,119
You seem to waste a lot of food

669
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:18,639
and you never feel bad about it.

670
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,759
You are happy to pay for them.

671
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,080
This is psychologically a sign

672
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,639
that you are lacking
in a sense of security and love.

673
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,359
Your family should have raised you well.

674
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,759
Your parents give you
a lot of material support,

675
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,039
but never enough for your inner needs.

676
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,999
I'm sure you're not the kind of person
they say you are.

677
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,999
It's just that you don't know
what you want yet.

678
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:41,999
Oh right,

679
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,720
(Introduction to Psychology)
I'll lend you this book.

680
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,800
I hope it inspires you when you read it.

681
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,159
Thank you.

682
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:56,399
No one has ever told me so much,

683
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,039
no one has ever believed me,

684
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,920
and no one has ever really cared about
what I really think.

685
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:05,840
I'm Li Yitang.

686
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:09,239
Let's be friends if you want to.

687
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,759
I'm An Ni.

688
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,999
(An Ni, I have chosen)

689
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,879
(to take one last big risk for him.)

690
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,159
(Let the game of saving Zhao Jikai begin.)

691
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:29,920
(Only if we turn against each other)

692
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,720
(will it be safe for both of us.)

693
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,080
Coming.

694
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:54,960
Welcome.

695
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,279
Here's a little something for you.

696
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,399
You bought me fruits.

697
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,519
That's very nice of you.

698
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,920
Come in.

699
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,039
I don't have to change my shoes?

700
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:01,879
No need. Just come in.

701
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:03,279
Come on.

702
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:03,960
Okay.

703
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,639
You have cooked so much.

704
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,320
It's a waste if we can't finish them.

705
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,119
It's rare that you come to my house

706
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,039
and I don't know what you like to eat

707
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
so I have to prepare more.

708
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,279
Let me help you.

709
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,239
It's okay.

710
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,359
Go and sit down.

711
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,359
There are fruits on the coffee table,
just help yourself.

712
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,560
They're washed.

713
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,639
Then I'll just be waiting for the meal?

714
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,320
Go ahead. There are fruits there,
and they have been washed.

715
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:26,840
Okay.

716
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,999
Your house is so big.

717
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:36,560
Hey.

718
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,759
Hey.

719
00:33:38,239 --> 00:33:40,639
Is this the orphanage
in the north of the city?

720
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:42,720
That's right.

721
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:45,519
It has now been converted to
a public welfare primary school.

722
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:48,080
When did it happen?

723
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:51,999
Listen, I am now the honorary headmaster

724
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:52,999
of this public welfare primary school.

725
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,440
You're something, Xiao Mu'en.

726
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,320
You do good deeds in secret.

727
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,239
After Shi Xiaohu's incident,

728
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:02,119
my company set up a special fund

729
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:05,119
for minors, which I am responsible for.

730
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,040
I heard you talk about
de facto orphans last time.

731
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,480
I took this opportunity to propose

732
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,720
to the Board of Directors

733
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,000
to set up a special primary school
in Jiangcheng

734
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,159
for the benefit of the whole community

735
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,399
by accepting de facto
and statutory orphans.

736
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,119
In fact, be it Huiquan's deeds

737
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,799
or the charity you have initiated,

738
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,559
I think they are all very good.

739
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,720
It's a good deed, right?

740
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
I'll have one more place to go
in the future.

741
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,799
When life gets too stressful

742
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,839
or when things get tough,

743
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I plan to hide out at school
with the kids.

744
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,799
Actually, it's really sad to think about

745
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,960
these orphans.

746
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,200
Their hearts must be aching

747
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,839
and they need the care and
attention of the community.

748
00:34:57,319 --> 00:35:00,839
I think one has to
have a happy childhood.

749
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,040
They should be allowed to grow up
in an innocent environment

750
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:09,319
like a fairy tale and
not lose their innocence

751
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,920
to the harsh realities of the world.

752
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:12,599
You are quite literary.

753
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:18,912
(Wang Xiaojiao: I can't make it today,
so you two enjoy your meal.)

754
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,119
This woman...

755
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:26,520
(Hello, the number
you have dialled is switched off.)

756
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,200
Did Xiaojiao send you any messages?

757
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,319
My phone is charging in
my room. What's wrong?

758
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:35,839
She has switched off her phone.
She said she couldn't come.

759
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,319
She's always like this.

760
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,799
I owe this best friend of yours
another favour.

761
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:44,639
Don't encourage her like that.

762
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,399
If you encourage her, she'll do it again.

763
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,399
What to do then?

764
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Shall we eat first?

765
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:51,520
Sure. Let's eat.

766
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,000
They're definitely not coming anyway.

767
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,000
If you are going to cook more
dishes in the kitchen, please stop now,

768
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,720
or there will be too much to eat.

769
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,760
Okay. I'll serve the soup.

770
00:35:59,119 --> 00:35:59,960
There's soup?

771
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,839
I'm too full.

772
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:10,240
I really can't eat any more.

773
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,879
I have eaten a bit too much.

774
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,119
Wait here.

775
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,720
I have prepared a dessert.

776
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,040
What's with the dessert?

777
00:36:28,399 --> 00:36:29,599
Mr. Xiao, I really don't need dessert.

778
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,399
Is your phone ringing?

779
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,240
I'm going to take a call.

780
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,399
I'll just take a bite.

781
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,879
This science guy reads a lot of books.

782
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,520
(When I Was Little)
And a children's book.

783
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,639
(We are no longer
and can no longer be a kid.)

784
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,639
(We can no longer run in a world)

785
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,440
(where we are still young.)

786
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,960
(But we can still
create our own paradise.)

787
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,599
Peter Pan.

788
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,599
(Peter Pan)

789
00:37:42,879 --> 00:37:44,319
(Peter Pan)
(I thought my mum)

790
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:46,119
(would be waiting for me
with the window open)

791
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:48,319
(so I played outside for two months)

792
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,040
(and another two months
and then I flew home)

793
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,480
(but the window was chained.)

794
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,040
(Mum had forgotten about me.)

795
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,639
(A little one was sleeping in my bed.)

796
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:18,879
What are you reading?

797
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:22,615
(Peter Pan)

798
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,879
I saw there was a children's book.

799
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,000
Mr. Xiao, what are you doing?

800
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,879
An Ni, I'm sorry.

801
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,680
I... I'm...

802
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:30,480
- An Ni.
- I'm going home now, Mr. Xiao.

803
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,760
I have work tomorrow.

804
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,720
The party group has decided

805
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,399
to appoint Comrade Wang Heyu

806
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,520
as the Director of our Public
Interest Litigation Department.

807
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,960
You will be in charge of

808
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,119
the public interest litigation in future.

809
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,680
Besides, Zhao Jia, you will also be
transferred to this department.

810
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,280
Sit down.

811
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,280
Prosecutor Guo,

812
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,000
I...

813
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,079
It's you.

814
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,639
We has been examining you
for a long time.

815
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,920
First of all, you are a veteran comrade,

816
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,040
professional and
politically well qualified,

817
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:50,040
and you have been working hard
for so many years.

818
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:51,680
There is no one more qualified than you.

819
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,559
Keep up the good work.

820
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:53,680
Yes.

821
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:55,599
Anyway, Prosecutor Guo,

822
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,399
I'm just getting to grips

823
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,480
with this new cybercrime,

824
00:39:59,799 --> 00:40:01,200
but now I...

825
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,599
It is because of your experience
in this field

826
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,720
that we have taken the plunge
and chosen you.

827
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,559
Violations of consumer rights

828
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:14,079
have now clearly shifted
from offline to online.

829
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,520
So all the more reason why
experience in this aspect is needed.

830
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,680
I have also recently
been concerned about

831
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,799
the guidance issued by

832
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,639
the Supreme People's Procuratorate
on actively

833
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,720
and steadily expanding the scope
of public interest litigation cases.

834
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,280
That includes the protection
of personal information

835
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:29,720
as the focus of cases of
online infringement.

836
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:31,879
This has given me great insight.

837
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:37,879
I think this is one of
our future priorities.

838
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:43,359
Well, the Public Interest
Litigation Department will focus on

839
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,159
both civil and administrative violations

840
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,000
and the people's safety.

841
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:48,839
Yes.

842
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,040
The society nowadays is changing rapidly

843
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,879
and there are different forms of crime
than the traditional ones.

844
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,079
Nowadays, online infringement

845
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,359
has become very prominent.

846
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,240
It's important to
tackle online infringement at its root.

847
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,200
For example, data security

848
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,599
and the protection of
personal information

849
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,760
must be done in the best possible way.

850
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,280
Otherwise,
there would be a serious impact

851
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,200
on public safety.

852
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,680
Yes, Prosecutor Guo.

853
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,839
Look, it is true that
the rapid development of the Internet

854
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,720
has brought some business opportunities

855
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,559
and convenience to the people,

856
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:26,839
but at the same time,
it has also given rise

857
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:31,639
to the lack of supervision
of personal data.

858
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,359
Look, through the Zhao Jikai case

859
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,040
brought out by our investigation
into Huiquan, I have an idea.

860
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:44,799
Let's start by looking into other
games and applications in the city

861
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:49,079
to see if there are any crimes
involving the illegal collection

862
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,200
of personal data,
especially those involving

863
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,520
criminal and profit chains.

864
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,799
If detected,

865
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,440
we will cut off the chain
with legal sanctions.

866
00:41:59,399 --> 00:41:59,879
Well said.

867
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,399
In particular, we need to give full play

868
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,200
to the advantages

869
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,159
of our integrated Public Interest
Litigation Department in handling cases.

870
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,079
Heyu, you will be responsible for this.

871
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,399
Put more effort into people's rights.

872
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,559
Find out a few key cases and
make sure everyone recognises

873
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,879
the Public Interest Litigation
Prosecution Department.

874
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,399
We'll do our best, sir.

875
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,200
We'll do our best, sir.

876
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,000
I'll leave it to you then.

877
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,599
Ni.

878
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,440
Ni.

879
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,119
Yes?

880
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:39,559
Why are you goofing off
early in the morning?

881
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,520
Did you not sleep well last night?

882
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,079
Yes, I didn't.

883
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:42,960
What did you just say?
