15
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:41,992
Do you still remember
the day I asked you

16
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,872
why your wife went to Mount Yunding?

17
00:01:45,391 --> 00:01:46,711
Yes, I do remember.

18
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:48,111
What's wrong?

19
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:51,791
We checked her phone.

20
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,111
We did it as a matter of routine.

21
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,872
Do you know Zhang Jianhua?

22
00:01:58,511 --> 00:01:59,191
Who?

23
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:00,791
Zhang Jianhua.

24
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:04,151
I don't know him.

25
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:12,911
It was he who asked your wife
to go to Mount Yunding.

26
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,472
I'll just be frank with you.

27
00:02:21,872 --> 00:02:23,232
You should know their relationship

28
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:25,711
better than I do.

29
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,071
He Luyuan.

30
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:32,911
I understand

31
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,832
the police have a way of investigating,

32
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:36,392
but you can't simply make claims

33
00:02:36,392 --> 00:02:38,631
just because someone died.

34
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,192
It's inappropriate, isn't it?

35
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:44,112
My wife and I had been
very close to each other.

36
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:45,872
If I cheated on her,

37
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,192
some might believe it,

38
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:49,431
but no one would believe

39
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:51,312
that she cheated on me.

40
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:55,071
I could understand
why you reacted like this.

41
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:58,312
However, we do have evidence

42
00:02:58,672 --> 00:03:00,032
before we say something like that.

43
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,911
Calm down first.

44
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,431
Try to recall whether she did

45
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,232
anything unusual recently.

46
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:11,312
Yes.

47
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:16,631
She used to be quite conservative

48
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:18,032
during intercourse.

49
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:20,832
She changed

50
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:23,232
these two years.

51
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:26,271
She became...

52
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,032
Don't worry.

53
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,592
You're helping us in the investigation.

54
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:35,431
In these two years,

55
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,392
she would buy

56
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:39,952
some sexy clothes regularly.

57
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:40,991
Those are

58
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:42,431
lingerie

59
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,431
and sleepwear.

60
00:03:46,832 --> 00:03:48,631
I thought she wanted
to try something new

61
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,392
after getting married for so long,

62
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:52,431
but now it seems...

63
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:16,072
Master,

64
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,352
Zhu Xin is...

65
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:42,352
Master,

66
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:44,192
why are you eating sunflower seeds?

67
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:56,792
What's wrong?

68
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,072
I was going through
everything again in my mind,

69
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:00,752
hoping to confirm

70
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:02,231
the questionable points about Zhu Xin.

71
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:04,271
They are confirmed.

72
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:06,671
Shall we ask him
to go to the police station

73
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,671
to assist in the investigation?

74
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:10,472
I've used the money
in the Provident Fund.

75
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,231
I've burnt my boats.

76
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,872
If you reveal anything

77
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:14,391
about tonight's tape reading...

78
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:14,711
Come.

79
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:15,231
Please come in.

80
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,072
Okay.

81
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:18,991
Do I change my shoes?

82
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:19,831
No need.

83
00:05:19,872 --> 00:05:20,512
You don't have to.

84
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:22,072
Please have a seat.

85
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:22,671
Yonggang.

86
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:24,072
Xiaojiao.

87
00:05:26,831 --> 00:05:27,671
Mr. Xiao is here.

88
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:29,752
Mr. Xiao, please have a seat first.

89
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:30,912
Xiaojiao, serve them first.

90
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:32,592
The food is almost ready.

91
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:34,391
Would you like to have
water or other drinks?

92
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:35,192
Just water is fine.

93
00:05:35,352 --> 00:05:36,192
I'll help myself, Xiaojiao.

94
00:05:36,512 --> 00:05:37,512
You go and help Yonggang.

95
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:38,472
Okay.

96
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:40,032
Have a seat.

97
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:40,711
All right.

98
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:41,151
How's everything?

99
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:42,032
All okay.

100
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:42,792
Is it enough?

101
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:43,752
Yes.

102
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:44,271
I made

103
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:45,951
spicy stir-fried chicken
and Coca-cola chicken wings.

104
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,632
Is it okay if I don't get
water for you both?

105
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,072
Sure, don't mind us.

106
00:05:50,072 --> 00:05:51,111
Is there any wine?

107
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,671
Yes.

108
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:52,831
Quick, go get some.

109
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:54,991
Mr. Xiao.

110
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,032
Um...

111
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,391
Have a seat there.

112
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,551
The food is almost ready.

113
00:05:58,632 --> 00:05:59,271
Okay.

114
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:03,671
This bottle of wine
is specially prepared for you.

115
00:06:04,032 --> 00:06:04,912
I'm not an expert.

116
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,431
Is this good?

117
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:07,831
This looks like

118
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:09,991
the one I gave you last time.

119
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:10,912
It is that one.

120
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,431
I can't bear to drink it all this while.

121
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:13,991
Since you're here today, let's drink it.

122
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:14,512
Sure.

123
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:15,192
I shall open it now.

124
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:15,632
Okay.

125
00:06:18,632 --> 00:06:20,111
Hey, what's wrong with you?

126
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:21,472
How could you take
the wine Mr. Xiao gave you?

127
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:22,831
What's the matter with you?

128
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:24,632
That wine is of good quality.

129
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:29,151
Serve this first.

130
00:06:29,192 --> 00:06:30,032
Cook the other two dishes.

131
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:30,512
Okay.

132
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:33,991
This is spicy stir-fried chicken.

133
00:06:34,912 --> 00:06:36,391
The other two dishes will be ready soon.

134
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,551
It's enviable, isn't it?

135
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,271
Mr. Xiao, I didn't expect

136
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,391
that you actually like such life.

137
00:06:47,632 --> 00:06:49,231
I thought you would yearn for a life

138
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,231
with the seven daily necessities

139
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:51,312
of a scholar.

140
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,512
It turns out that what I like is the
seven daily necessities of a commoner.

141
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:56,151
I know.

142
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,592
Rich people are like that.

143
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:59,072
When they have been rich
for a long time,

144
00:06:59,072 --> 00:07:00,551
they tend to yearn for

145
00:07:00,632 --> 00:07:02,231
a usual life like a normal person.

146
00:07:02,592 --> 00:07:04,032
You might have misunderstood.

147
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:05,991
Let me put it this way.

148
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:11,632
They seem to be chatting happily.

149
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:15,192
I told you they are
a good match for each other.

150
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,671
Mr. Xiao is excellent.

151
00:07:18,592 --> 00:07:19,951
An Ni is excellent too.

152
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,951
- Cook, hurry up.
- Okay.

153
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:24,271
I have no choice.

154
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:25,711
I can't be painting a rosy picture
to my team all the time.

155
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:27,512
I must help them live a decent life.

156
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,472
Here it is.

157
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:29,912
The food is here.

158
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:30,671
Everything is ready.

159
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:32,872
There are so many dishes.

160
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,632
You still don't drink, right?

161
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:35,472
Get some orange juice.

162
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:36,671
Okay.

163
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:38,632
Woah, there is so much food.

164
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,391
It's all thanks to Mr. Xiao,

165
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,792
otherwise,
we don't have so much usually.

166
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,111
These are all his signature dishes.

167
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:45,951
Here.

168
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:46,431
Give it to me.

169
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:48,671
Thanks.

170
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:51,312
Xiaojiao, serve An Ni first.

171
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:52,671
That's for sure.

172
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,831
Okay, that will do.

173
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:01,352
I would like to raise
a toast to Mr. Xiao.

174
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,872
Mr. Xiao has always been

175
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:06,192
treating me so well at work.

176
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:07,312
He cares for me a lot.

177
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:10,111
Today, I only made
a few home-cooked dishes.

178
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:11,032
I hope you don't mind.

179
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,671
You're very welcome, Yonggang.

180
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:13,991
I'm here for a free meal.

181
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:15,151
Just do whatever you see fit.

182
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,312
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

183
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:17,391
Thank you.

184
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:23,991
Just now Mr. Xiao was saying

185
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,632
that he envies a life like yours.

186
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,831
What is there to be envious about?

187
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:29,231
There isn't anything good.

188
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:30,391
If it weren't for An Ni,

189
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,031
we wouldn't have become better.

190
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:33,512
What's wrong, Yonggang?

191
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:36,911
Xiaojiao, why did you
tell Mr. Xiao about this?

192
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:40,512
I used to be involved
in online soccer gambling

193
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:42,712
and I lost some money.

194
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,351
Xiaojiao found out about it.

195
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,752
Um... An Ni also lectured me already.

196
00:08:48,312 --> 00:08:48,872
Yonggang.

197
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,791
I didn't mean to
scold you in front of Xiaojiao,

198
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:51,872
but gambling is not good.

199
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:53,551
Of course, I know

200
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,272
that he wanted to get quick cash,

201
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,351
but it should not be
using ways like gambling.

202
00:08:57,591 --> 00:08:58,111
Gambling

203
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,991
makes people addicted

204
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:02,031
and they would lose
until they have nothing left.

205
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:03,632
- Yes.
- Did you hear that?

206
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:04,832
Mr. Xiao is right.

207
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,231
Yes, Mr. Xiao, you're right,

208
00:09:06,471 --> 00:09:08,072
but I've stopped gambling.

209
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:09,072
I swear...

210
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:10,072
You don't have to.

211
00:09:10,072 --> 00:09:10,712
I swear

212
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:12,072
that I won't gamble anymore.

213
00:09:12,471 --> 00:09:14,111
You don't have to swear.

214
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,591
Anyway, in such cases,

215
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:16,872
stopping loss is very important.

216
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:18,111
Moreover, a few soccer gamblers

217
00:09:18,111 --> 00:09:19,911
were arrested because of your help.

218
00:09:20,312 --> 00:09:21,031
Help?

219
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,431
Don't speak for him.

220
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:24,072
Hey, let's stop this topic.

221
00:09:24,072 --> 00:09:24,952
Mr. Xiao, try this.

222
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:25,952
This is his signature dish.

223
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:26,872
It's delicious.

224
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:27,471
Yes.

225
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:28,712
Mr. Xiao, try this.

226
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:29,551
Okay.

227
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:31,072
Thanks.

228
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:32,832
I don't care, get your own food.

229
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
(Banker)

230
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,231
Yonggang, who's that?

231
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,872
Nothing.

232
00:09:42,272 --> 00:09:43,272
Let's eat.

233
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,872
Who keeps texting you?

234
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:45,671
No.

235
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:46,671
It's a work-related group.

236
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:48,791
Mute it then!

237
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:49,272
All right.

238
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:49,872
What's the matter?

239
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:50,752
Nothing.

240
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,152
Oh ya.

241
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:56,152
Do you remember that I said
I bought some tea leaves for you?

242
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,231
Let me go get them for you.

243
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,911
Please take some with you
when you leave.

244
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:00,671
There's no hurry.

245
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:02,272
Why do you want to take them now? Later...

246
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:06,312
Mr. Xiao, don't mind him.
He's always like that.

247
00:10:14,272 --> 00:10:15,031
(Are you in?)

248
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,072
(The soccer match
is starting in three minutes.)

249
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:17,671
(You told me to allocate 50,000 yuan
for you in the beginning.)

250
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:18,551
(What's wrong with you?)

251
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,111
All right.

252
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,471
I'll wager 30,000 yuan
on the white team.

253
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:25,111
Mr. Xiao,

254
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:26,351
I hope you don't mind.

255
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:27,471
This is him.

256
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:28,791
He doesn't know the ways of the world.

257
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,952
He looks so silly all the time.

258
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,072
I'd like to propose
a toast to you again.

259
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,111
Please tolerate him.

260
00:10:32,111 --> 00:10:32,671
Okay.

261
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:35,231
If I win this round,

262
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:36,671
you don't have to
transfer the money to me.

263
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:38,512
Then I'll owe you 75,000 yuan only.

264
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:44,192
Yonggang.

265
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:47,872
Chen Yonggang!

266
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,431
What are you doing?

267
00:10:51,072 --> 00:10:52,551
Why are you gambling again?

268
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:54,351
Where did you get the money?

269
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:56,312
I'm asking you!

270
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:57,231
- Tell me!
- Xiaojiao!

271
00:10:57,272 --> 00:10:58,591
- Xiaojiao, calm down.
- Xiaojiao!

272
00:10:58,632 --> 00:10:59,272
An Ni!

273
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:00,911
-What happened?
-Take him to the police station.

274
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,111
Lock him up!

275
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:03,231
I want to divorce him!

276
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:04,832
I don't want to be
with a person like him.

277
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,712
Why did he do this?

278
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:07,312
Xiaojiao.

279
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:08,712
Yonggang.

280
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:10,872
Is this the present you want to give me?

281
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,872
Just now Wang Xiaojiao was so mad,

282
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,272
I didn't dare to go near her,

283
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:32,991
but you, wow,

284
00:11:33,031 --> 00:11:34,152
you held her in your arms.

285
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:34,911
You're so cool!

286
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:36,671
Cool?

287
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,192
Is this adjective

288
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:39,632
for females?

289
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:40,991
No.

290
00:11:41,152 --> 00:11:42,152
I mean...

291
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:43,712
I'm sorry, I'm not good

292
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,072
at giving compliments.

293
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,072
But you did good deeds.

294
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,632
Don't tease me.

295
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:51,671
I only raised Chen's salary a little.

296
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:53,671
It's not a good solution
to this situation.

297
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:55,272
If we want him

298
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:57,272
to get rid of this bad habit entirely,

299
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:59,431
we have to work hard together.

300
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,752
I'm also referring to other matters.

301
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:05,591
I find the opinion

302
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:06,471
that you expressed

303
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:08,072
pretty good.

304
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:09,471
You don't sound like a science geek.

305
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:10,671
Really?

306
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,272
There's a similarity
among science geeks.

307
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,272
When they are away from the computers,

308
00:12:14,312 --> 00:12:15,832
they look like walking robots.

309
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,551
You're over-generalizing.

310
00:12:18,431 --> 00:12:19,192
I think

311
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:20,152
there's something special about you

312
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,272
that is different from others.

313
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,832
The things you do have the common touch

314
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:24,872
and are practical,

315
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,752
but in your eyes, I could see

316
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,152
that you

317
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,872
set your sights high
on romantic and impractical things.

318
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:34,031
I don't know

319
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:36,272
how to respond to what you said.

320
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:38,272
It's a failure for me.

321
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:40,072
Usually, when I say this
to the suspects,

322
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:41,031
they couldn't respond.

323
00:12:45,752 --> 00:12:47,872
Do you think

324
00:12:48,872 --> 00:12:50,431
my occupation is okay?

325
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:52,952
What I'm trying to say is...

326
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,031
I mean...

327
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:55,872
Look.

328
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,231
You're in charge of cybercrimes

329
00:12:57,312 --> 00:12:57,952
while I'm

330
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:58,991
the founder

331
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,512
of a newly established online company.

332
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:02,072
Of course,

333
00:13:02,152 --> 00:13:03,351
I always abide by the law.

334
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:05,072
Do you feel

335
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,111
that something

336
00:13:06,512 --> 00:13:07,671
is strange between us?

337
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:09,791
Don't you find this kind of thinking

338
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:10,872
very outdated?

339
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,312
We want to crack down on cybercrimes,

340
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:14,632
but most importantly,

341
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:16,351
we are trying to 'purify' the internet.

342
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:18,471
Furthermore, in recent years,

343
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:19,632
I've seen countless crimes caused

344
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,551
by the advanced development
of the internet.

345
00:13:22,231 --> 00:13:22,872
Nevertheless,

346
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:24,272
it's undeniable

347
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:26,471
that the internet
also brought convenience

348
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,712
and faster pace of life for people.

349
00:13:30,872 --> 00:13:31,591
I'm sorry.

350
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,431
I don't agree with what you said

351
00:13:33,671 --> 00:13:34,632
just now.

352
00:13:34,911 --> 00:13:36,231
The crimes you mentioned

353
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,272
are not a result of
the development of the internet.

354
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:39,431
I'd like to hear the details.

355
00:13:39,872 --> 00:13:41,431
Ever since the birth of mankind,

356
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:43,392
sins have existed.

357
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,272
The very first murder case

358
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:47,752
happened on the Heidelberg Man

359
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,752
as early as

360
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,192
430,000 years ago.

361
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:51,712
It was earlier than human civilization.

362
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:53,152
From here, we could see

363
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:55,911
that committing sins is innate in humans

364
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,431
and is unrelated to civilization,

365
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:58,632
let alone to the internet.

366
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:00,791
The internet

367
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:02,591
is a tool

368
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,512
that can help mankind to progress

369
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,152
towards a greater world.

370
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,192
It shouldn't shoulder
the blame for hurting people.

371
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:09,231
It's just like

372
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,351
the criminals are those
who should be punished

373
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,231
and not the weapon in their hands.

374
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:17,192
Hence,

375
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:19,351
those who are great are human,

376
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,911
those who are sinful are also human.

377
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,231
To be great or sinful,

378
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,152
only humans can decide it.

379
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:28,152
It all depends on
how you make use of it.

380
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:29,231
If used correctly,

381
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:30,152
nuclear radiation

382
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,031
can benefit mankind.

383
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:33,072
If used incorrectly,

384
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:35,152
even a chopstick can kill people.

385
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:37,152
So, I think

386
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,312
we shouldn't allow innocent tools

387
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,952
to be used for human sins.

388
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:43,111
This is especially true

389
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:45,231
for great inventions like the internet

390
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,072
which has brought
huge profits for mankind.

391
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:52,952
Committing sins is innate in humans.

392
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:57,272
Sorry,

393
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:58,671
I'd probably never

394
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,231
agree with your point of view.

395
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:04,752
What a pity.

396
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,911
I thought you'd understand.

397
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:10,872
It's like

398
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,712
the law that exists

399
00:15:13,351 --> 00:15:14,272
to provide

400
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,111
guidance and restrictions on people.

401
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:19,471
To some extent,

402
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:22,752
it assumes that there'll definitely

403
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:25,272
be people who choose to commit sins,

404
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,952
so it's the bare minimum
required of people.

405
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,952
I also don't quite
agree with this opinion

406
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,551
but I'd say

407
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:36,991
the ways of using tools

408
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:38,272
are entirely

409
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:39,591
decided by humans.

410
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:41,832
However, every tool
comes with its own nature.

411
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:43,152
For example,

412
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:45,111
the fire's nature

413
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,752
is hot and ferocious,

414
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:49,231
so precaution and restrictions

415
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:50,152
must be applied.

416
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,952
The internet is just like a fire.

417
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,111
When people are using it correctly,

418
00:15:54,152 --> 00:15:55,991
they should still be extra careful.

419
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:58,392
I see eye to eye with you.

420
00:15:59,832 --> 00:16:00,591
I agree.

421
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:03,431
To be honest,

422
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,872
although I didn't agree
with what you said,

423
00:16:05,872 --> 00:16:06,752
I could tell

424
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:08,471
that you're really
passionate about your career

425
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,872
from the serious way
you talked just now.

426
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,872
Although you didn't fully agree with me,

427
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,152
hearing these words

428
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,911
could make me

429
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:21,072
feel the happiness
in the air for the whole night.

430
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:25,312
Of course,

431
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:26,952
I can tell

432
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,952
that you're not interested in that.

433
00:16:30,272 --> 00:16:33,031
I think you know what I'm referring to.

434
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:37,031
Your observation skills
are as sharp as your opinion.

435
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:39,512
As for whether I'm interested,

436
00:16:40,031 --> 00:16:42,312
as a human, I do have

437
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,752
emotions and desires too.

438
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,392
It's just that something
is still holding me back

439
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,591
these two years

440
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:48,551
and I couldn't escape.

441
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:51,471
I'm sorry

442
00:16:51,671 --> 00:16:53,272
if I sound too nosy.

443
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,431
Is the matter you said just now

444
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,351
related to a man?

445
00:16:57,512 --> 00:16:59,152
Were you hurt
in the previous relationship?

446
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:02,471
That's too worldly of you.

447
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,792
It's related to a lady.

448
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,512
She was my senior.

449
00:17:08,071 --> 00:17:10,471
Two years ago, she died in front of me.

450
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:12,831
She couldn't rest in peace
even until now.

451
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:14,272
I keep feeling that

452
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:15,711
if I couldn't seek justice for her,

453
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:17,432
I couldn't do anything else.

454
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:19,231
Got it.

455
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:27,912
Chairman.

456
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:28,752
Please don't be angry.

457
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:30,351
I'll give you
a comprehensive explanation

458
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:31,951
on this matter.

459
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:34,351
Comprehensive?

460
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:36,912
Look at the news.

461
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:38,311
What explanation can you give?

462
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:44,591
Dad, I'm going out.

463
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:46,191
Where are you going?

464
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:46,991
For a drink.

465
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:48,831
Don't drive!

466
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:50,231
I'll get a designated driver,
don't worry.

467
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,872
I could never get peace of mind.

468
00:17:59,351 --> 00:17:59,951
Chairman,

469
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:01,552
rest assured

470
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:03,552
that I'll track down
the one who uploaded the video.

471
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:04,872
I'll also handle

472
00:18:04,872 --> 00:18:06,351
Shi Xiaohu's case.

473
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:09,951
I hope so.

474
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:12,432
You do know

475
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,071
that of all the businesses

476
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:16,432
under Huiquan Corporation,

477
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:19,591
I prioritize
Huiquan Technology the most.

478
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,752
Gaming, live streaming
and app development

479
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,912
are all in the hand
of Huiquan Technology.

480
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,591
However,

481
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:32,191
you're the one who received

482
00:18:32,672 --> 00:18:34,392
the most complaints

483
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:36,632
among the general managers
in the six branches.

484
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:39,552
I can't be giving you chances forever.

485
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,191
I understand.

486
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:43,111
Chairman,

487
00:18:43,752 --> 00:18:44,872
please give me some time.

488
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:46,351
I'll settle this matter well.

489
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:49,512
I'm tired.

490
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:50,951
Go back.

491
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:53,311
Good night, Chairman.

492
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:10,632
I'm back.

493
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,032
You worked overtime until so late.

494
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:14,071
You must be hungry.

495
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,912
I'll cook something for you.

496
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,872
It's okay, Mom.
I had my dinner at Xiaojiao's house.

497
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:17,591
Where's Dad?

498
00:19:18,311 --> 00:19:18,831
He's here.

499
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:19,591
I'm here.

500
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:20,951
You're back.

501
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,111
Eat some apples.

502
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:24,951
Ni.

503
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:27,831
Have you read the article I sent you

504
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:28,991
this morning?

505
00:19:30,311 --> 00:19:33,191
You were so busy that you didn't even
reply to my message for the whole day.

506
00:19:33,951 --> 00:19:35,152
Here, drink some water.

507
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:38,032
The article was well-written.

508
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,392
It stated that the most important
point in a woman's life

509
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:42,591
is 30 years old.

510
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,111
It's particularly crucial.

511
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,792
I'm talking to you.

512
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,231
I'm listening to you, Mom.

513
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,711
I am listening, go on.

514
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,191
Furthermore, you are now

515
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,672
at this most important point in life.

516
00:19:56,632 --> 00:19:59,512
You're at your most beautiful age.

517
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:00,711
Do you know that?

518
00:20:00,831 --> 00:20:01,351
Yes.

519
00:20:02,152 --> 00:20:04,512
Mom, look.

520
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,432
Currently, I don't have time
to think about this.

521
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:07,792
If I met

522
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,152
someone I love one day,

523
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:10,752
I would inform you immediately.

524
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:13,152
Hey, stop it.

525
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:14,032
Ni.

526
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,912
Your mother was not referring entirely

527
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,792
to getting into a relationship.

528
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,591
However,

529
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:22,111
this is what I think.

530
00:20:22,432 --> 00:20:23,672
We won't force you, all right?

531
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,711
I don't mean that you must
accomplish certain things

532
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,912
at a certain age.

533
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:29,191
We just want you

534
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,471
to have more time to enjoy life.

535
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,632
Of course, the job of a prosecutor

536
00:20:34,632 --> 00:20:36,711
is sacred, noble and tense,

537
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:38,831
but it doesn't mean

538
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,632
you have to give up
living your own life.

539
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:41,792
Do you agree?

540
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:44,311
I realize

541
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,152
that I won't

542
00:20:45,152 --> 00:20:46,311
be able to work here.

543
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,951
I'll go back to my room
to sort out the materials.

544
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:49,351
Rest early tonight.

545
00:20:49,951 --> 00:20:51,111
I'll take this with me.

546
00:20:51,231 --> 00:20:52,152
Take some apples.

547
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:52,752
No, thanks.

548
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:53,632
I'm too full.

549
00:20:57,032 --> 00:20:58,672
You've been nagging non-stop
since she came back.

550
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,230
(Huiquan)

551
00:21:25,071 --> 00:21:26,152
Why are you looking at me?

552
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:28,752
Are there words on my face?
Do your work.

553
00:21:29,672 --> 00:21:30,471
Mr. Chen.

554
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:32,432
You should take a look at this.

555
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:37,672
(Gaming development department of Huiquan)
Mr. Chen.

556
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,552
(Chen Yonggang didn't pay back money)
They sent messages

557
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:41,792
about your gambling debts
in the work chat group.

558
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,071
Everything is fine.

559
00:22:32,152 --> 00:22:33,951
Carry on according to this.

560
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:39,752
Yonggang.

561
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:41,792
Look at the time now.

562
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:43,552
You're not on duty during working hours.

563
00:22:43,672 --> 00:22:44,392
Where have you been?

564
00:22:44,991 --> 00:22:46,191
Mr. Xiao, I...

565
00:22:49,512 --> 00:22:50,152
Everyone,

566
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,272
please spare two minutes for me.

567
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:53,632
I have something to say.

568
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:57,512
Today, I received a message.

569
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,231
It stated that Chen Yonggang

570
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:02,471
was involved in online gambling

571
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:03,672
and owed a huge debt.

572
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:05,872
They want to come to our office

573
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,432
to collect the money.

574
00:23:09,512 --> 00:23:11,512
I don't know if any of you
received the same text.

575
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:16,351
It seems some of you did.

576
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:19,111
What I want to say is

577
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:22,432
this is a malicious spam message.

578
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:24,872
It's fake. I think this is

579
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,552
planned by our competitors

580
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:27,951
on purpose.

581
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:28,872
Their purpose

582
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,711
is to lower our morale.

583
00:23:31,032 --> 00:23:33,071
Everyone, I hope you won't believe it.

584
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:34,471
Plus, don't have

585
00:23:34,591 --> 00:23:36,471
a prejudice against Yonggang

586
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:37,872
because this is unfair to him.

587
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:39,912
Yonggang,

588
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,071
you must have felt aggrieved.

589
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,152
All right,

590
00:23:46,272 --> 00:23:46,912
that's all from me.

591
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:47,872
Get back to work.

592
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:04,672
I could

593
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,951
go against my principles
to help you overcome this issue.

594
00:24:07,632 --> 00:24:08,632
I'll also

595
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:10,471
think of ways to help you pay the debt,

596
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:13,552
but you'd better
get rid of that gambling habit.

597
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,152
Don't let me down.

598
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:29,432
Captain He.

599
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:31,191
Master.

600
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,152
Did you come in
using the back door as well?

601
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:34,552
The main entrance is blocked.

602
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:37,152
The media nowadays

603
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:38,711
is infinitely resourceful.

604
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,032
They already started playing up

605
00:24:41,152 --> 00:24:41,872
Zhu Xin's case.

606
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:43,351
If we hadn't taken

607
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,311
Zhu Xin back here,

608
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:45,392
the investigation

609
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:46,792
would have been seriously affected.

610
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:48,152
For many years,

611
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,672
there hasn't been any case
like this in Jiangcheng.

612
00:24:49,912 --> 00:24:51,752
It's normal for the media
to react like this.

613
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:54,471
However, as a policeman,

614
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,152
I hope cases like this
won't ever happen.

615
00:24:58,191 --> 00:24:59,552
This is indeed despicable.

616
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,831
If there's no severe sentence
for this case,

617
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:03,872
I dare not get married in the future.

618
00:25:07,111 --> 00:25:08,512
Now you reminded me.

619
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,152
I have to report to Chief Bai

620
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:12,872
and ask him to get us

621
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:15,351
a shoo-in from the Procuratorate.

622
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:20,831
Come in.

623
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:23,311
Prosecutor Guo, do you want to see me?

624
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:24,591
An Ni.

625
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:25,351
Have a seat.

626
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:32,552
I got a call from
the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

627
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:35,672
There is a case about
the murder of a wife.

628
00:25:35,792 --> 00:25:37,672
It is the case where He Luyuan

629
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:40,071
was called away
during our task force meeting.

630
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,591
The media is paying
much attention to it now.

631
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,392
There is a strong response
in public opinion.

632
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,032
After discussion,

633
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,272
we think

634
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:49,591
that financial crimes which involve

635
00:25:49,672 --> 00:25:50,951
health insurance frauds like this

636
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:52,752
should be handled
by the No. 4 Procurator's Office.

637
00:25:53,392 --> 00:25:54,872
Moreover, we need to send a prosecutor

638
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:56,392
who stands a good chance.

639
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,672
What I'm trying to say is
you will be the prosecutor.

640
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:03,152
Although you're handling dozens of cases

641
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:05,032
at the moment,

642
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:06,831
having one more case wouldn't matter.

643
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:10,071
The main reasons are as follows,

644
00:26:11,231 --> 00:26:11,711
first,

645
00:26:12,152 --> 00:26:12,991
you're

646
00:26:13,432 --> 00:26:16,032
experienced in handling cybercrimes.

647
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:17,152
Second,

648
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:19,632
you're more influential in our official

649
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:20,991
media platform.

650
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:23,951
Third, since we are in the top ten,

651
00:26:24,071 --> 00:26:25,351
we do have excellent approaches

652
00:26:25,512 --> 00:26:26,711
to solve this case.

653
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,951
In Jiangcheng, there haven't been
any despicable crimes like this

654
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:31,351
for five years.

655
00:26:32,552 --> 00:26:33,951
As a prosecutor,

656
00:26:34,432 --> 00:26:35,632
I hope that I wouldn't have to

657
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,512
handle cases like this anymore.

658
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,792
Oh ya, after this,

659
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,071
you have to focus on

660
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,552
Operation 7·23.

661
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,272
The superiors pay
a lot of attention to it.

662
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:49,912
We must make

663
00:26:49,912 --> 00:26:51,951
substantive progress
as soon as possible.

664
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:54,432
Since the process is restarted,

665
00:26:54,432 --> 00:26:57,311
we must balance
our effort appropriately.

666
00:26:57,752 --> 00:26:59,272
We mustn't let
the Public Security Bureau

667
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:00,672
think that we have a smart mouth

668
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,392
and do things for show.

669
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,272
Rest assured

670
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:05,711
that I have never given up

671
00:27:05,951 --> 00:27:08,032
on Operation 7·23
throughout these two years.

672
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:09,272
To get a chance

673
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:10,552
to seek justice for Wanru,

674
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:11,552
not only you and I,

675
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,432
those who witnessed and experienced it

676
00:27:13,512 --> 00:27:14,512
care about it too.

677
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,940
(Jiangcheng Public Security Bureau)

678
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,710
(Interrogation Room)

679
00:27:17,711 --> 00:27:19,792
I've answered everything you asked me.

680

if we worked together)

to give me an out.)

and I think I made a right guess.)

I did take up the case, where is he?)

What are you doing?

712

You even took those on the table.

Shoo her away!

716

- Go away! Don't ruin my business!
- Get off!

Get off!

718

Come, don't care about her.

She can't afford to be poor.

722
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:57,831
Take this.

Zhu Xin.

778
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,071
Let me emphasize this again.

779
00:34:38,351 --> 00:34:39,192
To make a long story short,

780
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:40,472
there are

781
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:42,232
two key points in your case.

782
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:43,392
First,

783
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,912
your fingerprints were not identified

784
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:46,271

785
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,511
Second,

786
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:49,351
the Office of the Prosecutor

787
00:34:49,392 --> 00:34:50,712
is trying to prove that the defendant

788
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:52,232
added the dosage of psychoactive drugs

789
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:53,271
for the victim on purpose.

790
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,031
Since the victim is dead,

791
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:56,111
there is no evidence,

792
00:34:56,432 --> 00:34:58,472
plus the victim
suffered from depression,

793
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:01,591
it's hard to prove that you
harmed the victim subjectively.

I have one last question.

798
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:13,031
Did anyone out there ask you

799
00:35:14,992 --> 00:35:16,311
why I murdered my wife?

800
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:23,632
We are trying to defend

801
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:24,831

00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:42,952
(If I told you,)

846
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,791
(I'd wait for you to rescue me, right?)

847
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,071
(Do you think I'm riding the wave?)

848
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:47,992
(Do not)

849
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,952
(be a keyboard warrior
who kills people.)

850
00:36:50,232 --> 00:36:51,791
(A word from you)

851
00:36:51,912 --> 00:36:54,031
(could either save someone
from committing suicide)

852
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:56,351
(or make someone kill themselves.)

853
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:57,432
I'm in debt.

854
00:36:57,511 --> 00:36:59,432
Many people are going
after me for money.

855
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:01,551
They tail me and
threaten me in every way.

856
00:37:01,712 --> 00:37:03,071
(If you really encounter difficulties)

857
00:37:03,071 --> 00:37:03,912
(from the underworld forces)

858
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:06,071
(and need any support,)

859
00:37:06,232 --> 00:37:07,831
(please send me a private message.)

860
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:10,351
(Zhang Xiaobei.)

861
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:11,591
(As a victim,)

862
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:12,672
(it's okay to rant.)

863
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:15,831
(However, we must believe in justice.)

864
00:37:16,952 --> 00:37:17,952
All right, I'll go on.

865
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:19,031
Since I've started the topic,

866
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,152
I'll tell you about the rest today.

867
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,392
Do you remember Shi Xiaohu?

868
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:24,311
(Just like me,)

869
00:37:24,632 --> 00:37:25,751
(he committed suicide
and he's in a vegetative state now.)

870
00:37:26,632 --> 00:37:28,392
His mother sold scrap metal
to gather medical fees

871
00:37:28,791 --> 00:37:30,111
to sustain his life for half a year

872
00:37:30,872 --> 00:37:32,311
but he still died.

873
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:33,751
How unseemly.

874
00:37:34,591 --> 00:37:35,912
However, Huiquan didn't even

875
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:38,791
apologize for his death.

876
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:40,551
You weren't even bothered to fake one.

877
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,152
(I knew his death was unjust.)

878
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:43,872
(That's why)

879
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:45,271
(I kept speaking up for him,)

880
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:46,632
(but everything was deleted.)

881
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:50,071
(Even his mother was cyberbullied.)

882
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:51,472
(Huiquan,)

883
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:53,872
don't burn your bridges

884
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:55,632
to the point of no return.

885
00:37:56,271 --> 00:37:57,351
Indeed,

886
00:37:57,392 --> 00:37:59,672
you didn't plan to leave
a way out for others.

887
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:01,672
Don't blame

888
00:38:01,672 --> 00:38:04,031
Mr. Bei for this mutual destruction.

889
00:38:07,031 --> 00:38:07,551
(Everyone,)

890
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:09,952
(please help me share this live stream)

891
00:38:10,192 --> 00:38:11,632
(so that more people could watch it.)

892
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:13,511
(Come on.)

893
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:20,232
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

894
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:20,952
(Xiao Mu'en.)

895
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:22,831
(How did you monitor the popular accounts?)

896
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:24,672
(Do you think the current situation)

897
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,232
(is controllable?)

898
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:27,712
(Don't tell me)

899
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:28,791
that you haven't seen

900
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:29,751
this news.

901
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:30,751
(Mr. Zhao.)

902
00:38:31,271 --> 00:38:32,111
Please calm down.

903
00:38:32,432 --> 00:38:33,271
I only saw it just now.

904
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:34,632
(I'll look into it right away.)

905
00:38:35,232 --> 00:38:36,031
All right.

906
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:38,432
(Didn't Huiquan)

907
00:38:38,472 --> 00:38:40,591
(Mr. Bei, you're my God.)
(just buy a live-streaming company?)

908
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:43,271
(The power of internet)
(I'm going to speak up using your platform.)

909
00:38:43,392 --> 00:38:45,152
(I'll contend against you
even if I have to die.)

910
00:38:45,511 --> 00:38:46,751
(What? Don't take it to heart.)
(Bye!)

911
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:52,751
Behind me

912
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,791
is Jiangcheng's Intermediate
People's Court.

913
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:56,912
Mr. Zhu's murder case which has caught

914
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:57,912
the public's attention

915
00:38:57,952 --> 00:39:00,351
will have its first hearing here today.

916
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:01,271
It is reported that

917
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:03,192
the victim, Yuan Fangfang,
met with an accident

918
00:39:03,232 --> 00:39:04,632
when she was passing by

919
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:06,071
Dong'an Road. This hearing...

920
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:14,432
He's here.

921
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:17,831
When did it happen?

922
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:19,472
About 20 minutes ago.

923
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:21,232
Where?

924
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:22,672
(The exact location is not confirmed.)

925
00:39:22,672 --> 00:39:23,751
(We're still tracking.)

926
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:26,232
Listen.

927
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:28,152
Ask our colleagues
from the technical investigation team

928
00:39:28,271 --> 00:39:30,071
whether they could confirm
which river it is

929
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:31,912
based on the background in the video.

930
00:39:32,071 --> 00:39:33,351
Besides, make a visit to Green Broadcasting.

931
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:35,751
Ask them whether they
could provide back-end data

932
00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:37,432
for us to get the exact location.

933
00:39:37,672 --> 00:39:38,831
(Got it.)

934
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:49,271
- What is he doing?
- What's going on?

935
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:51,152
Isn't Captain He
attending court as a witness?

936
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,232
This...

937
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:56,952
Why isn't he answering?

938
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:00,271
Never mind, there's no time for this.

939
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:01,071
We'll play it by ear.

940
00:40:01,672 --> 00:40:01,992
Okay.

941
00:40:18,872 --> 00:40:19,232
Liu.

942
00:40:19,472 --> 00:40:20,152
How's everything?

943
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,751
We have identified where he jumped.

944
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:23,311
It's there.

945
00:40:27,271 --> 00:40:27,751
Look.

946
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,712
The rescue team is searching for him.

947
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,432
He jumped from such a high place.

948
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:32,831
I think it isn't very optimistic.

949
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,351
Let's go there to have a look.

950
00:40:35,672 --> 00:40:36,152
Okay.

951
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:38,551
As of now,

952
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:40,152
the police and professionals

953
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:42,152
have started positive measures
to carry out search and rescue work.

954
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:43,511
There's no update yet.

955
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:44,632
Behind me

956
00:40:44,712 --> 00:40:46,271
is where Zhang Xiaobei
fell into the water.

957
00:40:46,632 --> 00:40:47,632
Is this where he had the live stream?

958
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:48,511
Yes.

959
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:52,152
This is the spot.

960
00:40:53,511 --> 00:40:55,351
How far could a person drift from here?

961
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:01,992
Liu.

962
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:03,351
Hold my clothes.

963
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:04,232
Why?

964
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:05,511
Captain He!

965
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:06,992
Captain He!

966
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:08,311
Why did you jump?

967
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:08,952
Gosh.

968
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:09,672
Quick!

969
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:10,472
Hold this!

970
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:12,831
Start searching for Captain He! Quick!

971
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,192
Just a moment ago,

972
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:16,271
the captain of
the Criminal Investigation Division,

973
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:17,952
He Luyuan also jumped off the bridge.

974
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:20,232
The reason behind this is unknown.

975
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:24,511
(Next, we'll focus on local news.)

976
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:25,271
(Today,)

977
00:41:25,351 --> 00:41:26,591

978
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:28,952
(of him committing suicide
on the famous streaming platform, Huibo)

979
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,591
(by jumping into the river.)

982
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:43,271
Come in.

983

Mr. Zhao.

984
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:47,232
Everyone has been informed.

985
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:48,551
The meeting room is ready.

986
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,472
Please have a look.

987
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,271
Ask Xiao Mu'en

988
00:41:52,672 --> 00:41:53,751
to come here now.

989
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:54,872
Besides,

990
00:41:55,472 --> 00:41:56,992
check the background

991
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:58,071
of Zhang Xiaobei.

992
00:41:58,511 --> 00:42:00,632
I want to know about
his relationship with Shi Xiaohu.

993
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:01,672
Also,

994
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:03,712
ask help from the companies

995
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:05,152
which we have collaborated with.

996
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:06,192
Don't worry about the money.

997
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:08,351
What I want is to suppress

998
00:42:08,472 --> 00:42:09,912
all the negative comments about us

999
00:42:09,992 --> 00:42:11,071
in the shortest time.

1000
