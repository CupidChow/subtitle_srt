=Episode 36=

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,481
By the way, Captain He,

16
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:44,201
I have something I want to tell you guys.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,561
However, if my whistleblowing

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,241
can contribute to your case,
even just a little,

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,921
I hope that you guys can write
something down for me

20
00:01:55,521 --> 00:01:57,161
and help me apply for leniency.

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,201
It depends on
what you're going to tell us.

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,441
I suspect that the person who hired me
to be Qian Tianxin's attorney

23
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:06,801
isn't Qian Tianxin's husband
in Country F.

24
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:09,040
I suspect it's someone else.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,520
Why do you say so?

26
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:15,761
When I urged him to
transfer the payment to me,

27
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,121
he said this by accident.

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,600
Hmm.

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,761
He said he hasn't transferred
the money to me yet.

30
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:22,800
He said he has no money.

31
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:26,121
That's why I had doubts.

32
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,880
Hello?

33
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,561
(How's your investigation?)

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Tian Qianxin requested her attorney

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,721
to give Li Yitang an address.

36
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,600
(That address was the place)

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,641
(where Li Yitang had visited
in Guangdong.)

38
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,040
Indeed.

39
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:53,361
Everyone's attention is on Zhao Jikai

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,721
after something like this.

41
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:56,800
No one would expect
Qian Tianxin to be the one.

42
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,160
And, Li Yitang went to Guangdong.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,201
I think she's going to find someone

44
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:02,440
or something that can help

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,160
reduce Zhao Jikai's sentence

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,641
according to the address
provided by Qian Tianxin.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,800
I know her well.

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,561
She'll never come back

49
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,841
until she discovers something.

50
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:11,841
Since she already decided
to return to Jiangcheng,

51
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:13,921
that means she must've
discovered something.

52
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,761
You mean the photo with
a contact number on her phone?

53
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:18,641
That's right.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,201
After that, she fainted in front

55
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:23,121
of her house in Jiangcheng.

56
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:30,040
We have to find out who she met

57
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:31,320
and what she discovered.

58
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:37,040
No. He Luyuan,
we have to fly to Guangdong

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
as soon as possible.

60
00:03:38,481 --> 00:03:39,960
I'll always be there for you.

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,240
Alright. Thank you.

62
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,721
Are you going to interrogate
Qian Tianxin again?

63
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,761
Nope. If she had anything to tell us

64
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,121
or was willing to cooperate with us,

65
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,040
she would've done so long ago.

66
00:03:54,121 --> 00:03:55,600
She wouldn't need to wait until now.

67
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:57,680
Let's not waste our time on her.

68
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:03,040
Now, we're in a race
against the person who harmed Li Yitang.

69
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,361
Although we have no testimonies,

70
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,160
I still believe in you.

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,960
I believe that
we can definitely find the true A.

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,440
I'll say the same thing.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,201
Thank you.

74
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,600
Ni, are we heading to Guangdong?

75
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,040
You're not going.

76
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,081
Come on, bring me along.

77
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,660
(Psychological offense is the best of tactics)

78
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,780
(Use the emotional dispute of Qian Tianxin, Li Yitang
and Zhao Jikai to control them)

79
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,740
(Blindly arrogant)

80
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:25,720
Tiancheng.

81
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,761
You're back, huh? Come here.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,921
I'm tired.

83
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:32,160
I'm telling you to come here.

84
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:42,840
Why did you drink?

85
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,241
It's all because of you.

86
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
You're not willing to trust me too, huh?

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,481
You're more willing to trust
that your son is a pervert, right?

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,440
I didn't say that.

89
00:05:57,761 --> 00:06:00,040
They already proved my innocence.

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
I just don't want to blow things up.

91
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,761
Enough. Calm down. Have a seat.

92
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:16,081
I know what you'll do.

93
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,000
You'll lecture me again.

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,921
Since young, whenever I got into
a conflict with someone else,

95
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,761
you never listened even when

96
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,761
Mom was trying to explain the situation.

97
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,761
You always forced me to apologize.

98
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,801
Everything was my fault.

99
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,921
I heard that you were removed

100
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,320
from your position as the chairman.

101
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:35,201
Yes. It's my fault.

102
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:37,440
You never made any mistakes.

103
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,000
Your biggest mistake

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
was to give birth to a son like me.

105
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,481
How could you say that?

106
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,160
You want to give me a beating now?

107
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,040
Go ahead.

108
00:06:56,761 --> 00:06:57,560
Yes.

109
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:01,840
You're right.

110
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:06,921
Your mother and you, you two

111
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,600
always acted upon my will.

112
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:14,401
But I never expected this to happen.

113
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,120
All those bootlickers

114
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,840
who try to butter me up endlessly,

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,961
they never stood up

116
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,641
and told me that I made a mistake

117
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:26,081
even when I did so.

118
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,320
No one told me I was wrong.

119
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,361
When I was removed from my position,

120
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:36,600
I felt like I was an utter failure.

121
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:39,440
Are you sure you only experienced that
in Huiquan?

122
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,600
You want to hear the truth, right?

123
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:46,201
Come. Look at this house.

124
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:50,600
Yes.

125
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:56,641
I failed as a husband and a father.

126
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,720
However, no matter
how much of a failure I am,

127
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,560
I just want the best for you.

128
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,241
Even if we're leading different lives,

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I still hope that you can
lead a good life.

130
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,120
Understood, boy?

131
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:11,081
Are you done?

132
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,560
Madam Zhang,
Tiancheng hasn't eaten yet.

133
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,320
Can you make him his favorite dumplings?

134
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Okay.

135
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:53,880
Okay.

136
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:07,041
Madam Zhang.

137
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:09,761
Are the dumplings ready?

138
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,641
Alright, pass them to me.

139
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,601
You can get back to work.

140
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,601
Okay.

141
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:15,320
Alright.

142
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,041
Tiancheng.

143
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
Tiancheng?

144
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:51,920
You haven't eaten yet, right?

145
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,880
These are your favorite dumplings.

146
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,521
Have them while they're hot. Take it.

147
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,880
Hello, madam.

148
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:19,800
Who are you guys?

149
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:20,880
Are you looking for someone?

150
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:23,041
I'm from the public security bureau.

151
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,680
I'm from the People's Procuratorate.

152
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:26,320
You must be Madam Qi.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,721
That's right.

154
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:32,041
I didn't commit any crime.

155
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,521
Madam Qi, calm down. It's like this.

156
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,680
We inquired about you
from your neighbors.

157
00:10:36,721 --> 00:10:38,201
We heard that a lady named Ms. Li

158
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,841
looked for you before this.

159
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,281
Her name is Li Yitang.

160
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:41,601
Do you still remember her?

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,120
Yeah. Someone like that
did look for me before.

162
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:47,841
I'm already old.

163
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,360
And now, the police are here?

164
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,800
What's going on?

165
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,920
Madam, calm down.

166
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,161
We're just here to
inquire about something.

167
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,281
Oh.

168
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:58,560
Okay then. Have a seat.

169
00:10:58,961 --> 00:11:00,120
Have a seat.

170
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:02,401
Have a seat.

171
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,521
What are you guys
trying to inquire about?

172
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,641
Madam, it's like this.

173
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:11,601
We wish to record our conversation.

174
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:12,800
Is it okay with you?

175
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,281
Thank you.

176
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,081
Madam Qi,

177
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
when Ms. Li came to find you,

178
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,401
what did she inquire about?

179
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,281
She asked me about Zhou Ling
and Zhou Siyue.

180
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,480
Please take a look. Is this Zhou Siyue?

181
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:36,401
That's right.

182
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,161
I can tell from his birthmark.

183
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:44,081
If so, what did you tell Li Yitang?

184
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:47,081
I told her something about Huiquan.

185
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,480
What did you mention about Huiquan?

186
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,601
At first, Ms. Li gave me a lot of names.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I knew none of them.

188
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,000
But she mentioned the name
of someone in Huiquan.

189
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,041
I knew that person well.

190
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,841
It was Zhou Ling.

191
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,920
She had a screw loose.

192
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:16,401
She always drinks at night
and goes crazy.

193
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:19,601
After that, she'll keep mumbling

194
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,440
the word "Huiquan".

195
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:27,641
Back then, Ling was working here
while taking care of her son.

196
00:12:27,841 --> 00:12:29,041
It was tough on her.

197
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,920
In addition, she was in a bad mood.

198
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,641
She looked weak.

199
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:40,000
However, on the surface,
she was a beauty.

200
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,721
That's why someone suggested
her to do that job.

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,721
That's easy money.

202
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:49,360
However, Ling has a stubborn temper.

203
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:55,161
She would rather suffer in the factory
than do that job.

204
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,440
But whenever she gets home,

205
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,961
she'll get herself drunk and go crazy.

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,041
She'll pace back and forth

207
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:06,721
and keep mumbling the word "Huiquan".

208
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:12,841
She'll criticize Huiquan and her son,
Zhou Siyue.

209
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,041
Sometimes, she even throws stuff and yells

210
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,081
in the middle of the night.

211
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,041
Huiquan!

212
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:34,440
It's my fault. Don't leave us.
Don't leave us!

213
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,761
Mom. Mom, what's the matter?

214
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,641
Don't touch me! You ugly freak!

215
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,120
Mom?

216
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:49,920
You freak!

217
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:51,521
Mom, what's wrong with you?

218
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
What's wrong with me?

219
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,401
It's all because of you!

220
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,800
Mom!

221
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,641
He left me because of you!

222
00:13:56,641 --> 00:13:57,000
Mom.

223
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,440
You freak!

224
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,680
You're a jinx!

225
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:03,521
Scram!

226
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:04,641
Mom.

227
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,521
But when Zhou Ling is normal,

228
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,841
she does treat her son well.

229
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,081
Siyue, look at what I've bought for you.

230
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:29,281
I told you to come.
Are you stuck on that stool?

231
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:33,081
Come here.

232
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:46,920
Open it and take a look.

233
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,560
Why are you in a daze?

234
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:52,601
Have them while they're hot.

235
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:54,880
Aren't they your favorite?

236
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,920
Slow down.
No one will steal them from you.

237
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,240
If you like them,
I'll buy them for you again.

238
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,800
I made a fortune today.

239
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,601
Do you know where they are right now?

240
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,281
They left long ago.

241
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:22,120
If so, do you know where they went?

242
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,641
I don't. It's all because of that.

243
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,920
What is it?

244
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:32,721
It's because Xin was almost raped.

245
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:34,480
In order to save Xin, Ling was...

246
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,641
Were you referring to Qian Tianxin?

247
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:41,440
Yeah. Ms. Li gave me
the same reaction as you.

248
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,120
She thought Xin was Qian Tianxin.

249
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,320
However, none of us knew her full name.

250
00:15:48,721 --> 00:15:50,641
We only called her Xin.

251
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,601
If so, was Xin close to
Zhou Ling and her son?

252
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,240
On the surface,
they didn't look that close.

253
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,000
But when I took a closer look,

254
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,601
I felt that Xin
was especially nice to Zhou Siyue.

255
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,721
She was truly nice to him.

256
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,920
It's all your fault!

257
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:10,920
It's all because of you!

258
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:13,480
Ugly freak! I'll kill you!

259
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,680
- Mom!
- I'll kill you!

260
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,120
Mom!

261
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,761
Stop!

262
00:16:17,761 --> 00:16:18,761
Stop hitting him!

263
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:20,521
That's enough!

264
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:22,721
Scram! Don't stop me!

265
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:26,401
Enough! You've lost your mind!

266
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
You should blame it on the man
who harmed you.

267
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,800
It's not his fault.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,320
He's still a child!

269
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,920
Are you even his biological mother?

270
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,201
This is none of your business!

271
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:37,800
If you want to care for a son that much,
go and give birth to one.

272
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,920
He's really unlucky
to have a mother like you!

273
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:50,841
Stop hitting him!

274
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:52,721
You've lost your mind!

275
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:55,041
Forget it! I don't care anymore!

276
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,601
You freak!

277
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,880
- She has lost her mind.
- It's all because of you!

278
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:19,880
Siyue, here.

279
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:29,720
I know your mother was triggered too.

280
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,880
But no matter what,

281
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,080
she can't just vent her anger
on you all the time.

282
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:44,681
Did Xin go to Macau, China after that?

283
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,080
She did go to Macau, China.

284
00:17:49,561 --> 00:17:51,281
Back then, she told us

285
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:53,321
that she wanted to work in Macau, China.

286
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,880
She wanted to make a fortune there.

287
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
After that, we lost contact.

288
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,921
I don't know whether
she went there or not.

289
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,200
After listening to what
you guys had said, I guess it was true.

290
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:05,240
Have you guys seen her then?

291
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,401
Is she doing well?

292
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Not really.

293
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,521
By the way, Madam Qi,

294
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,281
I have something to show you.

295
00:18:14,641 --> 00:18:16,480
The contact number on this picture,

296
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
did you give it to Ms. Li back then?

297
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,321
(Ma Huibo)
Oh, 1380789. That's right.

298
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,441
I did give her that number.

299
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:32,120
Zhou Siyue was a nice boy.

300
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:34,600
When he gave me the number,

301
00:18:34,761 --> 00:18:38,041
he told me not to forget about him.

302
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,600
Ling, where are you going?

303
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,761
Are you moving?

304
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,521
My child has grown up. It's time
to have a change of environment.

305
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:52,281
All these years,
we're used to leading a nomadic life.

306
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,921
Am I right?

307
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,561
Look at him.

308
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,441
He's not greeting me even though
he'll be leaving soon.

309
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
We're neighbors after all.

310
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:05,080
You can tell everyone that
you're leaving the village.

311
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,281
Xin will never agree to it if
she hears about this.

312
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,480
I don't want to trouble anyone.

313
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,681
Besides, they'll find out eventually.

314
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,240
I know you have plenty of trouble.

315
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:21,880
Zhou Siyue is just like you.

316
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,200
He keeps everything to himself.

317
00:19:26,921 --> 00:19:28,720
I know you guys have it rough.

318
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,161
However,
there are many people in the world

319
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:33,600
who have it rough too.

320
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,480
No matter how rough it is,
you shouldn't let your child suffer.

321
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:40,200
Got it, Madam Qi.
We're running out of time.

322
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,281
If there's anything
you like in the house, you can take them.

323
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:48,240
Where are you guys going then?

324
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:50,880
We don't know yet.

325
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:53,360
Take care.

326
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,801
Write me a letter
once you've settled down.

327
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,681
You have my number, right?

328
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:04,960
Madam Qi, don't forget about us.

329
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,921
Okay.

330
00:20:07,321 --> 00:20:10,120
Madam Qi, Zhou Siyue was still a child

331
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,240
when he left the village, right?

332
00:20:11,321 --> 00:20:13,681
He should be in his thirties now, right?

333
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,161
More or less.

334
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,761
Are you two looking for them

335
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,561
because they did something?

336
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:22,960
Don't worry.

337
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,281
We're just here to
inquire about the situation.

338
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,041
Inquire about the situation, huh?

339
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:30,641
Actually, I do watch dramas often.

340
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,840
Whenever they say that they want
to inquire about the situation,

341
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,880
it's definitely something bad.

342
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,681
Did Zhou Ling harm Zhou Siyue?

343
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,401
It's not Zhou Ling's fault.

344
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
You should blame the person

345
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,281
who caused Zhou Ling to suffer.

346
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,761
He Luyuan, we have to go.

347
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,600
Madam, we'll make a move first.

348
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:58,321
Please take care of yourself.

349
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
We'll contact the local police

350
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:01,281
to protect you in secret.

351
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,041
One of my feet is already in the coffin.

352
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,921
Who would try to harm me?

353
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,321
Could it be Zhou Siyue?

354
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:14,801
That's impossible.

355
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,360
If he did want to harm me,

356
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:18,161
he wouldn't let you guys find me

357
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:19,681
and inquire about the situation.

358
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,080
Madam, anyway, just be careful

359
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,041
and take care of yourself.

360
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:25,401
Okay.

361
00:21:25,401 --> 00:21:26,600
We'll make a move first.

362
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,120
Take care. See you.

363
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:36,480
If that's the case,

364
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:39,480
Yin Huiquan is Zhou Siyue's
biological father.

365
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,720
That means our initial inference
was on point.

366
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,681
Zhou Ling got to know
Yin Huiquan in Fujian.

367
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,681
They broke up for unknown reasons.

368
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,401
After that, she returned to her hometown

369
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:48,401
and gave birth to Zhou Siyue.

370
00:21:48,561 --> 00:21:50,561
And, she brought Zhou Siyue
to Guangdong.

371
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,401
After they arrived here,
they got to know Qian Tianxin.

372
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:54,880
Zhou Ling even saved
Qian Tianxin before.

373
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,281
Due to that, Zhou Ling was raped.

374
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:01,641
So, Zhou Siyue treats Qian Tianxin...

375
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,200
He treats her like his kin.

376
00:22:04,441 --> 00:22:06,200
I guess our trip wasn't in vain.

377
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:22,200
Li Kui,
assign someone to protect Yin Huiquan.

378
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,401
Captain He, do we protect him
in secret or not?

379
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,200
Don't let him find out.

380
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:27,080
Roger that.

381
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,600
It's just like our prediction.

382
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,120
The relationship between Zhou Siyue

383
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,801
and Yin Huiquan is complicated.

384
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,080
Do you plan to find
Yin Huiquan directly?

385
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:43,281
Not for now.
I'll find him when the time is right.

386
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,281
(Username Jiang Hua User Status Normal)

387
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,281
(Payment Record Search)

388
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,880
Hello, Han Xuan?

389
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,801
Hello, Ni.

390
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,281
I've locked onto three contact numbers.

391
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:00,000
These three contact numbers
are pretty suspicious.

392
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,801
However, they have
a common characteristic.

393
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,401
No one is on the other end of the phone.

394
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:04,921
No one picked up when I called
the first two contact numbers.

395
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,880
For the last number,
the phone was switched off.

396
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:09,600
What's going on with
these three contact numbers?

397
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,041
The first contact number
wasn't even registered.

398
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:14,281
However, there were records

399
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:17,000
(of top-ups made in offline stores
in several provinces.)

400
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:19,921
(I called the number. It was working,
but no one picked up the phone.)

401
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,921
I think it was restricted.

402
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,080
It can only pick up calls,
not make them.

403
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:25,120
For the second contact number,

404
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,921
it was registered.

405
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,161
However, it was under the name of

406
00:23:29,161 --> 00:23:30,641
an old man in his seventies.

407
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:32,041
What's so strange about that?

408
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:34,401
Elderly people do
have phones too nowadays.

409
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,120
Ni, that's not it.

410
00:23:35,161 --> 00:23:37,120
I told the local household
registration office to check the number.

411
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:38,960
That old man lives in the mountains.

412
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,161
He never used a phone before.

413
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,521
And, he lost his ID card long ago.

414
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,521
(He didn't report it.)

415
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,240
(Most importantly,)

416
00:23:45,521 --> 00:23:48,041
(he made a top-up worth 30,000 yuan
ten years ago.)

417
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,921
30,000 yuan?

418
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,080
(That's right.
As for the third contact number...)

419
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:52,681
Han Xuan, stop there for a second.

420
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,880
Send the contact number
with the 30,000 yuan top-up to me.

421
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:55,720
Okay.

422
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:00,960
What? Do you plan to call it right now?

423
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,521
You'll alert them to our presence.

424
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:06,681
I can't rest at ease
without confirming it.

425
00:24:07,161 --> 00:24:09,561
Besides, we already alerted him
to our presence long ago.

426
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
We don't know where he is.

427
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,401
Do you think he'll be afraid of us?

428
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,761
Now, we just need to confirm that
this number belongs to Zhou Siyue.

429
00:24:16,281 --> 00:24:17,880
If so, everything else
will fall in place.

430
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,921
He hung up? Call him again.

431
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,161
(Hello. The number
you have dialed is unavailable.)

432
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:58,561
He switched off his phone.

433
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Was it Zhou Siyue?

434
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,720
I think it's him.

435
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:12,080
Zhou Siyue, he avoided arrest.

436
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:13,761
I'm sure he's related to Operation 7·23.

437
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,200
He picked up the phone,

438
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:16,840
but he didn't utter a single word.

439
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,281
Both of us had the same mindset.

440
00:25:18,281 --> 00:25:19,120
We were trying to see

441
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,161
who would speak first.

442
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:26,681

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,761
(Ah!)

00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:04,960
(Help!)

448
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,441
(Let go! I'm begging you!)

449
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,561
Siyue?

450
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:12,960
Come here.

451
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,240
Buy some alcohol for me.

452
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:23,401
Mom, you should stop drinking.

453
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:24,801
Just obey my instruction.

454
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,401
Are you going to buy it or not?

455
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:35,000
Take your time.

456
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,380
(You always care about him
when I beat him.)

457
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,200
(Because of that,
I won't let anything bad happen to you.)

458
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:54,600
You aren't married yet.

459
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:57,161
Mom!

460
00:26:57,521 --> 00:26:58,360
Don't come in!

461
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,840
Who did it?

462
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,441
Stop right there! If you go after him,

463
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,761
I'll take my life right now!

464
00:27:06,801 --> 00:27:07,720
Siyue.

465
00:27:08,561 --> 00:27:11,960
Siyue, let go.

466
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,960
I know you feel terrible.

467
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,600
Your mother did it to save me.

468
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,401
Siyue, she did so to save me!

469
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,600
Siyue, let go!

470
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,240
In the past,
I didn't understand your mother at all.

471
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,681
I didn't understand why

472
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,600
she would abuse you
whenever she got drunk.

473
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:11,921
You were her son after all.

474
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:15,840
I never met a mother who
would do such a thing to their child.

475
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:24,120
But today, I realized that
she became like this

476
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,761
because she suffered too much.

477
00:28:28,401 --> 00:28:29,641
She does love you.

478
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,960
She took on everything by herself.

479
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:40,000
She couldn't forgive herself.

480
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:43,240
She's a nice person.

481
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,840
In the future, I'll be your kin.

482
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:55,720
I'll always be your kin.

Siyue.

490
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:28,561
Are you Siyue?

491
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:30,041
Siyue!

492
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,240
I can't believe this.

493
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,000
You're all grown up.

494
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,240
You completely changed.

495
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:37,401
I would never recognize you

496
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,561
if you didn't call me Xin.

497
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,401
How have you been doing?

498
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:43,840
I'm doing pretty well.

499
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,200
Do you know something?

500
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,720
I was trying to inquire about Yin Huiquan
some time ago.

501
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,000
I heard that he was gambling
in Macau, China

502
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,641
and he got a citizenship
in Hong Kong, China.

503
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,761
I thought I could find you guys

504
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,960
- if I found him...
- I know.

505
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,161
I know that.
That's why I came to find you.

506
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:04,360
Yeah. This is great.
I finally encountered you again.

507
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,960
So, how's Ling doing?

508
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:11,960
She passed away not long
after we left the village.

509
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:25,360
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

510
00:30:26,041 --> 00:30:29,200
Xin, my mother's death
has nothing to do with you.

511
00:30:33,321 --> 00:30:35,321
Xin, listen to me.

512
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,000
I will find time to explain
the details to you.

513
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
Right now, I need your help

514
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:44,240
for something important.

515
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:49,041
Xin, are you willing to help me?

516
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,641
Siyue, just give me the word.

517
00:30:56,761 --> 00:30:59,600
I'll help you in any way I can.

518
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,000
(Xin, don't tell me
you're going to betray me too?)

519
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,000
Hello, Ni?

520
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,561
Xuan, I'll send a contact number to you.

521
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,321
Investigate it and see what you can find.

522
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,360
You don't need to send it to me.

523
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,281
We were tracking its location

524
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,761
when you called the number.

525
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:20,761
And, the forensic department
is helping us too.

526
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:21,600
There's no way to locate it.

527
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:22,641
The call was too short.

528
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,921
And, I think the other party used
a custom phone or a virtual dialer.

529
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,441
A custom phone?

530
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,041
Yes.

531
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,840
For example,
the old phone models of Blackberry

532
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,921
have this function.

533
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:37,401
If so, is the virtual dialing system
the latest system we have?

534
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:39,480
Yes. The virtual dialer is

535
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,080
a voice getaway technology

536
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,240
that was built upon VoIP technology.

537
00:31:43,641 --> 00:31:46,561
(It can form a seamless connection
between VoIP and mobile communication.)

538
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
(It can perform a call on the Internet)

539
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:51,441
(with the formation of a SIM matrix.)

540
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:52,960
It's unique in the sense
that the caller, the phone,

541
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,761
and the SIM card
don't need to be in one place.

542
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,641
For example, scammers
who aren't in the country

543
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,200
can perform such functions
without being in the country.

544
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,041
Are you saying that
a person can use a virtual dialer

545
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,161
to transform the phone signal
to a VoIP signal

546
00:32:05,161 --> 00:32:07,240
and transform the signal
of their SIM card

547
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:08,240
to somewhere outside of the country?

548
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
Is that what you mean?

549
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,167
(Yes.)

550
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:14,120
Does that mean it's controlled
by a remote server?

551
00:32:14,401 --> 00:32:19,641
Yes, Ni. And I assume that
as the backbone of the fraud syndicate,

552
00:32:19,681 --> 00:32:21,641
if Zhou Siyue has the capability
to establish such a server,

553
00:32:21,681 --> 00:32:23,840
he can make it so that
we won't be able to find him.

554
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,200
Alright, Xuan. I got it.

555
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,960
Help me apply for leave
from Prosecutor Guo.

556
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,880
Thank you so much.

557
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,681
(Okay.)

558
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,120
Where are we going?

559
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:37,120
Let me think.

560
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,161
Do you have any suspects in mind?

561
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:46,321
To be honest,
I think Zhou Siyue is right around us.

562
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
We'll find him soon.

563
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:50,441
But I'm really confused.

564
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:52,880
Why don't you send me home?

565
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,840
I'll try and straighten them out.

566
00:33:02,041 --> 00:33:02,521
Han Xuan.

567
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,480
Now, we've already arrested
the key figures of cybercrime syndicates

568
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:06,761
inside and outside of the country.

569
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,681
Why aren't you paying attention to them

570
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:10,161
and trying to prosecute them?

571
00:33:10,761 --> 00:33:13,321
Why are you investigating
Huiquan's cash flow again?

572
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,921
Zhao Jikai was already arrested, right?

573
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,880
Don't tell me there's
a bigger fish out there?

574
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,761
An Ni said there were doubts

575
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:22,840
regarding the foreign capital
that was just injected into Huiquan.

576
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,761
Although it looked like

577
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:26,401
a proper equity-based investment,

578
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
Ni still wanted us to find out

579
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,521
the source of the capital
that came from the trust company.

580
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,000
She thinks there's more to it
than meets the eye.

581
00:33:33,641 --> 00:33:34,281
Is that so?

582
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,281
Investigating cash flow is our expertise.

583
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,921
However, we usually investigate

584
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,561
local funds that were transferred
to other countries.

585
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:43,521
We never did the opposite before.

586
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,641
Besides that,
since we lack key evidence,

587
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,360
we have no right to investigate

588
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,161
a foreign trust company and their clients.

589
00:33:52,561 --> 00:33:54,921
Moreover, I don't think a crime syndicate
will do this.

590
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:57,801
They spent so much effort
to scam people of their money in China

591
00:33:58,041 --> 00:33:59,441
and launder it so that

592
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:00,480
they could transfer it
out of the country.

593
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:02,000
Now, they're transferring
the money back?

594
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:02,801
What are they after?

595
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,120
Who knows?

596
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,401
I've learned something from
the occurrences lately.

597
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:09,720
Anything is possible.

598
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,920
You see, for a typical fraud syndicate,

599
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,440
there must be a leader, right?

600
00:34:16,801 --> 00:34:18,680
Logically speaking, all of the criminals

601
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,521
will avoid getting
involved with the leader.

602
00:34:20,761 --> 00:34:21,920
But for Operation 7·23,

603
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,920
people kept saying that
they were A from the start.

604
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:26,121
Isn't that suspicious?

605
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,081
If I must say,
we should stop thinking

606
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:32,240
and start working.

607
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,881
And, I think Ni has an idea
of what's going on.

608
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:40,960
Did Ni head to the hospital again?

609
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,841
She said she needed some space to think.

610
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:45,841
She'll piece the case together
from the very beginning to the end.

611
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,361
She said everything will be resolved

612
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,321
as long as she finds Zhou Siyue.

613
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,140
(Government Resources)

614
00:35:15,761 --> 00:35:17,680
(Zhou Siyue)
(He was the cause of everything.)

615
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,601
(From Country A to Country B.)

616
00:35:20,761 --> 00:35:22,000
(After that, to Country C.)

617
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,480
(vanished)
(In the end, he vanished.)

618
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:29,121
Qian Tianxin. There's no doubt.
She's the main figure

619
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,521
of the crime syndicate.

620
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,160
(We have a huge number of witnesses)

621
00:35:32,361 --> 00:35:33,841
(and evidence to prove)

622
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,960
(that she's the main figure)

623
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,640
(of the crime syndicate)

624
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,801
(no matter if it's in Country A or F.)

625
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:39,601
(Wei.)

626
00:35:39,881 --> 00:35:41,200
(Wei)
(However, our prosecution)

627
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,041
(lacks three basic pieces of evidence.)

628
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,480
(First, regarding Zhang Wanru's death)

629
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:46,960
(Li Quan)
(and Paul's information,)

630
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
(it was obvious that
she was prepared for them.)

631
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,720
(However, it didn't match
the details we had.)

632
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:54,920
(And, Li Quan couldn't accuse her
of being A directly.)

633
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,881
(Hu Dewang even denied the fact
that A even existed in the court.)

634
00:35:58,041 --> 00:35:59,440
The leader of the syndicate

635
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,000
in Country A and F is someone named A.

636
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,960
Hu Dewang!

637
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:04,400
What nonsense are you saying?

638
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,281
(Qian Tianxin intends to bear)

639
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:08,440
(all responsibility herself.)

640
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:10,841
(It's obvious that
she's protecting the culprit.)

641
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,400
(She hopes that
we can end the case soon.)

642
00:36:12,601 --> 00:36:14,960
(This means that there are two forces
behind this case.)

643
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:16,601
(One of them wishes to make the best
of a bad bargain)

644
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,281
(while the other wants to save her.)

645
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,761
(The one who wants to save her)

646
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:22,200
(is most likely Zhao Jikai.)

647
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:24,000
(If so, who's the one making the best)

648
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,281
(of a bad bargain?)

649
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,801
(So, she's definitely not the person
who ordered someone)

650
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:31,081
(to kill Zhang Wanru.)

651
00:36:32,761 --> 00:36:34,841
(Secondly, regarding)

652
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,041
(Success rate)
(how she could make her subordinates)

653
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:38,081
(commit fraud cases with
an 85% success rate)

654
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,720
(and obtain detailed
information of the users,)

655
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,521
(she couldn't give me an answer.)

656
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,801
(However, I can assume)

657
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,160
(that she's trying to protect
Zhao Jikai here.)

658
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,281
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate)
(However, Zhao Jikai came to us)

659
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:49,200
(even though he knew she was arrested.)

660
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,121
(If so, who is she trying
to protect here?)

661
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:54,680
(Now, it's this fool.)

662
00:36:55,601 --> 00:36:57,160
(She knew the kind of person
Zhao Jikai was.)

663
00:36:57,601 --> 00:37:01,521
(Talking)
(She knew what she was getting into.)

664
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,640
(Even so, she was still drawn to him,)

665
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,680
(like a moth to a flame.)

666
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,881
(However, she did make
Qian Tianxin say something.)

667
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,521
(And, she helped us
to shift our attention)

668
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:13,160
(to someone we had
never pay attention to,)

669
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,160
(which was Zhou Siyue.)

670
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:17,400
(The chilling thing about this)

671
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,240
(Father and Son)
(was that Zhou Siyue and her mother)

672
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:21,920
(were involved with someone)

673
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,000
(we never expected to see here.)

674
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,841
(Everything here proves)

675
00:37:25,361 --> 00:37:27,400
(Yin Huiquan is definitely
related to this case.)

676
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,480
(However, right when we were about
to suspect Yin Huiquan,)

677
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,480
(Zhao Jikai turned himself in
out of the blue.)

678
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:33,200
(He could've avoided the case)

679
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:35,841
(and pushed the blame on Yin Huiquan.)

680
00:37:36,761 --> 00:37:38,281
(Why did he turn himself in?)

681
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,240
(After that, Luo Jiangxiao,)

682
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:41,881
(the legal advisor he trusted the most,)

683
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,680
(Proof)
(suddenly resigned from the company.)

684
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,361
(Yin Huiquan still has family)
(Besides the employees in the company,)

685
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,561
(Yin Huiquan's son,)

686
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:50,881
(Yin Tiancheng, got into trouble
for no apparent reason.)

687
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,380
(Please identify this man, Yin Tiancheng.)

688
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:53,761
Next is Li Yitang,

689
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:55,601
the director of legal affairs
of Huiquan Corporation.

690
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,361
(She could've
stayed out of the situation.)

691
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,881
(However, she has the highest chance
of knowing the company's secret.)

692
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:00,640
(Now, she's in a coma.)

693
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:02,240
(She might never speak again.)

694
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:06,121
Yin Huiquan is also affected by

695
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,041
the happenings around him lately.

696
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:09,920
And, he was removed from his position

697
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,761
by the board of directors,
which he trusted for many years.

698
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,601
If everything proceeds as expected,

699
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:22,400
he'll lose all of his wealth,
fame, and dignity.

700
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,380
(Investigation and evidence collection)

701
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,960
(Although they kept
getting into trouble,)

702
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,680
(someone kept rising through
the ranks steadily.)

703
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,680
(He's young and talented.)

704
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,240
(He's a successful entrepreneur)

705
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:42,121
(and the dark horse of
the live stream industry.)

706
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,720
(He's the revitalizing agent
of Huiquan Corporation.)

707
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,480
(He's a talented individual
who was admired by Yin Huiquan.)

708
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:49,640
(Zhou Siyue)
(And now, he's the favorite)

709
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,561
(of the new shareholders.)

710
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,321
(As the pillars of Huiquan Corporation
fell one by one,)

711
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:56,361
(he established himself
as one of the new pillars.)

712
00:38:57,321 --> 00:39:00,440
(And now, he's just one step away
from being the chairman of the company.)

713
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,340
(Major shareholder joined)

714
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,081
(When it comes to him,)

715
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,121
(Successful Network Entrepreneur)
(everyone, including me,)

716
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:08,521
(will never suspect him
for getting involved with crimes.)

717
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,521
(He's intelligent,)

718
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,361
(witty, and everyone inside
and outside of the company)

719
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:14,640
(regards him highly.)

720
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:17,361
(Even his competitors compliment him.)

721
00:39:17,841 --> 00:39:19,601
(To his subordinates,
he's a good leader.)

722
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,440
(To the shareholders,
he's an excellent talent.)

723
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:24,041
(A flawless person like him)

724
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:25,521
(is in the eye of the storm.)

725
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:28,041
(Many strange occurrences
happened right around him.)

726
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,400
(Even so, his presence
was always neglected.)

727
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,841
(However, the doubts about him)

728
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,480
(are just as obvious as his strengths.)

729
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:36,801
(They cannot be ignored.)

730
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:40,440
(Two years ago, he appeared,
just like a shooting star.)

731
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:44,200
(Two years ago,
someone vanished all of a sudden.)

732
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:46,200
Two years ago,

733
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,680
Mr. Xiao said he wanted me
to start a business together with him.

734
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,200
(Zhou Siyue)
(Back then, I was just laid off.)

735
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,680
(Programmers our age
were basically unwanted.)

736
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:53,680
(It's all thanks to Mr. Xiao.)

737
00:39:54,121 --> 00:39:56,561
(If he was the culprit,
(how did he vanish)

738
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:57,801
(from a Nordic country)

739
00:39:57,881 --> 00:39:59,281
(where border security
was extremely tight)

740
00:39:59,281 --> 00:40:00,680
(and illegal border crossing)

741
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,720
(Birthmark below the eye)
(was literally impossible?)

742
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:04,321
Mr. Xiao wore spectacles
in order to look cool.

743
00:40:04,521 --> 00:40:05,521
(Xiao Mu'en)
His eyes are fine.

744
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,760
(Plastic surgery)

745
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,200
(There's no way for us
to find Zhou Siyue.)

746
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:11,980
(Xiao)

747
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:14,920
(It's because someone named Xiao Mu'en)

748
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,081
(has replaced him permanently.)

749
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:16,640
Mr. Xiao!

750
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,081
Mr. Xiao, what are you doing?

751
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,940
(Xiao Mu'en is A.)

752
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,900
(Xiao Mu'en.
Strict immigration controls)

753
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:39,640
(According to the latest news)

754
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,761
(from Jiangcheng
Evening News Program Team,)

755
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,440
(from now on, the ex-chairman)

756
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,400
(of Huiquan Corporation, Yin Huiquan,)

757
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,041
(will cease to be the chairman.)

758
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,081
(After the voting of
Huiquan Corporation's)

759
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:50,281
(board of directors,)

760
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,321
(Xiao Mu'en, the person in charge of
Huibo Broadcasting, a subsidiary company)

761
00:40:52,361 --> 00:40:54,480
(under Huiquan Corporation,)

762
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,480
(will be the acting chairman.)

763
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,720
(A press meeting will be held
at Rongdu Hotel at 8 PM.)

764
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,960
(The change of personnel
will be announced.)

765
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,240
Qian Tianxin and Zhao Jikai

766
00:41:08,281 --> 00:41:10,081
refused to tell us
where the dirty money went.

767
00:41:14,121 --> 00:41:15,041
I know where it went.

768
00:41:30,081 --> 00:41:31,480
Captain He. Xiao Mu'en is here.

769
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,041
Got it. Keep an eye on him.

770
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:33,881
Roger that.

771
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,240
We need to keep an eye on him.

772
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,200
Chairman. Nice to meet you.

773
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,601
May I go inside?

774
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,321
What are you doing here?

775
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,640
Are you here to mock me?

776
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,720
I'm no longer the chairman.

777
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,720
By the way, Chairman Xiao,

778
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:06,521
please forgive me

779
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:09,000
for not congratulating you
on your success yet.

780
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,960
According to the procedures,

781
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,440
are you guys going to announce

782
00:42:15,521 --> 00:42:17,321
the appointment of you
as the chairman tonight?

783
00:42:18,041 --> 00:42:19,041
I'm only the acting chairman.

784
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,841
Even so, you're a chairman.

785
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,240
I still need to work hard

786
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:25,281
before I can assume the post completely.

787
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:27,761
Xiao Mu'en, it's you again?

788
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,281
Are you not done yet?

789
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,601
We don't welcome you.

790
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,761
Get out!

791
00:42:33,601 --> 00:42:36,160
