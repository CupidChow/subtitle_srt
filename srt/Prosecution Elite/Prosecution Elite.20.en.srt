15
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,920
Thanks.

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't thank me just yet.

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,040
You can thank me
when Qian Tianxin is back in the country.

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
What do you mean?

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,600
With everything that Qian Tianxin did,

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,920
she'll be in jail forever.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
The extradition requirements were met.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,280
Why can't we bring her back?

23
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,080
Qian Tianxin is now
a citizen of Country F.

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,720
She broke the law of Country F

25
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,840
on the soil of Country F.

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,200
Country F has jurisdiction to try her.

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,880
China is only obligated to provide

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,200
evidence of her crimes.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
Country F will put her on trial.

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
Principle of non-extradition.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,120
Precisely.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,360
More importantly,
The chief procurator thinks the same.

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
I tried my best to convince him,

34
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
but we still lack
the key reason to do so.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,320
Unless...

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,280
Unless we can prove that

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
Qian Tianxin is not
a citizen of Country F.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,240
We don't have the power

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,080
to revoke her citizenship.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,040
By the way, I heard that

41
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,400
the prosecutor of Country F
is pressing charges

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,880
against Qian Tianxin.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,320
More importantly,
her husband from Country F,

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,760
Gomez, doesn't seem very eager

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,800
to bail her out.

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Furthermore,
he is cooperating with the prosecutors.

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,400
Of course, for people like him,

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,600
keeping Qian Tianxin in Country F

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,000
is better than letting you
take her back to China.

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,200
After all, the Chinese government

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,720
is cracking down on cybercrimes.

52
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,600
I thought the case could be closed

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,120
after we caught Qian Tianxin.

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,920
I didn't see this coming.

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,960
I think we must cover

56
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
two things at the same time.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,480
First off, we will continue

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
to extradite Qian Tianxin's accomplices

59
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,200
who are Chinese citizens.

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
We must help the police assess
their identity before extraditing them.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,800
Secondly,
we must ask for help from China.

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,040
We need to know more about

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Qian Tianxin's background and family.

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,280
I have a feeling that even though

65
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,720
Qian Tianxin is alone abroad,

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,720
she must have frequently contacted
her connections in China.

67
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,600
Yes.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,400
Cheers.

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,000
I owe you my thanks.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,760
Don't mention it.

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,520
Thanks.

72
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,480
Anything else to say?

73
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,880
Yang Wei.

74
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,080
You should cooperate
and confirm all the evidence.

75
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,840
It's better for you.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,480
Trying to scare me?

77
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Bring me in, if you can.

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,800
Yang Wei.

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,360
Listen closely.

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,000
We're taking you sooner or later.

81
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,560
We've checked.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,000
You're a citizen of China.

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,200
You are among the first batch
to be extradited back to China.

84
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,160
You can be tried anywhere.

85
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,040
Your fate is sealed.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,520
I don't care.

87
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
Sir, if you'll excuse me.

88
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,440
I'd like to take a break.

89
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,720
Did he confess?

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,520
No.

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,800
So where are you going?

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,680
The hospital.

93
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,800
What for?

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,720
You'll know soon enough.

95
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,460
(Huiquan Group)

96
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,560
Zhao.

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,720
You seem rather troubled lately,

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
as if you'd lost your soul.

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,400
What happened?

100
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Maybe it's just fatigue.

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,200
Is it because of the woman?

102
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
You saw right through me.

103
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,640
Li Yitang and I had a fight lately.

104
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,200
I see. Now is not the time to be
troubled by relationships.

105
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,960
Huiquan Corporation is currently

106
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,400
in a tough position,

107
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
especially with the public uproar.

108
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,880
For a company that is
expanding its business,

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,960
this is not very ideal.

110
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,720
Yes.

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
As of now, some investors have decided

112
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,360
to wait and observe.

113
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,200
But I think we shouldn't
be too concerned.

114
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,280
There is a huge sum that
will soon come in from abroad.

115
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
If they come into the country,

116
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,000
the company can expand

117
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,400
without any problem.

118
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
Yes.

119
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,720
Zhao.

120
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,680
Lately,
I've been getting this strange feeling

121
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,480
that someone is secretly
pulling the strings

122
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,480
and controlling the entire
Huiquan Corporation.

123
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,080
Because of that,
I can't eat or sleep well.

124
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,560
I even have this hunch

125
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,120
that everything that happened recently
is not a coincidence.

126
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,520
Zhao. Do you feel the same way?

127
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,560
Chairman. You worry too much.

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
I believe everyone

129
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,040
who works for Huiquan Corporation is

130
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,760
loyal to the company.

131
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,000
We've run into some setbacks,

132
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,200
but as a company

133
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,760
that is growing and expanding,

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
this obstacle is necessary.

135
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,720
If we make it through,

136
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,880
I believe everything will be better.

137
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,280
You are right.

138
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,880
Zhao. What do you think

139
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,000
about Xiao Mu'en?

140
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
Which aspect do you mean?

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,920
I...

142
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,760
I plan to cultivate Xiao Mu'en's talent.

143
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,120
I want him to contribute to the company.

144
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,800
I've observed him for quite some time.

145
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,960
He is practical, reliable, and shows

146
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,120
this determination that
I used to have when I was young.

147
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,840
These are the qualities
Huiquan Corporation needs.

148
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,360
If you have the time,
give it some thought.

149
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
See if there is a better way

150
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,720
to hone his capabilities.

151
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
What do you think?

152
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,400
You're the chairman.
I believe in your insight.

153
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,800
I'll consider it.

154
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,480
Good. Enjoy the tea.

155
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,880
The tea is nice.

156
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,240
A friend sent it here.

157
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,560
Please have a look at this.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,960
Yang Wei. Do you remember me?

159
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm here again.

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,520
Do you still remember this face?

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,520
Have you forgotten?

162
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,480
I got this from you.

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,400
There was only one thing on my mind!

164
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,600
I'll make you suffer

165
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
the way you made me suffer!

166
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,960
Turn it off. I don't want to see this.

167
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,320
Zhang Xiaobei has told us
everything about

168
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,600
everything you did to him

169
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,840
and what you did to
the other workers.

170
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
The local police verified

171
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,360
the victim whom you crippled

172
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,000
and tossed into the sea
as fourth-degree disabled.

173
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,000
Inflicting injuries or crippling

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,720
through the means of cruelty or violence

175
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,600
will warrant imprisonment
of ten years or above

176
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,480
according to the law of the PRC.

177
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
It could also be a life sentence
or a death sentence.

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,120
We've interrogated the workers
of your syndicate.

179
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
They identified you
as Qian Tianxin's right-hand man.

180
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,080
You know everything
about her illicit conduct.

181
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
That charge alone is severe enough.

182
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,400
If we find out you're involved in

183
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,200
Qian Tianxin's online scamming ring

184
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,040
or online gambling business,

185
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
That means concurrent sentences.

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
The punishment will be very severe.

187
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,040
Yang Wei.

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,720
Are you sure you still
want to help Qian Tianxin evade the law?

189
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,360
It's not fair. This is not fair.

190
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,160
Gambling is legal in that country.

191
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,480
I never forced them to gamble
or play the games.

192
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,240
They tossed their own money

193
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,360
down the drain.

194
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,840
They went to the loan sharks to
pay their debts.

195
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
It has nothing to do with me.

196
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,360
(They tossed their own money
down the drain.)

197
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
(They went to the loan sharks
to pay their debts.)

198
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
(It has nothing to do with me.)

199
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Hey! Why did you smash my laptop?

200
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,360
Tell me where this scoundrel is!

201
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,480
I'll kill him!

202
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,360
What got into you this time?

203
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,160
What got into me?

204
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,200
Shi Xiaohu is dead because of him!

205
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
- I'm his victim too!
- What's wrong?

206
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,160
I just showed him Yang Wei's video,

207
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,080
- and he became like this.
- They wanted to force me

208
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
to hurt even more people!

209
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,280
Tell me where he is now!

210
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
I want to kill this guy!

211
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,680
Stop it! Zhang Xiaobei!

212
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,960
Are you done yet?

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
Can you calm down now?

214
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,720
How long have you behaved this way?

215
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,400
After your sister died,

216
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,640
you jumped into a river,

217
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,280
started a live stream, and came here.

218
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
You finally got out,

219
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,800
why did you jump back into that mess?

220
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,280
Everyone here and the local police

221
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,320
went to rescue you
before we had the time

222
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,120
without any preparation.

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,280
Are you happy now?

224
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,280
You got what you want!

225
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
I didn't.

226
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,120
Yes. You're right.

227
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,160
Have you thought about us?

228
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,200
You're not getting away

229
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,120
after what you did.

230
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,440
All of us are filled with anger right now.

231
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,000
We thought we should save the talk

232
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,920
until we're back in China

233
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,400
because you were still recovering.

234
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,560
But you?

235
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,120
You always talk about killing people.

236
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,720
Have you thought about your sister?

237
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,280
I still have files on this laptop.

238
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,960
Can you please make some changes?

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,200
You've never changed.

240
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,320
Not even a bit!

241
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,480
I'm still the same!

242
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,880
You are right!

243
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,760
People are dead because of me!

244
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,080
So listen closely,
Shi Xiaohu is dead because of me!

245
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,200
I've never seen her get so upset before.

246
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,560
I want you to tell me the whole truth.

247
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,800
If you want to confess,

248
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,360
I want the truth.

249
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,340
(Two Years Ago)

250
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,480
Start a machine for me.

251
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,880
Why are you here again?

252
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,400
You haven't paid me back
for the last time.

253
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,480
Cover for me, will you?

254
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,760
I'll pay in a few days.

255
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,000
I can't do that, sir.

256
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
Why are you here again?

257
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,600
You didn't pay up last time.

258
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,760
Get lost unless you pay up.

259
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,200
I'm not leaving.

260
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Can't I watch the other play?

261
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,400
Back off.

262
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,600
Young man. What is it, sir?

263
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,160
Nothing. I don't like you.

264
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,800
I can tell you are a newbie
by the way you play.

265
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,960
Look at the mess you got yourself into.

266
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,640
You don't buy any gear
you're still losing.

267
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,000
Back up.

268
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,160
I'll show you how to play.

269
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,920
(That was how Shi Xiaohu and I met
at the internet cafe.)

270
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
(He was a good kid.)

271
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,280
(He was a freshman
at the university nearby.)

272
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,920
(He didn't know how to play
or socialize.)

273
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,600
(I swindled him so easily.)

274
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,720
(He followed me everywhere)

275
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,040
(and helped me grind for the loots.)

276
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,600
(He was my free labor.)

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,920
(I really did see him as my sidekick,)

278
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,160
(in the game and in real life.)

279
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,160
Xiaohu. Take this.

280
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
That's a lot of money.

281
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,160
It must be at least 10,000 yuan.

282
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,240
It's more than that. Take it.

283
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Bei. Can I really take the money?

284
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,480
Of course it's yours.

285
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,360
Just take the money.

286
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
What's wrong? Too stunned?

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
Show some gratitude.

288
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,840
I went through a lot of trouble

289
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,040
to get you a loan of 14,000 yuan.

290
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,440
With the money,

291
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,520
you can get some decent gear.

292
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,440
The whole streets will bow before you.

293
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
It's nice to buy new gear.

294
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,000
But I have to return the money somehow.

295
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,720
If I don't pay up...

296
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,680
Fine. You're worthless.

297
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,560
You annoy me with your whining.

298
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,000
What is the loan for?

299
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,960
We take a loan to have more fun.

300
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,000
You haven't had any fun.

301
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
Why worry about paying up?

302
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,240
Don't let the money go to waste.

303
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,320
That kind of makes sense.

304
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,640
You only live once.

305
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,440
Besides,
so many young people nowadays

306
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,720
are overconsuming.

307
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,760
Only the present matters.
Who cares about tomorrow?

308
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,240
What if you are dead tomorrow?

309
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
Stop worrying so much.

310
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,440
take it and have some fun.

311
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,440
Trust me on this.

312
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,120
What is taking so long?

313
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,000
I've been waiting for you.

314
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,480
Why are you staring at me?

315
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,640
It's only been two months.

316
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,640
Don't you recognize your own mother?

317
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,640
Don't you remember me?

318
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,120
Here. I made some dumplings.

319
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,520
Take them.

320
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,520
And...

321
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,200
I brought you some clothes.

322
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,080
It's getting cold.
You should wear thicker clothes.

323
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,360
Stay warm.

324
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,400
Your hand! What's happened?

325
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,640
Your hand is so cold.

326
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,360
It's all dried up.

327
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,520
What do you eat at school?

328
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm going back to class.

329
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,600
Take care of yourself!

330
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Study hard.

331
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,160
Mom. Sorry.

332
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,640
Thank you.

333
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,720
And then, there was
the case with Yang Bao.

334
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,920
He could tell you needed money.

335
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
So, he made you his recruit.

336
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,080
Shi Xiaohu was one of the clients.

337
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,120
Yes.

338
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,720
Shi Xiaohu was my first recruit.

339
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,400
He was the most honest.

340
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,080
He was too naive.

341
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,920
He's too dense for his own good.

342
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,680
At first,
he wasn't that interested in the game.

343
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,920
But ever since he
started playing with real money,

344
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,480
he became better at the game.

345
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
He gained more followers.

346
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,200
The amount he spent started to snowball.

347
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,840
(In the end,
the damage couldn't be undone.)

348
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,520
(I tried to talk him out of it.)

349
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,920
(But I was too late.)

350
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,280
(At first,
he managed to put together some money)

351
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,000
(via some loaning websites)

352
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,520
(to cover for some debts.)

353
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,080
(But in the end,)

354
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
(he had nowhere to get any money.)

355
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,800
(The friends on his contact list)

356
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,000
(were harassed 24 hours rounds.)

357
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,800
(The debt collectors)

358
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,080
(even went to his school.)

359
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,720
(There was nothing he could do.)

360
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,520
(And in the end,)

361
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,880
(there was only one way out.)

362
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,040
Someone jumped off the building!
Call the ambulance!

363
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,120
So that was why you did what he did.

364
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,680
You tried to take your life
to avoid the debt collectors.

365
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
It was more than that.

366
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,760
I wanted to use my death

367
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,000
to get back at Huiquan.

368
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
I don't know the law.

369
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,600
But something is clear.

370
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,800
Huiquan Corporation

371
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,200
must be held accountable for
Shi Xiaohu's suicide.

372
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,000
First, why didn't Huiquan Games

373
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,920
limit the amount of time and money

374
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,840
a university student
can spend on the games?

375
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,560
They designed the game mechanics

376
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,160
to lure those students
into spending more money.

377
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,720
Secondly,
whether or not Shi Xiaohu's death

378
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,200
was related to Huiquan Games or not,

379
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,000
Huiquan shouldn't oppress
the customers with their power.

380
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
When people post a comment online,

381
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,800
they manipulate public opinions
and sway the people.

382
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,840
If they weren't afraid because of guilt,

383
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,720
would the situation have become this bad?

384
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,360
And finally,
Shi Xiaohu was a fringe case.

385
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,200
He was the special exception.

386
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,320
Had he not been exposed to
illegal online loan sharks

387
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,840
through the game,

388
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,080
he wouldn't have been
knee-deep in debt

389
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,720
and made his condition worse,
which led to his suicide.

390
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,200
Huiquan has some questionable conduct.

391
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,960
We are all aware of that.

392
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,040
But you shouldn't link your misconduct

393
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,160
of getting into illegal online loans
and recruiting people into the scheme

394
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,960
with Huiquan's business.

395
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,840
I'm telling the truth.

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,120
Something is definitely wrong
with Huiquan Corporation.

397
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,120
We will find the truth
after the investigation.

398
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,900
Carry on.

399
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,320
After I made up my mind,

400
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,360
I started preparing.

401
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,920
(To make everyone think that I was dead,)

402
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,760
(I have things
painstakingly plotted out.)

403
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,840
(First, I picked a location.)

404
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,400
(I found the spot a month prior.)

405
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,040
(I noticed that the riverside
was dotted with cameras)

406
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,160
(with certain distances in between.)

407
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,640
(Each camera could cover)

408
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,520
(around 50 meters
of the river's surface.)

409
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,840
That was how I evaded the cameras

410
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
and went downstream.

411
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,960
No one noticed me.

412
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,000
That was impressive.

413
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,800
You plotted an escape route.

414
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,320
My precision was a bit off.

415
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,720
But I have a special skill.

416
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,720
I can count seconds with high precision.

417
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,960
(I ran many tests.
It'd take me 45 seconds)

418
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,560
(to swim 50 meters underwater.)

419
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,000
(So, I rose to the surface
every 45 seconds to breathe.)

420
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,720
(I managed to evade all the cameras)

421
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,000
(and made it downstream.)

422
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,440
If He Luyuan knew you fooled us all

423
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,600
simply by swimming underwater,
he'd be steaming.

424
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,960
I have another question.

425
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,720
What was the deal with
Zhang Xiaoguang's ID card?

426
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,800
Why was it on a corpse?

427
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,400
I didn't want to do it.

428
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,920
I am Zhang Xiaoguang.

429
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,000
I used that ID for
some mischievous conducts.

430
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,520
(During those days,
they didn't know my real name.)

431
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,400
(They only knew me as Zhang Xiaoguang.)

432
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,720
(As of now, the Public Security Bureau
and our specialists)

433
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,640
(have begun the salvage operation.)

434
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,200
(They've found nothing so far.)

435
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,880
(Right behind me is the spot
where Zhang Xiaobei fell into the water.)

436
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,920
(Captain He.)

437
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,280
(Why did you jump into the water?)

438
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,320
(What were you doing?)

439
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,520
(The ensuing events were way beyond)

440
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,760
(my expectation.)

441
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,120
(I couldn't continue the plan.)

442
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,240
(The only way left was skipping town.)

443
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,760
(I was worried you might track me down,)

444
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,920
(so I gave my fake ID and my phone)

445
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,480
(to the homeless person.)

446
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,680
(I used him to confuse
the police's search.)

447
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
It's free. Do you want it?

448
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,400
Take it.

449
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,640
(But I didn't know he'd get killed.)

450
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
There are more things you didn't expect.

451
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,600
I guess you got swindled
after you went on shore.

452
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,000
That was how you got here.

453
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,680
An Ni. Now I know

454
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,600
how despicable and terrifying

455
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,520
these people are.

456
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,400
You will bring Qian Tianxin

457
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,320
back to China for a trial, right?

458
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,440
Whoever hurt your sister,

459
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,680
all of us here will bring

460
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,920
the culprit to justice.

461
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,600
Prosecutor Guo.

462
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,440
She didn't pick up?

463
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,800
Hold the line. I'll get her.

464
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,040
Prosecutor Guo called.

465
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,760
Prosecutor Guo.

466
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,240
Any update on the investigation?

467
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,000
Qian Tianxin used many aliases
in the early years

468
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,800
to travel to Hong Kong, China
Macau, China and the Mainland.

469
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,040
The investigation took some time.

470
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,400
But the Public Security Bureau

471
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,600
has tracked her down.

472
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,640
She was one of the escaped fugitives

473
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,520
from a loan shark related case
in Macau, China years ago.

474
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,960
She's been involved

475
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,280
in related activities ever since.

476
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
It's clear that she committed
numerous crimes.

477
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
We also have the evidence.

478
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,640
More charges won't change
a thing for her.

479
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,200
More importantly,
we found something big.

480
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,240
Qian Tianxin might
have gotten married in China.

481
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
The marriage is still ongoing.

482
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,680
You know what that means.

483
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,520
Sure. I get it.

484
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,640
Look.

485
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,360
We'll contact Mr. Raphael for help.

486
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,640
I'm glad you understand.

487
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,920
We must get ahead of them this time.

488
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,520
Block off all possible
escape routes for her.

489
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,360
Don't give her any chance to slip away.

490
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,400
We must get her extradited
for real this time.

491
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't worry.

492
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,840
I have everything arranged.

493
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,120
The prosecutors of Country F

494
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,720
will press charges against
Qian Tianxin very soon.

495
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,760
If they press charges before China does,

496
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,560
we can keep Qian Tianxin

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,520
in the Country F for her trial

498
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,760
with absolute certainty.

499
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,240
Yes. It's all part of the job.

500
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,680
We are willing to serve you, Mr. A.

501
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,440
Master. We got our hands full with work.

502
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,000
There's no time for books.

503
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,040
Don't disturb her.

504
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,280
Prosecutor Guo says her book is the key

505
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,680
to extraditing Qian Tianxin back to China.

506
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,680
Get up.

507
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,840
The prosecutor is here to see you.

508
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,360
Mrs. Gomez. You say this is about
something important.

509
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,280
I hope you're not lying.

510
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,480
I heard I'd be extradited to China.

511
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,360
Is that right?

512
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,800
Yes, correct.

513
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,200
If I go there,

514
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,200
I might never come back again.

515
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,160
I've been thinking.

516
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,320
I let my husband down the most.

517
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,040
Mr. Gomez truly loves me

518
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,240
and cherishes me.

519
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,160
But I lied to him.

520
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,080
If I end up dying,
I'll be sent to hell for sure.

521
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
I can never forgive myself.

522
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,680
I don't want him to see

523
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,240
this horrible side of me,

524
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,880
but I don't want to
let his trust be in vain.

525
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,320
What should I do?

526
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,040
What should I do?

527
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,280
What can I do now?

528
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,200
What should I do?

529
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,880
Mrs. Gomez. We don't have much time.

530
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,400
What is it that you want?

531
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,800
I...

532
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,520
I want to confess my crimes.

533
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,640
I don't want to disappoint my husband.

534
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,680
Actually,
I committed the crime of bigamy.

535
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:17,920
Mrs. Gomez.

536
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
I think you're lying
so you wouldn't get extradited.

537
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,280
When you came to
Country F five years ago,

538
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,600
you married Mr. Gomez soon after.

539
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,320
You were never married again.

540
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,440
We can get the records
in the Immigration Department.

541
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,400
I'm not lying to you.

542
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,720
I have a husband in China.

543
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
He lives in Guangzhou City of Guangdong.

544
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,720
He's a tycoon.

545
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,080
His name is Liu Yi.

546
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,680
Are you telling the truth?

547
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,760
Of course I am.

548
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,680
Liu Yi and I had
a clear record of marriage.

549
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,600
You can look it up.

550
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,520
Jikai,
what did you go through in the past?

551
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Why haven't you told me
about your childhood?

552
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,400
You want to know more about the scar.

553
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,000
It was a long time ago.

554
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,480
What about it?

555
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,400
What's wrong with you today?

556
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,000
Why do you even ask
about the distant past?

557
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm just curious.

558
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,640
Alright.

559
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
I finished the workout.

560
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
I'm taking a shower.

561
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,120
Let go!

562
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:50,800
Stand up.

563
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,920
Let go of me!

564
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,200
Let go of me!

565
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,040
You worthless fool.

566
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,640
Your job is to mind the place.

567
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,080
Stay out of my personal matters.

568
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,320
Listen.

569
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,840
I can sleep with whoever I want.

570
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,080
Let go of me!

571
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,840
She doesn't like you very much.

572
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,960
Is that so?

573
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:12,880
Come on.

574
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,360
Look at him.

575
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,800
Look at his sorry face.

576
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,640
You are broke and ugly.

577
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,560
Why not pick me instead?

578
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
Can't you see I'm better?

579
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,920
You're asking for it!

580
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,880
I want him crippled.

581
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,240
However, make sure he lives.

582
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,880
I want him to watch.

583
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,120
Stand back!

584
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,680
Stand back!

585
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,960
Buddy.

586
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,360
Calm down.

587
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,560
Let's sit down and talk it over.

588
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,320
Okay?

589
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,240
Stand back!

590
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,160
Listen. She is a beautiful woman.

591
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
You shouldn't have hurt her.

592
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,120
Stop right there!

593
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,160
You really are a fool.

594
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,320
Look at you.

595
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,160
You're a young man
who came to be a bouncer

596
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,440
to make some meager money.

597
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,960
Why must you offend the rich guys?

598
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,440
What's the big deal with them?

599
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,080
They are either taking from their dads

600
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,400
or favored by fate.

601
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,960
The world isn't fair to all.

602
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,440
You said it as if
the world was once fair to all.

603
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,760
What's the plan now?

604
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,040
So, you're all talk and no show.

605
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
Hey, I can do more than just talk.

606
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,760
Listen.

607
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,120
Soon enough, I'll be loaded with money.

608
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Come with me.

609
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,520
I guarantee you will...

610
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:16,960
A man shouldn't bluff
until he's delivered actual results.

611
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,760
Do not make a promise

612
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,440
that even you don't believe
can be fulfilled.

613
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,440
It's disgusting.

614
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,640
Therefore, you are a fool.

615
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Do you really think
I didn't want to marry

616
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,960
the Guangdong tycoon?

617
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,600
We didn't settle on a price.

618
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,840
What a fool.

619
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,920
In this world we live in,

620
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,480
only wealth matters.

621
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,760
Without it, you will always be

622
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,400
a mutt despised by everyone.

623
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,760
Why should I leave with you?

624
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,120
Do you want me to a mutt just like you?

625
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,240
I dare you to say that again!

626
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,360
Rather than asking me to follow you,

627
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,040
why not follow me instead?

628
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,480
I'll let you in on it.

629
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,080
I came to Macau, China
to live off a moneybag.

630
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,520
I have a plan.

631
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,120
I want to marry a rich guy.

632
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:35,000
I'll get as much from them as I can.

633
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,760
Then,
I'll ditch them for the next rich guy.

634
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,960
As for you...

635
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,800
Would you like to be my sidekick?

636
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,440
If anything happens to me,

637
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,640
do as you did yesterday. Protect me.

638
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,240
I will never be anyone's sidekick.

639
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,720
You're not interested?

640
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,320
Alright.

641
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,200
Would you be my little brother instead?

642
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,440
Be my brother and
you get to protect your sister.

643
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,080
Be my brother,
and your hard work will be rewarded.

644
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,400
What say you?

645
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,200
Would you consider it?

646
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,400
Based on what we know,

647
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,120
Qian Tianxin was married in China
more than once.

648
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
She changed her name numerous times.

649
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,560
She ran a business
similar to a badger game.

650
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,560
After her business grew large enough,

651
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,640
she developed it into a loan fraud.

652
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,680
And now, she is a philanthropist

653
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,920
and a successful businesswoman.

654
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,920
Qian Tianxin committed marriage frauds.

655
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
She had a husband in China

656
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,800
but came here to get married again.

657
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,880
But how does it concern her extradition?

658
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,200
It's very important.

659
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,920
I got this information from Raphael.

660
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,000
Bigamy?

661
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,240
Master.

662
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,560
As a local citizen, Qian Tianxin

663
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,720
committed the crime there,

664
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,080
hence should be tried there.

665
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,880
We have no authority to extradite her.

666
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,080
Han Xuan. How is the research going?

667
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,000
I got it, Ni.

668
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,840
Qian Tianxin's most recent
marriage in China

669
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,640
was with a man named Liu Yi.

670
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,000
Even now, they are still legally married.

671
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,320
When she married Gomez in Country F,

672
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
she was already married.

673
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,920
This minor charge is enough to keep
her here for the trial.

674
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,960
They really plotted it all out.

675
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,520
Wouldn't the green card she got
with the fake marriage be revoked?

676
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,000
According to local law, a void marriage

677
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,200
won't get the citizenship revoked.

678
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,000
The citizenship will only be void

679
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,760
if it's acquired by means of deception.

680
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,360
That won't work.

681
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,200
She will be kept here.

682
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,400
She will use any means to
get away unscathed.

683
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,120
Given her influence here,
she might get released in the end.

684
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:15,640
Yes.

685
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,640
This method is very unscrupulous,

686
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,600
but she has us stalled. She is smart.

687
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,640
Can we make allegations
during her trial in Country F?

688
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,560
According to Treaty on Mutual
Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters,

689
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,400
Article 1, the legal assistance

690
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,840
should be testified by
personnel of convenience.

691
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,320
But, we can't attend as prosecutors.

692
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,240
We can only request
to testify as a witness.

693
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,480
So, if we can get evidence of her

694
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,960
not committing the crime of bigamy,

695
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,400
will it be easier to extradite her?

696
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,480
There are some complications.

697
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,080
The judiciary of Country F and China

698
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,520
have reached an agreement.

699
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
They are coming for Qian Tianxin.

700
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,520
This time, it won't be easy to get away.

701
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:09,840
So?

702
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,200
Can you figure something out to
make things more complicated?

703
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,760
If I remember correctly,

704
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,400
we still have other contingency plans.

705
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
Of course, I've seen to it.

706
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,640
However, even if we pull this off,

707
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,160
something unexpected might
still undermine us.

708
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,440
As you saw, the prosecutor from China

709
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
means business.

710
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,800
Her higher-ups and team
are taking this seriously.

711
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,400
If any problem arises...

712
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,120
In that case, Qian Tianxin

713
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,080
will know what must be done.

714
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,200
She saw this coming long ago.

715
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,520
You need not be concerned about it.

716
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,600
Your job is to do whatever you can

717
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,720
to make the situation complicated

718
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,760
and keep her in Country F.

719
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,880
Who is it?

720
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,520
House keeping.

721
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,560
Why did you come at this late hour?

722
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,320
The trial is about to start,

723
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,000
but I've prepared nothing.

724
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,640
I brought supper because I knew

725
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,200
you'd still be working.

726
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,600
You're not a machine.

727
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,640
But even a machine needs power.

728
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,840
Right? Get some food

729
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,120
and replenish your strength.

730
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,000
Put that aside.

731
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,120
How is the search for clues?

732
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,120
No progress.

733
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,920
She had five marriages,
but she divorced.

734
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,880
Everything was legal,
there was nothing unusual.

735
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,240
Qian Tianxin didn't divorce Liu Yi

736
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,080
before coming here
because he was a backup plan.

737
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,880
Qian Tianxin actually turned her marriage
into a business deal.

738
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,920
Indeed. Marriage should be sacred.

739
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,880
One should marry the one they love.

740
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,840
Yeah. People only get married because

741
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,440
they like each other.

742
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,680
If I ever want to get married,

743
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,480
it has to be someone I love.

744
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Me too.

745
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,200
If I ever get married,
it's because I love her.

746
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,040
I asked my colleagues in
China to search for Liu Yi.

747
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,040
He's missing and hiding somewhere.

748
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,320
I'm concerned that
a written record of her marriage

749
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,920
won't be enough at all.

750
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,680
We didn't get any results,

751
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,040
so I didn't tell you.

752
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,680
The head of the Household
Registration Office in Liu Yi's area

753
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,880
is my friend from the university.

754
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,840
I asked him to help with the search.

755
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,800
However, there are a lot of people
there called "Liu Yi."

756
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,280
So, it will take some time.

757
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Stop sighing.

758
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
Eat up.

759
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,120
Try it.

760
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
How does it taste?

761
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,000
I grilled it myself.

762
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,720
Don't you have work to finish?

763
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,880
Is it me or is the skewer salty?

764
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,840
You both are.

765
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,680
That must be really salty.

766
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,640
Still edible. Not bad.

767
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,440
Today, we convene the court hearing

768
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,080
on Mrs. Gomez's charge of bigamy.

769
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,800
The purpose of this trial is

770
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,640
for the prosecution to summon
Chinese witnesses to testify in court.

771
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,040
Evidence will now be presented in court.

772
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,520
The prosecution
will present evidence first.

773
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,800
Mrs. Gomez confessed to the prosecution

774
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,360
that she committed the crime of bigamy.

775
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,040
She had a previous marriage in China

776
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,080
that is legally ongoing.

777
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,240
After coming to Country F,

778
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,520
in order to obtain Country F's
citizenship as quickly as possible,

779
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,720
she married Mr. Gomez.

780
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,040
Feeling guilty for deceiving

781
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,400
her loyal and loving husband, Mr. Gomez,

782
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,240
for personal gain,

783
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,640
she is deeply sorry about her actions.

784
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,360
Therefore, she chose to
surrender and plead guilty,

785
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,360
and is willing to accept
the punishments of Country F.

786
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,320
Prosecution, do you have any evidence
for these allegations?

787
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,760
I have the evidence
provided by Mrs. Gomez.

788
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,480
The evidence is the original documentation
of her marriage with

789
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,720
her Chinese husband, Liu Yi.
