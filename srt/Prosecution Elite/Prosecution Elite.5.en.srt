15
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:46,231
Have you seen Xiaobei
before that incident?

16
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,392
Before Bei's accident,

17
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:52,712
we met once.

18
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:01,751
Here.

19
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,831
Bei, why did you choose to meet here?

20
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:08,152
Stop talking nonsense.
No one followed you here, right?

21
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:08,751
No.

22
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:10,471
Don't worry. I made a few detours.

23
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,712
- Okay.
- Where have you been hiding recently?

24
00:02:12,912 --> 00:02:13,751
I knocked on your door

25
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:15,432
but someone was in the way.

26
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,751
Fortunately, your father has no idea about it.

27
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:19,152
Otherwise...

28
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:22,432
I moved last minute.

29
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:23,792
It isn't far from here.

30
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,232
I'll tell you the address later.

31
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:26,072
Keep it a secret.

32
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:27,831
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

33
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,152
Why did you ask me out?

34
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:31,551
No one listens to me.

35
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:33,072
I wanted to see you

36
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:34,751
and listen to your voice, Danan.

37
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:37,512
You are acting weirdly.

38
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:38,951
Did you fight with your father?

39
00:02:39,471 --> 00:02:40,272
Danan,

40
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:42,792
you know how cruel those people can be.

41
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:44,872
I've never asked you for anything.

42
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:46,471
When I'm not around,

43
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,072
please often visit
my family on my behalf.

44
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,551
Especially my sister.

45
00:02:49,912 --> 00:02:51,232
Don't let her get too lonely.

46
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:52,912
Don't scare me, Bei.

47
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:55,072
Why does it seem like
you're saying your last words?

48
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,992
Won't you take care of your father?

49
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,551
Don't be a coward.

50
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:00,352
He doesn't need me. He won't die.

51
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:09,792
When will we depart?

52
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
(This message is successfully sent
but rejected by the receiver.)

53
00:03:14,872 --> 00:03:15,751
Who is it?

54
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:17,591
I got blocked?

55
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:19,232
Your new girlfriend?

56
00:03:20,551 --> 00:03:22,751
Did you remember what I told you?

57
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,152
Don't worry. I won't forget it.

58
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:27,751
I saw in the news
that he jumped into the river.

59
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:29,792
I went to his house a few days ago

60
00:03:30,111 --> 00:03:30,912
and realised

61
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:33,591
he wasn't joking with me.

62
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,191
Well,

63
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:40,951
what if those people

64
00:03:40,992 --> 00:03:42,551
come to look for me again?

65
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:43,831
They won't.

66
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,951
Why?

67
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:46,352
There are a total of

68
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:47,632
11 surveillance cameras in that area.

69
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:48,792
Captain He

70
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:50,352
will be calling
that area's police station later.

71
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:51,471
They won't be able to escape.

72
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:56,712
Danan,

73
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,191
do you know why I'd sometimes

74
00:03:58,232 --> 00:03:59,152
help you and Xiaobei?

75
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,992
You both

76
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:03,792
might sometimes

77
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:06,111
go a bit too far,
but you're not bad people.

78
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:08,792
How could Xiaobei do

79
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,951
this, though?

80
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:12,712
A few dozens police officers
worked hard these few days,

81
00:04:12,792 --> 00:04:14,912
but we still don't know
if he's dead or alive.

82
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:17,311
You must protect yourself.

83
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:19,431
I promise.

84
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:20,632
I promise

85
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:22,191
I will be safe and sound

86
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:23,632
instead of embarrassing you.

87
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:25,552
Okay. You can go back now.

88
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,232
I'll leave now.

89
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:28,792
Okay.

90
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:30,751
If there are any updates about Xiaobei,

91
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:32,232
let me know.

92
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:33,952
Okay. Go.

93
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:36,191
Hey, wait a minute.

94
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:43,792
Thank you.

95
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:44,912
Spend it slowly.

96
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:46,792
This is for the meal!

97
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:48,031
Okay.

98
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,591
Here you go.

99
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:58,392
Thank you.

100
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:02,431
Why are these young people
leading muddled lives?

101
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,952
Among the prosecutors,

102
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,112
you're considered top notch.

103
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:12,031
But do you know
there's a lesson you lack?

104
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:17,191
Say it. I'm waiting for you to say it.

105
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,072
Life.

106
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,112
Coming from a life full of passion

107
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,552
and heading into the intense reality.

108
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,912
As a police officer,

109
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:30,072
I got dispatched
to the local police station twice.

110
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:33,751
People like us
who are used to being in the office

111
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,751
think we know a lot about life,

112
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,711
but there, I discovered

113
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:40,271
life wasn't as simple as we imagined.

114
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:43,031
That makes sense.

115
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:44,031
Indeed,

116
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:46,191
those in our industry
have to be down to earth.

117
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:47,832
What does down to earth mean?

118
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:49,912
It means the trivial matters

119
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:51,352
of the people.

120
00:05:53,232 --> 00:05:54,271
Elaborate

121
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:55,952
how you come from a life full of passion

122
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:57,431
and enter the intense reality.

123
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,591
I'm really sleepy.

124
00:06:03,191 --> 00:06:03,912
Another day.

125
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,112
I gain my experience

126
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,471
over time.

127
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:08,232
They

128
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:09,392
cost me a lot.

129
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:11,431
You need to buy me an expensive meal,

130
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:12,431
like hotpot.

131
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:14,471
If you treat me to hotpot one day,
I'll tell you my story.

132
00:06:14,552 --> 00:06:15,112
Why, you are

133
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:16,711
quite insatiable, huh?

134
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,232
What are you doing tomorrow?

135
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,952
Tomorrow? Your matter.

136
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:23,512
My matter?

137
00:06:23,632 --> 00:06:26,232
I need to prepare well
for Zhu Xin's case.

138
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,591
Their lawyer is well-prepared.

139
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:30,832
What else?

140
00:06:31,512 --> 00:06:33,471
Also, Li Quan's matter.

141
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,471
It should've worked.

142
00:06:35,632 --> 00:06:37,431
He requested to meet me today,

143
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:39,672
but I'm planning on
ignoring him for now.

144
00:06:39,751 --> 00:06:41,191
Tomorrow, I'll head to prison

145
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,991
to question his accomplices...

146
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,072
Then you'll spread the news

147
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:47,352
so he'll panic.

148
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,232
What about you?

149
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,191
Are you going to look for Luo Xiaoting,

150
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,392
Mr. Zhang, or Zhan Mei?

151
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,232
You're getting to know me now.

152
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:01,151
Yes, we're getting to
know each other now.

153
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,711
I'll take my leave now.

154
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:04,232
Be careful!

155
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:19,072
Captain He,

156
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:22,232
I don't know anyone named Zhang Xiaobei.

157
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:23,952
No one with that name came to me!

158
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:25,871
Think carefully.

159
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,552
Did any stranger pay you a visit?

160
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:29,072
Stranger?

161
00:07:29,352 --> 00:07:30,311
No.

162
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:31,352
Oh,

163
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:34,832
someone named
Zhang Xiaoguang came a few days ago.

164
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,311
I didn't even see him.

165
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:38,072
He left a letter on the ground.

166
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:39,352
Let me show you.

167
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:42,751
Here.

168
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,912
There is a letter

169
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,632
and some money inside.

170
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,151
It's him.

171
00:07:57,072 --> 00:07:57,952
Who?

172
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:40,631
Prosecutor Guo, you asked for me?

173
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:42,432
Come in.

174
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:54,432
Prosecutor Guo.

175
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,432
Well,

176
00:09:00,752 --> 00:09:02,071
recently,

177
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:04,631
Zhang Xiaobei's matter
has caused an uproar.

178
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:06,631
That got me thinking.

179
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:10,752
Since Zhang Xiaobei's matter
was publicised through online tools

180
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:14,031
such as live streams and short videos,

181
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:18,432
can we utilise the Internet

182
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,031
to educate the public about laws

183
00:09:21,912 --> 00:09:24,831
and increase their awareness of law?

184
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:28,552
What do you mean by that?

185
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:30,112
I was thinking

186
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,792
that we can

187
00:09:31,992 --> 00:09:33,271
set up an account

188
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:37,672
and publish short videos
to educate the people about the law.

189
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:39,872
Whenever it is suitable, we can also

190
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:42,471
do law-related live streams

191
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,831
to answer the people's questions online.

192
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,471
After looking into it,

193
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,471
the procuratorial committee decided
to assign you to the task.

194
00:09:52,112 --> 00:09:53,951
You'll be handling
the first live stream today.

195
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:55,831
Me?

196
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:56,912
Yes.

197
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,271
You.

198
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:01,951
Of course,

199
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:04,232
you can't blow off your own work.

200
00:10:04,432 --> 00:10:06,631
It's best to do that
during your free time.

201
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:10,071
About the account,

202
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,672
the publicity division
has already registered it.

203
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:13,312
You can get it from them later.

204
00:10:14,471 --> 00:10:14,951
Got it.

205
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:15,951
Here.

206
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,391
Try live streaming for one hour today.

207
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:19,391
Take a look at this.

208
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,711
Captain He, An Ni told me about it.

209
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:25,711
I'll be honest with you.

210
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:27,511
Zhang Xiaobei has indeed
sent me a private message.

211
00:10:28,112 --> 00:10:29,552
Why would he do that?

212
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,031
He made it clear in his private message.

213
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,631
Previously, I spoke out
for Shi Xiaohu,

214
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,232
so he had complete trust in me.

215
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:37,631
He hoped I could help him.

216
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,511
I'm a popular influencer, after all.

217
00:10:40,631 --> 00:10:42,271
Is there any news about Zhang Xiaobei?

218
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:44,352
Not until now.

219
00:10:46,752 --> 00:10:47,672
I'll pray for him.

220
00:10:48,312 --> 00:10:50,552
I could sense that he was a kind person.

221
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:53,071
I don't think
he would end his life easily.

222
00:10:54,912 --> 00:10:55,831
Thank you.

223
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,112
By the way, Xiaoting,

224
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:00,391
in Zhang Xiaobei's laptop,

225
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:03,312
we found a draft
for the private message he sent you.

226
00:11:03,752 --> 00:11:05,151
However, we couldn't find
the entire message.

227
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:06,872
What is the exact content
of the message?

228
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:09,752
It's almost the same as
what he said during his live stream.

229
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,352
Could you let me read it?

230
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:19,672
Thank you.

231
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:21,192
Well,

232
00:11:21,312 --> 00:11:23,312
he talked about Shi Xiaohu.

233
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:25,831
He targeted Huiquan.

234
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:27,672
Besides mentioning illegal online loans,

235
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:30,232
(Huiquan caused Shi Xiaohu's death)
he also involved my dad,

236
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:30,872
(and bribed a legal expert, Luo Jiangxiao.)

237
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:32,312
claiming that my dad accepted a bribe

238
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,631
to do illegal stuff for Huiquan.

239
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,071
Was that why

240
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,631
you didn't tell An Ni

241
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,232
about this at once?

242
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:42,312
He's still my dad.

243
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,232
Xiaoting,

244
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,352
in the event of any future occurrence,
whether real or fabricated,

245
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,151
I hope you can reach out

246
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:50,552
to the Public Security Organs

247
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:51,672
or An Ni.

248
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:53,511
A man's live depends on this.

249
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,031
Had you informed us about this earlier,

250
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:57,432
we might a chance
to stop that unfortunate incident.

251
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:00,511
I know, Captain He.

252
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:03,071
If there are any updates about Xiaobei,

253
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:04,432
can you let me know?

254
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:05,471
No problem.

255
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,711
This is my first live stream.

256
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,071
Do you think there are

257
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:16,232
thousands of people watching me online?

258
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:17,912
Are you nervous?

259
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:19,631
Why would I be nervous?

260
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:20,951
I only have to talk.

261
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,631
Staying calm in tense situations

262
00:12:22,831 --> 00:12:23,872
is a basic quality

263
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,432
possessed by those in the prosecution.

264
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,151
It's fine to be nervous.

265
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:29,071
There are only three people
in the live stream,

266
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:30,312
including me.

267
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,112
Why are there so few people?

268
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:33,872
Didn't you mention a way

269
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,471
to increase the account's popularity?

270
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,031
Yes, there are some ways
to do that,

271
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:39,391
like engaging in duels, boosting popularity,
and joining someone else's live stream.

272
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:41,151
Why don't you try joining
someone else's live stream?

273
00:12:41,432 --> 00:12:42,831
If that influencer's fans
take a liking to you,

274
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:43,672
they will follow you.

Everyone, hit subscribe!

276
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,432
I'll perform a sexy dance later.

277

Okay, everyone.

278
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,831
Everyone, hit subscribe!

279
00:12:53,912 --> 00:12:55,831
This is Long from Nanshan.

280

(Everyone,)

281
00:12:57,631 --> 00:12:59,711
(I won't back down today.)

282
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:03,511
(I won't be afraid
no matter who joins my live stream.)

283
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:04,752
(Someone has joined my live stream.)

284
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:07,271
(Let's see who is it.)

285
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,432
(Huh? Who is this?)

286
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:12,912
(Hello, Long from Nanshan.)

287
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:14,432
(I'm a prosecutor from)

288
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:15,552
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate
in Zhongjiang Province.)

289
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,352
(My name is An Ni.)

290
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:17,711
(Apologies for joining your live stream.)

291
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,511
(- I have a question for you...
- A prosecutor?)

292
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,752
(I'm sorry, Miss Prosecutor.
I know my mistake.)

293
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:25,432
(I'm not a bad person.)

294
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,432
(I've been honest since young.)

295
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,432
(I claimed that)

296
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,031
(One Sports Car received)
(I call the shots in Nanshan.)

297
00:13:31,031 --> 00:13:31,432
(One Sports Car received)

298
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:33,031
(One Sports Car received)
(I was merely boasting.)

299
00:13:33,232 --> 00:13:34,112
(I'm sorry, Miss Prosecutor.)

300
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:35,112
(I'm not a bad person.)

301
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:36,631
(That's not why I'm here.)

302
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:37,511
(I am...)

303
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:39,631
He hung up.

304
00:13:41,511 --> 00:13:43,352
We gained a lot of fans from that.

305
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:44,752
If you continue doing this,

306
00:13:44,752 --> 00:13:46,352
I think we can gain
over ten thousand fans tonight!

307
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:48,831
Hurry, join another live stream.

(to prevent
telecom and online frauds)

310
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,031
(while also continuously)

311
00:13:53,071 --> 00:13:54,672
(cracking down on fraudulent activities)

312
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:56,631
(to uphold
the integrity of our society.)

313

(Lastly, we would like
to remind everyone to not be greedy)

314
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,352
(so you won't fall victim to scams.)

315

(Beware of virtual numbers)

316

(and exercise caution when
answering calls from unknown numbers.)

317
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,312

(I'll often conduct live streams.)

00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,112
(Good night, everyone.)

321
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:24,192
Hurry, look at this!

322
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,711
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate's account

323
00:14:26,752 --> 00:14:27,951
hits eighty thousand fans tonight!

324
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:30,591
Eighty thousand!
You're now an influencer.

325
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,271
Influencer?

326
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,552
I've completed my mission.

327
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
(Inpatient)

328
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:43,391
It's him.

329
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:45,591
His son is dead.

330
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:47,031
As a father,

331
00:14:47,192 --> 00:14:48,752
he isn't upset at all.

332
00:14:49,391 --> 00:14:50,591
(Jiangcheng First People's Hospital)
(They might be father and son,)

(Jiangcheng First People's Hospital)
(but they are distant.)

334

His father has been
in the hospital for a long time,

335

but he had only visited thrice.

Every time he shows up,

337
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,591
his father would fly into a rage.

338
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:01,591
In the end,

339
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:03,792
the nurse would kick him out.

340
00:15:06,232 --> 00:15:07,912
I'm neither blind nor deaf.

341
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:09,872
Don't gossip behind my back.

342
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:11,792
Do you really think
I don't know anything?

343
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:16,391
Mr. Zhang!

344
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:18,831
- Captain He, you're here.
- Hello.

345
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:21,031
- Hello.
- Captain He, you're here.

346
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:23,471
Stay put, Mr. Zhang.

347
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,752
I'll help you wind your bed up.

348
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,511
How are you doing recently?

349
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:35,271
I'm neither dead nor alive.

350
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,312
Nothing much.

351
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:37,951
Did Xiaobei come and visit you?

352
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:47,752
Old Fool,

353
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,471
I'm leaving on a long trip soon.

354
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:53,552
If anyone asks you about me,

355
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,352
pretend you don't know anything.

356
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:59,552
If you hear news of my death,

357
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,071
don't trust them.

358
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:02,511
Don't get too emotional.

359
00:16:02,912 --> 00:16:04,312
That is just

360
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:05,951
a trick for me to disappear.

361
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:07,232
Brat,

362
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:08,511
what are you up to again?

363
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,752
Getting rich.

364
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,432
Don't die.

365
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,792
You need to open your eyes wide

366
00:16:15,071 --> 00:16:16,912
and watch how does your useless son

367
00:16:17,071 --> 00:16:18,192
get rich.

368
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,192
When I come back,

369
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:22,951
you won't have to suffer anymore.

370
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,912
I'll upgrade you to the VIP ward.

371
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:26,752
I'll also hire a caregiver
and a housekeeper for you.

372
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,831
They will take good care of you.

373
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,831
Mom and Wanru left ahead of us.

374
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,391
All these years,

375
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,432
you've suffered alone.

376
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:36,511
I'll have you know

377
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:39,071
that I

378
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,471
don't want anything now.

379
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,752
You must be muddled from your illness.

380
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:45,511
Your filial son
is spending money on you.

381
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:46,711
Why won't you accept it?

382
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:48,672
Ha!

383
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,831
When I recover

384
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:52,631
and can get out of bed,

385
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:54,071
the first thing I'll do

386
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:55,951
is to kick your knees

387
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:56,992
until the bones are crushed.

388
00:16:57,752 --> 00:16:59,591
You'll kneel every day on the ground.
Do you believe me?

389
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:02,271
Fine! Stay ill forever.

390
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,711
This is annoying.

391
00:17:03,711 --> 00:17:04,472
I was in a great mood

392
00:17:04,472 --> 00:17:05,991
but you ruined it.

393
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:09,432
Wait.

394
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:11,351
Eh?

395
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:15,072
Did Zhang Xiaobei

396
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:17,031
cause trouble, right?

397
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:20,991
No, we met two days ago.

398
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,072
He told me you like
to eat apples from Shaanxi.

399
00:17:23,072 --> 00:17:24,751
I bought some for you today.

400
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:28,432
Impossible.

401
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,672
He has never been a filial son.

402
00:17:32,312 --> 00:17:33,312
I don't

403
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:36,672
have such a son.

404
00:17:36,952 --> 00:17:39,391
He is nothing compared to his sister.

405
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,472
Fine.

406
00:17:40,472 --> 00:17:42,792
My poor Wanru.

407
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:48,511
Why did you die ahead of me?

408
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:49,912
Calm down, calm down.

409
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:52,231
My Wanru is dead.

410
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,792
My Wanru.

411
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:59,592
Mr. Zhang's act
was a little exaggerated.

412
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,991
That can prove one thing, though.

413
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:03,271
Zhang Xiaobei

414
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:05,552
is most probably deceiving everyone
by flying under the radar.

415
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:06,592
No,

416
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:07,552
he's flying under the river.

417
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:10,271
(Qingshui River, which he jumped into.)

418
00:18:12,072 --> 00:18:13,871
(It's obvious he was putting up an act.)

419
00:18:14,111 --> 00:18:14,631
(I knew that)

420
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,432
(he wouldn't die easily.)

421
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:17,871
(But I think)

422
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,391
(his father doesn't know where he is.)

423
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:23,111
(The lesser people who know,
the safer he is.)

424
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:24,592
As long as he's alive,

425
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,952
that's fine.

426
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,111
We need to find his problem next.

427
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:30,072
You'll have to pay more attention to it

428
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:31,592
as it concerns your ministry.

429
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:32,192
(Got it.)

430
00:18:32,952 --> 00:18:34,192
You're here.

431
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:35,271
- Hurry, the meeting is starting soon.
- That's all for now.

432
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,271
I need to go.

433
00:18:40,271 --> 00:18:41,312
Who was that?

434
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:42,271
You're smiling.

435
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:43,631
Stop teasing me.
Let's go to the meeting.

436
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:47,432
Did you bring everything along?

437
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,391
Yes.

438
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:50,271
(Implementing the sixth prosecution directive)
Comrades, you all know

439
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,391
(Implementing the sixth prosecution directive)
the Supreme People's Procuratorate

440
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,072
(Comprehensive governance of cyberspace)

441
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:54,712
(Comprehensive governance of cyberspace)
has issued five prosecution directives

442
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:55,271
(Comprehensive governance of cyberspace)

443
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,832
(Comprehensive governance of cyberspace)
in less than three years.

444
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:02,031
The scope of these directives
covers sexual assault on campus,

445
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:04,072
standardising public notice delivery,

446
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,912
strengthening financial regulations,

447
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:07,712
preventing accidents
caused by manhole covers,

448
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:09,511
and combating false litigation.

449
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:12,192
Efforts have been made to explore

450
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:14,072
new models of prosecutorial
participation in social governance

451
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:17,592
advancing the scientific, social,
legal, and intelligent development

452
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:20,351
of building a safe China.

453
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:22,991
In this instance,

454
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:25,751
focusing on the rectification of
online illegal industry chains,

455
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:28,592
illegal and irregular collection of
personal information by applications,

456

the digital sphere and other issues,

457
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,592
the sixth prosecution directive
has been issued.

458
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:36,151
Here,

459
00:19:36,151 --> 00:19:37,231
I'd like to add something.

460
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:38,991
Comrades,

461
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:41,792
criminal methods of the new era

462
00:19:41,792 --> 00:19:43,631
possess the attributes of the Internet.

463
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,631
That means they are

464
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:48,511
everywhere.

465
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,231
(Guo Hongjiang)

(Guo Hongjiang)
is to resolutely implement the core tasks

468
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:56,751
(Guo Hongjiang)
outlined in the sixth prosecution directive,

469

(Guo Hongjiang)
aiming to stop cybercriminals.

471
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:02,871
I hope everyone can
summarize and digest the content

472
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:05,072
back at home.

473
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:08,991
An Ni and Wang Heyu.

474
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:10,472
Come to my office later.

475
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:12,072
You're dismissed.

476
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,200
(Name: Zhang Xiaoguang)

477

(Protest! Say no to
unscrupulous businesses like Huiquan!)

478
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:38,432
Blocked road?
What happened? Qingshui River?

479
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:52,072
Both of you are in luck.

480
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,511
This is fresh tea from my hometown.

481
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,991
My family just delivered it over.

482
00:20:57,432 --> 00:20:57,991
Have a taste.

483
00:20:58,231 --> 00:20:59,151
Okay. Let me do it.

484
00:21:03,151 --> 00:21:03,952
Well.

485
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:05,832
According to the Supreme People's Procuratorate's

486
00:21:05,991 --> 00:21:08,151
sixth prosecution directive,

487
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:09,712
the party members

488
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:12,351
and procuratorial committee
had a discussion.

489
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,432
They decided to assign you both

490
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:16,672
the challenge

491
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,192
of cracking down on
new types of cybercrime.

492
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,511
Get used to your new task and
familiarise yourselves with it

493
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:24,952
in order to pave the way

494
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,751
for specialized divisions
to combat emerging forms

495
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:27,432
of cybercrime.

496
00:21:27,952 --> 00:21:28,552
At the same time,

497
00:21:28,792 --> 00:21:30,912
we are planning to prioritise research

498
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:32,351
on combating

499
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:34,751
cybercrimes.

500
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:36,472
This includes exploring how
to guide law enforcement agencies

501
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:38,952
in conducting remote electronic
investigation and evidence collection,

502
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,631
establishing standards

503
00:21:41,991 --> 00:21:44,751
for the extraction, storage,
and transfer of electronic data,

504
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:48,832
devising methods to examine
and authenticate electronic data,

505
00:21:48,991 --> 00:21:51,751
the conversion of electronic data
into other forms of evidence,

506
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:53,151
especially in cases

507
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:54,751
where the electronic data
is at risk of being lost

508
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:57,312
and et cetera.

509
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:00,552
Do you have any suggestions?

510
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:02,552
No.

511
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,192
(12309 Procuratorial Service Center)
I want to make an appeal!

512
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:04,792
(12309 Procuratorial Service Center)

513
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:06,592
The People's Procuratorate
must back me up!

514
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,271
I want to make an appeal!

515
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:09,832
I want to make an appeal!

516
00:22:09,991 --> 00:22:12,351
The People's Procuratorate
must back me up!

517
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,712
I want to make an appeal!

518
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,672
The People's Procuratorate
must back me up!

519
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:18,031
I want to make an appeal!

520
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,312
By the way,

521
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,111
don't forget to handle the cases

522
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,552
you are in charge of

523
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:25,912
at the same time.

524
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:27,631
Remember to handle the cases responsibly

525
00:22:27,952 --> 00:22:29,192
until they are closed.

526
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:31,231
Don't slack off
because of your new task.

527
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,432
At this stage,

528
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:33,672
you might have to

529
00:22:34,592 --> 00:22:36,552
work overtime.

530
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:37,991
Bear with it.

531
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:40,432
After this,

532
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:42,792
when we outline the structure,

533
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:43,592
and everything is on the right track,

534
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,031
I'll allow you to go on holiday.

535
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:47,631
Prosecutor Guo, don't worry.

536
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,072
Having many skills isn't a burden.

537
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:51,792
No matter how many cases we get
assigned to, we won't feel exhausted.

538
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:53,432
Besides, cybercrime

539
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,991
is a new issue.

540
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:56,351
Both of us should

541
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:57,991
willingly get used
to the new environment.

542
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:58,391
Yes.

543
00:23:09,592 --> 00:23:10,751
Okay. I'll be there right away.

544
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,072
Come with me.

545
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:21,151
No, you must back me up!

546
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:22,432
I demand to meet your superior.

547
00:23:22,432 --> 00:23:23,751
- What is going on?
- I want to make an appeal.

548
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:24,751
I demand to meet your superior.

549
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,552
Stand up and talk.

550
00:23:26,712 --> 00:23:28,271
- Stop taking photos.
- I won't stand up.

551
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:29,391
I want to make an appeal.

552
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:30,751
I demand to meet your superior.

553
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:31,952
I want to make an appeal.

554
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:32,832
Madam,

555
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:35,832
this is the 12309 service center for
Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate.

556
00:23:36,072 --> 00:23:38,231
I'm the Prosecutor-General,
Guo Hongjiang.

557
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:40,351
Please, stand up so we can talk.

558
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:41,312
We can solve

559
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,912
all the problems slowly, okay?

560
00:23:43,952 --> 00:23:45,432
Are you really the Prosecutor-General?

561
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,072
Yes.

562
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,792
Sir, please back me up!

563
00:23:50,072 --> 00:23:52,552
You came here to seek help.

564
00:23:52,712 --> 00:23:53,751
The People's Procuratorate

565
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,631
is here to solve the people's problems.

566
00:23:55,991 --> 00:23:56,871
But please

567
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:58,871
stand up so we can talk.

568
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:00,952
Madam, let me help you up.

569
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:08,031
Miss, I want you to help me.

570
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:09,672
Me?

571
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:12,192
Why don't we talk inside?

572
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:13,832
No, Sir.

573
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:15,472
You must let her help me.

574
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:17,231
I heard she's one of
the Top Ten Prosecutors,

575
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:19,552
who is especially good
at helping the people.

576
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,832
If you agree, I'll come in with you.

577
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,271
Sure, don't worry.

578
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:25,490
- This way.
- Okay.

579
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:26,540
(Jiangcheng People's Procuratorate
Service Center)

580
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:27,792
Madam, let's go in.

581
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,552
I finally found you.

582
00:24:29,792 --> 00:24:31,391
Everyone, please disperse.

583
00:24:34,991 --> 00:24:35,871
Madam,

584
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,832
we've got to know your situation.

585
00:24:39,031 --> 00:24:39,912
We understand your desire

586
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:41,912
to request a retrial

587
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:43,991
and seek our support for an appeal

588
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:47,151
after your case
was dismissed by the court.

589
00:24:47,472 --> 00:24:49,231
However, the process of filing an appeal
with the People's Procuratorate

590
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:51,832
follows a set
of standardised criteria and procedures.

591
00:24:52,432 --> 00:24:53,871
It is essential for us to adhere

592
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:55,231
to these legal protocols.

593
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,751
We hope you can understand our position.

594
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:01,552
Shortly, Prosecutor Wang Na

595
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:02,712
from No. 6 Procurator's Office

596
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,751
responsible for handling appeals,
will see you to discuss the matter.

597
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:05,751
In short,

598
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:06,952
she has to review your case

599
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:08,031
to see

600
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:09,192
if it meets the criteria of an appeal.

601
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:10,552
Our office can only
initiate the appeal process,

602
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,271
if the case
meets the established criteria.

603
00:25:13,672 --> 00:25:15,192
Your case

604
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,391
isn't under the responsibility of

605
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:19,511
Prosecutor An's division.

606
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,751
Prosecutor An
is the only person I trust.

607
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:23,271
If she isn't in charge of my case,

608
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:24,792
I will feel unsettled.

609
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:27,991
An deserves a spot
in the Top Ten Prosecutors

610
00:25:28,031 --> 00:25:29,832
as she is trusted by the public.

611
00:25:30,672 --> 00:25:31,552
Well, Madam,

612
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,391
every prosecutor here

613
00:25:33,552 --> 00:25:35,552
is just like Prosecutor An.

614
00:25:35,552 --> 00:25:36,751
They will handle your case

615
00:25:36,792 --> 00:25:37,991
according to the law
in a responsible manner.

616
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:39,031
Don't worry.

617
00:25:39,712 --> 00:25:41,952
Of course, if needed,

618
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:44,031
Prosecutor An will provide help,

619
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:45,151
okay?

620
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:47,672
I'm sorry,

621
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,351
but I have a meeting to attend.

622
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:50,832
Please excuse me.

623
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,031
Sir.

624
00:25:54,072 --> 00:25:54,952
I implore you.

625
00:25:55,432 --> 00:25:56,151
I implore you.

626
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:57,312
Please get Prosecutor An

627
00:25:57,552 --> 00:25:59,432
to keep a close eye on my case, okay?

628
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:00,871
I implore you.

629
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:06,592
Madam, your situation
is indeed different.

630
00:26:07,271 --> 00:26:08,391
Prosecutor An, why don't you

631
00:26:08,472 --> 00:26:09,751
review the details

632
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,111
with Prosecutor Wang Na later?

633
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:12,631
If everything else fails,

634
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:15,592
consider holding a prosecutorial hearing

635
00:26:15,832 --> 00:26:17,472
to solve her family's problem.

636
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:18,351
Got it, Prosecutor Guo.

637
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:19,952
Madam, don't worry.

638
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:22,552
Prosecutor An will keep you company.

639
00:26:22,672 --> 00:26:24,271
Okay.

640
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:25,111
Madam,

641
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:27,192
the 12309 Procuratorial Service Center

642
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:29,832
is a place to explain the law
and uphold justice for the people.

643
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:31,751
We respond within seven days

644
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:33,031
and provide a reply within three months.

645
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:35,231
We serve the people

646
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:37,192
and enforce the law impartially.
Don't worry.

647
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:38,991
Thank you so much.

648
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,271
Also, from now on,

649
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,231
you can state your problem,

650
00:26:43,391 --> 00:26:44,552
injustice,

651
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:46,031
or trouble freely,

652
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:46,871
but please

653
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:47,871
don't get on your knees.

654
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:50,231
Okay.

655
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,832
Thank you, Sir.

656
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:53,672
Thank you.

657
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:55,231
Have a seat, please.

658
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,751
- Sit down.
- Okay.

659
00:26:58,271 --> 00:26:59,832
Captain He, I'm leaving.

660
00:27:00,432 --> 00:27:00,952
Master,

661
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,151
Beiwan Police Station
transferred a case to us.

662
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:04,391
They want us to follow up on it.

663
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:05,351
What case?

664
00:27:06,072 --> 00:27:07,312
A burglary.

665
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:08,952
Did anyone get hurt?

666
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:11,952
No. The culprit negotiated for a while

667
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,871
before giving 8,000 yuan to the culprit.

668
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:15,151
He then called the police.

669
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:17,271
Quite smart, huh?

670
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:20,111
Get Liu to follow up on the case.

671
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:22,472
Find out what happened exactly
by visiting the parties involved.

672
00:27:23,231 --> 00:27:24,712
I need to go and find An Ni later.

673
00:27:25,631 --> 00:27:28,231
Master, what meal are you having?

674
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:29,111
Lunch.

675
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:31,231
It's pretty late now!

676
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:35,712
By the way,
any updates about Zhang Xiaobei?

677
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,231
Soon, I suppose.

678
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,031
Han Xuan, replay the video online.

679
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:47,631
I'd like to watch the entire trial.

680
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:49,631
The water has cooled down.

681
00:27:49,672 --> 00:27:51,472
- The temperature is just right.
- Okay. Hurry.

682
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:54,672
I've extracted the video for you.

683
00:27:54,871 --> 00:27:55,672
Here.

684
00:27:56,151 --> 00:27:58,432
Your Honour,out of humanitarian reasons,

685
00:27:58,472 --> 00:27:59,991
I must say I sympathize with

686
00:28:00,072 --> 00:28:01,151
Shi Xiaohu's mother.

687
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:01,991
However, this case

688
00:28:01,991 --> 00:28:03,832
still needs to revolve around law.

689
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:06,952
To what extent does a person's choice
to commit suicide

690
00:28:07,072 --> 00:28:09,631
(Attorney)
relate to the games they play?

691
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:12,631
Furthermore, the plaintiff's attorney
has not provided

692
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:14,672
effective arguments regarding
the issue of liability for tort.

693
00:28:14,912 --> 00:28:19,351
After becoming addicted
to Huiquan's game,

694
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:22,871
Shi Xiaohu's relationship
with his parents deteriorated,

695
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,472
leading him to run away from home.

696
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:27,031
How can one claim
that Shi Xiaohu's death

697
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:28,672
has no connection

698
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,031
to Huiquan?

699
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:32,672
I cannot agree

700
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:34,552
with the plaintiff's attorney's
inference.

701
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:36,351
Allow me to provide
an inappropriate example to illustrate.

702
00:28:36,472 --> 00:28:37,991
Following your logic,

703
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:39,552
anyone involved in a car accident

704
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:40,871
or food poisoning

705
00:28:41,031 --> 00:28:42,432
could blame their deaths on our game

706
00:28:42,751 --> 00:28:44,792
just because they had played it,

707
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:46,271
directly linking

708
00:28:46,271 --> 00:28:47,751
such incidents to Huiquan?

709
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,930
(Presiding Judge)

710
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:54,351
(Prosecutor  Plaintiff)
Prior to running away from home,

711
00:28:54,472 --> 00:28:55,912
(Prosecutor  Plaintiff)
Shi Xiaohu had already been diagnosed

712
00:28:55,912 --> 00:28:56,552
(Prosecutor  Plaintiff)

713
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:58,351
(Prosecutor  Plaintiff)
with bipolar disorder.

714
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:01,031
Here is the diagnostic certificate
as proof.

715
00:29:01,592 --> 00:29:03,271
His attending physician concluded that

716
00:29:03,312 --> 00:29:06,552
Shi Xiaohu's condition worsened

717
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:08,312
due to long hours of gaming,

718
00:29:08,511 --> 00:29:10,871
resulting in
a lack of normal communication

719
00:29:11,351 --> 00:29:13,072
with his parents and friends.

720
00:29:13,192 --> 00:29:16,192
This contributed to
the triggering of his extreme behaviour

721
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:17,552
of running away

722
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:18,672
from home.

723
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:19,712
In summary,

724
00:29:20,991 --> 00:29:25,391
it was the lack of gaming time limits

725
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:27,912
that should've been enforced
by the higher-ups of Huiquan

726
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,952
that

727
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,792
exacerbated Shi Xiaohu's condition,

728
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:35,192
ultimately leading
to this tragic outcome.

729
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:37,792
In response to
the plaintiff's attorney's viewpoint

730
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,192
(Judge  Presiding Judge Jury)
that Huiquan's

731
00:29:39,192 --> 00:29:39,271
(Judge  Presiding Judge Jury)

732
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:40,952
(Judge  Presiding Judge Jury)
failure to limit gaming time

733
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:42,871
led to the exacerbation
of Shi Xiaohu's condition

734
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:44,712
and ultimately pushed him to the brink,

735
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,552
(Presiding Judge)
what is the defendant's reply?

736
00:29:50,151 --> 00:29:50,991
Your Honour,

737
00:29:51,072 --> 00:29:52,271
can I say something?

738
00:29:52,672 --> 00:29:53,312
Go ahead.

739
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:54,472
Firstly,

740
00:29:54,552 --> 00:29:57,952
we at Huiquan deeply regret

741
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,751
the unfortunate death of Shi Xiaohu.

742
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:02,472
Furthermore, regarding

743
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:04,432
the issue of limiting gaming time,

744
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:05,592
Huiquan,

745
00:30:06,312 --> 00:30:07,751
just like
everyone else in this industry,

746
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:08,592
has implemented

747
00:30:08,631 --> 00:30:11,312
a legally required
anti-addiction system for minors.

748
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,991
However, we did not
consider the possibility

749
00:30:14,552 --> 00:30:17,312
that adults with full legal capacity

750
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:18,912
might also have

751
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,712
various congenital or acquired

752
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:24,151
mental health issues.

753
00:30:24,351 --> 00:30:27,111
Recently, I have led my technical team

754
00:30:27,511 --> 00:30:28,751
in urgently developing

755
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:32,391
and launching
a mental health questionnaire.

756
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:33,871
In the future,

757
00:30:34,192 --> 00:30:35,151
only users

758
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:37,432
(who are confirmed
to be mentally healthy)

759
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,192
(will be able to enjoy
extended gaming time,)

760
00:30:40,312 --> 00:30:42,312
(based on their own judgment)

761
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:45,151
(as a healthy individual.)

762
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:46,552
(We also hope)

763
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:49,792
(to prevent similar tragedies
from occurring in the future.)

764
00:30:53,072 --> 00:30:54,271
I express deep regret

765
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:56,312
for Shi Xiaohu's demise.

766
00:31:01,912 --> 00:31:03,391
It is indeed our oversight

767
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:07,031
as we did not consider that
Shi Xiaohu, despite being an adult,

768
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:09,991
suffered from undisclosed

769
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:11,111
mental and

770
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:15,511
psychological issues.

771
00:31:15,912 --> 00:31:19,912
As the president of
Huiquan Network Technology,

772
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:23,031
a subsidiary of Huiquan Corporation,
my personal involvement

773
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:25,751
in this litigation is aimed at conveying
Huiquan's stance through this tragic,

774
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:26,912
or rather,

775
00:31:27,592 --> 00:31:29,552
logically flawed lawsuit.

776
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:32,912
We want the people to know

777
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,912
that we are a responsible company.

778
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:38,511
We operate in compliance

779
00:31:38,631 --> 00:31:40,192
with government regulations.

780
00:31:40,472 --> 00:31:41,552
In the past, people have said

781
00:31:42,351 --> 00:31:43,511
"Regulate games,

782
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,031
save children."

783
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:46,511
However, I believe that

784
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:48,192
in this era of order

785
00:31:48,312 --> 00:31:49,751
and rules

786
00:31:50,192 --> 00:31:51,312
perhaps this slogan

787
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,712
needs to be revised.

788
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:55,351
It is our shared responsibility

789
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:58,312
to look after the children.

790
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,351
That's all I have to say.

791
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:08,672
(Your Honour, the causes of
bipolar disorder are complex,)

792
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:09,792
(and we cannot simply conclude)

793
00:32:09,832 --> 00:32:11,351
(that the mental illness
of the affected individual)

794
00:32:11,391 --> 00:32:13,312
(was directly caused by gaming addiction.)

795
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:15,552
(From the opposing counsel's statement,)

796
00:32:15,552 --> 00:32:16,631
(we can observe)

797
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,952
Shi Xiaohu had a tensed relationship
with his biological family.

798
00:32:20,192 --> 00:32:21,072
In other words,

799
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:22,751
we cannot rule out the possibility

800
00:32:22,952 --> 00:32:24,391
that Shi Xiaohu's parents

801
00:32:24,391 --> 00:32:26,391
gave him pressure
by controlling his actions,

802
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,312
leading to
a strained parent-child relationship.

803
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,312
Shi Xiaohu's decision
to run away from home

804
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:33,592
may have been an attempt to escape
the control of his parents.

805
00:32:34,192 --> 00:32:35,832
That concludes my statement,
Your Honour.

806
00:32:38,592 --> 00:32:40,111
The number of successful lawsuits

807
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,391
in such tort cases is limited.

808
00:32:42,792 --> 00:32:43,391
Filing a lawsuit

809
00:32:43,432 --> 00:32:44,472
based on personal injury
caused by cybersecurity

810
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:45,432
does not fall under

811
00:32:45,472 --> 00:32:47,111
the principle of reversed burden of proof.

812
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:50,072
This tort case is distinct from others.

813
00:32:50,192 --> 00:32:50,952
For Zhan Mei to prove

814
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:52,192
that Huiquan engaged in tort,

815
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:53,631
she must present strong evidence

816
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,231
demonstrating
a direct causal relationship

817
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:56,072
between Huiquan's tort actions

818
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:57,391
and Shi Xiaohu's suicide.

819
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:00,031
According to civil litigation law,

820
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:01,472
the burden of proof lies
with the party making the claim.

821
00:33:02,592 --> 00:33:04,031
There are many reasons

822
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:05,271
which could've caused
Shi Xiaohu to commit suicide,

823
00:33:05,472 --> 00:33:06,511
such as violence, depression,

824
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:07,391
or failure,

825
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:09,511
among others.

826
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:12,472
The difficulty in getting evidence

827
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:13,672
may have contributed
to her defeat in the lawsuit.

828
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:17,192
From the information
currently available to us,

829
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:19,111
I find it extremely challenging.

830
00:33:19,592 --> 00:33:22,672
Zhan Mei has caused a scene earlier.

831
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:24,151
An Ni,

832
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,192
what do you think?

833
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:30,871
Just do our best.

834
00:33:33,472 --> 00:33:34,271
Most importantly,

835
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,151
we need to get

836
00:33:35,192 --> 00:33:36,631
the data available in Shi Xiaohu's

837
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:37,631
game account.

838
00:33:38,991 --> 00:33:40,072
The defense counsel representing Huiquan

839
00:33:40,192 --> 00:33:41,312
is Li Yitang.

840
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:43,072
You're good friends.

841
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:44,432
Won't you argue over this?

842
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:46,031
Young man,

843
00:33:46,231 --> 00:33:47,271
I can't believe you're underestimating

844
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:48,312
Prosecutor An.

845
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:51,192
Do you not have trust in my perspective

846
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,792
or her capability?

847
00:33:53,952 --> 00:33:55,672
Fine, I was wrong.

848
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,192
I'm still surviving

849
00:34:09,032 --> 00:34:11,871
as I hope to win
the lawsuit on behalf of Xiaohu.

850
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,032
(Huiquan's game
caused Shi Xiaohu to commit suicide)

851
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:13,591
To be honest,

852
00:34:14,192 --> 00:34:15,111
Prosecutor An,

853
00:34:15,831 --> 00:34:17,391
I really...

854
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:18,952
I don't have the motivation

855
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:20,672
to continue living.

856
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:23,871
I'm like a zombie.

857
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:28,672
Madam,

858
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:30,432
my advice is even though
you have one day to live,

859
00:34:30,432 --> 00:34:32,071
you'll have to live well.

860
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:33,631
After all,

861
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:35,871
I believe Xiaohu

862
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,272
won't want to see you suffer.

863
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,631
I'll take these with me

864
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:43,111
and review them carefully.

865
00:34:43,871 --> 00:34:44,871
Don't worry.

866
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,992
Okay.

867
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:50,512
Madam,

868
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:54,032
have you met me before somewhere?

869
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:59,032
You didn't know me,

870
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,631
but insisted that
I take charge of your case.

871
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:04,311
How did you get to know me?

872
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:08,992
Through the People's Procuratorate's

873
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:12,071
live stream.

874
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:14,192
That isn't it, though.

875
00:35:17,232 --> 00:35:18,311
What else?

876
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,831
Madam,

877
00:35:25,992 --> 00:35:27,311
I want to know why.

878
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:30,391
Wait a minute.

879
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,992
The answer you want is inside.

880
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,700
(An Ni, Top Ten Prosecutors)

881
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,980
(An Ni is upright and earnest.
Get her to look into Xiaohu's case.)

882
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:13,992
These...

883
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:15,672
Did

884
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:17,672
a man pay you a visit and see these?

885
00:36:18,232 --> 00:36:21,952
A police officer with the surname He

886
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,351
came to my house.

887
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:25,432
How do you know about that?

888
00:36:26,831 --> 00:36:28,151
He's a friend of mine,

889
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:30,472
but he didn't tell me

890
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:32,831
he read articles about me.

891
00:36:36,952 --> 00:36:39,151
Huiquan

892
00:36:39,232 --> 00:36:40,631
is capable of covering things up.

893
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:42,512
I'm afraid that if

894
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:44,351
they find out I'm going to look for you,

895
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,871
I'll lose all hope.

896
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:50,472
That was why I kept this to myself.

897
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,472
If I knew you know each other,

898
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:57,111
I wouldn't need to kneel
in front of the People's Procuratorate.

899
00:36:57,871 --> 00:36:59,071
Madam, don't worry.

900
00:36:59,472 --> 00:37:00,192
It so happened

901
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:02,311
I'm going to meet Captain He later.

902
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,912
I'll ask for his help.

903
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:05,631
Remember

904
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:07,551
to take care of yourself.

905
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:09,232
I'll handle everything

906
00:37:09,232 --> 00:37:11,111
at the People's Procuratorate.

907
00:37:13,032 --> 00:37:14,111
Thank you.

908
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:30,472
Thank you.

909
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:37,952
Are you treating me this for lunch?

910
00:37:38,871 --> 00:37:41,871
Humans should know how to be grateful.

911
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,432
Sometimes, when we handle cases outdoor,

912
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:46,672
we have to eat instant noodles
for ten more days.

913
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:48,912
You should be thankful you get to eat

914
00:37:49,071 --> 00:37:50,232
a bowl of proper noodles.

915
00:37:50,672 --> 00:37:52,432
Fine. To people like you,

916
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:54,472
I'm quite pampered, huh?

917
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:56,831
How is your investigation going?

918
00:37:57,631 --> 00:37:59,952
It is as calm as
the surface of Qingshui River.

919
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:02,672
I think Xiaobei has fooled us all,

920
00:38:03,752 --> 00:38:06,912
but I also think
something will happen soon.

921
00:38:07,712 --> 00:38:09,032
He seems carefree,

922
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:10,151
but he's actually pretty meticulous

923
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:11,432
just like his elder sister.

924
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:13,591
From the very beginning, I suspected

925
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:14,912
that his suicide

926
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:17,071
was a charade.

927
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:21,631
Back at the outreach office,

928
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,432
you were quite close to him, right?

929
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,831
Xiaobei isn't a bad person.

930
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:29,232
He's a little

931
00:38:30,272 --> 00:38:31,752
arrogant and has a strong character.

932
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:33,472
Initially,

933
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:36,871
I was worried he wanted
so much money to take drugs

934
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:38,071
or gamble,

935
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:40,032
but now I know
he gave all the money to Huibo.

936
00:38:41,871 --> 00:38:43,432
What about the online loans?

937
00:38:43,831 --> 00:38:44,752
The building is deserted.

938
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:47,151
Companies like them change locations
once they got caught.

939
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:50,912
Both cases

940
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:51,871
have a similarity,

941
00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:52,752
games.

942
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:54,351
Both are related to Huiquan games.

943
00:38:54,672 --> 00:38:56,272
I think we need
to start investigating Huiquan.

944
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,311
We need to find

945
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:00,871
Shi Xiaohu's game account
as soon as possible.

946
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:04,311
I'll do that as a prosecutor.

947
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:06,032
You can decide
whether to dig into the matter.

948
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,752
Why don't we combine both cases?

949
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:09,311
I agree.

950
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:13,111
The illegal deal case
you're in charge of

951
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,472
comes to trial four days later, right?

952
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:15,712
Yes. Why?

953
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:17,192
Nothing.

954
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:18,351
Let me plan

955
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:20,551
the breakfast, tea,
and supper for that day.

956
00:39:21,631 --> 00:39:22,952
Seriously?

957
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:24,791
Of course.

958
00:39:24,992 --> 00:39:26,351
You're uncorrupted

959
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:28,151
but we ask you
to bring breakfast for us every day.

960
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:29,672
I feel terribly apologetic.

961
00:39:29,752 --> 00:39:31,591
- I need to feed you sometimes.
- Feed me?

962
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:42,151
All right. I...

963
00:39:42,192 --> 00:39:43,272
I'm coming.

964
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:45,952
Uh, Han Xuan.

965
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:47,952
I need to go.

966
00:39:48,391 --> 00:39:50,192
I'll call Prosecutor Guo

967
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,831
to ask for a day off.

968
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:53,551
If anything crops up, call me.

969
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,791
What's wrong? What happened?

970
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,730
(Emergency)

971
00:39:59,992 --> 00:40:02,591
I can't believe it.

972
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:04,472
Your wife was pregnant over a month along,

973
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:05,831
but none of you knew.

974
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:07,311
She had a geriatric pregnancy,

975
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:10,232
and now she lost the baby from a fall.
That was such a pity.

976
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:13,831
She doesn't know, right?

977
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:17,232
She fell head first and was unconscious
when she arrived at the hospital.

978
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,912
We couldn't tell her as she was brought
into the operating room immediately.

979
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:26,791
Doctor,

980
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:28,071
can you do this?

981
00:40:28,151 --> 00:40:29,631
Don't tell her about this.

982
00:40:29,672 --> 00:40:30,871
I'll inform her later.

983
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:34,151
Young people like you only
focus on your jobs.

984
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:35,551
Why the stiff competition?

985
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:37,192
Is there a need to work so hard?

986
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:38,952
Take care of the patient well.

987
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:46,391
Heyu, keep your wife company
at the hospital.

988
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:49,831
You've never taken any annual leave,

989
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:52,071
not even any sick leave
when you caught a cold or had a fever.

990
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:54,591
I took note of that.

991
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:58,232
About the illegal online operation case
going to trial the day after tomorrow,

992
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,192
you can leave it for now.

993
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:01,591
I've arranged
for someone else to attend the trial.

994
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:06,272
For now, your one and only

995
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:09,151
task is to keep Li Jun company.

996
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:14,871
Also, remember
to send my regards to Li Jun.

997
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:16,192
On behalf of everyone,

998
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:18,432
I send my regards to her.

999
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,071
I'll leave you to it.

1000
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:37,551
Why are you here?

1001
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,192
You said you wanted to discuss

1002
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:40,512
Shi Xiaohu's case tonight, right?

1003
00:41:42,551 --> 00:41:44,071
Han Xuan, do you have any food here?

1004
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:46,192
Hungry? I have some biscuits.
Here you go.

1005
00:41:47,512 --> 00:41:48,351
It's for him.

1006
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:49,192
Here.

1007
00:41:49,192 --> 00:41:50,472
Didn't you eat a lot at noon?

1008
00:41:51,192 --> 00:41:52,791
I also ate at night.

1009
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,791
My stomach is acting up as usual.

1010
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:57,071
Police officers often
suffer from gastric problems.

1011
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:01,672
Recently, I put melon seeds
in my pocket

1012
00:42:01,712 --> 00:42:02,992
to snack on when I'm hungry.

1013
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,032
I got changed today
and forgot to take any along.

1014
00:42:05,551 --> 00:42:06,432
How is it going?

1015
00:42:08,752 --> 00:42:11,311
I made a new discovery this afternoon.

1016
00:42:11,952 --> 00:42:15,992
Shi Xiaohu gave a reward
on a pornographic site,

1017
00:42:16,151 --> 00:42:18,071
but he didn't use his Huibo's account.

1018
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:19,952
A pornographic site?
