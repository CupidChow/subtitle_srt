1
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:13,680
Dear God, please save me.

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,806
Load!

3
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,558
Aim!

4
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,646
And fire!

5
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,037
They were all working with the insurgents
in the Gando area.

6
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:41,124
There's been an increase of people
conspiring with the rebels

7
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,045
while they lie and feign cooperation
with our great country.

8
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,431
Colonel Fukuda just told us

9
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,976
that the insurgents
are actually trying to steal the funds

10
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,380
from the Gando Line construction.

11
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,645
Yes, sir.

12
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,817
Has the bank in Hoeryŏng
gotten any warning regarding this threat?

13
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,572
No, sir.

14
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,199
You're the first I've been able
to tell about this.

15
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,496
Oh, really? Then I'll let Hoeryŏng know.

16
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:24,876
It sure is lucky that nothing
too significant occurred prior to this.

17
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,585
I wouldn't

18
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,921
tell them, sir.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,674
And why shouldn't I?

20
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:35,220
Sir, these funds need to be conducted
to their destination just as planned.

21
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,513
And here's why.

22
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,974
If the funds aren't moved,
the insurgents might not show.

23
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:43,686
And the insurgents must show up
if we are to catch them.

24
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,065
I will go if you'd like, sir.

25
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,611
I will catch the rebels,
and I'll bring back the money.

26
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,949
Hmm. Our great empire's
vast resources and wealth

27
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,034
make a good wager, you're saying?

28
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,204
No, sir. We're just investing.

29
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,874
By destroying the insurgents,
we'll get a great return, right?

30
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,796
Should I

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,801
just blindly count on you
to go on telling me the truth, huh?

32
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,806
You're not making deals behind my back
and working with the rebels or anything?

33
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,142
I'm not.

34
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,603
Why would you ask that, sir?

35
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,021
Sir, aren't I...

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,358
aren't I a trusted and loyal soldier?

37
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,111
Calm down.
It's not that I don't trust you.

38
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,739
It's your Joseon ancestry
that I just don't trust.

39
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:46,499
There isn't a single, solitary person
from your entire family line I trust.

40
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,670
First, you were on the Daewongun's side
before switching to Queen Min's side.

41
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,673
The Qing side, then Russia.

42
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,509
And in the end, you're now pro-Japan.

43
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,928
The entire clan of you are opportunists.

44
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,222
You see what I mean?

45
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,685
My guess is you and your family can
abandon our great empire just as easily.

46
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,104
Am I wrong?

47
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,191
Tell me your name, soldier. What is it?

48
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:18,114
Miura Shohei, sir.

49
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,783
Now say it again.

50
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:26,289
Tell me your name again, soldier.
What is it?

51
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,001
Miura Shohei, sir.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,503
Tell me your name again!

53
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,671
What is it?

54
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,715
Fire!

55
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,930
A Joseon man.

56
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,766
A Joseon called

57
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,268
Lee Gwang-il, sir.

58
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,189
That's right. You're miles from being
"Miura Shohei" yet. Get it?

59
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,526
What do you need to do
to become Miura Shohei, then?

60
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,155
Go to Myeongjeong.

61
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:07,664
I want to see your people fighting
against each other until the bitter end.

62
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,584
I want to see your people trying
to conceal

63
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,878
all the pain and injustice
they've suffered.

64
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,130
And I want every last one

65
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,217
to deny their own shameful history.

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,095
So you will survive until the end.

67
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,641
And then tell the world how uncivilized
and vulgar your people are.

68
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:31,771
Your people will praise
the great Empire of Japan on their own.

69
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,691
That is what

70
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,026
you must accomplish with your descendants

71
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,612
if you want to carve out
a place for yourselves.

72
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:44,867
I serve my country in the 19th Division,
37th Infantry, now as Miura Shohei!

73
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,954
I will obey your orders at once,
Lieutenant General Katayama!

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,370
SONG OF THE BANDITS

75
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,001
You and San-gun
have to get the railway manager.

76
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,585
Okay?

77
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:40,298
Pop this out and throw it, okay?

78
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,883
Like this. Ya get it?

79
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,843
Yeah, it's not that hard.

80
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,429
Yeah, just throw this.
Not this part. Look.

81
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,764
Yeah, yeah.

82
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,266
Mix these up,
and then it's you who's dead, okay?

83
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,019
He's such an idiot, this guy. Bang!

84
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,146
You scared me. Holy shit.

85
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,856
Hey, don't do that. Come on.

86
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,567
You're mean, scaring me, you know.

87
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,611
Then listen to me, you idiot, huh?

88
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,781
The railway manager
is going to the consulate

89
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,035
before going to the construction site,
so let's try to kill him at the consulate.

90
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,996
There'll be tons of people at the site,
so an explosive there

91
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,623
might kill civilians instead.

92
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,083
How am I gonna kill him, then?

93
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,169
Bring this along to their big brunch
and pitch it in there.

94
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:20,505
Yeah, but then
everyone gets blown away.

95
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,965
- Yamada, right?
- He's a bastard.

96
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,385
- Hashimoto too.
- Another big piece of shit.

97
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,845
Yeah, but, uh, Ōoka. He's gonna be there.

98
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:31,307
Ōoka is such an ass. I really hope
he gets a nice piece of this too!

99
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,560
I want Ōoka dead, all right?
In shreds too little for a funeral.

100
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,814
Man, hell no. Myeongjeong's no place
to throw around grenades.

101
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,273
Choraeng-yi.

102
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,777
If Ōoka gets blown up there,

103
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,613
I'll buy your bootlegged goods
behind Yoon's back.

104
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,907
You know I'm a rich girl.
Isn't that right?

105
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,536
- Do you really mean it?
- Of course.

106
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,832
Then I guess I can do it.

107
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,310
It would be rude to say no
since I'm kinda like your brother.

108
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,646
You're like my sister,
and the two of us have been through a lot!

109
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,839
- That's right!
- Don't worry about it.

110
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,342
I'll take Ōoka out, boom,
waah, bang, dead, waah!

111
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,426
Yes!

112
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,808
Come on, man. Ugh.

113
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,354
Wha... what's so funny?

114
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,232
He's talking shit again, huh?

115
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,941
Bruh.

116
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,028
So I guess tomorrow
we're killing the consulate guys.

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,702
Why are you lookin' at me, huh?

118
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,539
Oh, you jackass.

119
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,124
You did, didn't you?

120
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,792
You were talking shit about me.

121
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,051
San-gun and Choraeng-yi need to ensure
that it all goes right on their end.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,929
But can they do it?

123
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,015
Trust those two.

124
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,100
You know their skills
better than anyone else.

125
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:01,355
I don't know what might happen
if I say this, but hear me out, Yoon.

126
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,650
The money's not my real concern right now.

127
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,988
It's the manager that's being sent here.
He can't leave Gando alive.

128
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,702
You can be indifferent about your country,
but to betray it is another thing.

129
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,580
No true man could betray his own land.

130
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,711
You seem upset you're not going.

131
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,425
There's not much I can do now.

132
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,638
Old Joseon leaders
are still targets of the Japanese anyway.

133
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,641
They'd love to get
their hands on you, I bet.

134
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,269
Head to bed early. It'll be a busy day.

135
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,191
I was already feeling tired.
I was about to hit the hay anyway.

136
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,574
Eon-nyeoni's back again.

137
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,625
My plan was to hide that fact.

138
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,002
Now it seems right to tell you.

139
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,297
She wants the money, just like us.

140
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,512
So I might see her out there.

141
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,097
If we meet, should I kill her?

142
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,273
We can decide that later on
if you two meet.

143
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,026
Yeah.

144
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,194
Good night, then.

145
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,168
Ah!

146
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,257
I know they made
a great number of changes. True.

147
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,343
Still, I'm not letting peasants
go around talking like that!

148
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,886
And so I said to him,

149
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,265
"In this country,
we have our five separate ranks."

150
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,393
"The lowly, then commoners,
then merchants,

151
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,270
and the merchants are beneath the nobles."

152
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,064
"And the nobles are under the Japanese."

153
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:11,444
"Now, do you understand the difference
between your standing and my standing?"

154
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,614
And smacked him
right across the face like this!

155
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,493
Gosh. Well done, my friend.

156
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,372
Some peasant being rude when he's
beneath you by three ranks. The nerve.

157
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,834
I think you should've hit him again.
One slap clearly wasn't enough.

158
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,837
Three ranks apart, is it?
It's four apart now.

159
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Sorry?

160
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,924
See here, I was once a noble, that's true.

161
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,426
The past is past though.

162
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,096
A citizen of Japan sits across from you.

163
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,140
Now I loyally and resolutely

164
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,809
serve our great country
and our emperor's will!

165
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,769
Stand in awe!

166
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,314
Gosh, I really am sorry.

167
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,858
I really do apologize for the mistake.

168
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:53,486
I'll pour you a drink
as a token of my apology.

169
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,580
Huh? What the...

170
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,542
Ah!

171
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:12,254
Oh, that feels great.
Ah, made it just in time, huh?

172
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,008
- Oh, it's him, huh?
- Yes.

173
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:20,137
Nice to meet ya. I trust he filled you in
on our little situation.

174
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,849
Then I'll keep this short
since we're busy folks.

175
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,269
You gonna help us out or not?

176
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,690
Hwang Sam-deok, I'm waiting.

177
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,093
You're such a junkie now, seriously.

178
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,346
Told me you'd quit opium.
It's just too much money for you now!

179
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,307
How's that different?

180
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,851
Because it's different, okay?

181
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,185
Ah, I'm gonna just...

182
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,812
Hey, listen close now.

183
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,983
I didn't get you some 'cause I like you.
I got it so you won't make any mistakes.

184
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,735
Look alive, dumbass!

185
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,528
I need you to listen to me, idiot.

186
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,072
Ah, come on. It's not even that hard.

187
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,490
Right, not hard at all.

188
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,243
You just gotta keep your eyes on 'em,
watch 'em close,

189
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,164
and when the railway manager and Ōoka
get there, you give me some signal.

190
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,124
I'll be disguised as a rickshaw guy.

191
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,793
But then, I'm gonna
throw the bomb in there!

192
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,336
And then, bang!

193
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
Bang! It's all... it's all explosions!

194
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,132
It'll be all gone, right? Sound good?

195
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,593
- Great, right?
- Yeah, it's great.

196
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,302
Kill them all.

197
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,931
So stay focused.
We can't have any mistakes, okay?

198
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,141
Let's do it, huh?

199
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,769
I can tell we'll both be famous. Historic!

200
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,852
Huh?

201
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,813
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

202
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,300
Damn it.

203
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,677
That's a machine gun, isn't it?

204
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,098
Our fingers are gonna wear out
trying to bring it down.

205
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,436
So what do we do?

206
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,688
The damage we'd take is serious.

207
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,027
Let us wait for a little.

208
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,196
There are still some people on their way.

209
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,876
An armored truck was just spotted
near Gaesandun, I'm told.

210
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,838
Any insurgents so far? Bandits?

211
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,256
No, not so far, sir.

212
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,133
Once they reach Jisin,
Myeongjeong is next.

213
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,303
There will be an attack on that truck
before it gets to Jisin.

214
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,849
Continue watching them,
and send us your intel.

215
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,932
Yes, sir!

216
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,228
JOSEON BANK HOERYŎNG BRANCH

217
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,402
Wait, Mr. Hwang!

218
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,282
Did something happen?

219
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,451
It seems so sudden to quit.

220
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,455
Work hard, kid.

221
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,011
Here they come.

222
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,185
Mounted bandits!

223
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,028
Mounted bandits are here!

224
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,126
Drive faster!

225
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,628
The ammunition, quick!

226
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,841
Eon-nyeoni's not here yet.

227
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,928
Did you decide what we'll do
if she still comes?

228
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,937
I'll make that decision

229
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,232
whether to kill or not kill.

230
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,951
Let me give you a ride.

231
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,812
Insurgents, they've appeared.

232
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,360
Sir, it's... The insurgents have appeared.

233
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,113
Let's go.

234
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,219
Shoot the gunner!

235
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,938
Hurry!

236
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,078
No! They really said that, huh?

237
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,788
Oh, they're quite funny!

238
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,001
Enter! Did they really?

239
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,129
She's here now, sir.

240
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,006
Oh, she's here.

241
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,926
Oh, come in, come in, come in.

242
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,762
Come in, please.
Thank you for joining us for brunch.

243
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,305
I'm Consul Yamada, miss.

244
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,684
The railway asked if I would act
in their stead. Nam Hee-shin, my pleasure.

245
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,694
Ah.

246
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,115
So the overseer's a... a cute lady,
I guess, huh?

247
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,041
Kill them!

248
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,376
Hurry! Hurry!

249
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,641
Drive faster!

250
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,280
Holy shit! Wow!

251
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,240
That jackass has gotta be smarting.

252
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,951
How long are we
gonna wait around, huh? Huh?

253
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,079
But shouldn't we just charge 'em
no matter what they do?

254
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,249
Hang on. Just until the gun gives out.

255
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,003
The magazine's got 30 rounds.

256
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,630
Ammo by the strips
for this particular machine gun.

257
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,134
The firing rate increases as you shoot,
thanks to the external feed system,

258
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,636
but it's heavily affected
by its surroundings.

259
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,431
Especially with dust.

260
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,477
As the feeder gets dust on it,
the firing speed starts to slow down,

261
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,481
eventually causing the gun to break
due to a feeding failure.

262
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,693
When that happens, we start.

263
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,197
It won't do us much good to get hurt now.

264
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,074
We're fighting to live, after all.

265
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,338
Man, what's that?

266
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,632
Hey.

267
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,841
Stop that shit!

268
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,550
Stay down!

269
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,815
Ki-ryong's men will be easy enough,
but that gun's our uppermost target.

270
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,360
Don't worry about it.
They're as good as dead.

271
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,821
Geumsu, can you handle
the men in the truck?

272
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,990
It will be done.

273
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
Il-sik. Cheon-man. Listen.

274
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:48,455
You concentrate
on minimizing the number of injured.

275
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,250
Out there, you might see a woman.

276
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,716
No matter what happens,
you can't shoot her.

277
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
Shit.

278
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,614
You know, this dish in front of us
is the work of our finest chef.

279
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,701
I don't know if it suits your palate,
though I'm honored to have you.

280
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,411
Of course. Thank you so much.

281
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:49,391
Not yet.

282
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,565
Pull out. Toss it. Pull out.

283
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,869
Construction for the South Gando...

284
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,872
- Toshio!
- Oh, Toshio, over here!

285
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,498
Hi, Daddy!

286
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,584
Ah!

287
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:16,710
Goodness!

288
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,260
Hey!

289
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,429
Hey!

290
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,186
Hey, where are you? Where's the signal?

291
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,315
Such a prick! Kang San-gun, you bastard.
I should've guessed.

292
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,537
Not yet.

293
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,377
Ah shit.

294
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,800
Oh, Choraeng-yi! Yeah, come on, let's go!

295
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,599
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Ch... Choraeng-yi. Hey, hang on!

296
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,821
Soldiers!

297
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,904
This is it.

298
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,365
Yes, sir!

299
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,337
Toss it.

300
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,841
Pull out. Toss it.

301
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,927
Hey, Cho!

302
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,887
Pull out. Toss it.

303
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,432
Hey, Cho... Cho... Choraeng-yi!

304
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,566
Toss it.

305
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,109
When our Toshio here's an adult,

306
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:07,696
I certainly hope he'll be a good husband
to a lady such as Miss Nam.

307
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,739
I hope we're so fortunate.

308
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,323
Pull out.

309
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,412
Hey!

310
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,873
Oh no!

311
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,594
But why?

312
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,513
A kid! I saw... I... I had to.

313
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,390
A kid?

314
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,519
Huh? What, no! Don't break!
The bullets! Reload it, quick!

315
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,273
Drive faster, damn it!

316
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,488
They're on the left!
Drive faster! Go, go!

317
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,517
Hurry! Hurry up!

318
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,602
Look out!

319
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,850
Fuck!

320
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,950
Stop!

321
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,515
Boss!

322
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,358
Lee Yoon!

323
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,461
You sent those men to die?

324
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,424
Leave the cash, and go on your way.
It's our best offer.

325
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,634
Your best option.

326
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,806
Fine. We'll do it.

327
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,890
Yoon!

328
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,643
- Are you going nuts, boss?
- It's all right.

329
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,605
Let's make it out of here alive.
Don't do anything stupid. Guns down.

330
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,066
Let's get out of here.

331
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,528
There's this Japanese guy
I heard about.

332
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,989
Some army guy coming here to take over.

333
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,077
What'd that jackass say?

334
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,580
There's apparently a Japanese officer
who's coming out here

335
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,999
so he can take over the 19th Division.

336
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,626
A real brute.

337
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,672
Bloodthirsty and heartless.

338
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,966
When he comes out here,

339
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,803
not even a single Joseon in all of Gando

340
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,181
will be left breathing.

341
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,226
I'd suggest you get away now...

342
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,605
before you get killed.

343
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,191
We'll end up dead.

344
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,452
Your concern is much appreciated.

345
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,662
I tend to kill any bastards like that one.

346
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,831
Considering you're one of them,

347
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,667
we'll meet again.

348
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,837
Your old buddy Nodeoksan might be lonely.

349
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,506
Won't be long now.

350
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,017
Let's go. We'll go and talk.

351
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,311
- Right, let's go.
- Come on. We can't back down!

352
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,065
These shitty assholes!

353
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,567
You shits!

354
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,743
They couldn't have gone far, sir!

355
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:49,912
Let's go!

356
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,296
Those sons of bitches.
We shoulda killed 'em all.

357
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,215
That's enough.

358
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,384
- And the injured?
- They've been sent to the village.

359
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,015
You decided, and we all obeyed.
Why give up all that money?

360
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,726
Our resistance can't fund itself.

361
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,651
It was empty.

362
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,986
Wait, what do you mean?

363
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,155
There was no money there.

364
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,452
Since even
Jang Ki-ryong was fooled,

365
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,247
I don't think it's the Japanese.

366
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,549
I think that someone duped us all.

367
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,189
You gonna help us out or not?

368
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,235
Hwang Sam-deok, I'm waiting.

369
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,240
So you're asking me
to steal money for you, seriously?

370
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:10,118
I work as their trusted branch manager!

371
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,452
Hey, listen.

372
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,123
Ah, you really need
to pay more attention, man.

373
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,708
Listen carefully now, okay?

374
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:21,296
We're not gonna steal that money.
There are other people handling that.

375
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,673
That's all been taken care of, my friend.

376
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:26,801
The steps you were to take,
I'm assuming they're already taken?

377
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,721
On my oath.
I brought on a few men that are reliable.

378
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,973
I made your commands clear to all of them.

379
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,895
Great. Great. Well done, then.

380
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,897
What are you on about?

381
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,441
Why would the rumor have spread?

382
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,318
The greater the number
in the loop on this...

383
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:48,615
He thinks that you could be responsible
for a rumor about 200,000 won

384
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,074
coming from Hoeryŏng.

385
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,951
Is he correct?

386
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,494
Are you getting it now?

387
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,079
As the branch manager here,

388
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,625
you'll put empty boxes on the truck
and sneak the money out covertly.

389
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,795
The mounted bandits
will take down the truck,

390
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,881
so we might as well take it, right?

391
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,174
Don't you agree?

392
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,178
So you and I
will take the money for ourselves

393
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,807
while the bandits will get framed
for the crime instead.

394
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,309
There's not a single safer...

395
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,810
Totally assured...

396
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,228
...more efficacious...

397
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,690
...or more capitalistic strategy
than this one.

398
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,901
So now what?

399
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,404
Wanna come along?

400
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,865
Bandits will absolutely
attack that truck, right?

401
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,659
Come on, yes.

402
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,537
Don't stress yourself out.
I'll take any bet on this.

403
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,830
You will forget

404
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,041
all you overheard.

405
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,124
My word on it.

406
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,293
So I'm thinking

407
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,797
you really should go ahead
with your strategy.

408
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:47,882
They'll be there.

409
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,093
You're not planning on giving up, then.

410
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,261
No, I'm not like that.

411
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,556
Like I told you,
it's completely in my control, you know?

412
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,394
I guess there's no choice.
We'll do the thing we're best at.

413
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,234
Now, why are you making this so hard?

414
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,532
Just join us both.
I promise the water is fine.

415
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,746
These are tough times, right?

416
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,290
We need to live accordingly.

417
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,727
Don't believe
in anything or anyone.

418
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,355
Just trust in money alone...

419
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,026
...without any regrets.

420
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:51,696
Not placing my beliefs in anything
except cash, huh?

421
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,744
All right. Then let's do it.

422
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,288
I'll handle the cash.

423
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,124
And I can have it here in one day.

424
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,296
There's one last thing to mention.

425
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,757
Caring about cash and nothing else

426
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,384
is not the same as
letting yourself be led by it.

427
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,347
Do you understand?
I hope the meaning's clear.

428
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,568
But we'll see.

429
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,418
Hey.

430
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,244
You should've told me
you didn't understand what I said.

431
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:53,716
"Explain it again
and maybe again, just to be sure."

432
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,011
Would that've been so difficult?

433
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,764
I wouldn't have come here, then.

434
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,351
Who is it?

435
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,565
You know what?

436
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,693
I'll kill you with no regrets.

437
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,850
We think this would be
a good site for Myeongjeong Station.

438
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,310
Hunchun's pretty close, as well.

439
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,397
I even went so far as
to ask a feng shui master.

440
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,067
Ah, and he said, more than anything,
that it's good land.

441
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:57,697
Of course, there aren't any large
nearby mountains here,

442
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,740
and the view's wide open
in all directions.

443
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,577
It's an excellent location
to build the train station.

444
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,955
And I must admit,
you've done very well to find it, sir.

445
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,166
You think so?

446
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,585
I'm sure that's what I told you
before, yes?

447
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:14,297
Well, if you go on listening to me,
then benefits will start.

448
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,423
However,

449
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:20,052
what are you going to do, exactly,
regarding all those farmers there?

450
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,347
They're cultivating the land and plowing.

451
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,851
It looks as though
they intend to settle here, doesn't it?

452
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:30,897
Well, then I suppose we'll just
make sure they're gone by then.

453
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,442
The great Empire of Japan
holds all of the rights

454
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,528
for any kind of building ventures
in Gando anyway.

455
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,531
But even without that boon,
peasants don't matter.

456
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,827
They'll be gone.
They'll be kicked out. They'll make way.

457
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,205
They're obviously
Joseon scoundrels anyway.

458
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,335
We'll construct this railroad
with our nation's wealth

459
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,003
and on Chinese land.

460
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,755
Who'd complain over it anyway?

461
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,550
Those Joseon fools
are going to destroy the economy

462
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,346
if they keep this up,
taking land they have no right to.

463
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,764
Such a vexation to us all.

464
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:05,890
A great affliction.

465
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,976
Is that so?

466
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,439
Miss Nam, you're not who he meant.

467
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,817
The rebels who fight the Japanese
and spurn our gifts,

468
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,237
those are the kind of Joseon
he's referring to.

469
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:24,075
Ah... I'm so sorry.

470
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,452
I truly didn't mean you at all.
Not in the least, miss.

471
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,204
I wouldn't refer to you that way.

472
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,581
Uh, anyhow!

473
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,917
Uh, I look forward
to the address you'll give

474
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,669
later on at the groundbreaking.

475
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:38,214
You can say how our empire
brings glory and abundance

476
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,049
to those who choose to accept it.

477
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,468
These are gifts that any Joseon can enjoy

478
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,096
just as soon as
they swear their true loyalty

479
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,014
to the great Empire of Japan.

480
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,185
I'll count on you then, Miss Nam.

481
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,831
CHEONDO LIGHT RAILWAY
GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

482
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,909
As requested by Consul Yamada,
who is here with us today,

483
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,745
I will be giving my speech
in the Joseon language.

484
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,122
Thank you for your time.

485
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,583
It's to the...

486
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,838
Great Japanese Empire

487
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,923
that I am loyal.

488
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,927
What is the reason I'm loyal to Japan,
you may ask.

489
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,595
Opportunity.

490
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,640
They gave me an opportunity.

491
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,600
Nobles have the opportunity

492
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,770
to see their neighbors in a new way.

493
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:40,776
People from poorer classes
can pursue their own new wealth.

494
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:45,323
The Empire of Japan
has given us these gifts.

495
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,826
There are some who say,

496
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,121
"Our country is ruined."

497
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,915
- Don't murder the wrong person.
- "So why does it matter at all?"

498
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,461
If we can't kill her here,
we're not gonna get another shot at...

499
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,544
Shut it!

500
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,172
"It has

501
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,384
met its end."

502
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,889
To any who hold these attitudes,
please put emotions aside.

503
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,391
Think about the gains being made.

504
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,104
What is it that can make a land?

505
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,650
Joseon isn't

506
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,112
a true nation, and it can't be saved.

507
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:32,411
The Japanese emperor...

508
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:37,500
is to whom you need to be loyal.

509
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,086
This is what you must do.

510
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,922
You fucker.

511
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,258
You smoked ten won's worth of opium.
Why are you still so shaky, you irrespon...

512
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,428
Why are you always
this damn annoying? Fuck!

513
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,473
...continue to pin their hope blindly
to independence someday.

514
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,643
You must stop now!

515
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,062
The Joseon you've waited for

516
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,481
is never going to come back!

517
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,650
And from now on...

518
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,862
and into eternity, our

519
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,531
loyalty

520
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,492
is to Japan!

521
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,575
Shut your mouth!

522
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,290
Whoa.

523
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,168
- Free Joseon! We are free!
- Hey, you!

524
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,837
Get him now!

525
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,548
Arrest him now!

526
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,799
You okay?

527
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:30,219
- Free Joseon! We will be free!
- Free Joseon! We're free!

528
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,555
- Free Joseon!
- Freeze!

529
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,851
- Free Joseon! We'll be free!
- Do you wanna die?

530
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,437
- Free Joseon!
- Free Joseon!

531
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,065
Free Joseon! We'll be free again!

532
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,527
Go, go, go, go! Go! What are you doing?
Come on! Hurry! Go, go!

533
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,534
You... you're safe, Miss Nam!
Have you been hurt?

534
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,497
Are you, uh, are you hurt at all?

535
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,832
I haven't been hurt.

536
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:02,001
Go! Hurry!

537
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,264
Man, we're both fucked, aren't we?

538
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,601
Oh shit!

539
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,490
Well, take care.

540
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,450
Thank you very much.

541
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,496
And please give Consul Yamada
my sincere thanks as well.

542
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,415
The shooting today was...

543
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,375
That's always going on in Gando,

544
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,544
so please don't think too much of it.

545
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,587
Yes.

546
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,089
So long.

547
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,242
What's going on?

548
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,246
What? What are you staring at?

549
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,081
You're here.

550
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,459
You didn't betray me.

551
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,713
It's just like I said.

552
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:34,468
While I sometimes do risky work,
that is not how I try to live my life.

553
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:43,394
I'd like to think your work might also be
as safe as your personal life.

554
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,228
One day.

555
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,942
Oh man.

556
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,069
I'm not sure that'll happen.

557
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,989
Aren't you going?

558
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,159
This train's gotta make two stops
to get to Changchun.

559
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,245
We'll be late if we don't go now.

560
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,954
Well, come on, then.

561
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,957
To Changchun.
