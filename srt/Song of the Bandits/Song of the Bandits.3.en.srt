1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:16,099
16 YEARS AGO, 1904

2
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,103
Hey.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,734
The woman you've been pining after
for ten years.

4
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,402
She's here, right?

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,572
And yours?

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,615
Here too.

7
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,078
Hey, we swore.

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,206
Tonight we confess our feelings
no matter what. Yes?

9
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,794
Fine.

10
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,921
I need to talk to some people, okay?

11
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,715
You go and show her how you dance.

12
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,300
You...

13
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,385
Ah, shake to the music, you know?

14
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,012
Right, I'll be quick.

15
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,058
Oh, and keep in mind
it's the only shot we've got.

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,560
- Hey. Wait.
- Go on.

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,307
You must not have been to war before.

18
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,183
Sorry?

19
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,353
Oh, no. I haven't been.

20
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,940
I don't know you
or the circumstances

21
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,483
that led to you being here.

22
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,652
I just hope your sword and gun

23
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,447
will not point towards the weak
and our fellow countrymen.

24
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,036
I will bear that in mind.

25
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,084
And your name was?

26
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,710
Lee Yoon, miss.

27
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,174
Try to return with your life, Lee Yoon.

28
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:54,799
SONG OF THE BANDITS

29
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,222
Miss Nam.

30
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,268
I took a call from your fiancé.

31
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,228
He said he's going to meet his uncle.

32
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,565
Yes, understood.

33
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,953
Oh, yes, hello.
This is Hee-shin from the railroad.

34
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,706
Please, could you connect me to the major?

35
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,639
I'm sorry to meet on such short notice.

36
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,307
You know I'm swamped.

37
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,101
Still, that isn't an excuse
for me not to see you.

38
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,020
I get it. I get it.

39
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,397
Business can be like that, I know.

40
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,775
I know I should've visited you more often.

41
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,237
You made it possible
that Hee-shin and I got engaged, Uncle.

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,199
This happiness isn't something
I knew that a person could feel.

43
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,200
Thank you, Uncle.

44
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,369
No need.

45
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,038
I've been transferred to a new base.
It's in Nanam.

46
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,500
- I'm not sure if you've heard?
- Yes, I heard about it.

47
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,252
I wish the best of luck.

48
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,421
Have you fulfilled
the last of your responsibilities here?

49
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,131
Yeah.

50
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,217
Just one small issue to resolve.

51
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,177
This man, Jang Seok.

52
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,974
A rebel we caught some days ago.
He talked. He told us about his gang...

53
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,352
and who the ringleader is.

54
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,398
Why would you do it?

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,986
Why lie to everyone, even your family,
all over a worthless cause?

56
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,448
Don't imagine I'm without sympathy.

57
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,742
Repairing and restoring Joseon?

58
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,953
Yes, splendid.

59
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,997
I suppose it feels noble.

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,081
But, Uncle,

61
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,209
it's already been a decade under Japan.

62
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,546
This all belongs to
His Majesty Emperor Taishō.

63
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,133
So cease these pointless efforts, please.

64
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,176
Just take my hand.

65
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,896
Gwang-il,

66
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,940
there are some things

67
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,818
that I have been meaning
to ask you and your father.

68
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,405
What happens after this?

69
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,909
When Joseon was nearing its end,
and Ganghwa was taken,

70
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,288
you followed your father to Japan's side.

71
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,541
All the world's matters
are similar to flowers.

72
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,586
They can't bloom eternally.

73
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,881
One day, Japan's empire
will wilt like a flower too.

74
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,800
Once that day arrives, you'll both say,

75
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,138
"Now Japan is ruined and devastated,
so just take my hand."

76
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,602
On that day,

77
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,021
where do you plan to throw your lot?

78
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,482
Which is your new country?

79
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:00,817
Uncle,

80
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,780
you need to adapt to the times.

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,074
Joseon's demise was complete.

82
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,659
Gwang-il,

83
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:14,123
don't get lost in pursuit of glory
and forget about history's judgment.

84
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,170
Times make the wrong choices,
but history does not.

85
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,549
Your actions will be judged in course.

86
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,676
Please think about that, will you?

87
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,487
I will now sing
"The True Nature of a Soldier."

88
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,110
We need you
to come with us, Mr. Lee Sang-guk.

89
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,612
Long live the emperor!

90
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,866
Long live the emperor!

91
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,492
The emperor!

92
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,369
Long live

93
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,037
the emperor.

94
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,375
Talk now!

95
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,794
"My dear Hee-shin...

96
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,507
...my heart aches at the thought
of going such a long time

97
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,509
without seeing you."

98
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,305
"Time spent without you
is meaningless to me."

99
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,225
Talk, you bastard!

100
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,105
This is good.

101
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,317
A credit to the Tokyo Imperial University.

102
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,569
I don't know what to say.

103
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,948
"The day I fell in love with you

104
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,534
is the most precious memory I hold."

105
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,289
"You are the only reason
I care to exist in this world."

106
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,919
It's really good.

107
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,963
However, Hee-shin is a nationalist.

108
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,134
I can't go saying she's the only reason
that I breathe. Say the emperor as well.

109
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
Rewrite it, beginning here.

110
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,305
"Memory I hold."

111
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,556
Sir.

112
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,525
Start talking!

113
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,158
Sit here and complete the modifications.

114
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,242
Yes, sir.

115
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,789
He hasn't said anything yet?

116
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,832
Yes, sir. Mouth is shut.

117
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,339
So, Uncle.

118
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,886
Who was Jang Seok
attempting to join up with, huh?

119
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,180
The man transporting?

120
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,856
I'm always amazed by you, Uncle.

121
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,575
Are those screams you hear
bothering you, Uncle?

122
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:40,162
You hear those shrieks?
Those are your men being tortured, see.

123
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,083
Apparently, you told them
the operation would go ahead as planned

124
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,128
despite the fact
that we'd captured Jang Seok already.

125
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,048
That means the one that you hired
to be your courier

126
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,301
will be in Changchun on the day anyway.

127
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,767
Your man is who?

128
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,272
Just explain to me how you're going
to collect all those funds.

129
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,566
Just tell me, Uncle.

130
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,486
He's gonna be caught regardless,
so why not let your nephew do it?

131
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,157
Helping your only nephew succeed
would also benefit you.

132
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,325
Right?

133
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,455
You...

134
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,587
- Bring me the chili powder.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,591
Leave it to a Lee
to be this stubborn.

136
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,970
Your lungs are weak to begin with.

137
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,723
How long do you think you can endure this?

138
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,768
What will happen if you don't make it?

139
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,479
If you don't...

140
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,901
I'll shed tears, Uncle.

141
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,403
What's your plan?

142
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,280
Give up your treacherous scheme!

143
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,618
You won't? Keeping quiet?

144
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,328
You just wanna croak here?

145
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,537
Speak already.

146
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,916
Spit it out, jackass. Tell me!

147
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,461
I'm done with the letter, sir!

148
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,612
"The day I fell in love with you

149
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,157
is the day I hold most dear of all."

150
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,830
"Today, the next,
and all the tomorrows ahead of us,

151
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,542
you shall remain the one in my heart."

152
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,301
Good work.

153
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:05,307
Hear, hear, Tokyo graduate.

154
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,810
Ga...

155
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,938
Gando.

156
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,361
Back up. What was that?

157
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,029
Ga...

158
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,701
The Gando Line... Railway funds.

159
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,371
Gando Line Railway funds?

160
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,124
Hey, Get him down!

161
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,137
The Gando Line, what about it?

162
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,931
Are you gonna steal that money
to fund your rebellion?

163
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:52,813
More water.

164
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,857
Water, please.

165
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,817
Water? Water, you said?

166
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,819
That's good. Tae-ju, get some water.

167
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,334
Now tell me who your person is.

168
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,072
You brought your gun with you in here?

169
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,908
Sir, I didn't expect a situation...

170
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,329
You call yourself a soldier?
You, a soldier?

171
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,290
You brought a gun?
A gun in here? You bastard!

172
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,000
- How dare you do that?
- Sir, stop!

173
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,585
Let go! Let go!

174
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,796
Let go of me, you asshole!

175
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,562
Hey, you good?

176
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,172
Gando Line Railroad construction funds.

177
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,509
The 5th in Changchun.

178
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,637
We know no more than that?

179
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,722
Yes, sir.

180
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,019
A nameless, unknown person

181
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,647
is going to rob the railway's assets

182
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,983
and then haul it

183
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,944
to Changchun on September 5th.

184
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,423
And we know no more than that.

185
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,135
If it's Gando Line money
getting robbed, then

186
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:33,098
what's at risk are the Joseon Bank funds
being sent to Myeongjeong.

187
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,476
Myeongjeong means...

188
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,441
that my Hee-shin is near to the epicenter.

189
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,613
There's no choice.

190
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:49,740
We need to go.

191
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,325
We should go?

192
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,410
Sir, we aren't officially transferred.

193
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:58,582
Should I sit here and wait until then
to protect the country and girl I love?

194
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,333
Get everyone ready.

195
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,629
We'll go there ourselves...

196
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,341
to catch and dispatch those shits.

197
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,691
As soon as we depart,
we're no more than strangers.

198
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,028
We'll go our separate ways,
then meet here once the job is done with.

199
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:28,946
The plan...

200
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
We will stop by Changchun
and return to Gyeongseong.

201
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,702
- Am I right?
- Yes, right.

202
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,288
I trust that you'll remember your role
if they catch you?

203
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,709
You don't say a word,

204
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,627
and you die alone.

205
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,837
Understood?

206
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,882
Yep, completely.

207
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,425
Got it.

208
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,806
Let me pick your brain real quick.

209
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,352
You can, as long as it's brief.

210
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,229
Sure, brief.

211
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,648
I can do that.

212
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,823
You always such a great
stuck-up little bitch, princess?

213
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,202
I did what I could
to keep it short, huh?

214
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,872
I'd hate to keep you too long, milady.

215
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,048
I'll take this horse.

216
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,351
Spare change is yours.

217
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,646
What the hell's this?

218
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,900
Hey, she shorted us!
Come back! Get back here!

219
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,110
Hey, come back here, you bitch!

220
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,029
Come back!

221
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,252
The railway sent you, yes?

222
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,338
You wouldn't be Ms. Nam Hee-Shin,
would you?

223
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:10,839
That's right.

224
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,176
Oh, excellent.
Superintendent Ōoka is my name.

225
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,595
My job is escorting you to Myeongjeong.

226
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,678
This way.

227
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,490
Ah.

228
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,033
You're here.

229
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,205
I would have happily gone
to meet you at the train station.

230
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,289
Apologies.

231
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,543
That's why I didn't reach out beforehand.
Why go to that length?

232
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,169
It's not like I'm worth greeting.

233
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,589
The steps you were to take,
I'm assuming they're already taken?

234
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,676
On my oath.
I brought on a few men that are reliable.

235
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,303
I made your commands clear to all of them.

236
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,222
Great. Well done, then.

237
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,268
The greater number in the loop on this,

238
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,270
the better our situation.

239
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,105
Enjoy the food.

240
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,698
Rumor traveled

241
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,409
regarding the leader of Group 1,
Kim Tae-seon.

242
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,827
Unfortunate. I was sorry...

243
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,078
You're sorry, why?

244
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,165
He didn't follow through for his client
and let the target disappear.

245
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,961
A person like that deserves to die.
Do the job you're paid to do, you know?

246
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,421
He was a scumbag.

247
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,840
That's not something
you'd permit to happen?

248
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,176
Letting a target escape like Tae-seon did.

249
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,848
Hey, seriously,

250
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,684
you better not imply that.

251
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,352
I kill all my targets.

252
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,523
Seriously, if I allow my target to live,
I die instead.

253
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,442
It won't happen. Don't be troubled.

254
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,154
Don't be troubled
when there's no basis to be, you know?

255
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,031
Merely see to the things I asked.

256
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,659
Hwang Sam-deok,
worry that he gets here to me.

257
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,370
I was actually just making ready
to head to Hoeryŏng shortly.

258
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:09,291
Hwang Sam-deok and I shall talk
and return with good news, miss.

259
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,374
On my word.

260
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,795
I will get going, then. Goodbye.

261
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,966
So long.

262
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,336
Your first time
in Myeongjeong, ma'am?

263
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,129
Yes, it's all brand-new.

264
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,548
More energetic than I thought.

265
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,425
It's idyllic.

266
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,177
Is that right?

267
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,596
Glad to hear you say it.

268
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,015
In Gyeongseong, a lot of citizens

269
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,685
believe Gando is
the light at the end of the tunnel.

270
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,104
Now I'm here,

271
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,107
I think the Joseon who said so were right.

272
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,528
Sir, if I may,
has your station here been long?

273
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,613
Roughly ten years now, miss.

274
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,907
Ten years.

275
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,576
That's a really long stay.

276
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,744
It sure is.

277
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,039
I can't wait until the day I am sent home.

278
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,210
The empire can rot in hell for all I care.

279
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,088
Co-Prosperity Sphere too.

280
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,340
What are you on about?

281
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,636
- Why would the rumor have spread?
- Beats the shit outta me.

282
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,181
200,000 won cash
being moved by the railway.

283
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,642
Every gunslinger in the area
knows about it.

284
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,875
Who the hell is running their mouth?

285
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,522
Bandits spring out
anywhere a score can get had.

286
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,605
Fuck's sake.

287
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,290
Ms. Nam, it's market day,
so the car can't go any further.

288
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,209
It's fine. I can walk.

289
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,681
That's the hotel where you'll be staying.

290
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,725
I'll carry this.

291
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,727
No need. It's okay.

292
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,314
I will go alone from here.
I'll take a look about town.

293
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,483
Are you sure?

294
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,110
Well then, should you need anything,

295
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,529
please don't hesitate
to reach out at any hour.

296
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,655
Till then.

297
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,057
Transport schedule hasn't changed?

298
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,643
I thought because of the rumors...

299
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,687
Those rumors are spreading
among bandit bastards,

300
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,856
so don't worry about that right now.

301
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,819
Okay? Worry over us instead, huh?
There's Jang Ki-Ryong.

302
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,614
And every bandit and their mother
will come after that money.

303
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,617
How do we shake them
and keep it for ourselves? Goddamn it!

304
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,871
I'm going to beat the hell out of
the person who spread that rumor, I swear.

305
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,956
Or just kill them.

306
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,667
It wasn't Choraeng-yi, right? Right?

307
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,045
No matter how hard I consider it,
it's what my gut's saying!

308
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,631
Oh, give it a break.
Choraeng-yi is a good kid, you know.

309
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,967
Why are you continually suspecting him?
He's very loyal.

310
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,095
I'm not really. Okay?
I know Choraeng-yi pretty well, but...

311
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,141
Yoon.

312
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,229
Yoon!

313
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,982
What was that?

314
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,196
Yoon, wait!

315
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,531
Oh!

316
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,825
Oh, you little punks
didn't get to eat again?

317
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,718
Strangely,
I always seem to think of her here...

318
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,347
because she was my first
in a few respects.

319
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,856
The first noble to ask my name,
not who I served.

320
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,526
The first noble to smile
and hold my hand in hers.

321
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,409
And the first person who

322
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,078
brought me sincere joy

323
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,249
just by looking me in the eyes
the first time I felt like that, yeah.

324
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,635
Though she must've forgotten me now.

325
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,385
So,

326
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,932
you miss her a lot, don't you, Yoon?

327
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,145
I do regret it a bit
with how much longing I've ended up with.

328
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,273
I should've gone to see her more.

329
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,210
But if you ever happen
to run into me again in the future...

330
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,814
...then I really will have to kill you.

331
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,759
You're actually here. My goodness.

332
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,517
- What was that?
- Was that a gunshot?

333
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,060
What now?

334
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,187
Trouble again? Seriously?

335
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,313
Not again.

336
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,948
What are you doing here?

337
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,117
I could ask you also.

338
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,662
You said you would die five years ago,
so why are you alive?

339
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,891
Shit.

340
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,911
Shit balls.

341
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,789
Move aside!

342
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,156
Come out. Come out!

343
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,707
Come out
while I'm being generous.

344
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,432
Shit!

345
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,192
My next one won't be a warning shot.
Drop your gun already.

346
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,196
Then everything becomes simple.
We don't have to make this complicated.

347
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:02,824
Huh?

348
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,034
This is no sweat for you, huh?

349
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,124
Just go down quietly, jackass.

350
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,923
Yoon, she get ya?

351
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,426
Bitch, who is she?

352
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,980
That's my little brother
you're shooting at, bitch! How dare you?

353
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,649
You're one crazy,
reckless bitch, aren't you?

354
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,193
You goddamn rotten harpy!

355
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,987
Got yourself
a big sister since before, huh?

356
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,491
For a man who wanted to die,
you've been pretty busy.

357
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:49,162
Seon-bok, it's nothing too major.
Please don't put yourself in the middle.

358
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,998
I can't just go and back out.
You know she's shooting at you, right?

359
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,894
So I have a thought that I'll put
enough holes in her to make a beehive.

360
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,419
- Got a death wish, bitch?
- God!

361
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,881
That ancient lady
just won't stop the swearing, will she?

362
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,008
Hey, old lady!

363
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,177
- Old lady?
- We know each other?

364
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,970
I know your kind, brat!

365
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,974
You're stupidly fearless and attack
without knowing who you're up against.

366
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:11,434
Now you're about to pay for it
by dying at these hands.

367
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,560
Unreal.

368
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,398
That old woman really made me
wanna kill her in a short amount of time.

369
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,317
So I'll make you regret it!

370
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,700
Shit.

371
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:35,457
Fall in!

372
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,168
Hold position.

373
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,932
You are disturbing the peace of our town
and are causing

374
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,936
serious physical and psychological damage
to others right now.

375
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,773
Drop your weapons immediately
and surrender.

376
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,693
I take it that you are unwilling.

377
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,821
Then I must order summary judgment.

378
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,119
Men, open fire if they have not come out
by the count of ten. Understood?

379
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,287
Yes, sir!

380
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,874
One.

381
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,127
- Two.
- Yoon, what now? Yoon!

382
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,505
Three.

383
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,174
What will you do now?

384
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,136
You wanted me dead. Now you're dying also.

385
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,889
- Four.
- This is all your fault, bitch.

386
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,892
Five.

387
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,185
Lock and load, gentlemen.

388
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,981
So what now?

389
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,608
Six.

390
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,944
You plan to walk out?

391
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,698
Or do you prefer to be killed here?

392
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,493
You decide.

393
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,577
Seven.

394
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,747
You and I aren't done yet.

395
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,418
I intend to kill you,
however long it takes.

396
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,544
Sure.

397
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,172
I'll wait for you,

398
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,175
however long it takes.

399
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,636
I won't die until then.

400
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,015
Eight.

401
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,649
Nine.

402
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,658
Ten.

403
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,952
- Everyone! Hold fire!
- Wait, hold up!

404
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,661
So it was you, Lee Yoon.

405
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,418
Cuffs. Right. Take them.

406
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,211
Start walking.

407
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,337
Is this all?

408
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,465
Not quite!

409
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:33,094
Hi! There is one more!
Hello! Seon-bok is here!

410
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,431
Ah! You must not have seen me.

411
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,890
Hello, sir!

412
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,767
Maybe you need glasses.

413
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,021
Shall I get you a fetching set?

414
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,024
I'm very sorry.

415
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,068
Oh fuck, my back hurts.
Shit.

416
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Hey.

417
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,124
So why aren't you dead?

418
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,418
It's a bit complicated.

419
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,339
I don't care if it's complicated.
I'm gonna be executed, thanks to you.

420
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,094
In the guild I'm part of,

421
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,538
their procedure is to kill anyone
who lets a mark go. You...

422
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,061
I guess it's complicated for me also.

423
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,648
Anyway,

424
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,278
you had better keep a low profile for now.

425
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,947
Don't wander,
and don't let my boss see you.

426
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,288
- Who is it?
- Hello.

427
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,999
So sorry to interrupt.

428
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,044
If it's all right,
could we have some privacy?

429
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,796
What is this about?

430
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,592
- Sir!
- Sir!

431
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,054
Who the hell is that?

432
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,523
If you would. Thank you, gentlemen.

433
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,901
Yes, sir! Please excuse us.

434
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,008
What do we think?

435
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,928
Does he look like he's guilty,

436
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,305
or is he innocent?

437
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,977
The general is asking you a question.

438
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,357
He thinks that you could be responsible
for a rumor about 200,000 won

439
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,650
coming from Hoeryŏng.

440
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,402
Is he correct?

441
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,831
So who have you told?

442
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,793
Did you tell the consulate officers
all about it?

443
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,923
You still could though.

444
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,802
Then do you intend to change that?

445
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,723
I want guarantees.

446
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,683
Do you warrant our trust?

447
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,316
You know, I'm willing

448
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,818
to believe

449
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,029
you're telling the truth.

450
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,492
The general wants to say
your heart is trustworthy.

451
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,246
Thank you so much, please.

452
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,625
This is the right thing, trusting in me.

453
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,127
Hmm.

454
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,842
I'm afraid there is one thing.

455
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,471
The general cannot trust your tongue.

456
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,081
General.

457
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,065
Were you listening?

458
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:41,902
You will forget

459
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,196
all you overheard.

460
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,657
Only then do you survive.

461
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:57,168
Stop running your damn mouth,
all right? Huh?

462
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,588
Or do you wanna come in here?

463
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,598
Time to go.

464
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,867
Frustrating, isn't it?
You wanted to take the money and run.

465
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,870
Huh. But they all want a piece now.

466
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:36,956
Hey.

467
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,335
So I'm thinking,

468
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,713
you really should go ahead
with your strategy...

469
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,384
so I can shoot you that day.

470
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,178
Two birds with one stone.

471
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,931
Or, to put it more plainly for you,
I'll be taking the money.

472
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,266
Perfect, huh?

473
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,937
Simply release them?

474
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,689
We cannot do that.

475
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:06,153
Maybe you'd prefer me
to order our guests be executed publicly?

476
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,406
Yes, preferably.

477
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,909
It would go a ways
in maintaining the public order, sir.

478
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,744
But you need to consider this.

479
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,122
If we kill a Joseon in Gando,

480
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,457
all that'll do is create ten, nah...

481
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,209
Another 100 insurgents.

482
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,585
For goodness sake,

483
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,172
why would you want
to bring back trouble like that,

484
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,799
Superintendent Ōoka.

485
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:30,261
Uh, come on. Let's go down
the path of least resistance.

486
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,389
Then, sir, what are we doing here?

487
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,392
How am I supposed to do my job?

488
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,438
Stay in Gando and impose the rule of law
over Myeongjeong?

489
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,649
Since Gando is the location
of the Japanese Consulate General,

490
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,943
that is your mission, sir.

491
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,071
"If you perform well in your duty,

492
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:52,658
then you'll return to your home
within two years."

493
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,577
Weren't those your exact words, sir?

494
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,829
You said them ten years ago.

495
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:01,167
Regardless of how we handle
Joseon prisoners in the future,

496
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,418
this is our situation.

497
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,711
They must be released.

498
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,725
No. I won't do it.

499
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,980
Why do you disobey me,
the Consul General? Just listen!

500
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,775
My orders benefit the nation,
and you're complaining! Why?

501
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,945
Uh, just get it done, will you?

502
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,575
This is for the benefit of the nation?

503
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,120
The Co-Prosperity Sphere
and whatever else?

504
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,247
That's what you mean, right?

505
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,169
And all for that, I came here,

506
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,046
out to this deserted wasteland,

507
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,216
to perform my duty
across almost ten years.

508
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,969
And now I'm done with it.

509
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,472
You and the empire can rot in hell.

510
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,516
I'll take my leave, sir.

511
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,896
You said rot... rot... rot in... rot in hell?

512
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,065
You dirty traitor! Say that again!

513
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,891
Hey.

514
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,860
You're really here for that money?

515
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,738
You traveled all this way

516
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,741
just to rob 200,000 from a train?

517
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,953
Can you think of any other reason?

518
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,373
There's nothing special in this town.

519
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,336
Don't go changing your plans
because of me, huh?

520
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,840
We have to meet that day.
We have unfinished business.

521
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,551
Let's not waste time.

522
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,013
Go back to Gyeongseong
while you have the chance.

523
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,984
You'll be putting your own life
on the line.

524
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,057
Hey.

525
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,811
Who do you think you are, huh?

526
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,314
You're really starting to get annoying.

527
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,940
You're one to talk, huh?

528
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,443
All you do is
disrespect those older than you.

529
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,987
Think that bitch is a slave child
or what? Sheesh.

530
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,363
Hey, grandma.

531
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,782
Quit calling me "that bitch," would you?

532
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,660
I have a name, you know. Eon-nyeoni.

533
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,580
Eon-nyeoni. This bitch. That bitch.
It's all the same, you bitch.

534
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,583
Seriously, your mouth
better get washed out with...

535
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,381
If you're committed,

536
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,925
you'll also be against
that crew you just saw.

537
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,302
You'll be in real jeopardy.

538
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,679
Are you concerned
or intimidating me, then?

539
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,641
Or intimidating
under the guise of concern?

540
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,601
You said you're going to murder me.

541
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,520
Then you need to stay alive to do it.

542
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,523
You're really in a bad situation,
you know?

543
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:15,361
Worry about yourself, okay?

544
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,071
My life's not your business.

545
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,239
You're not planning on giving up, then?

546
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,116
No, I'm not like that.

547
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,493
I guess there's no choice.

548
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,037
We'll do the thing we're best at.

549
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:27,872
All right.

550
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,209
Well, you're on, then.

551
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,797
It's just I don't know
what you're best at.
