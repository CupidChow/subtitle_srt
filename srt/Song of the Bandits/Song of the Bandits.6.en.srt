1
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,458
Who are you?

2
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,354
Eon-nyeoni, you said?

3
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,648
Yes.

4
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,237
So bandits set upon you
beside the Duman River?

5
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,452
And then they killed
your whole family, eh?

6
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,372
All of them are dead.

7
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,585
You alone survived, and now
your heart is torn apart, right?

8
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,921
Maybe you even feel guilty?

9
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,257
Answer me.

10
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,678
Manners are important, so answer me now.

11
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,688
I... I'm not...

12
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,818
not the kind of woman to cause any issues.

13
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,739
Please let me stay for a little while.

14
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:01,204
When my grief becomes less,
I'll leave right away. I swear that...

15
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,498
You don't even mean it,
so quit your begging.

16
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,416
Stop. Don't be like that.

17
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,919
Neither of us are stupid.

18
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,013
Are you coming or not?

19
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,546
The hardships you've faced
up to this point in your short life

20
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,798
haven't been your fault.

21
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,844
It's all our fault.

22
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,181
It's all my generation.

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,351
We were the ones
who let Joseon fall into utter ruin,

24
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,897
and our mistakes made refugees of us all.

25
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,235
You can only get rich
by siding with the Japanese.

26
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,324
And backstabbing your comrades
makes your survival more likely.

27
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,827
This is the world we created for you.

28
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,248
I have nothing
but the utmost pity for you all.

29
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,835
And for all of our mistakes,
I apologize to you.

30
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,089
It's not right
that you live in times like these.

31
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,594
I'm sorry that now you have to struggle

32
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,971
with all that.

33
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,398
And don't think I'll swallow that
daft nonsense about making your own way.

34
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,858
Just settle down here.

35
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,028
Your own people can care for you here.

36
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,782
- It's better than a dead nation.
- All right, sir.

37
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,283
"Sir."

38
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,911
"Sir." Why call me that?

39
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,916
Both of us have had our loved ones
ripped from us, you see.

40
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,006
From now on, you can call me "Father..."

41
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,719
because I swear
to look after you like one of my own.

42
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,931
So count on me as a father.

43
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,725
I'll count on you as a daughter.

44
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,238
Just eat now

45
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,825
until you feel like you'll burst.

46
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,786
Nobody will judge you for it.

47
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,458
SONG OF THE BANDITS

48
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,800
Is she here to eat?
Why's she eating our potatoes? Shit.

49
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,011
You don't need to worry.
Just trust me, okay?

50
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,848
If she tries anything funny,
I'll kick her ass real quick.

51
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,309
Ah!

52
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,853
Oh, that hit the spot, seriously.

53
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,732
Oh, man, my belly's so full.
Strange, I don't even like potatoes.

54
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,069
So you've become a crook, huh?

55
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,654
It doesn't pay for food,

56
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:46,781
but your stomach's full, so talk.

57
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:47,907
Why are you here?

58
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,159
I don't have business with you.

59
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,749
I just came for Lee Yoon.

60
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,961
It's nothing for you to worry about.

61
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,921
Yoon's some other place now.

62
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,007
Looks like you've lost everything
since you're here alone.

63
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,884
Your client and that cash too.

64
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,848
Wow! You got a real sharp eye,
huh, don't you?

65
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,604
But yeah, I gotta find Lee Yoon

66
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,024
because if I mess it up again, that's it.

67
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,443
I'll be boned.

68
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,445
Then my bones will feed the dogs.

69
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,655
So, Mr. Choi, how's this?

70
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,826
- I'll wait till he comes here and then...
- Impossible, no way.

71
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,829
I won't let you stay
so you can try to kill Yoon again.

72
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:38,249
The old man's gonna stop me?

73
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,170
Why is Lee Yoon so special?

74
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,423
I guess he's your pal?

75
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:49,427
I consider Lee Yoon a son,
as you were a daughter.

76
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,894
Uh, Mr. Choi.

77
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,231
Don't consider someone like
that Lee Yoon guy to be your son, okay?

78
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,817
I mean, it sure seems like
he didn't tell you in the end, huh?

79
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,403
I can say what the bastard did
way back then if...

80
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
Forget it.

81
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,620
It's way too long a story.
Let's just talk business.

82
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,289
I gotta kill Yoon quick. You get it?

83
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,667
And I'll admit,
I'm not real happy either.

84
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,254
Still, if Yoon doesn't die,
then there'll be trouble.

85
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,799
Well, I guess we'll just have to see
what happens in the end, then, huh?

86
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,010
Hey, I can just spoil it for you
right now.

87
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,846
There's nothing an old man
and a few idiots can do.

88
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,475
You hear me? You're beaten.

89
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,519
Stop your jabbering, and get out.

90
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,812
You should go while you can, you know.

91
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,401
Look, I don't wanna hurt you, okay?

92
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,950
Wow!

93
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,202
Hey.

94
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,747
Watch your mouth around us,
you stuck-up little...

95
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,165
Stop it now.

96
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,668
But, come on. She's so rude.
This girl's just asking for it.

97
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,754
Stop it, or you'll get a bullet
in your gut, you blind fool.

98
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,965
What? Bullet, where?

99
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,092
What?

100
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:12,885
Moron, just look under.

101
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,809
Oh.

102
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,061
Just go and stand in your corner,

103
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,355
or I'll put some holes in you.

104
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,857
Oh...

105
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,195
Let's get back on track, then.
Why did Lee Yoon wanna kill that lady?

106
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,656
Or was that your idea?

107
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,581
It was your idea, wasn't it?

108
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,875
But not for the money. Not if it was you.

109
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,465
Oh, okay, I get it now.
It was her job, wasn't it?

110
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,594
Gando Line railroad. All that?

111
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,221
Once that thing gets built,

112
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,932
the Joseon people will be the ones hurt,

113
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,059
but we can shut it down, can't we?

114
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,937
Ah!

115
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,024
So you'll keep all of us Joseon
out of danger, huh?

116
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,484
I guess Yoon's on some other page, huh?

117
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,950
Please, what's with the shock?
My goodness.

118
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,368
Don't you know he let her go?

119
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,250
When he showed up,
I honestly thought it was all over.

120
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,211
He was so close to her
for so long.

121
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,590
I mean,
he could've shot her four or five times.

122
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,674
And yet,

123
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,594
he didn't shoot.

124
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,764
So listen up now, old man.

125
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,558
I'm just letting you know
if you want that woman dead,

126
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,228
and if Taepyeong-dong's security
and safety depend on killing Nam Hee-shin,

127
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,440
then Yoon might be wrong
for this job, understand?

128
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,152
He'll just protect Nam Hee-shin.

129
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,907
Hey, glasses guy,

130
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,743
you saw it on the train, right?

131
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,788
Dummy, can you speak?

132
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,706
You saw it too, right?

133
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,583
Nothing happened.

134
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,754
That's why
I skipped the ugly one, man.

135
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,507
- Me?
- Dummy, answer the question.

136
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,343
You saw it. Just admit it already, okay?

137
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,018
Oh, sorry, maybe you can't?

138
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,104
That's why you keep staring instead of...

139
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,855
You're just a shitty jackass, huh?

140
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,607
Just you wait, fucking bitch!

141
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,444
Stop it, everyone!

142
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,613
Let's see some hands.

143
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,993
Some hands, please!

144
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,166
An axe, seriously?

145
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,460
Are you from the 1500s, or what?

146
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,629
Just put it down.

147
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,761
Well, it looks like
we've said everything we need to say now,

148
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,179
so put your guns down.

149
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,307
Drop this insane
"Yoon must be murdered" quest

150
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,517
and go to Gyeongseong.

151
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,270
I say all this for you, Eon-nyeoni.

152
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,275
I can handle things. Don't worry.

153
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,445
So you can just stay out of it.

154
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,740
My mind's set.
There's no going back to Gyeongseong.

155
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,287
And anyway, you might wanna
find Yoon quick, yourself.

156
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,416
He could make off
with that woman, you know?

157
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,182
We were so young.

158
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
I was young,

159
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,521
and Hee-shin too.

160
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,633
Major, we've obtained
the carrier's whereabouts

161
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:03,801
still with the funds.

162
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,136
What? All of a sudden?

163
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,807
Well, my sources have learned
that several Joseon-born soldiers

164
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,433
recently deserted in Kwantung.

165
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,811
In Jeongwoljin,
their dead bodies were recovered.

166
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,021
They'd all been killed
at a railway station.

167
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,399
However, the men all said

168
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,861
to a Joseon officer before they deserted

169
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,029
something, maybe, helpful.

170
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,157
Get to the point already,
would you?

171
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,119
Will I hear it after I take a nap?

172
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,663
I'm sorry. Their message was,

173
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,833
"In Changchun, rebels with stolen funds
will arrive September 5th."

174
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,585
"This is plan A."

175
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,086
"There's a plan B."

176
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,673
"Jeongwoljin railway station,
southeast of Changchun by around ten ri,

177
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,135
disguised as fellow rebels,
will steal the money back."

178
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,513
That's the main argument made
to their officer, at least.

179
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,682
Then they deserted their squad.

180
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,934
What you're telling me now is

181
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,937
that the go-between
we've been chasing after

182
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,439
has murdered those soldiers

183
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,735
and might currently be in the area
nearby Jeongwoljin, correct?

184
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,820
Yes, sir.

185
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,488
Get the men ready.

186
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,658
We go to Jeongwoljin.

187
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,370
I guess you're up, huh?

188
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,455
Feeling better yet?

189
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,040
Where are we anyway?

190
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,752
Gwangmyeong Village.

191
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,004
It's a Daur village
they settled some time ago.

192
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,883
They have been very helpful to us.

193
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,137
How long... how long
have we been here, do you know?

194
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,849
About three days now, miss.

195
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,900
Wh... where are you going?

196
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,986
I wasted three days.
I don't have much time.

197
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,571
You can't possibly be fit to travel yet.
Just rest here.

198
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,198
No, it's all right. I can go.

199
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,867
Miss, wait.

200
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,077
Let go.

201
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,873
I need to go deliver their money.
I can't miss our meeting, all right?

202
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,796
Then let me go, please.
You have to focus on getting well.

203
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,964
No.

204
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,424
I can take care of this.

205
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,593
This isn't your worry,
so just stay out of it, please.

206
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
Choong-soo!

207
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,182
Hey, we found boss. We did!

208
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,226
Stay still. Shit.

209
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,813
Come on, you know where Yoon is. Say it.

210
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,732
There's some Daur village
called Gwangmyeong.

211
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,860
I guess that's where boss is at.
It's 100 ri southeast of Jilin.

212
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,153
And the lady?

213
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,489
Uh, she's with him there.

214
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,449
San-gun saw 'em there together.

215
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,994
San-gun, he wanted to talk to boss, like,
"Why are you messing around here?"

216
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,412
He held it back though.

217
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,664
He stopped and remembered what you said.

218
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,709
So now he and the guys are there,
right smack in their path,

219
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,711
so those two can't make
a crazy escape or...

220
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,964
Let 'em escape. Who cares?
It's what happens after that sucks.

221
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,010
Think boss will just stand by
while someone puts her down?

222
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,263
What are you gonna do
if boss gets in your way?

223
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,059
Come on.

224
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,108
It seems he's all tangled up
with this woman now, our friend, Yoon.

225
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,995
What's going on with you?

226
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,800
To guard your health!

227
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,219
To guard your health!

228
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:00,097
For many more birthdays!

229
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,850
For many more birthdays!

230
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,153
I apologize.

231
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,574
Too many terrible things
have happened all at once,

232
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,786
and so my feelings started to run wild.

233
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,543
My actions and thoughts were selfish,

234
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,796
so you have my apologies.

235
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:35,591
Don't worry, I'm fine.

236
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,633
So don't apologize.

237
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,554
How can I not worry though?

238
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,059
I spoke so impolitely
to the man who saved my life out there.

239
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,066
I heard about how you took care of me
during those days and nights.

240
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,282
Who talked about... who said that I might've

241
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,326
sat by you that long?

242
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,872
Um, right there. The head of the village.

243
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,130
I mean, I just felt bad, like we'd been
asking the villagers for a lot, and...

244
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,551
Sleep has never really meant much to me,
so it made sense to do it.

245
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,262
So I was just trying to be useful,
that's all.

246
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:27,601
So it's not like I only did it
because I was worried, miss.

247
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,272
Actually,

248
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,485
there's a favor I've been meaning to ask.

249
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,364
Can you stop calling me that?

250
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,117
I just mean the "miss" title, all right?

251
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,121
From now on, stop calling me "Miss Nam."

252
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,251
Mmm, just Hee-shin is great.
I would prefer that.

253
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,296
Will you try saying my name?
Please, for me?

254
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,133
Right now?

255
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,219
Yeah.

256
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,346
Right here?

257
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:06,890
Please do.

258
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,313
Uh...

259
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,323
Uh, that might be a little bit hard,
so I'll need some time, okay?

260
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:24,658
How much longer?

261
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,161
Well,

262
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:31,998
I don't know.

263
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,672
Smile more.

264
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,341
You look so much better
than when you're frowning.

265
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:54,603
Oh.

266
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
I wanted to say

267
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,776
if it sounds good to you,

268
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,362
I would appreciate you
telling me that name of yours

269
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,032
some other time when you feel ready.

270
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,619
Calling me Hee-shin might be easier

271
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,664
if I could use your real name
in return, you know?

272
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,903
Are you serious? Shit!

273
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,529
What's going on?

274
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,991
Let's get out of here.

275
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,579
Hey!

276
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,800
- Don't stop me. Let me go, boss!
- Choraeng-yi.

277
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,174
Christ. Shit.

278
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,303
- Let's go.
- Hey.

279
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,472
Ah shit!

280
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,799
Grit your teeth now, boss.

281
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,887
- Geumsu, please stop. Listen to me.
- Just quit that yapping!

282
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,252
Get out of our way.
We're here to end this foolishness.

283
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,713
Wait, Choong-soo, just listen.

284
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,006
I just told you to move!

285
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,049
Don't be mad, Gramps, wait!

286
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,134
Just calm down.

287
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,434
Let's just take this woman,
and then we can...

288
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,762
Geumsu, stop that now!

289
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,482
Ah, come on.
Your head's in the way.

290
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,568
This is all a mistake. We were wrong.

291
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,529
She's really part of our resistance.

292
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,616
Her role as manager there was just a ruse

293
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,535
so she could steal and transport
those funds to the insurgents.

294
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,454
And you really believe it?

295
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:01,958
We've all had to kill many traitors
claiming they were part of our cause.

296
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,835
She tries to avoid her sentence by lying...

297
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,005
Choong-soo! Don't act rashly.
You have to believe me.

298
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,090
She's a rebel fighter too.

299
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,135
If you want to protect the Joseon people,

300
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,556
then we all must do our best
to try and help her.

301
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,681
And if you've simply convinced yourself,

302
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,809
since perhaps you are drawn
toward this woman, eh?

303
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,019
That's not...

304
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,355
that's not what it is.

305
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,457
Shit, damn it.

306
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,625
Japanese are here.

307
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,754
Cheon-man, get our guns out, huh?

308
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,509
Oh shit.

309
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,761
I swear I can explain this later.

310
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,371
Stay here, and don't come out
until I come back for you, all right?

311
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,736
All right. Wait.

312
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,366
Please just be careful.

313
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,531
There's a Japanese officer
who's coming out here

314
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,784
so he can take over the 19th Division.

315
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,078
He's brutal.

316
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,038
Cutthroat.

317
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,915
And merciless.

318
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,376
When he comes here,

319
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,921
not a single Joseon in Gando

320
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,091
will escape alive.

321
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,719
I'm Major Miura Shohei
of Japan's 19th Division,

322
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,888
the 37th Infantry.

323
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,307
Just listen because this is crucial.

324
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,311
We're here to arrest
a seditious Joseon citizen.

325
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,315
I ask that my orders are followed. That...

326
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,777
Lee Yoon?

327
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,072
Why is this asshole out here?

328
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,490
Do you know this guy?

329
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,661
Who's that man, sir?

330
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,789
A guy who

331
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,042
used to be my slave.

332
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,017
Wow. You don't seem
to have changed all that much.

333
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,903
It seems fate wants us together.

334
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,239
Well, I think we should chat.

335
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,121
My client told me to
make sure to tell you this before you die.

336
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:27,705
A dog

337
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,083
dies when it leaves its home.

338
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
We should.

339
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,425
Look at those eyes.

340
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,426
Still the same.

341
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,055
Where can we talk?

342
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,726
Oh, let's talk in there.

343
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,203
Won't need weapons, right?
We'll be talking.

344
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,181
Hyung, a group this size
might stomp us flat.

345
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,264
You know?

346
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,684
It won't come to that, all right?

347
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,438
Just keep calm and don't make trouble
until our talk is done.

348
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,151
Keep calm, but be ready for orders.

349
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,112
And no matter what you hear,
don't come in.

350
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,908
What about making sure
the insurgent carrier gets captured, sir?

351
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,036
These armed men justify
a change of plan, understand?

352
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,579
Now it's scorched earth.

353
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,247
Scorched earth, sir?

354
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,540
Just pay attention.

355
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,085
It'll start when I walk out.

356
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:57,879
Once I'm clear,

357
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,424
you kill them all, got it?

358
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,220
Well, what happens
if there is trouble, huh?

359
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,320
What happens if those bastards start it?

360
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,557
We'll make sure they die.

361
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,854
And if some of us die,

362
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,274
we'll go on shooting anyway

363
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,360
until they're all dead.

364
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,415
It's such a small world,
isn't it?

365
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,835
I never thought I'd run into you here.

366
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,046
You really had me worried about you, man.

367
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,799
I was afraid
you were off starving somewhere.

368
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,595
Now, you should tell me.

369
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,889
How have you been doing?

370
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,687
Hey, didn't you hear me, buddy?

371
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,106
I asked how you've been.

372
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,360
So I'm not worth talking to now, huh?

373
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,948
Ah, well,

374
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,076
seems you're doing fine
since you're here, I guess.

375
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,456
So, anyway,
those men with weapons, who are they?

376
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,294
They seem like a bunch of bandits
with those faces, you know?

377
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:22,589
They are bandits

378
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,924
who bring down Japanese soldiers.

379
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,306
So you should be careful,
or you might get hurt.

380
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,850
They're all much worse
than you might think.

381
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,400
Yoon, mind your manners.

382
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,151
Huh?

383
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,988
Ignoring my rank could prove imprudent.

384
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,947
Understand?

385
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,661
Don't ignore your own predicament.

386
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,039
This isn't Gyeongseong.

387
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,501
If you die out here tonight,
nobody's gonna be bothered at all.

388
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,597
We're looking for someone

389
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,599
transporting stolen funds
from Myeongjeong.

390
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,309
That man's here,

391
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,185
isn't that right?

392
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,317
There is no such person here, so get out.

393
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,405
He'd been injured back at Jeongwoljin
at his drop-off location.

394
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:34,285
I came because I heard that an outsider
who'd been shot was seen here,

395
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,372
and you tell me he's not here?

396
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,416
Why don't you just turn him in?

397
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,377
I know you're lying.

398
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,130
I'm saying he's not here,
so just ride away.

399
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,799
Any chance

400
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,678
the person with the stolen money
might just meet up with you?

401
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:55,946
It's strange that the more I keep chasing
after the rebel carrier,

402
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,433
the more I run into you, isn't it?

403
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,936
Perhaps you didn't hear.

404
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,730
I just said that I'm not involved.

405
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,065
You're not part of it?

406
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,651
Tell me why you're here, then.

407
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,862
I'm supposed to believe
it's just chance, huh?

408
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,867
You're a part of that group of bandits
fighting Japanese soldiers, right?

409
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,538
So you must be an insurgent too?

410
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,957
You bastard.

411
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,335
Is this really all you made of yourself
after forsaking your country and friend?

412
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,805
I didn't forsake my country or my friend

413
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,517
since neither one
was ever true at the start.

414
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,355
My indentured man is set free,

415
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,358
and my repayment
is you spitting on that gift, huh?

416
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,154
That's the problem with you and Joseon.

417
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,197
Japan is giving us a future
just like I gave you.

418
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,117
We did it all for you,
so what are you complaining about?

419
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,205
You're a lowly man in a lowly nation.

420
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,959
There's nothing you could ever hope
to accomplish here.

421
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,384
Where's the carrier?

422
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,977
- Don't move!
- Stay where you are.

423
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,937
What happened in there just now?

424
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,398
Shit. We're all dead now, right? Shit.

425
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,984
If you don't talk, you'll die.

426
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,070
Where's the carrier?

427
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,412
You're not talking?

428
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,875
That's just fine.

429
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,586
I'll go ahead and kill you.

430
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,301
You're done, okay?

431
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,387
You're like a spoiled kid,
and I won't keep coddling you.

432
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:05,394
You'll be killed anyway, you know.
My soldiers are still waiting outside.

433
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,772
Minami Sadao. You know him, right?

434
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,191
Commanded the Hoeryŏng barracks?

435
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,735
The Hoeryŏng Garrison Camp raided.

436
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,363
Minami and his men brutally murdered
and seven officers.

437
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,989
You must've heard all that, right?

438
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,911
Now, who did that, huh?

439
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,788
Are you with the insurgents?

440
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:26,998
No, no.

441
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,045
Just bandits.

442
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,215
You and your men wiped out
that whole garrison?

443
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,759
Those guys outside?

444
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,220
We're just a small part
of a much larger force,

445
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,139
but the rest are heading right for us.

446
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,350
If you wanna live,
you should take your men and leave now.

447
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,192
Just one more gift from a bonded man
to his former master, all right?

448
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,530
And so I'm supposed to trust you?

449
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,740
You better believe it if you want to live.

450
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,578
When a Joseon-born
officer's duties aren't fulfilled,

451
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,121
both you and I know he gets killed.

452
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,910
You may have the same rank,

453
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,292
but the Japanese
still treat you worse, I'd guess.

454
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,128
So you wanna become a war hero, right?

455
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,671
Watch what you say, worthless shit!

456
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,684
Don't make emotional decisions.
Think rationally.

457
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,062
You might get dragged down

458
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,231
by the dog that ran away.

459
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,441
You...

460
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:40,072
What are we waiting for? They need to die!

461
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,949
No, hold your fire!

462
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,910
Wait until the major gives his order!

463
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,993
Ishida!

464
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,787
What's the commotion there?

465
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,708
That one wants to open fire.
Damn, what now?

466
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:53,127
What are you doing? Hurry and shoot!

467
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,545
Put those dogs down!

468
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,005
Hold your fire!

469
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:59,258
Why are you ignoring his orders?
You son of a bitch!

470
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,428
Then let's get started,
you bunch of ugly assholes!

471
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,971
Geumsu!

472
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,476
Geumsu, calm down.
God. You'll get us killed.

473
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:19,403
This operation is over!
Troops, we're leaving!

474
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,247
You holding up okay?

475
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,251
Stay put for me, and I'll be right back.

476
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,713
Did you hear what I said?

477
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,548
Lower your guns now!

478
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,848
Hey, why don't you bandits
lower your weapons too?

479
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,685
We're gonna pretend
we never saw each other.

480
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,347
What did you say
to make 'em walk away like that?

481
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,932
What, did you pay out some money?

482
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,144
Whoa, man, he must be
really crazy about his money.

483
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,354
I don't know what's been happening, Yoon,

484
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,940
but we really need to talk.

485
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,024
Right.

486
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:44,780
Uh, are we really
just leaving like this?

487
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,783
I pity the man.
He used to be indentured to me.

488
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,535
Oh, yes, I see.

489
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,786
But, still, sir,

490
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,081
from the view of the Joseon,
I'm sure many would applaud you.

491
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,542
I'm just afraid
the Japanese will see a traitor

492
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,502
who should be killed right away.

493
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,173
I could shoot you happily.

494
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:05,217
Oh, I was... I really am sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

495
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,107
I may not kill him myself but don't worry.

496
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,638
He's overdue for a run-in with karma.

497
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,390
Oh, uh, I'm not following you, sir.

498
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,609
Listen up
so I don't have to say this again.

499
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:25,654
The one who stole all of that money
from us back in Myeongjeong is here,

500
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,978
and he's working with Lee Yoon.

501
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,742
So shoot him along with Lee Yoon,

502
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:31,952
and then bring that cash to me.

503
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,746
Then you and I will be done.

504
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,831
Major, I'm confused.
Who are you talking to?

505
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,917
Uh, am I supposed to go back?

506
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,504
So you better kill Lee Yoon,
or else you're the one who will die.

507
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:49,053
And next time, don't hide like
some damn rat eavesdropping.

508
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,553
Understand?

509
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,811
I'll pay you for killing them both.
So this time, don't screw it up.

510
00:39:57,436 --> 00:40:00,815
And who knows?
I might see you as more human, then.

511
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,359
Move out.

512
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,987
Let's move!

513
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,951
What was that, huh?

514
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,577
Merely a letter.

515
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,414
To the person the money is for.

516
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,166
This is too complicated now. Shit.

517
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,128
That's my story in its entirety.

518
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,338
All the reasons I came to Gando.

519
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,234
Let me get this straight.

520
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,196
You're saying that
you're an independent fighter for Joseon.

521
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,615
You don't work
for the government general, hmm?

522
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,870
Whoa! Hey, man, you got it all wrong!
Your brain's empty, huh?

523
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,038
She stopped working
for the government one day, like,

524
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,166
"Man, I wanna join the insurgents."
Open your ears!

525
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,710
- You're so dumb, seriously.
- You jackass.

526
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,479
- Don't you start!
- I said you're a jackass!

527
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,213
Wow, you're both idiots.

528
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,883
How'd you make it in life
being such gigantic idiots, huh?

529
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,385
Now listen carefully.

530
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,222
That woman just told us
that she joined the independence,

531
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,026
but she really wanted
to work for the state.

532
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,477
That's what you said, right?

533
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,688
It's the exact opposite.

534
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,771
Ah!

535
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,443
Hey, just kill yourself, okay?
Kill yourself.

536
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:31,030
I started working for the state so I could
join the rebels and strike back

537
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,033
since government work let me glean
high-level information

538
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,576
about Japan to pass on.

539
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,745
Let's have a word.

540
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,582
Just hang on
'cause I'm confused about this.

541
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,667
What about your state job?

542
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,969
Did the Japanese Army
come out here to capture her?

543
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,432
Yes. They meant
to put the carrier under arrest.

544
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,813
Tell me when you became aware
that she's a rebel.

545
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,192
Is that why you didn't kill her
on the train?

546
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,947
Can't you tell me what's really going on?

547
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,789
When we were talking on the hill that day,

548
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,292
It was about the things we long for.

549
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,380
I'd spoken of someone
I wanted to see again, a woman.

550
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,300
She's the woman.

551
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,389
And she came this far
to get our country back,

552
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,517
so I'm not going to let her
fight this battle alone anymore.

553
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,144
Choong-soo,

554
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,274
I want to ask you
if I can act as her guard?

555
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,025
I swear, our family won't get hurt.

556
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:55,656
I need to bring her safely to the rebels
so Gando won't be taken away from us.

557
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,826
Goodness.

558
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,663
I understand why
you've been making trouble now.

559
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:04,956
I'm sorry.

560
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,711
But remember, Yoon,

561
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,630
it'll be dangerous to get involved

562
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,800
with the men in the Insurgent Army
for any reason.

563
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,136
The massacre years ago,

564
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,680
you remember what they did in Gurye.

565
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,684
When all my people were killed,
there was a cause.

566
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,145
I was leading the insurgents, that's why.

567
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,440
Fooling myself into believing
I'd save our country,

568
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,776
and I sacrificed the family
I loved so dearly.

569
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,989
So that's when I realized

570
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:41,702
everybody must be cognizant
of their limitations.

571
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:45,331
I learned that I was never the one
who could save us from ruin.

572
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,127
They might march on Taepyeong-dong
and do the same thing there.

573
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,256
So I'll stay with those I love instead.

574
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,472
So make your choice and stand by it.

575
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,099
And I have to

576
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,269
live with my choices as well.

577
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,116
Come on, then.

578
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,664
But why are we going?
What about boss?

579
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,165
Just go, man.

580
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,508
Seon-bok is worth a visit, so head there.

581
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,677
She sells weapons
to the Independence Army.

582
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,720
She must have a few connections.

583
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,278
I'm afraid we've got a long trip ahead.

584
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,816
I thought I sensed
something odd. It was making me uneasy.

585
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,192
It was you, Eon-nyeoni.

586
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,068
Take a seat.

587
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,543
You know that five years ago...

588
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,507
I just let Lee Yoon get away.

589
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,015
Somehow, in all my years in this job,
I only spared that one man. That's it.

590
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,102
But he told me
that you had to kill him, no one else.

591
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,607
So that's why I didn't do it.

592
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:22,780
Seemed like the polite thing.
Step aside, and let you put the guy down.

593
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,576
It's my fault then, you're saying?

594
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,623
Because it was out of consideration
for me, and I decided not to kill him?

595
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,500
That's not it.

596
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,461
I wasn't saying that.

597
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,718
It's really a matter of
trying to make my situation clear to you.

598
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,057
Ensuring that Yoon dies is not a choice.

599
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,187
What's more,
Nam Hee-shin's on the list, too, now.

600
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:58,774
Otherwise, I get killed.

601
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,779
So step back and just keep out the way,
old man, understand?

602
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,282
I'll kill them quietly and then get out.

603
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,535
Like you told me to.

604
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,328
Eon-nyeoni, listen.

605
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,331
You think Yoon is going to go down easily?

606
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,628
Since you're not able
to get this thing done,

607
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,672
I'll do it for you.

608
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,261
So do you really not know
about what that bastard did, huh?

609
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,971
I'll tell you, then you'll be shocked...

610
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,264
I know it all.

611
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:31,973
All there is.

612
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,143
You know everything?

613
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,604
Well then, why's he still...

614
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,733
Oh, what the hell!
Are you that big a moron, for real?

615
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,282
So cold.

616
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:53,036
I was stupid enough
to believe you, wasn't I?

617
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,290
When you used your parents' death
as fuel for your lies.

618
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,373
Look, I...

619
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,780
I regret lying to you like that.

620
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,087
The thing I'm angriest about now is this.

621
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,424
A few days ago, I made a mistake, you see.

622
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:09,261
It was when Yoon needed to make a choice
about killing you. I was silent.

623
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,013
Yet Yoon decided against it.

624
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:14,141
That person,
this man you're trying to wipe out,

625
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,977
Yoon, he... he said to let you live.

626
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,188
Yet you come here and say what to me?

627
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,774
You dare call yourself human?

628
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,652
Precisely.

629
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,366
See, I'm not, really.

630
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,581
That's why I do what I do.

631
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,964
Anyway,

632
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,676
I said the things I had to say,
so I'll be off.

633
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,973
Now don't forget what I said to you.

634
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,726
This is none of your business.

635
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,812
And if you get in my way one more time...

636
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,233
then I'll just kill you as well.

637
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,984
Understood?

638
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,532
Is it really necessary that you do this?

639
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,331
Why worry over this guy, Lee Yoon?

640
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,791
It's not Yoon.

641
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,585
It's you I worry over. Can't you see that?

642
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,797
Yoon won't be outwitted by you.

643
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:28,924
We have to...

644
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,387
stop hurting our own people
and stand together.

645
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,475
Don't make me laugh.

646
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,063
You see, my parents...

647
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,776
were both killed
by their fellow Joseon that day.

648
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,949
Think I'm lying to you, huh?

649
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,038
That's too bad.

650
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,336
There's a chance you might be
the only one who ever believed me.

651
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:10,965
I should go.

652
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:15,886
Take care.

653
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,474
Stay healthy, okay?

654
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,610
The world you were born into
is such a wicked one,

655
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,113
both you, Eon-nyeoni,

656
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,824
and Lee Yoon.

657
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,011
No, Mother!

658
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,137
And my father!

659
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:01,808
Eon-nyeoni!

660
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,977
Don't! Just stay back!

661
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,270
Please, go back!

662
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,397
Father and Mother!

663
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,580
Father! Mother!

664
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,790
Father!

665
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:18,844
You're right! She's from that family!

666
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,887
Let's kill her too!
