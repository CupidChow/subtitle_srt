00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:49,883
SONG OF THE BANDITS

2
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,653
IN 1905, THE KOREAN EMPIRE SIGNED
A FORCED TREATY WITH JAPAN.

3
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,904
KOREANS FORMED RIGHTEOUS ARMIES.

4
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,741
JAPAN'S MILITIA ANNIHILATION CAMPAIGN
DROVE SOLDIERS TO MANCHURIA AND YEONHAEJU.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,893
From now on,
you must all honor, obey, and follow

6
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,145
the rule of the Japanese Empire!

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,606
Put your faith
in the Government-General of Joseon

8
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,983
and the Oriental Development Company.

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,107
- In the name of freedom and equality...
- Extra, extra, extra! Extra, extra!

10
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,156
...you are required
to report and declare your land

11
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:17,077
in order that you may enjoy
your given rights

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,120
as the owners of your properties!

13
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,789
To the side!

14
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,750
- Please, off the road!
- You will all prosper and be rich!

15
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,834
Don't run!

16
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,630
Put your faith
in the Government-General of Joseon

17
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,590
and the Oriental Development Company.

18
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,428
In the name of freedom and equality...

19
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,317
Uh, Yoon, sir!

20
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:51,985
It's here.

21
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,686
I believe that the person

22
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,147
you're looking for is here.

23
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:32,443
TAEPYEONG-DONG, 18-JEONG, 30-RI
MYEONGJEONG VILLAGE, NORTH GANDO

24
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,153
Lieutenant Lee.
Major Miura is waiting for you.

25
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,487
Get ready.

26
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,157
I've been commanded
to ensure that you'll be there.

27
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,868
It's an important occasion
for you, Lieutenant.

28
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,538
Ah.

29
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,458
And you'll be required
to dress in your military uniform.

30
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,674
The person I wanna
introduce to you today,

31
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,260
as undoubtedly many of you
are already aware,

32
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,012
used to be indentured to me.

33
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,016
Had it not been
for the great Empire of Japan,

34
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,312
it is certain he would have remained
a nameless slave forever

35
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,565
and not have become my confidant,
fellow soldier,

36
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,568
and not the kind of man
I'd be proud to call a friend.

37
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,795
He's a hero who annihilated
the Russian artillery unit

38
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,213
at the Battle of Sapyeong,

39
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:19,300
suppressed the rebels in Jeolla,
and made certain mobs wouldn't rise again.

40
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,969
He is a true patriot.

41
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,430
It's my absolute honor
to present to you this amazing man.

42
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,099
Lieutenant Lee Yoon.

43
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,817
Where is he?

44
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,070
Where?

45
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:00,966
Thank you.

46
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,477
Don't plan events like that?

47
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,856
I went through so much trouble
to put that event together,

48
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,401
and you're getting plastered
instead of showing up?

49
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,820
It's been a whole six years.

50
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,406
Did you know?
Did you think how long I was waiting?

51
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,370
I never wanted to go back to the army.

52
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,791
Hang on. Is that all you have to say?

53
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,046
I leave tonight.

54
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,840
There's someone I have to meet.

55
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,636
I'm not sure I'll return.

56
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,599
You're meeting with who, then?

57
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,268
And where, that you might not come back?

58
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,612
Am I a joke to you?

59
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,198
I set you free.
I thought the two of us were friends.

60
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,281
Am I wrong?

61
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:11,412
You need to think carefully.
Not long ago, I was your master.

62
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,415
Hell, without me,
you would still only be fucking chattel.

63
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:18,002
Hey. Remember?
I was the one who burned your papers.

64
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,463
You know,
I made you into a soldier, a hero.

65
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,591
It was all thanks to me
that those bastards know you. I did that!

66
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,803
The youngest Joseon major
in the Japanese Armed Forces,

67
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,929
Miura Shohei.

68
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,224
Do you really believe you did that alone?

69
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,812
I've paid you back.

70
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,691
So let me go, please.

71
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,568
What? I should let you go?

72
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,166
Wait, is this...

73
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,211
is this still about that?

74
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,588
The incident in Gurye?

75
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,223
Look, we couldn't disobey our orders.

76
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,852
How many times have I told you
there was nothing I could do?

77
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,646
God damn.

78
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,483
If I'd just shot you back then,
then all this shit...

79
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,949
Why are you so loud?

80
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,326
I can't hear myself think!

81
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,958
No. You can't go. You'd better stand up.

82
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,042
You got a gun?

83
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,215
Okay, hold it. Hold it and stand up, huh?

84
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,843
You can actually lose your head this time.

85
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,181
We can shoot it out here,
then we'll see who gets to walk away.

86
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,264
Huh?

87
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,641
What?

88
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,935
Scared I'll draw first, like last time?

89
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,815
Your place is at my side.

90
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,817
Just remain here
if you're scared, you shit!

91
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,363
Things are very different from back then.

92
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,366
Back then, I had no reason to live.

93
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,745
Not anymore though.

94
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,207
So do we really need to do this here?

95
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,043
To start with, you jackass,
you seriously think...

96
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,135
If you'd killed me then,
we wouldn't have gotten here.

97
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,104
It's overdue by now.

98
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:47,693
However, I'm sincerely grateful to you
for freeing me, Master.

99
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,787
Wait, Yoon. Don't you go.

100
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,455
Hey! Lee Yoon!

101
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,874
You stop! Major, stop!

102
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,585
Get off me! Let go of me!

103
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,796
Lee Yoon! Hey, Lee Yoon!

104
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,936
GYEONGSEONG

105
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,438
WONSAN

106
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,401
CHEONGJIN

107
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:42,368
HOERYEONG, MYEONGJEONG

108
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,394
Yoon!

109
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,904
My, you really got tall, huh!

110
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,698
You look amazing.

111
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:21,824
Money's treating you well.

112
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,286
For us slaves, the easy way to get respect
is through money, wouldn't you say?

113
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,787
So are you respected?

114
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,913
'Course I am.

115
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:31,041
But some call me a bitch.
I was a little too harsh, I think.

116
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:36,839
Fuck, the slave girl is in charge.
Anyway, you must be tired. Get in.

117
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,849
So how did you
get here so fast, huh?

118
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,810
Don't tell me you were...

119
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,730
You've been out there
waiting for my letter, right?

120
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,567
Seon-bok, thank you.
He must've been hard to locate.

121
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,403
Don't thank me.
You're like my little brother.

122
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,823
That said, did our old master
let you come without a fuss?

123
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,283
He made it hard.

124
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,662
- I may have put a handgun in his face.
- I wish that you'd actually ended it.

125
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,540
He'd always punish me over nothing.

126
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,361
He would beat a girl
over not warming up his fancy bedroom.

127
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,796
That little bastard had no manners at all.

128
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,964
Thanks to that, I've still got back pain.

129
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:23,636
Even with all this money these days,
my body still remembers poverty.

130
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,018
Ah shit.

131
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,188
Those bastards
got themselves caught again, huh?

132
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:36,357
Fuck.

133
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,942
Why bother fighting for independence

134
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,736
if you're just gonna die
a useless death like that? Damn.

135
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,366
The Japanese did that?

136
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,661
Ah, who can say? Bandit thugs,
or the Japanese. Either are likely.

137
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,913
I don't get why
bandits would kill soldiers.

138
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,457
It makes them money.
Independence soldiers aren't men.

139
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,875
They're just money here.

140
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,753
Careful you don't mistake Gando
for Gyeongseong.

141
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,381
No one likes it,
but Gyeongseong is Japanese property now.

142
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,467
You know what's great?
Men are drooling about control here,

143
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,886
and yet, here in Manchuria,
nobody's in charge.

144
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,596
There is no clear master.

145
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:14,895
Chinese land,
Japanese money, and Joseon people.

146
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,191
Who do you think is gonna rule this place?

147
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:27,950
Whoa!

148
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,170
What?

149
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,257
There's a sandstorm, miss.

150
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,924
Okay.

151
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,636
Yoon. Here you go.

152
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,308
Take one with you at all times.
The sandstorms here are no joke.

153
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,718
It's died down now. Come and see.

154
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,650
Is that the village?

155
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,987
Mmm. That's Myeongjeong.
The best city in North Gando.

156
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,031
To die for, right?

157
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,132
MYEONGJEONG VILLAGE

158
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,663
We'll have two noodles here.

159
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,917
Have a seat.
The noodles here are excellent.

160
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,462
There are hardly any Joseon shops here.

161
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,923
Running a shop costs money,

162
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:52,011
and I'm the only person here
from Joseon who has any of that.

163
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,555
You made all of it from that?

164
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,392
God, no.
That hardly makes money at all.

165
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,853
I'm peddling firearms.

166
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,605
A lot of battles
break out nearby, you know.

167
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,107
Listen, it's like so.

168
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,192
Say the Japanese Army gets beaten, okay?

169
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,987
The independents push the guns
to sale right away to get cash, yeah?

170
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,866
So I get them cheap and sell the weapons
to the Chinese warlords at a premium.

171
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,785
And if times get tough,
bandits will always buy from me too.

172
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,912
I sell anywhere they buy.

173
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,666
Ah! Here. Here, thanks.

174
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,750
Enjoy.

175
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,421
Time to eat. Here.

176
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,551
By the way,

177
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,638
how will you work while you're here?

178
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,725
Finding that man is one thing,

179
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
but you must've planned
how you would live here.

180
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,400
I didn't come here to live.

181
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,903
What do you mean,
"didn't come here to live"?

182
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,780
You mean to die here instead, then?

183
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,044
Come on. Come on, let's go.

184
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,424
Don't! No! Please! Don't hurt us!

185
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,258
What's this now?

186
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,643
Let's get 'em!

187
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,602
Ah, not again.

188
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,396
Not while I'm eating my lunch over here.
Hey, get up.

189
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,484
Nothing good comes of getting
involved with them. Best to avoid them.

190
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,862
Bye. What are you doing? Get up.

191
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,442
Yoon!

192
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,154
He's mine.

193
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,754
Oh my God.

194
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,112
Yeah, boss!

195
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,196
Yoon!

196
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,865
That jackass.

197
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,513
Oh shit!
I was fucking scared to death, damn. Hey!

198
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,808
What, were you paralyzed or something?
What were you thinking?

199
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,810
You just...

200
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,895
Who is that man?

201
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,190
Jang Ki-Ryong.
He's a bandit. He's a bandit.

202
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,735
The ones who're dead there
are Nodeoksan's crew. These gangs!

203
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,403
Both fight the other nonstop

204
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:41,823
to get domination of the market
in Myeongjeong and Gando.

205
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,076
- It's so scary.
- How do the police handle it?

206
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,911
Oh, those idiots are just...

207
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,830
Oh, oh, look.
Look over there. They're here.

208
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,005
See him? The man up there?

209
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,883
He... he's Superintendent Ōoka
from the consulate.

210
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,636
He's in charge of the main street here.
He's an ass.

211
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,764
- An awful son of a bitch. He's terrible.
- Hey, clean this up.

212
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,600
They're just moving the bodies?
Not going after the murderer?

213
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,621
They're not going after the murderer
because the murderer is Jang Ki-Ryong.

214
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,005
Of all the bandits in North Gando,

215
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,344
Jang Ki-Ryong takes out
the greatest number of insurgents.

216
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,025
Oh shit.

217
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,154
You're saying he gets away with all this
by bringing down independence fighters?

218
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,246
Even here,
it's the people of Joseon who die.

219
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,665
Still, it's not bad at present,
you understand?

220
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,835
We'll be dealing with a bloodbath
before much longer.

221
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,338
Rumor is Japan's sending
its occupying army here to us any day now.

222
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,091
Then, they must plan
to take over and run Manchuria.

223
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,259
Oh goodness.

224
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,178
Mounted bandits, the police,

225
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,306
the Japanese
and their out-of-control army.

226
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,808
What will ensue for the Joseon,
for the soldiers here?

227
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,560
Oh shit.

228
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,644
So, Yoon, I...

229
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,938
You had better not

230
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,858
go around the independents
or Joseon people, you hear? Huh?

231
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,527
There's no country at our backs
to protect us.

232
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,155
We must be on our guard constantly.
Got that?

233
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,782
Ay, ay. Ugh!

234
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Burn it.

235
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,492
Let's go.

236
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,328
Let's go!

237
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:42,711
Yoon, hey.

238
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,464
What are you doing?

239
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,053
I wasn't going to get to sleep anyway,
so you should get your rest.

240
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,598
Ah, some buffoons were shooting
all damn night. I was awake.

241
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:57,936
They're always shooting,
those crazy bastards. All the time.

242
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,564
It's not easy to sleep
with a battle going on.

243
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,025
It's you selling the weapons though.
So be glad they're shooting.

244
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,114
You need sleep in order to survive,
no matter how nice the money.

245
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,366
I'll have to fit it into their contracts.

246
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,035
After seven o'clock,
you need to behave.

247
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,955
In any case, they can't be bandits
if they follow the rules.

248
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,000
- All set. I owe you one.
- Uh-uh.

249
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:25,046
You don't owe me anything.
Just try to come back and see me, okay?

250
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,718
Hang on, Yoon.

251
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,346
About that thing you said yesterday...

252
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,725
You meant what when you said it exactly?

253
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,690
It wasn't important.
It's just something I said.

254
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:50,363
I know you're not here to make money.
Hey! Huh?

255
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,992
You left your old life
but didn't come here to live?

256
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,453
It's not what I think, right?

257
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,291
Who is this person
you're running off to meet?

258
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,793
Choi Choong-soo,
who is he, for God's sake?

259
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,012
TAEPYEONG-DONG

260
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,067
Whoa, whoa.

261
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,429
Who are you?

262
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,561
Did Nodeoksan send you?

263
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,199
You have my apologies.

264
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,284
I didn't know you were my countryman.

265
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:46,164
Anyhow, it's a great solace that
you weren't actually attacked, you know.

266
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,335
Now then, why come
to Taepyeong-dong at this hour?

267
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,840
I had to come here in order to...

268
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,178
to tell you something important
about the past.

269
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,555
Actually...

270
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,330
Eon-nyeoni is what she's called.

271
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,876
She came to us very recently.
Just five days ago.

272
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,048
Before that,
she lived as a peasant her whole life.

273
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,636
Then she was displaced and had to journey
all this way, thanks to the ODC.

274
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,931
Japanese and mounted bandits
after that, and they...

275
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,143
they murdered
that poor woman's whole family.

276
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,605
In this day and age, everyone has
some dark story to tell, it's true,

277
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,985
but whenever I look at her,
my heart aches a bit.

278
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,408
Anyway, what were you saying?

279
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,910
That you had to be honest about the...

280
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,079
Choong-soo! Choong-soo, sir!

281
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,875
- Choong-soo!
- Is that my husband?

282
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,002
You have to come quickly, sir.

283
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,005
My hearing hasn't totally departed.
Must you yell like that?

284
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,966
I can't. Kang Du-man, that fool,
he means to part ways with us.

285
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,330
- I could just tear that...
- What about that makes sense?

286
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,679
Might as well just eat dung.
Did he tell you why?

287
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,556
How can you sit and ask why?

288
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,267
He's worried he'll get killed
at the hands of Nodeoksan!

289
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,862
What you need to say,

290
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,364
could we delay it a short while?

291
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,409
Yes, I will wait.

292
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,577
Mm.

293
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,039
Eon-nyeoni can be your guide until then.
I will be back later.

294
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,334
- All right.
- Eat up.

295
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,644
The pastor left for Yeonhaeju
three, almost four years ago,

296
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,354
so the church is empty now.

297
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,773
You can stay here.

298
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,945
And even if you hear something outside,
don't go out to see.

299
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,073
The mounted bandits
might kill you if you do.

300
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:29,077
Why does Nodeoksan
have his eye on this place?

301
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,956
Breaking the law
is what outlaws do, isn't it?

302
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,875
What other reason could there be?

303
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,628
I mean, if you think of it honestly,

304
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,506
Joseon people make the best targets
for these gangs.

305
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,675
There are no consequences for killing us.

306
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,055
I heard you got here five days ago.

307
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,432
Who were you in Joseon?

308
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,854
Didn't you hear Choong-Soo? I farmed.

309
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,439
I can't tell if you were
even listening to him.

310
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,484
You two were looking at me
as you talked too.

311
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,865
Only you don't have the hands of a farmer.
You have the hands of a gunman.

312
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,494
Just by looking,
you can tell that from my hands, huh?

313
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,998
What are you, a seer?

314
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,209
- Who are you?
- What do you mean by that?

315
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,128
Why'd you really come
to this village,

316
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,630
keeping your history
and true name a secret?

317
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,968
Oh, what are you
going on about now?

318
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,345
What do you mean, I keep secrets?

319
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,931
Who am I, then?

320
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,725
An insurgent?

321
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,644
So I guess you're not one, then.

322
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,856
One more chance.

323
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,525
Who are you?

324
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,905
Should I say?
You won't be glad that I told you.

325
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,239
That right?

326
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,991
Should we get on with it, then?

327
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,085
Who are you? And why are you here?

328
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,629
I'm here to kill you.

329
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,214
When people die, that's how I get paid.

330
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,966
And just who is paying you now?

331
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,763
I can't tell you that,
or my business will decline.

332
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,765
I was hired in Gyeongseong. Best I can do.

333
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,642
How did you know where I was going?

334
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,062
North Gando, Myeongjeong town,
building number 30, about there.

335
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,648
You ever so kindly laid out a note.

336
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,906
You almost left without a trace.

337
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,659
What happened there? That was sloppy, huh?

338
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:48,007
Mauser C96. That's a nice gun you've got.

339
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,468
Nambu, Type 14.

340
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,012
Lousy gun you've got there.

341
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:02,021
Nambu Type 14s
are pretty prone to misfires.

342
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,189
You know that, right?

343
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,942
You fire, and there's about a 30% chance
you kill yourself.

344
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,152
That's still a 70% chance we die together.

345
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,736
It's your choice, then.
Do you wanna take that bet?

346
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,864
Your life at 30%?

347
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,533
You'll pull the trigger, huh?

348
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,745
This will complicate things though.

349
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,122
Nothing complex about it.

350
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,958
The simple solution is
to put your gun down now.

351
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,044
Come on. This bitch gets paid
to kill whoever she's hired to kill.

352
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,212
That's who she is.

353
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,967
How could I not meet the client's request?
You trying to make my career dry out?

354
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,678
I need to die at someone else's hands.

355
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,430
What someone else?

356
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,141
Back there, you saw.

357
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,729
Choong-Soo is the one
who's gonna kill you?

358
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,611
What on earth did you do to that old man
to make him want you dead?

359
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,912
Something a person
should never do to another.

360
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,958
That's what I did.

361
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,880
And that is why I can't allow you
to be the one who kills me, you see.

362
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:11,799
I heard
you used to be with the Japanese.

363
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,680
Pretty sure I get the gist.

364
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,392
I know what you did
to that man after all, don't I?

365
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,692
All right.

366
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,445
We'll do it your way.

367
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,656
Don't get me wrong.
It's not as though I'm moved.

368
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,535
It's just that I think Choong-Soo
has the better right to kill you.

369
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,704
That's why I'm listening to you.

370
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,845
Choong-Soo has treated me really well
ever since I came here.

371
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,022
I'll report to my client
that I killed you, so that's that.

372
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,818
But if you ever happen
to run into me again in the future,

373
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,779
then I really will have to kill you.

374
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,957
I could shoot you just like this.

375
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,542
Like a coward.

376
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,547
Oh, yeah.

377
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,552
My client told me to make sure
to tell you this before you die.

378
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,012
"A dog

379
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,932
dies when it leaves its home."

380
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,983
Die well!

381
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,195
Hope you're born
in a better place in the next life.

382
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,882
Don't try to stop me!

383
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,550
Come on, Du-man, huh?

384
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,886
If you leave, too, how will we go on?

385
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,430
I just... I...
Let go! Let go! I'm leaving!

386
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,347
Stay!

387
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,391
What are you doing?
Come on! Hurry up!

388
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,438
Why are you back here?
It's raining. Go inside.

389
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,399
I was going to wait,
then I changed my mind.

390
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,568
It's best we talk now.

391
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,321
Gurye, six years ago.

392
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,740
Gurye is the reason that I came here.

393
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,548
I must say, this is quite unexpected.

394
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:03,971
What is it you need to say
in what took place in Gurye back then?

395
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,393
You already know, I'm sure,

396
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,480
that in order
to suppress freedom fighters,

397
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:16,525
the Japanese ordered and deployed
the Militia Round-up Campaign.

398
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,029
Countless soldiers
of the Righteous Army were killed.

399
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,698
Any who made it, they...

400
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,077
Manchuria is where I was told
they could be located.

401
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,289
Just as you came here.

402
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,001
And how do you know?

403
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,380
How did you learn all these things, then?

404
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,634
Because I was there at the time, sir.

405
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,978
I was their puppet.

406
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,730
A Japanese unit leader.

407
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,696
I tracked suspected militia members.

408
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,117
I'd learn your names
and movement patterns in great detail

409
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,369
and bring your locations back
to the Japanese.

410
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,454
One day, I was ordered,

411
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,291
"Find Choi Choong-Soo,
the invincible general,

412
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,669
apprehend him,
and show us the way to his hideout."

413
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,129
Once I accomplished this,

414
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,756
I was to see you imprisoned at Gwangju.

415
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,469
The location of your village
was reported to senior authorities...

416
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,056
because of me, sir.

417
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,601
Everything that happened
in Gurye six years ago,

418
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,188
it was all because of my actions.

419
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,315
Nobody move!

420
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,941
Nobody move!

421
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,818
Everybody, stay where you are!

422
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,987
Why are you acting like this, huh?

423
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,390
I told you already,
Choi Choong-soo already must have gone!

424
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,782
So what is this?

425
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,451
We've been given new orders.

426
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,870
Now that we've found
the invincible general's base,

427
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,953
we burn it down.

428
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,081
These people are innocent.

429
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,417
Most don't own a weapon.
Some are women and children!

430
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,501
These innocents

431
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,130
may turn into the next soldiers
of the Righteous Army.

432
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,674
Surely you understand
nobody is born into it, right?

433
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,927
All us humans start out innocent
until we start sinning.

434
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,637
Gwang-il, stop. It's not right.

435
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,724
Arguing like this, this is hopeless.

436
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,476
Put your gun away.

437
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,603
Gwang-il, don't do this.

438
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,981
Fine, all right.
You bow out, I'm permitting it.

439
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,777
- Okay!
- Yes, sir!

440
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,654
- Iguchi.
- What are you doing?

441
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,990
For all my life,

442
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,202
as long as I remember,
I have obeyed orders.

443
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,581
My whole life,
my role has been a lowly man's.

444
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,752
I thought, who am I to question
the wisdom of my betters

445
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,921
as a man born and raised in ignorance?

446
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,558
But because of me,

447
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,603
so many were murdered. Our countrymen.

448
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,744
Your family

449
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,789
also died on that day.

450
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,437
That's what it took...

451
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,230
...for me to finally realize...

452
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,109
Kill the infant girl too.

453
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,115
...that I'd been wrong.

454
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,581
I am not here looking to get sympathy.

455
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,884
Lee Yoon, holy shit!

456
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,052
Nobody move!

457
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:16,474
Sir, just give us the order
to open fire at that Joseon barbarian!

458
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,851
Shut up and lower your gun!

459
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,019
I won't obey!

460
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:23,147
You might be soft on other Joseons,
but I'm Japanese.

461
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,732
Hey.

462
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,112
You mouth off to me again, soldier,
or make another sound,

463
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,072
you're dead, understand?

464
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,909
You're hearing this, aren't you?

465
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,037
If you take this further,
I can't cover for you.

466
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,122
Hand it over now, okay?

467
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,125
Put the gun down, and we can talk...

468
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,131
What did I just say?

469
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,137
It was all because of me, sir.

470
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,882
You want me to forgive you
because you're repentant?

471
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,677
Why are you doing this, huh?

472
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,304
You'd like to hear me say
it's in the past?

473
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,225
These aren't any sins
that I can ever repent for.

474
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:45,020
And that wasn't my purpose
in coming to meet you.

475
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,778
Let me guess.

476
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,865
You think justice is through your death.

477
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,954
You want to be killed,
and that's why you've spoken so coldly?

478
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,499
You imagine if you were
to speak emotionally,

479
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,419
I'd let this go instead?

480
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,229
This is one twisted world we live in.

481
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,774
Both you...

482
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:33,944
and I.

483
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:50,336
But you're the one who caused the murders
of my wife and family.

484
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,133
So I cannot make peace
or console you as I might have.

485
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,179
I'm sorry.

486
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,684
You can disappear or all be killed!

487
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,727
You hear me?

488
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,734
Let's kill all these bastards!
Come on!

489
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,948
And don't you dare let
a single one get away!

490
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,951
Just hold still, damn it!

491
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,753
Hey, you can't run from us!

492
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,548
Kill the stupid bastards!

493
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,507
Get 'em!

494
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,266
Just where do you think
you're going, bitch? Huh?

495
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,113
Kill 'em all, boys! Get 'em!

496
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,460
- Look at this one here!
- Ye-bun!

497
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,383
Ye-bun, no!

498
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,069
No, no, my love!

499
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,366
No, no, no.

500
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,831
No, no.

501
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,595
I told you,
our Ye-bun has disappeared!

502
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,774
Aren't you going to do anything?

503
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,569
Our Ye-bun has been taken away!

504
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,450
Choong-soo, there isn't time
to do this, okay?

505
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:34,328
It's not too late.
Nodeoksan's still near, but we have to go.

506
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,622
Please! Choong-soo!

507
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:42,794
Say something, Choong-soo!
Say something, please!

508
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:47,090
Oh, my dear, no!

509
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,009
Nam-chun, come quickly!

510
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,553
Oh, no. My love!

511
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,263
My love.

512
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:56,892
My love!

513
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,189
- Why? Why?
- Someone do something!

514
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,610
Oh, my love!

515
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,029
You're really planning
to not respond to this?

516
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,865
I'm not able to do anything.

517
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,120
All the fight we had, we gave.

518
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,288
There are murdered families.

519
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,087
The last time innocents were killed,

520
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,881
I led a battle for retribution.

521
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,719
And then more innocents were killed.

522
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,687
But you already knew that.

523
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,658
Quit standing there
imagining that I'll kill you.

524
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,326
You get to see

525
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,871
how you like scraping by, huh?

526
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,583
Every day, having things stolen from you.

527
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,543
Enduring this kind of pain always.

528
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,588
Always running away, just making it.

529
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,842
You should have to live like this too.

530
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,904
MYEONGJEONG VILLAGE

531
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
I fold.

532
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,429
Ah! Whoo!

533
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,974
Hurry up, hurry up!

534
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,057
Again, again!

535
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,730
Oh gosh, Yoon!

536
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,483
I'm looking for where you keep your guns.

537
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,071
SEON-BOK HOTEL

538
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,737
Will he be all right, ma'am?
This friend of yours?

539
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,989
No matter how I picture it,

540
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,450
taking on Nodeoksan's gang
and going alone, it's just...

541
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,744
In Sapyeong, ten years ago,

542
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,497
Yoon took out a whole complement
of Russian men on his own, you see.

543
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:33,543
That's when he got the nickname
Gamjaesaja, the "Guardian Grim Reaper."

544
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,506
He's the reaper who watches.
The reaper who guides.

545
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,760
In passing, the meaning sounds nice,

546
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,012
but who does
the Grim Reaper guard, exactly?

547
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,973
Ones who are meant to die, of course.

548
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:51,311
Just like tonight,
a thunderstorm was raging that day.

549
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,356
Yoon snuck around
to the back of the artillery unit alone.

550
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:56,149
When the thunder struck...

551
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,359
...he shot.

552
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,362
And when the thunder struck again,

553
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,113
...so did he.

554
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,210
And again...

555
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,713
...and again.

556
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,385
The entire unit was ground into dust,
and that's how.

557
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,095
Are you beginning to understand?

558
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,951
Against Yoon, the size
of your gang doesn't make a difference.

559
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,619
You need to play smart.

560
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,207
If your plan is simply to outnumber him,

561
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,251
then one by one...

562
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,218
What was that?

563
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,099
Your gun! Get it!

564
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,900
One by one, leaving no trace...

565
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,069
Now, fire!

566
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,112
Shoot him!

567
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:32,245
Silently and unforeseen
until no one is left.

568
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,291
So don't waste your time
worrying about Yoon.

569
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,543
Worry about how to get rid of the bodies.

570
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,630
Get him!

571
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,841
In all probability,

572
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,594
today will mark the end
of Nodeoksan's banditry

573
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,471
and his entire sorry syndicate.

574
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,151
He's back there!

575
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,609
We're going.

576
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,894
Our Father, who art in heaven,

577
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,104
hallowed be thy name.

578
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,440
Thy kingdom come.

579
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,903
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

580
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:54,781
Give us this day our daily bread.

581
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,908
Forgive us our trespasses...

582
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,910
What? Who is that?

583
00:58:58,993 --> 00:58:59,993
Oh! Ye-bun!

584
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,997
How can this...

585
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,251
Oh my. Oh my! Goodness, Ye-bun!

586
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,087
Oh my!

587
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,635
Father!

588
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,680
Hey. Oh.

589
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,031
Did you want to die so badly
that you'd attack that hideout

590
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:39,492
and Nodeoksan without any reinforcements?

591
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,036
That's not completely the reason.

592
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,914
I was just reminded of the past.

593
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,835
I saw the exact same faces here
that I saw in Gurye so much time ago.

594
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,463
You explained it to me earlier.

595
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:56,050
It's those who have been stolen from.
Those who've had to run away.

596
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,762
Those who live in pain every day.
I saw their faces.

597
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:01,263
Ye-bun.

598
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,267
That's the reason I fought there.

599
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,185
I once made those faces,

600
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,606
and I wanted to wash them clean.

601
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,694
What occurred,

602
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:19,240
does it still haunt you
and torment you that awfully, even now?

603
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:23,536
I truly apologize.

604
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,663
All the blame is mine.

605
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:33,379
What can I call you, by the way?
I never asked you that.

606
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:35,882
Lee Yoon, I'm called.

607
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,594
With the breakdown in our country,

608
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,347
you made a plan to become the king?

609
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,056
Lee Yoon.

610
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,476
King Gyeongjong's name, see.

611
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,272
He didn't do anything much
that was remarkable as ruler.

612
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:55,234
He was incompetent, sickly,
swept up in politics, and purged subjects.

613
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:59,322
Yet, for all those flaws,
he did one thing correctly.

614
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,950
To the end, he protected his rival,
the Crown Prince, his half-brother.

615
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:06,537
In the heat of bitter politics,
he defended his brother.

616
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,040
His family remained safe until the end.

617
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,504
And what of you?

618
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,590
Is your namesake
something you plan to honor?

619
01:01:19,884 --> 01:01:22,303
Will you see your countrymen here
as your family,

620
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,140
let them all depend on your protection
and possibly die for them?

621
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,100
You never know.

622
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:32,063
It might be one of these people
who uplift Joseon

623
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,732
as did King Yeongjo
or King Jeongjo the Great.

624
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:38,361
You've already decided to die anyway.

625
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,364
And if you made it meaningful instead,

626
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,286
is that not a greater way
to repent for your past, Yoon?

627
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,996
A way to amend transgressions?

628
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,209
We'll be dealing
with a bloodbath before long.

629
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,212
Rumor is Japan's sending
its occupying army here to us any day now.

630
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,297
Then they must plan
to take over and run Manchuria.

631
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,466
Goodness.

632
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,677
Mounted bandits, the police.

633
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,012
The Japanese
and their out-of-control army.

634
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,140
What will ensue for the Joseon here?

635
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,981
I'm not sure the time is right for me.

636
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,316
What do you mean by that?

637
01:02:17,942 --> 01:02:19,318
What obstacles are there?

638
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,529
I have nothing to my name right now.

639
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:25,408
No power. I own no land. Have no money.

640
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,285
To survive in a place like this...

641
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:35,543
it'll take people with us here.
That's all we've potentially got.

642
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,380
Who of sound mind
would consider coming here to us?

643
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,551
Those who have been treated
with malice and cruelty,

644
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,679
who have been driven out
from their houses and homelands.

645
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,891
That kind of person will come to join us.

646
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,815
Those who want back
what was stolen from them

647
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,817
and can no longer bear to run away...

648
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:09,076
...who mean to repay
all their enemies in kind.

649
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,172
People with nothing left to lose,

650
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,758
with nothing to depend on,
and no reason to keep going.

651
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,302
Those men. We'll need people like that.

652
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,972
And then, once you're done
assembling your gang of outcasts,

653
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,016
what do you intend, then?

654
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,310
Then we resist.

655
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,897
This is our way of defending Joseon.

656
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,483
I know we can't raise an army,

657
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,069
so we'll fight as bandits.
