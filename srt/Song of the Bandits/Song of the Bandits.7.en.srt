1
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,644
This feels strange.

2
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:23,732
A few days ago, I was in Myeongjeong
as a government official,

3
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,609
and now I'm going there
as an independence fighter.

4
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,241
That's one of many aspects
of your changing circumstances.

5
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,203
How you perceive those around you,
the places that you're in.

6
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,081
I suppose you're right.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,379
Ōoka's someone you'd best be mindful of,
then delivering the money should go well,

8
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,257
and you'll be safe
when you return to Gyeongseong.

9
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,471
Ōoka's actually
that... that dangerous of a person?

10
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,140
I did mean my words before.

11
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,851
A great many aspects of
your situation are changed.

12
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,274
You must long after your home.
After Japan.

13
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,817
All the time.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,320
I even went there in a dream recently.

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,448
My family and I saw
the city's cherry blossoms all together.

16
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,116
Hey, you asshole!

17
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,494
How dare you trick me?

18
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,662
Do you wanna die?

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,290
Tell me! What trick did you pull?

20
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,335
Am I supposed to believe
that you honestly won five times in a row?

21
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,212
I didn't cheat you. I mean it.

22
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,797
Please, I didn't.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,131
What are you saying?

24
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:34,469
Hey, how do you idiots
not know how to speak Japanese?

25
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,137
Lay your gun down, sir.

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,599
In Myeongjeong,
it is illegal to use your gun.

27
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:40,850
Who the fuck are you?

28
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,353
Just the commissioner
with the Consulate General of Japan.

29
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,063
Ōoka, at your service.

30
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,898
So why not just set your gun down?

31
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,193
This asshole
swindled me out of my money!

32
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,321
Swindling at cards.

33
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,614
It's contemptible.

34
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,659
Still, you can't use a weapon here,

35
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:58,742
so put it down.

36
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,415
And should I refuse?

37
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,422
Officers at the Consulate?
Who the hell cares?

38
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,093
How dare a lowly policeman tell
a soldier of the great Emperor's Army...

39
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,492
Here in Myeongjeong,

40
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,121
the orders you must adhere to
are mine alone.

41
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,083
Should the whole world
become embroiled in war,

42
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,296
our town, Myeongjeong,
will stay peaceful and without incident.

43
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,339
That's the only way

44
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,051
I get to return to the country I love.

45
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,262
Here in Myeongjeong, you see...

46
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,143
...the law is what I say.

47
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,797
Keep your head down.

48
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,909
Must have been a long journey.

49
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,308
It's nice to meet you.
Call me Nam Hee-shin.

50
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,227
At your service, lady.

51
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,522
Oh God,
I started talking like a slave again.

52
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,085
Yes, it's Seon-bok. Hi. Kim Seon-bok.

53
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,188
"Seon" meaning kind,
and "Bok" meaning good fortune.

54
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,794
Good fortune will come to me since I...

55
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,154
I'm talking all night,
and you're both tired. Let's go in.

56
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,991
Come on. You must be exhausted, hmm?

57
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,076
Gosh, you're so beautiful. In we go.

58
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,882
SONG OF THE BANDITS

59
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,598
Here you go.

60
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,357
Take your time.
Make yourself at home. Get comfortable.

61
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,149
Oh goodness.

62
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,405
What is this?
What is up with your face? What?

63
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,325
You're too pretty! So gorgeous, gosh!

64
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,869
I wanna take your skin
and put it over mine, you know?

65
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,332
Don't be alarmed. I'm only kidding!
Go on and laugh, huh?

66
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,505
I got in touch with the ones
who can assist you.

67
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,841
Don't be anxious from now on.
The Independence Army will come.

68
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,885
- Okay.
- Get some rest, then.

69
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,553
I'm much obliged.

70
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,815
Ah shit.

71
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,358
What's the matter now?

72
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,027
"The matter now"?
Right up there, that girl.

73
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,197
I'll find you a carrier
for the independence funds.

74
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,658
I'll do it because it's you asking me to,
and you know that.

75
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,244
I just do not have
the greatest feeling about all this.

76
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,539
Yoon, what we are now doing
is a whole lot more criminal

77
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,290
than selling guns under the radar.

78
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,294
You know what it means
to get involved with them.

79
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,128
That is how we will die.

80
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,630
I can only put my trust in you, Noonim.

81
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,466
Oh God, this is... Oh!

82
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:11,305
Oh my. Honey, did you need any?
I... I mean, Miss... Miss Nam.

83
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,309
You must be tired.

84
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,728
Why didn't you rest any longer?

85
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,814
I couldn't sleep.

86
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,568
The time was short, still.

87
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:28,906
Many things occurred,
and I received so much help from you.

88
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,409
Thank you for all you did.

89
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,455
Don't worry about me any longer now.

90
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,124
Go home where I'm sure they need you.

91
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,836
You and your friends will all be
living here together for a long time.

92
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,841
I wouldn't like to come in between
you and the others or cause greater pain.

93
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,054
I can't, not at the moment.

94
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,726
The person who is pursuing you
is a very tenacious man.

95
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,271
He's not apt to turn and abandon this.

96
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,524
Are you...

97
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,821
and that officer
acquainted with each other?

98
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,707
He used to be my master.

99
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:25,213
He took in my younger sibling and I
after we lost our parents.

100
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,550
Then the Gabo Reform let us be friends.

101
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,013
Then Japan wanted young soldiers,
and we enlisted together.

102
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,144
Now, I'm not sure anymore what we are.

103
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:50,571
If you don't mind saying,
what was it that caused your parents...

104
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,034
Well, my mother died young
when she gave birth to my younger sibling.

105
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
And my father...

106
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,082
...he was executed by our fellow countrymen.

107
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,138
He enlisted in the army
to guard our country,

108
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,433
but he was framed
for stealing war supplies.

109
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:24,480
He was betrayed
by the people he was intended to protect.

110
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,108
Have you ever thought about

111
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,777
searching for whoever framed your father?

112
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,196
Your parents' killer is near.

113
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,615
Gando, that's what I heard.

114
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,452
Gando is still quite vague.
Should I find out exactly?

115
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,663
I thought about it, naturally.

116
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,959
That was all I did in the end.

117
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,797
Bringing my parents justice,
holding grudges, and all that.

118
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,927
My big plans for revenge seem
so utterly useless to me now, you know?

119
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,724
None of that's meant
for those of us in my station.

120
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,435
We can be deprived of our country.

121
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,147
Our parents can endure
betrayal and murder, and that's it.

122
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,442
We just have to live with it
as life flows by.

123
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,903
Learning our will is irrelevant.

124
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,740
Tossed here and there by the world.

125
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,075
But as I accepted that kind of life...

126
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,455
I realized I'd become
the same kind of person

127
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,290
as those who had killed my parents.

128
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,876
Killing my countrymen with my own hands,

129
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,713
deserting the people I needed to protect.

130
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,217
That's why I came all this way to Gando.

131
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,264
Other than disappearing or being killed,

132
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,017
there were no more options there.

133
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,901
You don't have to bear
the pain of these times completely alone.

134
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,695
It ought to be shared...

135
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,949
with others who are like us,

136
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,243
who suffer the same sadness as us,

137
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,789
who are withstanding the times
side by side.

138
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,690
Hands up.

139
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,284
Hey! Don't move!

140
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,170
To hell with you,
you fucking Joseon bitch.

141
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,713
Arrest her!

142
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:36,922
Yes, sir!

143
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,559
Enough.

144
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,243
Why come back here to Myeongjeong?

145
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:17,004
Whoever took the money
has to die, that's why.

146
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,008
If that's the case,
you should tell me who has it.

147
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,262
Now, if I were to do that,

148
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,849
then you'd just go out
and catch that person, right?

149
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,477
If you do that...

150
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,941
well then, I will die instead.

151
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,321
Choose not to tell me,
I'll make yours a painful death.

152
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,865
Are you still not going to tell me?

153
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,207
Nanam Division Command,
Major Miura Shohei.

154
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,253
Call him. Get him here.

155
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,682
Am I speaking with Major Miura?

156
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,225
Good evening.

157
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,061
This is Gando Superintendent Ōoka
calling for you.

158
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,022
Yes? Why are you calling?

159
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,358
We have brought in a woman to the station,

160
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:23,863
and I would like to ascertain the truth
of a few things with you, Major.

161
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,993
According to her story,
the reason she came to Myeongjeong

162
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,911
is because you ordered her

163
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,415
to find and kill the carrier of
the stolen railway Bureau funds.

164
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,498
Is what she says true?

165
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,755
I need your honesty
regarding such a serious subject, you see.

166
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,384
As you know,
Myeongjeong is in Chinese territory.

167
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,304
Executing such an order on foreign soil,

168
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,347
that would likely cause
a diplomatic incident.

169
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,143
Don't suppose I could...
I could converse with her personally?

170
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,896
I'd like to check for myself who she is.

171
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,864
Yes?

172
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,783
Don't talk much.

173
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,912
Are Yoon and whoever
the money's with in Myeongjeong?

174
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,706
Yes.

175
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,586
And that Ōoka, the superintendent whoever,
is trying to outwit us, isn't he?

176
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,965
Don't tell me you spilled our information.

177
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,927
Please. I wouldn't.

178
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,762
You're certain of that, are you?

179
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,557
Listen, you mess up,
and my work's wasted, you understand?

180
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,267
I swear to you. I didn't tell.

181
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,190
Please come and get me out fast.

182
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,737
How can I do what you told me to

183
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,781
if I'm stuck here in a prison cell?

184
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,955
I'll talk to Ōoka. Just bring him back.

185
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,292
Go ahead, sir.

186
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,130
- I really don't know who she is.
- Huh?

187
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,384
- But you were...
- It's the first I've heard of such things.

188
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,721
I don't know that woman,
and I don't know what she's talking about.

189
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,309
Nor am I currently pursuing
anyone suspected of carrying stolen funds.

190
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,813
I think it's quite likely
that she's crazy.

191
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,732
Then are you saying
that we are permitted to do as we will?

192
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,737
Yes, you're permitted.

193
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,949
Do what you see fit regarding the girl.

194
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,496
Understood, Major.
Very sorry to bother you.

195
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,919
When did we last execute
an Independence Army soldier?

196
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,629
A little
over a month ago, sir.

197
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,715
It's been a while, hasn't it?

198
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,557
Yamada won't need to know until it's done.
We'll execute her tomorrow afternoon.

199
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Yes, sir!

200
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,436
Wait. Wait!

201
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,980
What reason do you have for this, Ōoka?

202
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,149
Tell me what he said!

203
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,569
Hey! Miura, what did he say? Hey!

204
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,910
Major, sir. The heavy weapons platoon,
and the mounted officers,

205
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,912
and the infantry that we requested
have made it.

206
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,248
We're gonna put an end to this
promptly but cleanly,

207
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,833
the way it was supposed to go.

208
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,920
First thing, we'll find out who they are
before Superintendent Ōoka does.

209
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:31,425
And make sure
to kill all the rebel bastards.

210
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,309
Wait, Major,
have you thought this through?

211
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,228
A diplomatic incident with China
is almost certainly...

212
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,356
All right, what's your brilliant idea?

213
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,359
I'm trying to avoid us both
being shot to death, you idiot!

214
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,482
We'll simply make an excuse

215
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:54,031
that we were chasing down rebels
in the Hamgyeong area.

216
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,241
Just trust me.

217
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,585
Turn on the light!

218
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,963
There's a saying.

219
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,216
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

220
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,718
The meaning of the saying is

221
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,472
that one must not forget the favors
or the kindnesses they were portioned.

222
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,141
I'm charging you with one task.

223
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,312
Your mission is to find and capture
all who have bitten our hand.

224
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,947
The ungrateful Joseon
independence fighters

225
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,907
betrayed our great empire of Japan

226
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,701
after it modernized and developed
Joseon land for them.

227
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,082
They have forgotten that Japan ended
the 500-year Joseon dynasty

228
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,042
and freed them from its exploitation.

229
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,919
They are no more than rabid dogs!

230
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,671
Therefore,

231
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,424
you must not feel guilty.

232
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,385
Murder every Joseon dog.

233
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,720
- Do we understand?
- Yes, sir!

234
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:00,763
Once again!

235
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,391
Yes, sir!

236
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,352
Good.

237
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,607
I'll be there soon

238
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,443
to kill you, Lee Yoon.

239
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,479
Here, here.

240
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,817
- Get the carriage ready.
- Yes.

241
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,790
An Independence Army soldier
can meet you in six hours.

242
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,043
Nearby to Mount Cheonbo
is a railway construction site.

243
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,002
Go there.

244
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,085
Thanks.

245
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,523
At any second now,
the Japanese could arrive.

246
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,776
For our people here,
we need to stay alert!

247
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:36,859
Yes, sir!

248
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,239
Choong-soo!

249
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,744
We're in trouble. I spoke to Il-shik,
who was scouting in Musan.

250
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,913
He said a proper Japanese army
is headed here.

251
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,248
They're past the Duman by now.

252
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,209
Those men are making their way here.
Is that what you're saying?

253
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,004
That's not it.
Myeongjeong is where he suspected.

254
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,249
What should we do about boss?

255
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,592
Escaping an army
is more than boss can manage on his own.

256
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,762
Asshole, saying that'll bring bad luck,
so shut it.

257
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,098
Seems we are all caught in this battle.

258
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,683
The fight for independence.

259
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,899
To Myeongjeong!

260
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:16,983
Yes, sir!

261
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,593
- Is that Myeongjeong?
- Yes.

262
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,973
I think that our best option
is to make this sudden and quick.

263
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,560
Ishida, you take the cavalry.

264
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,730
- That's a good location there.
- Sir.

265
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,774
- Tae-ju, bring the infantry and follow.
- Sir.

266
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,361
Let's go.

267
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,916
We're prepared, sir.

268
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,294
Let's do this, then.

269
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,154
I guess this is really the end.

270
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,450
I can't thank you enough.

271
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,994
There's nothing I can really do
to pay you back now,

272
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,871
but I will someday.

273
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,879
I wanted to assist you, so I did.
You don't owe me a thing.

274
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,342
I hope you get to see
Joseon's independence one day.

275
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,719
Also, that

276
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,681
you'll be happy as well.

277
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,603
It's time. Let's get going.

278
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,813
Let's go.

279
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,699
Is anyone inside?

280
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,327
What was that?

281
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,333
What are they doing?

282
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,630
Anyone inside?

283
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,466
Are they the ones you ran into
on your way? Are they Master's?

284
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,718
Yeah.

285
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,219
Shit.

286
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,598
Stay here for a minute.

287
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,184
I'll go and threaten them,
then we can get out of here.

288
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:00,272
How are you going
to keep them away?

289
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,357
I think you should take her.

290
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,944
I'll lure the men away so you can run.

291
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,113
You know those independents. I don't.

292
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,366
What the hell are you talking about? Hey!

293
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,828
I can't throw them off my scent the whole
way to Cheonbo Mountain like you can.

294
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,580
Don't even worry about it.

295
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,582
I'll go take care of it, okay?

296
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,377
Don't get hurt for me, all right?
Understand?

297
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,712
Be careful.

298
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,590
What do you mean by that?

299
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,592
I am Seon-bok, aren't I?

300
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,094
There's not a damn thing in Gando
I need to fear.

301
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,599
SEDITIOUS JOSEON PERSON

302
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,808
Listen up!

303
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:43,356
This girl here aided Joseon terrorists
in their activities here in Gando

304
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,983
and is thus a traitor.

305
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,531
This imposter here
who has been brought to her knees

306
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,203
is a soldier of the independence
that you adore so much.

307
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,333
Excuse me?

308
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,460
Anybody here?

309
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,506
Nanam 19th Division Command.

310
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,384
Oh gosh.

311
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,971
How can I assist?
Booking a room, huh? Is that correct?

312
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,599
Ah, not exactly.
Nanam 19th Division Command.

313
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,808
Han Tae-ju is my name.

314
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,101
Goodness.

315
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,395
I'm here seeking
Independence Army soldiers.

316
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,856
We have reason to think
they are moving stolen funds.

317
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,276
According to the villagers,
two outsiders rented rooms here.

318
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,153
- Not anymore, no.
- Huh?

319
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,446
They picked up early.

320
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,490
This morning,
they got up super early and left us.

321
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,117
They left early this morning?
Are you positive?

322
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,537
Yes, of course. I'd know.

323
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,748
Hmm. Then you'll allow my soldiers
to search the building?

324
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,792
- Oh no, I'm afraid not.
- What?

325
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,962
Uh! What do you mean "what"?
I said you can't.

326
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,297
We're not open.
Our guests sleep very late. Yeah?

327
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,299
You know what?

328
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,468
I despise you Joseon dogs.

329
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,929
However, of all of you,

330
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,932
the independence fighters
are who I hate the most.

331
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,309
Ungrateful traitors like this woman here.

332
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,109
Our plan has gotten complicated.

333
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,403
You should be ready for trouble.

334
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,157
Well, you, um...

335
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,160
Unless you cooperate,
using force is my only option.

336
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,747
And I'm advising that you help us
unless trouble is what you're after!

337
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,710
Oh, silly me! I'll cooperate!

338
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,313
I can be so... so brainless sometimes.
I swear. Oh, I'm so sorry.

339
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,632
I should have realized those were threats.
Sorry. I'll cooperate. Yes, yeah.

340
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,676
Just wait. Just wait a moment.
Yes. Goodness.

341
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,846
Of course I'll cooperate
with you, Officer.

342
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,014
Yes, of course.

343
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,516
Whoa.

344
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,437
What... Ma'am, what are you...
Whoa. Just... Whoa.

345
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,357
Whoa! Hey, hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

346
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,693
Look, ma'am. Lower the gun.

347
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,863
Don't give me orders.
Nobody does that anymore.

348
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,466
There's not a single person here in Gando
that bosses me around.

349
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,077
No matter where you go
in this world,

350
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,747
there is no land
that belongs to your people.

351
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,251
And so, if any of you plan
to continue living in Myeongjeong,

352
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,420
don't act out. Stay low.

353
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:15,717
'Cause even the slightest trouble,
and you'll meet this same fate.

354
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,304
- Go ahead, do it.
- Sir.

355
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,689
Do you even know how to shoot?
Just put... put the gun down now!

356
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,075
Look at that. I'm a good shot, huh?

357
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,979
Guess I should have known better.

358
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,745
Now you boys run along,

359
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,708
else I'll land a bullet
smack between your eyes.

360
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,709
You've aged a lot
since I last saw you.

361
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,967
But you still make far too much noise.

362
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,844
And even still...

363
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,973
you're still so uncouth.

364
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,772
- Was that a gunshot just now?
- In town, there's an army, sir.

365
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,607
A what? The warlords?

366
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,276
It's not them.
It's the 19th Division Command.

367
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,569
The 19th.

368
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,033
Lock her back in her cell for now
and keep an eye on her.

369
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,202
- Yes, sir!
- Everybody else, follow me!

370
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,286
Yes, sir!

371
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,832
Move it! Move!

372
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,294
Hello again.

373
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,629
Yoon's inside, right?

374
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,506
Don't lie to me now,

375
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,677
or I'll be persuaded to beat some sense
into you like old times.

376
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,470
Take your army and get lost.

377
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,515
Your time as my master
is over and done now.

378
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:49,227
So Yoon is in there, then.

379
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,106
You're still truly hopeless
at deception, huh.

380
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,776
You're obstructing business here,
so get lost!

381
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,947
When Joseon was beaten,
there was one thing that didn't sit right.

382
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,699
Do you know what it was?

383
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,827
Peasants like you act up
since being liberated, you see.

384
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,955
But dogs like you and Yoon
don't know how to live without collars.

385
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,791
All of you start trying
to bite your owners, don't you?

386
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,091
So the gun goes down,

387
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,469
and you bring me Yoon.

388
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,513
Should you make a bad decision,

389
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,475
I'll kill you first
and then raze this town to the ground.

390
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
Move!

391
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,280
I figured you'd do this.

392
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,573
Choose beating.

393
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,916
You, restrain her.

394
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,999
Yes, sir!

395
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,802
Be quick. Break in there immediately!

396
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,054
Squad one, squad two!

397
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,180
Yes, sir!

398
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,114
I can go out there myself.

399
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,425
They believe I work for
the Joseon government for now, after all.

400
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,451
It could be worth a go.

401
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,331
I don't want you to be harmed
because of me, all right?

402
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,333
He won't
trust your words easily, miss.

403
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,919
If something happens to me,
then you can go out

404
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,673
and say that I abducted you
and held you against your will.

405
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,800
Blame me.
You will need to make it sound convincing.

406
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,510
No matter what, you must condemn me.

407
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,594
I can't.

408
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,722
That's not something I can do.

409
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,019
You've been protecting me
with your own life until now,

410
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,855
so how could I do that?

411
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,150
I'm just a passerby in your life.

412
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,696
Protect what's precious to you, miss...

413
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,956
and I will protect what's precious to me.

414
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,437
You're not going out there?

415
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,565
I sure hear a lot of shooting.

416
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,232
Shut up!

417
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,157
You're afraid, is that it?

418
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,868
You're scared to head out there, huh.

419
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,329
Shut up!

420
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,584
If you're that scared, just run away.

421
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,213
They're not going to thank you.

422
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,675
How many times do I have to say shut up?

423
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,332
I think it's over, Major.

424
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,431
Get in there, soldiers! Now!

425
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,514
Yes, sir!

426
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,107
What are you doing here?

427
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,620
You're clearly the consulate authorities.

428
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,831
I head the Nanam 19th Division.

429
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,914
Miura Sho...

430
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,717
It's my turn to ask what you're doing.

431
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,512
Leave this place immediately
unless you wanna die.

432
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,358
Miura, you're a dead man.

433
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,027
I apologize.

434
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,529
However, I cannot do that.

435
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,324
I told you to retreat.

436
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,366
I can't do that.

437
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,579
Get the hell out of my town
right now, jackass!

438
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,582
You're causing trouble,
and I won't stand it.

439
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,129
I just told you
I cannot do that.

440
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,507
If I tell you to piss off,
then piss off!

441
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,843
Here in Myeongjeong, the rules are simple.
The law is what I say.

442
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,762
You ought to be cautious.

443
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,223
No one, except His Majesty the Emperor,
can say such things.

444
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,558
Just stay put, asshole.

445
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,817
You've got the gall to lecture me
on Japanese loyalty, do you?

446
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,402
If you want to pretend to be Japanese,

447
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,948
you'd better learn to talk like us.

448
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,034
Not with that uncivilized Joseon accent.

449
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,127
Speak that way once again,

450
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,255
you'll discover
I'm not gonna stand for it.

451
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,965
Oh!

452
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,509
Come on, stay still. Shit.

453
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:38,719
What will you do, huh?

454
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,431
You are just a Joseon man
pretending to be Japanese,

455
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,560
whereas I am a Japanese national.

456
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,020
What can you do?

457
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,438
It's ludicrous.

458
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:54,694
No matter how hard you try to be Japanese,
you can't eradicate the stench of garlic!

459
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,237
You prick, shut your damn mouth!

460
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,322
- What the hell, you bastard!
- Major!

461
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,409
Oh shit.

462
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,620
Enemy fire!

463
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,707
Hold your fire!

464
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,878
Hold your fire!

465
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,673
Don't lose her! Find the enemy!

466
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,645
Get the girl!

467
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,939
Kill that girl!

468
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,234
That Joseon whore! Don't let her live!

469
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,627
Shoot that woman now!

470
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,477
Get her!

471
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,697
Go!

472
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,159
Let's go, sir! Get up now, sir!

473
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,621
And why are you here?

474
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,291
Not to kill you today, so don't worry.

475
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,293
Is there a back door here?

476
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,836
A back door? I would've used it.

477
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,466
Our best chance will be killing them
and walking out, then, right?

478
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,803
Uh-huh.

479
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,181
Shit.

480
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,933
Don't just stand there! Go!

481
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,517
Now go!

482
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,859
Not much choice, is there?

483
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:03,114
Well, let's do it, then.
Let's do what we're best at, shall we?

484
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,991
Other than disappearing or being killed...

485
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,994
There's nothing else
this bitch and this bastard can do.

486
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,207
Let's make them see that.

487
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,857
Second floor!
Head to the second floor! Get going!

488
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,989
Shit.

489
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,073
- Grenade!
- Run!

490
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,758
You demented jackasses. Shit!

491
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:29,760
Not the hotel!

492
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,024
No!

493
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,286
Hold her.

494
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,856
Get that fucking son of a bitch now!

495
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,191
Yes, sir!

496
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,497
And then, once you're done
assembling your gang of outcasts,

497
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,123
what do you intend then?

498
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,791
Then we resist.

499
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,211
This is our way of defending Joseon.

500
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,087
I know we can't raise an army,

501
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,257
so we'll fight as bandits.

502
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,761
Bandits who rob and steal?

503
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,348
- Do you mean that kind of bandit?
- No.

504
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,809
The kind who tell their stories
with the sound made by swords.

505
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:06,815
Isn't it time we let the Japanese hear
the song of the bandits?

506
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,235
There's no time to waste!

507
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,820
Let us annihilate

508
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,532
each and all

509
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,952
of those bastards!

510
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,881
Let's go, Major!

511
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,889
Let go! Let go, you assholes!

512
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,143
Oh.

513
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,360
- Hey!
- Oh!

514
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,864
That jackass. Use the bloody stairs.

515
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,050
Oh! Geumsu!

516
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,969
Geumsu.

517
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,037
What is this?
Now there's a whole bunch more of them!

518
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,580
Let's hurry and get this done!

519
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:34,963
They're doing great!

520
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,467
Oh shit. That bastard tied me up
so bloody tightly, I can't...

521
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,636
Stop swearing! You'll get noticed!

522
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,478
- San-gun. What the hell?
- Stay still, stay still.

523
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:52,272
- Stay still. Stay still, Seon-bok!
- It's me, Kim Seon-bok!

524
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,234
Go, go.

525
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,739
You need to learn to use a gun.

526
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,783
You're so behind with that bow, old man.

527
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,160
It's not wise
to underestimate an old warrior, you punk.

528
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,037
Not underestimating. Feeling sorry.

529
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,539
Ah! Sweating up a storm.

530
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:12,000
Just stop your bullshitting,
be alert, and let's see this done.

531
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,670
All these insolent bastards.
Hey, take this!

532
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,339
Be careful, be careful! Drop now!

533
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,968
Go, go! Go, go!

534
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,516
Yoon!

535
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,027
What the hell are you doing?

536
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,490
Hurry up.
Take her to the Independence Army.

537
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,909
Don't worry about all this.

538
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,992
The time has come
for you to fight for the country.

539
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,036
Now go!

540
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:33,749
I will take care of our family here.

541
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,461
They will hear the song of the bandits.

542
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,172
I'll be right back.

543
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,723
Here!

544
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,600
Be careful.

545
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,775
Come on, come on, come on!

546
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,362
Hurry.

547
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,645
Kill them all!

548
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,765
You all right?

549
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,164
It's all right.

550
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,005
You'll have to walk starting from here.
I will get on my way.

551
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,089
I'm grateful.

552
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:31,343
Who's that? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

553
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,080
Hey!

554
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,833
The ones who came in this carriage,
where are they?

555
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,377
Tell me!

556
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,552
They made it.

557
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,470
You should hurry.

558
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,807
And don't feel guilty about any of this.

559
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,116
You have to get to the other side safely

560
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,937
so that Joseon can have
the future you dream about.

561
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,981
Last time we were running,

562
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,608
the words that you said...

563
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,902
Live, no matter what the cost.

564
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,448
As long as I live, you must survive.

565
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,492
I'll say the same to you.

566
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,912
Live, no matter what the cost.

567
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,752
For as long as I live, you must survive...

568
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,132
so that we'll meet again.

569
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,473
I'll go now.

570
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,768
Thank you for everything.

571
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,157
One more thing.

572
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,621
The next time we meet again...

573
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,208
please tell me your name.

574
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,794
Two years or 20 years.

575
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,379
However long it is, it doesn't matter.

576
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,132
Let us swear

577
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,052
that we'll meet again.

578
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,093
Lee Yoon.

579
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,054
My name is Lee Yoon.

580
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,852
Try to return with your life, Lee Yoon.

581
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,775
I will stay alive
and come find you, Hee-shin.

582
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,127
Have we...

583
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,381
Have we met each other before somewhere?

584
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,427
No.

585
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,471
We've never met before.
