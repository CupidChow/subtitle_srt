1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,057
To all the policemen
serving here in Myeongjeong,

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,811
under the Japanese
Consulate General of Gando,

3
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,148
I hereby order you
to enter the police station

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,525
and to put those insurrectionists
in the ground!

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,738
You will immediately subdue those
Joseon-born rebels

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,532
who have seized
and are illegally occupying

7
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:36,619
an asset of the Japanese empire
and shoot them to death!

8
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,165
That is the way of
the great Empire of Japan we serve

9
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,085
and the way to show
your undying patriotism for Japan too!

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,128
Listen up!

11
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,339
Charge in there!

12
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,383
Charge!

13
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:55,847
Why aren't you... Why aren't you charging?

14
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,393
You saw for yourself how scary they are,
didn't you, General Yamada, sir?

15
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,479
We'd all just like to survive this.

16
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,607
Are you really willing
to betray our emperor?

17
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,150
All men!

18
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,196
Are you really going to betray Japan, huh?

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,782
Go now! Get in there!

20
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,176
All of you men
just standing there,

21
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,013
are you really willing
to... to betray His Majesty's grace?

22
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,849
Well then, you go ahead, sir, and lead us.

23
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,769
You owe our ruler
lots more than us policemen.

24
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,941
I suppose... I don't owe him...

25
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,528
I don't owe a whole lot, actually,
wouldn't you agree?

26
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,657
I, you know... you know,
I haven't laid eyes on the man.

27
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,995
All right, then! Just hold tight, then!

28
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:03,623
Yoon,
we don't have a lot of guns.

29
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,710
We can't hold out like this.

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,630
Noonim.

31
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,592
Any back pocket plans?

32
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,054
You've been living here longer than us.

33
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,348
You know this place well.

34
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,433
So talk to me.

35
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,605
Uh, well,
there might be a possibility, but...

36
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,025
Ah, no way. It's too much risk.

37
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:34,154
Jang Ki-ryong is returning,
and when he gets here...

38
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,158
he will kill all of us, got it?

39
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,371
If we have to wait for them
to come back and hack us into pieces...

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,208
Yoon, I

41
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,460
would rather us try

42
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,213
even something reckless, hmm?

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,007
Tell us that plan, Seon-bok.

44
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,010
What was that possibility you mentioned?

45
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,182
Well, to start,
someone'll have to sneak out.

46
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,809
There was a wagon stored at my inn.

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,812
If one of us could bring it here,
we could stop this whole damn thing!

48
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,608
Seon-bok, just what is in that wagon?

49
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,904
Ah, stop putting this off
and tell us in detail. Come on.

50
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,908
A Maxim machine gun, you know it?

51
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,702
A lot of money went to the Czech boys
to get my hands on it.

52
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,454
It'll do the trick, believe me.

53
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,998
But for someone to go and get it, huh?

54
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,917
Better be nimble, agile, swift,

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,377
and somehow able to dodge
all those bullets whizzing by.

56
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,800
Hmm?

57
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,095
What?

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
Why are you all looking in this direction?

59
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,395
I'm starting to get worried.

60
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,564
Shit.

61
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,067
Shooting a gun straight is required. Shit.

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,195
Ah, right, shit.

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,406
Fuck it all.

64
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,080
Uh... uh, sir?

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,790
Consulate General, sir.

66
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,709
Shouldn't we at least try
something at this juncture?

67
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,088
Like... like, charging in
or shooting in there, concentrated shots.

68
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,966
Ōoka would surely try a tactic,
wouldn't he?

69
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,969
What are you saying?

70
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,679
You mean to say that

71
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,224
Ōoka is what, superior?
He's better than me at this?

72
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,022
It's not too late.

73
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,692
Tell me now. I'll go instead.

74
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,694
Eh, I'll be okay.

75
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,572
This type of thing? Sneaking, stealing...
I'm better than you are.

76
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,619
Just be careful. And bring this.

77
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,246
Just in case.

78
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,208
There's no use bringing along
something I'm not really able to use.

79
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,793
Just keep it. This will go quick.

80
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,798
Mmm.

81
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,552
I'll go, then.

82
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,179
You all stay here and stay alive.

83
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,537
That... that shit. That piece of shit.

84
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,355
Why's he talking like he's just
gonna go out there to get killed?

85
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,151
Shit.

86
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,611
Oh!

87
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,364
That was so fucking close.

88
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,414
What now?

89
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,207
Wait, wait, sir!

90
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,611
- Stop it! Shut up!
- Sir, just...

91
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,628
Everyone, stand by for now!

92
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,712
Stand by!

93
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,635
Shut up!

94
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,597
Ah shit, mother...

95
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,766
Ah shit.

96
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,437
- Sir, think about this!
- Enough!

97
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,692
Ah, for fuck's sake!

98
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:03,738
Oh!

99
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:04,864
Uh...

100
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,075
- Oh!
- Ah, ah! Catch that man!

101
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,077
- Shit!
- Quickly!

102
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,537
Go and capture him!
What are you doing?

103
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,872
It's only the one guy!

104
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,232
Again? You must be kidding.
I missed again?

105
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,737
How do I use this?

106
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,575
I was holding it right.

107
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,417
This is driving me insane.
Seriously, shit.

108
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,836
Oh, it's way too quiet out there.

109
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,505
Man, do you think he's okay?

110
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,716
What do you mean
when you say that, Noonim?

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,928
You mean Choraeng-yi, that ass.
He went out there and died or something?

112
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,389
Why would you say he got killed?

113
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,685
- Hey, you're not the only one worrying!
- Come on. Stop, both of you.

114
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,479
Let's hope the silence means he's fine.

115
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,857
That's the best we can do for now.

116
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,196
Hashimoto, listen here.
Go get all our remaining ammunition.

117
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,867
You've concocted a plan, then.
Have you, sir?

118
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,329
We may be cowardly, true,
but we've also got bullets. Lots, huh?

119
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,124
We'll hit them with our bullets
till everybody's dead.

120
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,460
Get the guns quickly.

121
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,879
- Hurry.
- Yes. Yes, sir!

122
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,934
Fucking hell, man! Shit!

123
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,321
Wow.

124
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,281
What on earth?

125
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,492
This is killer.

126
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,291
I can see Myeongjeong, sir!
It's remote, but closer now!

127
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,044
As soon as we get there, we kill them all!

128
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,170
Get ready!

129
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,979
All forces, take aim!

130
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,528
For His Majesty, our great emperor,

131
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,571
hold back nothing!

132
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,031
- Now! Huh?
- Hey!

133
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:03,000
Anyone hungry?

134
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,593
You guys like to eat bullets?

135
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,136
Then open wide!

136
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,598
Choraeng-yi!

137
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,108
Heads down!

138
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,822
Everyone!

139
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,574
All good?

140
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,499
That's hot!

141
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,297
- What the hell?
- Choraeng-yi!

142
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,134
Cho... Choraeng-yi. Choraeng-yi's here!

143
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,554
Hey, Choong-soo!

144
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,599
Yoon! Hey, boss, I'm back!

145
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,559
What did I say to everyone?

146
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,185
I told you I can do it!

147
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,693
Why aren't they coming out?

148
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,112
Did they all... Wait.

149
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,657
Hey, come out. It's Choraeng-yi!

150
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,992
I'm here!

151
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:21,454
Alone! What do I do if they're all dead?

152
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,542
Boss! Ah, you bastard! I thought I'd...

153
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,628
Hey, you son of a bitch!

154
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:34,050
Hey, you son of a bitch!
You absolute fucker! I thought you died!

155
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,510
What's wrong with you?
What are you crying for?

156
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,929
You're the reason we're not dead.
Good work, Choraeng-yi.

157
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:41,724
I understand. Just get off me!
Let go already!

158
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,560
- Choong-soo!
- Choraeng-yi.

159
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,644
Good work, son.

160
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,610
Y... you

161
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,322
boorish Joseon animals.

162
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,084
Now,

163
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,254
Jang Ki-ryong is on his way,
so let's get lost.

164
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,382
And Nam-chun is out there. He needs us.

165
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,549
Yes.

166
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,968
Let's hurry, then.

167
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,011
Yeah.

168
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,598
Before we do,

169
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,726
since we're already here,

170
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,646
wouldn't you like to pay 'em back, huh?

171
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,609
Just what are you getting at now?

172
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:37,488
What do you think?
I mean, we should pay 'em back in kind.

173
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,203
Hey, it'll take a minute or less.

174
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,371
Not long at all.

175
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,134
Ah shit.

176
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,741
SEDITIOUS PERSON

177
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,165
Whoa.

178
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,686
Nam-chun.

179
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,615
I got you.

180
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:52,206
SONG OF THE BANDITS

181
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,044
Oh.

182
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,133
Sir, I... I kept thinking about it
on the way here.

183
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,345
And, well,
I don't think they'll kill us, Major.

184
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,306
They'll probably wrap it up
with a whipping, don't you think?

185
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,724
Or torture us a bit.

186
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,772
Relax, I won't let them
punish you or the others,

187
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
so don't panic.

188
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,610
You're sure? I'm grateful, sir.

189
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,448
I swear to trust and follow
only you, Major.

190
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,492
That's my hand.

191
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,621
Oh gosh. Oh, I'm sorry. It must hurt.

192
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,708
This shouldn't take too long.

193
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,294
- Stay put, will you?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,674
If they're too hard on you,
pretend you're hearing-impaired.

195
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,968
Say, "Huh, what's that?" All right, sir?

196
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,555
Using the bandit Jang Ki-ryong
will be the plan now.

197
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,642
And then, once it's all completed,

198
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,645
the Bonggye warlords will not be able
to obstruct our military activities

199
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,563
in the area.

200
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,398
Same for the Chinese government.

201
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,026
I'll execute the plan flawlessly.

202
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,611
Place your trust with me, sir.

203
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,905
Thank you very much.

204
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,421
You got all your men killed,
and now you're here

205
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,381
expecting another promotion, huh?

206
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,717
You're a damn coward.

207
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,678
You're right to be angry.

208
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,181
And any punishment is...

209
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,516
I'm willing to accept it.

210
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,645
Trust me, I'd love to see you punished
for this outrage,

211
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,440
but Governor-General Santo himself
has requested that you be spared.

212
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,279
You're really lucky that your father
is the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

213
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,991
Having the Governor-General step up
to save your ass, how nice.

214
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,373
Take that stupid subordinate of yours
and get out.

215
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,458
You're going back to Gyeongseong.

216
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,963
Until and unless you get summoned,

217
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,340
you're stuck on probation, got it?

218
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,652
DECIMATION CAMPAIGN
AGAINST SEDITIOUS JOSEON PERSONS IN GANDO

219
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,430
I've been
looking everywhere for you.

220
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,556
You found me.

221
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:02,187
The area near Myeongjeong's been
still and empty, based on what Il-sik saw.

222
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,816
The bandits and the Japanese
were nowhere in sight.

223
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,736
No point in being worried, then.

224
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,698
Myeongjeong has been completely destroyed.
The police and the consul are dead.

225
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,578
We should still worry
no matter how quiet it seems.

226
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,999
But don't you think
they would've attacked us then, huh?

227
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,460
The Japanese won't be able
to find us out here.

228
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,836
You worry too much, Yoon.

229
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,172
This lull could be your one chance.

230
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,426
What are you talking about?

231
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,304
Your hometown's just too far to see
from here, you know.

232
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,140
I think you should buy
a ticket home, then.

233
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:41,685
Aren't you here all the time
because she's still in your thoughts?

234
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,358
It's my duty to guard the village.

235
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,777
I'm not leaving here.

236
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,278
Goodness.

237
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,740
Nothing's about to happen
because you're gone a few days, all right?

238
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,788
Yoon, you carried
many more responsibilities for us

239
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,498
than many men could.

240
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,876
So you can take it easy for a while.

241
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,921
You need some time to rest,
or you'll break your back.

242
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,339
Don't burn yourself out.

243
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,135
I don't regret it.
Family helps each other, right?

244
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,558
I've been missing her though.

245
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,938
My goodness.

246
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,940
The wind sure is chilly today.

247
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,822
It's fine. Let go, let go.

248
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,914
Take a look at this!

249
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,333
Look at this! I was right, wasn't I?

250
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,418
Here! Look at this.

251
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,257
You're 30 won. Byeong-pal's 100 won.
That's a 70-won difference!

252
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,175
- Yeah!
- Why did you doubt me like that, huh?

253
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,428
- I said I saw it myself!
- Wait, this is real! It makes no sense.

254
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,865
Byeong-pal, this ass.
He barely moved, and his bounty's 100?

255
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,725
It's 100 because I did many things
when you weren't looking.

256
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,062
I just don't think it's right, you know,
that you belittle my hard work

257
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,772
just 'cause you didn't see it, miss.

258
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,237
You're just hilarious, huh?
Feel free to say that again, you asshole.

259
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,865
You know, my money's running out,
hiding out here.

260
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,828
Hey, so how about
I turn you in for that reward?

261
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,368
Huh? I'm bluffing, you think?

262
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,078
No, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.

263
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,250
Hey, check how much is on me now, huh?

264
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,295
Now that bounty's, well,
gotta be for thousands of won, huh?

265
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,174
- Ridiculous. You don't have a bounty.
- Huh?

266
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,383
Oh!

267
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,344
Ah, this lying asshole, huh?

268
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,098
Come on. What kinda bullshit is that?

269
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,224
Let me see.

270
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,858
I... I...

271
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,863
risked my life in battle
with those Japanese bastards and this...

272
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,325
I guess it's, uh, not the best kinda time
to talk about this news,

273
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,534
but it's 1,000 on me.

274
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,453
1,000?

275
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,624
- You fucking son of a bitch.
- Hey!

276
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,542
- You made some dirty Japanese deal?
- I...

277
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,604
- Did you bribe them or something?
- What the hell...

278
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,256
That's the answer, isn't it, huh?
That's why yours is higher. I'll prove it!

279
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,426
For heaven's sake, again?
You're fighting again?

280
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,888
Why waste your time on something
like... like that, you rotten punks!

281
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,308
When will you grow up
and behave like men, huh?

282
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,853
How much am I, huh?

283
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,107
I mean,
Choong-soo's bounty is 2,000 won. Two.

284
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,025
Crazy, right?

285
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,108
But...

286
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,239
Hey, this can't be real!

287
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,659
That grandpa shoots arrows!
He barely killed anyone! What the hell?

288
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,745
My goodness, Yoon!
You're looking sharp today.

289
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,914
Please say you're not going to surrender.

290
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,500
Just to Gyeongseong for a bit. That's all.

291
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,419
Gyeongseong?
Why are you going...

292
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,171
Oh my, my.

293
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,091
Hold on. Are you gonna go meet that girl?

294
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,929
No, I'll just go there and see her briefly
and come back here.

295
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,099
Don't worry about us here.
Just be safe, okay?

296
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:10,143
I'll be back soon,
so please take care of the place, huh?

297
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,227
Okay? All of you.

298
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,772
What is there
to protect here these days?

299
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,982
Each day is so peaceful.

300
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,192
We're sitting around here getting fat.

301
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,237
Get your things, and head out.
Don't worry about us now.

302
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,571
I'll do that.

303
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,157
See you.

304
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,451
Yoon, remember to be careful.

305
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,745
Don't forget the bounty on you is 6,000.

306
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,331
Your face! Cover your face well
when you go outside, okay?

307
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,958
Does that make sense?

308
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,962
Take it and hand it down as a family
heirloom, then, you ass. Goodness me.

309
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,507
Hey. Where's Yoon going?

310
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,719
Gyeongseong.

311
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,971
It's his hometown. He's off to see it.

312
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,727
What is he saying?

313
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,940
Wow, two thousand won.

314
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,319
Not cheap, now, is she?

315
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,821
I'd sure be after her.

316
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,616
WANTED REWARD 2,000 WON

317
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,753
The village you see over there
is Yongchun.

318
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,755
Time to go?

319
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,431
The Joseon rebels
are running amok.

320
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,974
They're becoming too bold.

321
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:36,438
Thus, we are going to take this chance
to purge the entire country of

322
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,775
all the stinking Joseon dogs
we can get our hands on in Manchuria.

323
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,028
To make that happen, Jang Ki-ryong,

324
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,906
your men will act as
the resource I require.

325
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,367
You'll repay your debt to me.

326
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,037
I let you go
when you were arrested last time

327
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,830
after the armored truck incident.

328
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,582
What's your big plan, then?

329
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:59,252
Seems like you
might have a little trouble with China.

330
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,506
And how do you intend
to execute this plan?

331
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:06,385
Diplomatic matters with China are complex,
are they not?

332
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,096
Japan is disallowed from dispatching
its military to Manchuria,

333
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,179
including Gando.

334
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,517
Have you heard the legend of Jie Zhitui?

335
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,604
When his master was starving to death,
he served the meat of his own thigh.

336
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,150
Perhaps we need to emulate that spirit

337
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,071
in service of His Majesty the Emperor.

338
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,740
Hup, hup.

339
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,921
I'm Chief Inspector Nagano
of the Yongchun Consulate.

340
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,757
State the reason
you've led a large detail here.

341
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,677
If I determine that your purpose in coming

342
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,139
is to cause injury
to Japanese assets and its loyal subjects,

343
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,182
you will be shot to death!

344
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:58,686
What is all this?

345
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,606
Lay down your weapons now or die!

346
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,110
All men, charge!

347
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,330
This'll only take a moment.

348
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,334
Oh, just stay still.

349
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,837
To defend and protect our land...

350
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,383
kill them all!

351
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,302
Yes, sir!

352
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,638
40 JAPANESE KILLED IN YONGCHUN
JAPAN TO SUBJUGATE MOUNTED BANDITS

353
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,875
Looks like I'm back,

354
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,543
Hee-shin.

355
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,762
There seems to be an issue with the power.

356
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,097
Warm up before anything else.

357
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,683
It's jujube, of course. Your favorite.

358
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,020
I appreciate it.

359
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,397
I appreciate all of this.

360
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,919
DECIMATION CAMPAIGN
AGAINST SEDITIOUS JOSEON PERSONS IN GANDO

361
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,671
Aren't you curious?

362
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,100
Why I'm back after hardly a month

363
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,229
but demanded you await me for a year?

364
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,275
And my hand... Don't you wanna ask?

365
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,944
I was going to wait.

366
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,154
Although, I admit I was curious

367
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,324
until you'd prepared yourself
to share the truth.

368
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,161
So much occurred.

369
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,208
So much happened these past few weeks.

370
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,545
Right as you left for your business trip,

371
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,007
I learned that my uncle
had been working alongside the rebels.

372
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,136
And I also became aware of
my uncle's orders

373
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,598
to have someone deliver
independence funds to Changchun.

374
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,935
And I wanted to capture the man myself.

375
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,649
It just wasn't as easy
as I thought it would be.

376
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:55,530
The carrier slipped through my grasp,
and my unit was almost annihilated.

377
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,535
And now I'm a soldier
unable to shoot anymore.

378
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,289
I'm a soldier who disgraced himself
and His Majesty.

379
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:11,046
Even with you beside me, I'm a hopeless
and, above all, stupid man.

380
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,090
So I ask if you'll still marry such...

381
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,264
...a complete
and utter failure of a man like me?

382
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,476
Now go!

383
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,898
A useless...

384
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,070
and no-good man.

385
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,926
I swore it to you

386
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,680
that I would forever love
and care for you.

387
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,617
I reached out
as soon as I heard you were back.

388
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,495
I'm aware you don't have a lot of time.

389
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,079
I'm very grateful to you, sir.

390
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,833
You risked all that you had in order
to help us in Gando with army funds.

391
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,211
Of course I have time for you. Now, then.

392
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,922
What was it in particular
that made you wish to meet?

393
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:04,010
I've come into some information
our comrades in Gando must be told.

394
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,513
Relaying it won't be a problem.

395
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,018
You're sure it's reliable, right?

396
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,355
Yes, my source is from Nanam Command.

397
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:16,981
Trust in me.

398
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,443
According to the documents I saw,

399
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,656
they're going to start a campaign
to kill seditious Joseon people in Gando.

400
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,577
The Japanese Army will cross the Duman,
and then the assault will commence.

401
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,120
They can't.

402
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,331
The Japanese can't order its army
into Manchuria.

403
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,291
Relations in China would be impacted.

404
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,210
Manchu bandits, Ki-ryong's crew.

405
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:41,005
You recall the Japanese Consulate
was raided by them, do you not?

406
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,467
Dozens of Japanese were murdered...

407
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,054
...including Chief Inspector Nagano.

408
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,433
Leaders of Nanam and the Bonggye
assembled due to the incident.

409
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,646
More than 40 valuable and loyal subjects
of our great empire died here!

410
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,857
The Japanese Army

411
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,277
will now demand recourse
to address this issue.

412
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,446
What was their conclusion?

413
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,115
I'm sure you know.

414
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,910
Japan managed to machinate a pretext
for its actions.

415
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,706
Agreed. We'll do as you say.

416
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:19,502
I will allow your "police action"
in Manchuria without objection.

417
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,087
However,

418
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,466
should you cause
a single Chinese citizen to be killed,

419
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,845
you shall become my enemy!

420
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,682
Hire bandits to attack Japan's Consulate
on his own country's soil

421
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,978
and manufacture a believable excuse
to send forth all their forces into China.

422
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,315
Then the Imperial Army wipes out
any remaining independence fighters too.

423
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,441
Is that...

424
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:44,235
They are now proposing to do
that in Gando, you're saying?

425
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,446
Yes.

426
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,746
Soon, tens of thousands
of Japanese troops

427
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,999
will descend on Gando
and kill any Joseon they deem seditious.

428
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:02,003
A strategy is paramount,
or people are going to die.

429
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,098
Let's talk outside.

430
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,404
GYEONGSEONG

431
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,008
You know that many say

432
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,845
we should leave Gando since Japan's army
is impossible to defeat given

433
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,682
the present strength of the independence.

434
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,519
Don't turn away, please.
We mustn't abandon Gando.

435
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,271
A great many countrymen dwell there now.

436
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,900
I will be one step behind you, I expect.

437
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,362
You'll drop your job with the government?

438
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,198
No matter how I look,

439
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,534
I don't think there's another way.

440
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,747
I'm going to get more information
out of my Nanam source to help you.

441
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,833
The risks are too many.

442
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,043
You'd be caught by the Japanese.
And, then?

443
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:30,341
I've spent almost 20 years
as a pro-Japanese noble's child

444
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,218
and as a compatriot for freedom.

445
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,471
I will not be caught.

446
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,398
What is it, Miss Nam?

447
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,203
Isn't that the man from Mount Cheonbo?

448
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,625
Perhaps he's here to see you, Miss Nam.

449
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,716
Neither I nor that man...

450
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,970
can afford to be victims of sentiment now.

451
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,223
Only then

452
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,227
can we create the type of world we desire.

453
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,116
Live no matter what the cost.

454
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,118
For as long as I live,

455
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,496
you must survive.

456
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,248
The next time we meet again...

457
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,586
please tell me your name.

458
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,214
Two years or twenty years.

459
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,800
However long it is, it doesn't matter.

460
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,427
Let us swear

461
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,388
that we'll meet again.

462
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,229
- Hello.
- Oh, welcome!

463
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,689
- I'm here to buy flowers.
- Ah, you'd like flowers?

464
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,773
Yes.

465
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,763
I'll stay alive
and come and find you, Hee-shin.

466
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,360
What?

467
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,446
Hee-shin, she was

468
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,449
with an independence soldier?

469
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,533
Right.

470
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,788
You're saying

471
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,376
that she took the intelligence
she stole from me and then

472
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:13,504
offered it
to the Independence Army, right?

473
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,924
Yes. Sir, I heard them both. It's true.

474
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,927
It sounded as though

475
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,931
she could also have been involved
in the... the funds transfer.

476
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,109
Then the idiot jackass
is me, huh?

477
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,154
I can't deny it.

478
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:44,035
I made the decision to love and trust her.

479
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,705
This proves I knew nothing.

480
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,794
Like when I set about apprehending
the soldier that Jang Seok was meeting.

481
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,090
Hee-shin.

482
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,346
And she said she was going to Gando
for business as well.

483
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,723
The meeting was a bit sudden. That's all.

484
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,808
My apologies.
There wasn't time to tell you.

485
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,270
I had no idea she was part of it.

486
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,858
I just trusted her blindly and believed.

487
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,535
And my uncle stayed silent.
All to protect her, goddamn it.

488
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,044
It's astounding.

489
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,879
Astounding.

490
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,801
Such goddamn astounding soldiers
those fuckers are, huh?

491
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,390
I don't really know
if I should say this right now, but she

492
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,558
should be turned in, shouldn't she?

493
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,230
I mean, since it seems certain she acted
as part of the Independence Army.

494
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,773
Even if it's someone you love, sir,

495
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,484
it's difficult,
but you'll have to report her sooner or-

496
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,367
You run your damn mouth,
you make an enemy.

497
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,829
I'll do as I decide,
whether I turn her in or marry her.

498
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,329
Remember this.

499
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,959
That nobody except you and I
know about her lies.

500
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,170
Should anyone else become aware,

501
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,798
that'll prove to me
that you couldn't be quiet,

502
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,050
so if you say anything, I'll make sure

503
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,595
your wife and children all die.

504
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,014
Got it?

505
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,185
Yes. I will remember, sir.

506
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:49,327
Take this for your kids
and get them a nice dinner.

507
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,205
Tae-ju will get here in just a bit,
so get out.

508
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,831
Sir.

509
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,523
Excuse me.

510
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,627
BLOCK 2, MAIN DISTRICT
DAESEONG MYEONOK, 1:00 P.M.

511
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:17,123
- Welcome, sir.
- A bowl of noodles. Thanks.

512
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,290
Sure.

513
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,837
It's nice to see you here
of all places.

514
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,673
Is everything well?

515
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,384
Our kind aren't meant to be doing well.

516
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,761
Let's have a meal together.

517
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,057
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

518
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,989
I assume this isn't just pleasure?

519
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,243
I was intrigued that you came to Hanseong
when it had appeared

520
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,370
that your sole priority was your family.

521
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,249
You came without knowing, right?

522
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,710
About Gando,
the plans they're making there.

523
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,007
A campaign to purge the Joseon people
in Gando is going to begin presently.

524
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,470
A campaign to purge Gando of the Joseon.

525
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,474
You're saying what?

526
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,393
General Katayama
and the bandit Jang Ki-ryong made a deal

527
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,021
that will allow Katayama
into Gando with his army

528
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,814
to pursue independence fighters.

529
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,610
I can't be certain, but I fear countless
Joseon people will be injured and killed

530
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:31,071
since nobody in our army advertises
their loyalty out in plain sight.

531
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,451
You're saying what happened in Jeolla...

532
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,788
something like the Militia Annihilation...

533
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,168
they're going to do it again in Gando?

534
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,670
Yes.

535
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,466
Look, I know the reason you came
all the way here to Gyeongseong,

536
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,594
but in this day and age,
in the world we live in,

537
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,930
we cannot be tied down
by personal feelings.

538
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,849
Soldiers aren't able
to keep our bonds with people.

539
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,809
Though we care, the time is here, now,

540
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,896
to create the world
that should be our children's birthright.

541
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,267
Departing now,
the train from Gyeongseong to Wonsan!

542
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,602
All aboard!

543
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,388
Everything is prepared.
We're ready, General.

544
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,348
Awaiting your command, sir.

545
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,853
- Send out the troops.
- Yes, sir!

546
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,969
I vow that I

547
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,888
will bring you joy and happiness.

548
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,867
All troops! Move out!

549
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,966
Drench Gando in blood.

550
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,047
Kill them all!
