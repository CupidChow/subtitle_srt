1
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,524
I'm telling you,
the police are becoming way too brutal.

2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,319
With summary judgment, they can kill
people they don't like without any reason.

3
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,196
And now they can flog us too?

4
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,949
They say that Joseons only obey
when we're beaten,

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,452
so they tie us down
and hit us with clubs like crazy.

6
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:38,375
Once you've been beaten, you can see
your bones right through your skin.

7
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,127
That man...
He fought for the Japanese.

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,295
Watch your mouth.

9
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,337
That man there?

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,135
Just three years ago,
during the Great Korean Militia Roundup,

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,221
more than half of the Righteous Army died
at his hands.

12
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,017
But he killed an old shaman witch once,
and he was possessed.

13
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,128
- Let's go.
- I hope they don't come this way.

14
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,317
Move! Move!

15
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,740
The culprit ran this way, sir.

16
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,878
Have a look around.

17
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,962
Sir.

18
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,634
Yoon, is that you?

19
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,390
Might've known.

20
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,935
Why are you here?

21
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,229
Not to see you.

22
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,608
Some bastard went and threw
an explosive at the station.

23
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,277
Killed a lot of officers.

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,862
That's why we're here.

25
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,159
They said the culprit headed this way.
You seen anyone suspicious?

26
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,788
Nobody.

27
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,498
Yeah?

28
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,667
There!
Someone suspicious over there!

29
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,334
Move it!

30
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,422
Hey! Let's go for...

31
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,968
Let's meet up and get dinner.

32
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,511
I'll call later.

33
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,401
Thank you. I owe you my life.

34
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,446
I will repay you
when I have the chance to do so.

35
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,699
There's no need to say that.

36
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,870
Why repay someone you never met?

37
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,108
SONG OF THE BANDITS

38
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,116
You care about independence?

39
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,741
Yeah.

40
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,577
Hmm. Independence.

41
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,537
Why?

42
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,501
Come on. Who doesn't want independence?
We all wanna work for ourselves.

43
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,587
What do you mean "ourselves"?

44
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,881
We weren't talking about
the same independence, right?

45
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,842
So what independence are you thinking?

46
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,720
Joseon's! Joseon's freedom!

47
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,805
The independence of our beloved home.

48
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,016
You know, "Hurrah, we're free!" That type.

49
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,393
Ah, that type. Hmm.

50
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,439
Why should you be worked up over that?
You don't care a bit about it.

51
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,276
Man, right?

52
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,487
I don't care about independence.

53
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,031
When has Joseon been there for me?

54
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,283
- Sure.
- I won't worry about it in that case.

55
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,827
- I'm not a soldier, ya know. Are you?
- No way.

56
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,830
So what? We weren't able
to do the assassination.

57
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,165
What are they gonna do about it?

58
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,417
You didn't kill him?

59
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,543
What happened?

60
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,671
Just kill me, please, boss!

61
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,716
I deserve it. I have betrayed our cause!

62
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,177
Get up.

63
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,887
Grown men shouldn't cry over this.

64
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,764
No, let me go! Let me go!

65
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,307
It would be better to end it.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,683
If not by gun, by sword.

67
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:57,231
I only had my axe,
so I couldn't finish my own self off.

68
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,818
I didn't think the mother I left

69
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,655
should have to see her youngest child,

70
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,700
her dead baby, headless and decomposing.

71
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,994
I am her baby, do you understand?

72
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:22,590
Wow! Kill... Uh, kill me... kill me also
when you kill this worthless bastard.

73
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,889
It'll be all right. Up you get. Come on.
Hmm? It's all right. Choraeng-yi.

74
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,558
No, let me go!
Let me go! No.

75
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,354
Us too. Nothing went according to plan.

76
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,191
When we got there, there wasn't any money.

77
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,274
Yeah?

78
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,028
Wait. Is that true?

79
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,450
Whoa!

80
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,536
We all messed up, then.

81
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,873
We're all in this sorry state, huh?
Oh, thank goodness. What a relief. Wow!

82
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,377
I wasn't sure how to be honest about it.
I was so scared.

83
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,004
Wow! No need to act contrite.

84
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,383
They all failed too, see?
So the plan then is...

85
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,094
It must be to start over, right?
All-new perspective.

86
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,471
Where do we start?

87
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,100
Do we get the money,
or should we properly kill that manager?

88
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,726
We'll do both simultaneously.

89
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,653
I don't care if we have
to comb every village.

90
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,440
If we aren't able to find him in Gando,

91
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,401
then we'll search all of Joseon
until we do.

92
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,862
Bring me all you dig up
regarding the transport

93
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,115
and what you can about
the railway section manager.

94
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,451
We'll take care of both
while they're still here.

95
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,577
Hey, Yoon.

96
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,291
The... That woman.
I don't think she's as... She didn't seem...

97
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,337
The Joseon you've waited for
is never going to come back!

98
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,425
I don't think she's this
terrible person we've been imagining.

99
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,181
She was crying during her speech
about the greatness of Japan.

100
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,893
The Railway Bureau manager
is a woman? Did you know that?

101
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,687
The who is inconsequential.

102
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,857
She has to die, so make sure she dies.

103
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,317
Don't show her mercy.

104
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:06,861
Nobody backs out.

105
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,283
What? This came from nowhere!
Why the hell?

106
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,410
We had just put him in there!

107
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,164
The captured man, he's, um,
Jang Ki-ryong, a bandit in these parts.

108
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,330
He knows a lot of important people
at the consulate.

109
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,294
Lieutenant General Katayama says
to let him go.

110
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,617
But he stole from us, you know?

111
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,923
He took that money
for the independence cause.

112
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,846
- You were there as well!
- They don't have it.

113
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,092
What?

114
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,010
The money, sir.

115
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,096
The bandits' bodies and their base,
they both were searched.

116
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,601
- They didn't have the money.
- Wait, so... so where is it, then?

117
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,103
- They're looking?
- It hasn't been determined.

118
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,648
Ah shit.

119
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,694
What is going on? Shit.

120
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,494
Hey, Tae-ju.

121
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,455
Tell the men to be ready to go.

122
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,294
Ready for what?

123
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,341
We can prevent them
from getting the money to its destination.

124
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,888
Remember, you and I already know
where their meeting location is.

125
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,646
Coming through!

126
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,733
Hey, boss! Boss!

127
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,821
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on? Breathe, breathe.

128
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,781
The guys who went
to Hoeryŏng say...

129
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,366
You know the guy, the bank guy there?

130
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,202
Somebody just murdered that guy. Shot him.

131
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,204
Shot in the head, bang! With a Mauser.

132
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,790
Mauser?

133
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,293
Yeah. A Mauser, yeah.

134
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,003
Mauser C96.

135
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,838
That's a nice gun you've got.

136
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,425
Shit.

137
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,805
I think I know who showed us up.

138
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,708
You met a woman a few days back.

139
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,084
Eon-nyeoni, right?

140
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,295
Owner of the noodle shop told us.

141
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,181
Thing is, there's something
that she owes us.

142
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,643
So tell us where she is.

143
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,647
This thing that you're trying to do
will not work.

144
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,194
I didn't ask your opinion.
Tell me where she is.

145
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,279
Your chances are running out.

146
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,909
If you kill the leader of Group 3,
our whole organiza...

147
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,788
I'll ask one last time.

148
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,623
Eon-nyeoni.

149
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,419
Where is she?

150
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,297
Journeying by train to Changchun.

151
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,967
She's going with the railway manager.

152
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,303
Eon-nyeoni said

153
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,223
she was the person who wanted that money.

154
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,517
That the person who hired her

155
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,144
worked in the government.

156
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,480
Worked for the rail line.

157
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,070
Come on, boys.

158
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,531
Changchun is waiting.

159
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,276
Is it even coming?

160
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,610
Just hold on.

161
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,196
You have to pass this way
to reach Changchun.

162
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,866
You're all dead in the dirt now.

163
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,702
That's what you get
when you put your hands on what's ours.

164
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,371
The money is important, certainly,

165
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,999
but the priority is
the woman from the Railway Bureau.

166
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,669
We can't flee again
in the face of Government-General Office.

167
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,546
We went through too much settling here.

168
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,592
So you have to be merciless
and do what needs to be done.

169
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,178
Don't take pity on that girl. Got it?

170
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:43,929
- Got it.
- Yeah.

171
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,101
Everybody ready?

172
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,061
Yeah.

173
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,525
Let's go.

174
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,503
Thick-ass.

175
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,326
What was that?

176
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,539
Merely a letter.

177
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,917
To the person the money is for.

178
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,669
What?

179
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,088
You stole it, but not for yourself?

180
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,008
Here I was

181
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,388
imagining you were working from the inside
to bring down the railway line in secret.

182
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,557
You weren't...

183
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,771
How'd you learn
what the nature of my work is?

184
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,982
I know much more than that.

185
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,111
You're the one running the Gando project
for the Railway Bureau.

186
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,822
I researched hard before I came here.

187
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,452
So I wasn't the only diligent one.

188
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,790
Be right back, okay? Stay here.

189
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,134
WASHROOM

190
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,389
What are you doing?

191
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,436
Hey. Excuse me.

192
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,439
Excuse us.

193
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,636
- Hyung, the lady's here.
- What?

194
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,138
Where is she?

195
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,572
Left side, middle.

196
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,034
- Left?
- Yeah. The hat.

197
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,210
And Eon-nyeoni?

198
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,629
Just the woman that I saw,
but she has the bag.

199
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:47,965
Stay here, okay?

200
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,843
- Hey, wait.
- Why? Are you gonna do it here?

201
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,262
It's the only choice.

202
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,932
It needs to be clear
what will happen when you try us.

203
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,084
Shit.

204
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,251
You know who to kill.

205
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,377
Yes, sir!

206
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,435
You seriously have a death wish,
don't you?

207
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,479
Shit.

208
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,237
Let's go get guns, yeah?

209
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,119
What do you think is happening in there?

210
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,457
Run! Get moving as fast as you can!

211
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,924
You and I have business, huh?

212
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,884
- Go! Go!
- Run!

213
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,770
Back out.

214
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,022
Would you back out, huh?

215
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,804
Damn it.

216
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,624
Oh.

217
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,170
Give him this message from me.

218
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,381
A dog dies when it leaves its home.

219
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,055
You were the transporter, then.

220
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,138
Sir?

221
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,185
In the trench coat, stop there!

222
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,275
You there!

223
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,987
Don't just stand there.
Arrest that woman now!

224
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,072
Yes, sir!

225
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,703
Seriously, what the hell is this?

226
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,413
The Japanese? What are they...

227
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,040
Blabber a bit less.

228
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:52,626
Grab a gun, or the boss is dead.

229
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,880
Freeze! Don't move!

230
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,386
I think you got the wrong girl.

231
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,101
Miss Nam!

232
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Hee-shin, wait!

233
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,739
Nam Hee-shin!

234
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,878
What is that?

235
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,681
What the hell are you doing?

236
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,350
What? What is it now?

237
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,068
What? Major, what is that?

238
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:10,037
Sandstorm coming in!

239
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,314
Die!

240
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,567
Kill them!

241
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,611
Get them all!

242
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,928
Ishikawa.

243
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,182
Sir, I-...

244
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,807
Why, sir?

245
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,277
Sir, no! It's me, sir.

246
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,488
The situation looks bad.

247
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,697
Should we retreat?

248
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,658
The transporter...

249
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,994
We're supposed to let her go?

250
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,456
Kill everyone.

251
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,624
Sir?

252
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,628
No one is to retreat
until they're all dead!

253
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,218
Yes, sir. It'll be done.

254
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,880
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

255
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,694
Boss! Move!

256
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,699
Boss, you all right?

257
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,076
Give me my gun. My gun!

258
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,705
Head to where Choong-soo is.

259
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,207
I'll follow you there
once I've caught her.

260
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,542
Boss!

261
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,210
- Wait!
- Boss!

262
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,755
- Will he be all right?
- That man, I swear!

263
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,855
Shit. Shit!

264
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,611
Here, take my hand!

265
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,568
That woman! Over there, sir!
She's over there!

266
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,263
Don't push me, damn it.

267
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,390
- Choong-soo!
- Hey.

268
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,561
What's the matter? Where's Yoon?

269
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,147
Oh, uh, Yoon, right.

270
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,524
He, well... You... you say it.

271
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,236
Uh... He, uh...

272
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,322
Bastards, what's going on here?

273
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,282
What did you guys do? Leave him behind?

274
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,434
So you made it. My thanks to you.

275
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,855
There's sure a lot for us to talk about,
isn't there?

276
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,624
How is your leg?

277
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,043
It's not bad, really.

278
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,462
You're lucky that it
just grazed you, you know?

279
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,925
Had you been hit directly,
it's likely you wouldn't be here now.

280
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,136
I'm grateful.

281
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,484
Sorry. Do you, by any chance, know

282
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,738
whether I would reach Changchun myself
from all the way out here?

283
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,994
It's not whether you'll be able
to get from here to Changchun.

284
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,454
It's if you can get there without

285
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,498
getting killed on the way
or without getting...

286
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,754
Bandits!

287
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,235
Take him with you and go!
Hurry!

288
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,915
No! No, no!

289
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,124
No!

290
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,796
Money!

291
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,505
Who are you?

292
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,423
Why keep following...

293
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,944
FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF JOSEON

294
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,419
The money you took.

295
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,424
Was it going to the Independence Army?

296
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,300
Is that the reason

297
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,594
you stole the Gando Line funds?

298
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,518
Go on. Tell me the truth.

299
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,481
Are you an independence agent
working undercover with the Japanese?

300
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,283
What makes you ask that question?

301
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,495
I suggest you answer my question.

302
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,459
Are you an independence agent
working undercover with the Japanese?

303
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,253
Answer me now.

304
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,275
I need you to listen to me if you
wanna survive this, do you understand?

305
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,920
Only the living
can act upon their beliefs.

306
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,174
From now on, your assignment is...

307
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,429
...live, no matter what the cost.

308
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,973
As long as I live, you must survive.

309
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,115
Behind you!

310
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,240
When and where
are you going to deliver the money?

311
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,080
It was today.

312
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,125
Changchun was the place.

313
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,170
That was today.

314
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:15,464
Any alternates?

315
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,302
If we couldn't meet up in Changchun,

316
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,929
Jeongwoljin Station,
more than two miles south.

317
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,360
Gyeongseong is a much better option.

318
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,908
This is Gando, and innocent people die
all the time here.

319
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,036
You're lucky if you die by gunshot here.

320
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,164
The bandits and Japanese soldiers
aren't known for their kindness.

321
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,664
They'll use you,

322
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,418
dismember you, skin you alive.

323
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,338
Is your task that important?

324
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,467
This is the money that's required

325
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,595
to make Joseon ours again.

326
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:04,972
So you see,

327
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,976
my life is not what actually matters.

328
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,366
Please come with me, then.

329
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:29,413
Better be ready to defend yourself though.
A thing like this could happen again.

330
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,583
Take this in case we're separated.

331
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,186
It's so hard to know
where to start, isn't it?

332
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,771
What with so much to talk about.

333
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,692
So why don't you start
and tell us what you'd like, hmm?

334
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,609
Who can say?

335
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,780
I just might let you go
if you're honest with us.

336
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,909
I... I'm not the person
who has the money, all right?

337
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,622
And I'm not a part of
the Independence Army either.

338
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,084
I swear to you.

339
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,878
Why would I risk doing that?

340
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,216
I wouldn't endanger my family
by doing something like that.

341
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,218
We searched the train, sir,

342
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,220
and through the baggage
still remaining onboard.

343
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,805
We didn't find any money, sir.

344
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,725
Nothing?

345
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,479
Nothing on the other passengers
or the corpses? You checked?

346
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,064
I'm afraid not.

347
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,777
It's likely that the carrier
managed to get away, sir.

348
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,994
All right, then.

349
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,334
Okay.

350
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,296
I will believe you this time.

351
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,799
Helping them is far too foolish,
isn't it? Right?

352
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,346
My regrets.

353
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,181
Guess I wasn't thinking.

354
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,266
No harm done.

355
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,354
You're a smart man, huh? Major.

356
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,423
I wouldn't normally tell you this,

357
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,442
but I'm in a pressing situation
at the moment.

358
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,654
I used a lot of resources and men
I didn't really have access to today.

359
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,738
Shit.

360
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,909
And there's nothing to bring
to my superiors.

361
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,620
That's too bad.

362
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,706
I actually meant I... Yeah.

363
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,292
This isn't how I want to return.

364
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,296
I came all the way to this goddamned
and barren place to kill rebels

365
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,006
and deal with Gando's trash.

366
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,886
So I need something

367
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,764
that can show it was worth it.

368
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,058
I would like you to assist with that.

369
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,561
I'm happy to. Yeah.

370
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,231
If you need me, I will certainly oblige.

371
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,608
- Say it.
- I saw something odd back there.

372
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,946
I saw someone
who should've died five years ago.

373
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,033
Who did...

374
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,828
who'd you see?

375
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,204
Why didn't you do it?

376
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,961
- You're probably mistaken.
- No lying!

377
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,754
I'm not mistaken, and you know it.

378
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,258
Tell me. Why didn't you kill your target?

379
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:32,138
I don't know what person it is
you might be talking about, but...

380
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,267
...I would not leave loose ends.

381
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,814
Does this jog your memory? Huh?

382
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,193
How about if I were
to shoot you as well, huh?

383
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,319
Tell me.

384
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,322
Come on, speak.

385
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,700
Lee Yoon, why isn't he dead?

386
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,547
Lee Yoon needs to die.

387
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:10,176
Go and finish the job
you left undone five years ago.

388
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,219
You were paid, yes?

389
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,762
So, then...

390
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:23,790
I know where you live
and who your associates are,

391
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,524
so don't do anything stupid, okay?

392
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,401
I want you to bring his head to me.

393
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,030
Don't forget.

394
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,449
Lee Yoon needs to die,

395
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,325
or else you will.

396
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,644
- You're staring at me. Why?
- Huh?

397
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,812
Oh.

398
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,526
I'm just a little confused.

399
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,654
Just about our situation, you know.

400
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,281
I wanted you dead because of your work.

401
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,660
Now I know where your allegiance is,
so I'm assisting.

402
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,038
The Joseon trying to carry on here

403
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,124
can live a little safer
because of rebels who are struggling.

404
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,337
Your personal interests might suggest

405
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,840
you actually care very much
about independence for Joseon.

406
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,884
Am I right?

407
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,761
I couldn't say

408
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,556
since I haven't given it any thought.

409
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,183
And I can't say I mean to.

410
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,269
I was born lowly.

411
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,813
Why say such a thing these days?

412
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,693
I don't think any person's born lowly.

413
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,780
There are only lowly thoughts for oneself.

414
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,244
Excuse me.

415
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,456
If it's not too rude for me to ask,
may I know your name?

416
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,253
I don't mean anything else by it.

417
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,590
I just want to know it since

418
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,134
you're helping so much.

419
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,813
Just concentrate on getting home safe.

420
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,190
It's better for the both of us.

421
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,985
This is only temporary.

422
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,582
I'm sick and tired of dealing
with this Joseon curse all day long.

423
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,542
Hey, how many did you catch?

424
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,754
- Around 20 or so, I'd guess.
- Don't look.

425
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,215
Don't turn. Keep your mind elsewhere.

426
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,177
It's that or be killed.

427
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,765
- I want all this to be over.
- It's so irritating.

428
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,226
Absolutely.
It's hideous, isn't it?

429
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,980
No matter how many you kill,
those bastards...

430
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,982
Ah, you're right.

431
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,401
SEDITIOUS JOSEON PERSON

432
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,855
What made you join the movement?

433
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:57,111
I wanted to pass on our land

434
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,186
down to our descendants
the same way it was passed to us.

435
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,536
They need to have land
in order for there to be a country.

436
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,037
A language. A people.

437
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,249
Japan robbed it all from us.

438
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,835
I need to fight for its return

439
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,838
so I won't be a disgrace
to my descendants.

440
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,506
That's why I choose to do this...

441
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,677
despite my shortcomings.

442
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,682
And you, how did you
reach your place in Gando?

443
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,852
I'm afraid it's boring to tell.
It's boring and long.

444
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:36,858
In Gyeongseong,

445
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,363
many people still imagine
that Gando is a land of hope.

446
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,535
There are so many wonderful stories
of lucky people who moved to Gando

447
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,162
who eluded Japan's tyranny

448
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,373
and built houses
on their own land and thrived.

449
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,712
But

450
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,340
the real place,
the Gando I've experienced,

451
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,927
it's not the Gando from the stories.

452
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,850
Feels melancholy.

453
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,521
Hope is obscured here as well.

454
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,237
At the moment, you're correct.

455
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,907
Gando's melancholy and pitiable, yes.

456
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,495
So I will keep fighting to change that

457
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,623
until the stories about hope
they tell in Gyeongseong are real...

458
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,752
until there is joy in Gando.

459
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,093
Once the money is delivered to the army,

460
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,971
I can't speak for Joseon,

461
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,599
but her citizens here in Gando
can at least be safe.

462
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,560
That's all I'm hoping for.

463
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,522
Nothing beyond that.

464
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,920
Have we...

465
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,301
Have we met each other before somewhere?

466
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,222
No.

467
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,141
We've never met before.

468
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,777
Jilin will be the starting point
for our search.

469
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,610
From there, the 200 ri southeast
are yours, San-gun.

470
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,489
Okay.

471
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,032
Going northeast is Geumsu.

472
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,869
I will be making my way southwest.

473
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,038
- And northwest is you, Choraeng-yi.
- Mmm. Yeah.

474
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:55,956
Understood?

475
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,291
Yes.

476
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,211
Did you get all of that hung?

477
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,171
Uh-uh. Give it here. Yeah.

478
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,883
There! Hey.

479
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,594
Don't think of
crawling back here until Yoon is found.

480
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,262
Search hard, and don't stop.

481
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,391
Comb through 50 ri a day.
Remember that his life depends on this.

482
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,060
Do we really?
I mean, is this necessary?

483
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,606
Boss will probably come back soon anyway.
I mean, he's not stupid, is he?

484
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,191
Once the woman is dead
and the money's in his hands.

485
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:25,903
Then what?

486
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:27,946
Don't even try, huh?

487
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,328
He... he's got absolutely no loyalty
to anybody at all, this asshole.

488
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,428
My goodness. Either I am delusional,

489
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,848
or my backed-up earwax
is making you sound like a moron.

490
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,768
Man, when Geumsu and I said,

491
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:01,313
"Should we let boss just go on his own,"
what did you say, San-gun?

492
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,524
Ah, he's all right. Right?
Now you talk about loyalty, huh?

493
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,901
You stupid asshole.

494
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,778
Jackass, that situation...

495
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,614
Yoon said to meet up
with the others, so I...

496
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,991
You... Hey! How dare... Dumbass brat!

497
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,826
I'm older. Show a bit of respect, huh?

498
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,662
Apologize, you jackass.

499
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,080
- Stop it!
- Why, when I meant it?

500
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,706
You complete ass!

501
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,963
Stop all this at once,
all of you!

502
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,757
Stop! Now!
You always manage to pick a fight!

503
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,724
Oh, uh, uh...

504
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,519
There's some... someone to see you.

505
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,402
Don't you push me! Shit!

506
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:49,902
Hey!

507
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,198
It's gotten
so much nicer here.

508
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,534
Five years, huh?

509
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,708
JEONGWOLJIN

510
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,312
Why did you come here?

511
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,440
We came here for independence.

512
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,813
How's the situation
in Gyeongseong these days?

513
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:01,808
Since the March 1st Independence Movement,

514
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,770
a lot of Japan's methods of government
have been improved.

515
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,815
That being said, it doesn't comfort me.
The policies are lies.

516
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:13,278
They exist so Japan can placate us,
dissuade added support for the cause.

517
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,781
They want to obstruct Joseon unifying...

518
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,867
...and starve out the independence movement.

519
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,161
A bitter taste.

520
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,485
You weren't at Changchun yesterday,

521
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,588
so I was concerned
something might be awry.

522
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,881
I'm relieved.

523
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,966
The bag, I'll take it.

524
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,887
We will use it happily
for... for Joseon's independence.

525
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,222
Yes.

526
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,235
I only hope it helps, despite how meager.

527
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,254
Uh,

528
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,339
what's this?

529
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,341
Oh, it's a letter
to President Seo Il from me.

530
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,844
Ah!

531
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,145
But what's with all these numbers
written on here?

532
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,122
"For the independence of Joseon."

533
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,833
Yada, yada, yada, yada.

534
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,752
It's all numbers after that, isn't it?

535
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:55,672
"One, three, three,

536
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,384
zero, one, eight, three."

537
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,354
Oh, are there a lot of numbers?

538
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,107
Yeah.

539
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,028
Oh, I didn't know.

540
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,485
Miss Nam.

541
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,030
Miss Nam.

542
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,492
Miss, don't fall asleep, no. Miss!

543
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,751
Hee-shin.

544
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,212
Stay with me, please. Stay. Hee-shin!

545
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,062
Just hang in there
a little longer.

546
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,566
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.

547
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,614
You'll be fine.
