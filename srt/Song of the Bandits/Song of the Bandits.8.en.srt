1
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,698
Do... do they have any idea
how valuable this is?

2
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,249
Consul, sir! What...
Sir, please, what's going on?

3
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,667
Hashimoto, hurry!

4
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,545
Hurry! Let's shift this quick!
Just help me! Hurry! Hurry up!

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,768
You can't just hide here anymore,
Mr. Yamada!

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,395
You have to go handle
the situation right now!

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,606
The police officers and the soldiers

8
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,816
are all in a shootout with each other
for some reason,

9
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,403
and the Joseon are part of it,
so it's total chaos out there!

10
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,573
So just how am I going to go out
and stop all this nonsense, huh?

11
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,369
Even Superintendent Ōoka
was shot and seriously wounded.

12
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,914
If we don't steer through
this crazy situation carefully,

13
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,415
we'll both die, get it?

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
That...

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,254
How do we get that down?

16
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,590
It's more costly than my other things.

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,598
You can't just hide. You need to act!

18
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,142
I can't. It's all hopeless. I...

19
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,435
Consul, you have to!

20
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:44,895
You're right.

21
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,817
It's all up to him now.
You see, I just can't!

22
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,739
Jang Ki-ryong.

23
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,822
SONG OF THE BANDITS

24
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,105
Hold fire!

25
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,735
I can take Yoon down alone.

26
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,992
Ah shit!

27
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,998
Halt!

28
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,190
The two of us together like this

29
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,567
seems like 11 years ago.

30
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:56,819
That time in Gurye, right?

31
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,820
You're right.

32
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,986
We wouldn't be in this trouble
if you'd just listened

33
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,785
and done what I told you, you know?

34
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,914
I tried to be loyal to you. I really did.

35
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,586
But some things are just
too much for a dog to stand.

36
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,009
So you're still all talk and no action.

37
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,429
But I'll make it quick.

38
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,557
Think of it as the last present

39
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,560
from me, your master,
to his thankless slave.

40
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,602
Oh shit.

41
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,812
Shit!

42
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,594
I can't kill you.

43
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,681
I wanted to kill you for so long.
I still want that.

44
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,064
But now I can't.

45
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,027
You won't be able
to hold a pistol in your hand.

46
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,655
So why not stop troubling your people.

47
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,784
Give up the Japanese man Miura Shohei.

48
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,370
Live as Joseon's Lee Gwang-il.

49
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,916
You were kind before that uniform.

50
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,421
So live that way again.

51
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,465
Okay?

52
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,966
All troops, stand by!

53
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,647
How could I not...

54
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,359
recall him before today?

55
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,656
I said he should return alive.
We talked together.

56
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,995
He saved my life so many times.
I owe him more than I can repay.

57
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,251
I spent so many days by him,
and still, it didn't...

58
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,629
didn't occur to me who he was.

59
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,551
I won't let him go so abruptly like this.

60
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,469
Can you pull over, please?

61
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,975
Just stop.
He can't die alone out there, please!

62
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,055
It's all right.

63
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,059
Don't worry. He won't be abandoned.

64
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,105
Your command, sir?

65
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,314
Hold fire.

66
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,525
We'll take Yoon alive, got it?

67
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,985
Alive, why?

68
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:26,154
Why would you let this guy live, huh?

69
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,740
If I tell you I want Yoon alive,
then that's what you do!

70
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,408
My order!

71
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,661
That's your order?

72
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,747
Ah shit!

73
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,628
Miura, come on. You're acting crazy!

74
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,921
Hey.

75
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,842
You should be careful
what you say, Ishida.

76
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:49,760
You're still a subordinate.

77
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,847
Damn it, man! I'm sick and tired
of treating Joseon scum like you,

78
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,557
like you're my superior officer.

79
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,934
Both you Joseon bastards should be killed.

80
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,483
We came to get independence funds
from a comrade we didn't recognize.

81
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,276
We wouldn't come without some plan.

82
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,528
You can believe in us.

83
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,406
That's because we're...

84
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:11,949
All troops!

85
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,702
Take aim at those two Joseon dogs!

86
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,250
...the Independence Army.

87
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,919
Fi...

88
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,270
All soldiers fall back!

89
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,606
Fall back now! Run away!

90
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,555
You'll be killed, so make a run for it!

91
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,707
- Let go, jackass!
- Gwang-il!

92
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,009
Just go. And don't think about
coming here again, you jackass.

93
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,570
This is where I say goodbye.

94
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,530
Our associate
will help you to a safe place.

95
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,457
Try to put it all to good use somehow

96
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,082
for our liberty.

97
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,960
We will get our freedom back.

98
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,171
You helped us so much.

99
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,256
I'll see you again in our free country.

100
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,144
Wait, sir!

101
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,024
Would you mind? May I ask a small favor?

102
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,694
Just take guns
and ammunition!

103
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,571
And move as swiftly as possible!

104
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,822
Yes, sir!

105
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,742
Seon-bok's friend, right? Are you hurt?

106
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,910
No, I'm fine.

107
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,122
My guys safely escorted
the woman bringing us the money,

108
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,666
so don't be concerned at all.

109
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,555
You're still here.

110
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,142
I was worried I'd be too late,
so I'm glad.

111
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,603
Comrade Nam said to give you this.

112
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,773
She wanted to do it personally,
but she didn't have a chance.

113
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,454
I decided to write this letter
to tell you the things I've felt

114
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,581
since I started this journey.

115
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,877
When I first set out
and made my way to Gando,

116
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,756
and I saw the people
in this free and lively city,

117
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,176
I felt a hope
I couldn't have imagined before

118
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,345
while living in Gyeongseong.

119
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,392
However, it was only a few days

120
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,104
before I realized
that the hope I felt was an illusion.

121
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,899
The city that looked
so free and lively at first

122
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,526
was not our city after all.

123
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,611
That's when I saw firsthand...

124
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:23,159
...that there is no such thing
as hope for the Joseon people.

125
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,746
I was staggered
by the fear and terror I felt,

126
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,459
and I believed that I was responsible
for all their deaths.

127
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:41,969
Everything I'd believed seemed to crumble
in the face of my complete powerlessness.

128
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:42,887
In that moment,

129
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,389
I wanted to give up everything
and just run away,

130
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,517
but then I happened to meet you.

131
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,436
Who are you?

132
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,067
I was drowning
in all of my despair,

133
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,571
my resentment, and my sense of defeat.

134
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,992
But then you opened my eyes
to an important truth I'd missed.

135
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,744
At the moment, you're correct.

136
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,955
Gando is melancholy and pitiable, yes.

137
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,548
The words you spoke that night
made me realize that

138
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,844
if I give up
because I cannot see the light of hope,

139
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,139
I'd have to live
in the darkness of despair forever.

140
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,142
So I decided, from now on,

141
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,562
I will keep the dream of hope alive
in my heart,

142
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,940
but I must exercise patience.

143
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,943
I will continue to fight on,
without complaint,

144
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,821
until the day
Joseon regains her independence.

145
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,198
So I hope and pray that your wish

146
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,201
of being able to build a peaceful home
on Joseon land

147
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,246
will come to pass for you
as quickly as possible.

148
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,708
Until the day
when we meet again,

149
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,920
I swear that I won't forget
all the moments

150
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,047
you and I have shared.

151
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,104
Thank you for all of your help.
I'm sure this won't be goodbye.

152
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,318
Have you thought about, um,

153
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,279
coming with us?

154
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,656
I have more things to protect still.
See you.

155
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,077
Don't tell me
you're headed to Myeongjeong?

156
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,162
Men are ripping it apart right now.

157
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,084
My family's out there.

158
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,295
Danger's not gonna stop me.

159
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,719
Right! Let's go!

160
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,053
Yes, sir!

161
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,153
Hurry, go!

162
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,921
You should get out while you can.

163
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,797
We'll handle this from here on out.

164
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,381
Right.

165
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,106
Eon-nyeoni, this is our fight now.

166
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,942
It's not yours, all right?

167
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,028
You've done enough, so beat it.
Don't stop running.

168
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,821
Ah, you're bullshitting, huh?

169
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,532
I was here at the start.
You can't stop me now.

170
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,416
I don't care if I die fighting,
old man, so...

171
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,495
Just listen!

172
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,456
How could you even
think of dying here, you idiot?

173
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,629
What are you doing?
And why are you acting like this?

174
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,340
And why are you telling me
to run like a dog?

175
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,975
Get out of here, or else
I'm gonna put you down myself, get it?

176
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,518
Now hold on.

177
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,814
We aren't that desperate
to get help from some bitch

178
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,024
who would kill men for a few coins.

179
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,818
So get lost then, you dog!

180
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,699
You're gonna push that far?

181
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,203
Fine. Then I'll go.
You can die alone here.

182
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,250
Goodness, what a rascal.

183
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,007
Shit!

184
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,093
- You doing all right?
- Stay back, or you'll be shot!

185
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:54,304
I had to help Yoon get out.
Ah shit. I'm tired.

186
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,639
Ah, go get ammo! Hurry!

187
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:56,640
- Ammo, go!
- You want...

188
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,933
Ammo, come on! Move, move!

189
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,497
- Come on, man. All right. I'll get it!
- Hurry! Just go quick!

190
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,988
Hey! Byeong-man.
Where are you going, bas...

191
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,588
You're dead, shithead. You're so dead.

192
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,570
I can do this all day!

193
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,989
Come on!

194
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,571
San-gun.

195
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,323
Hey, I told you to stay clear! Now go!

196
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,825
You said to get ammo, you jackass!

197
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,701
- Right.
- I found 'em.

198
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,704
- Right, right, right.
- Ah, so sore!

199
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,957
Wait, you got more, right?

200
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,126
Hey, you're lucky I found all that.
Don't waste it!

201
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,294
Shit, there's a ton of men for me to kill.

202
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,296
Don't waste any. Kill the worst ones!

203
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,385
What the...

204
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,468
What?

205
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,608
You... you brought an extra.

206
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,818
I just got one.

207
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,778
Oh fuck!

208
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,718
You shitty fucking jackass!

209
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,683
Shooter, look out!

210
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,479
- Don't make a move, Noonim.
- Where is he?

211
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,314
Find him quick!

212
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,326
Fuck! Shit! Damn it!

213
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,952
Did you find him?

214
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,704
- Can't spot the guy.
- Then try again!

215
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,183
Ah, damn it.

216
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,435
This sucks, huh?

217
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,906
Hey, boss, hurry.

218
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,416
There you are, you bastard.

219
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,209
You did it? Where is the guy?

220
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:18,377
Shit.

221
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,300
- Raise your hands, Noonim.
- Why?

222
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,721
Raise 'em high, okay?

223
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,847
Why?

224
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,517
Are we fucked?

225
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,399
Yoon. Where is that man now?

226
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,210
Yoon.

227
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,796
Tell me about Yoon.

228
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,402
Ah shit. I'm not sure.

229
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,322
Hey.

230
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,950
Your call to make.

231
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:13,910
Do we head back or not?

232
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,547
Man, why did I ask?

233
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,477
Tell me, sir. We're going back defeated?

234
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,771
Hey, I... I'm not sure of anything,
so don't ask.

235
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:43,856
Yes, sir.

236
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,048
Shit, this sucks.

237
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,968
Ah, damn it.

238
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,726
Stay still, okay?

239
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,561
Don't try anything brash now.

240
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,645
Sh.

241
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,859
I can't sit by
and watch them all get killed.

242
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,657
Helping in this situation
would be a mistake,

243
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,825
so wait a bit until we see an opportunity.

244
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,954
Hey, you make it sound simple,
don't ya?

245
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,706
Each one of 'em's like family
or something, right?

246
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,830
Seems like you'd wanna try a rescue,
not just wait for an opportunity like...

247
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,631
All of them mean more to me
than to you, believe that.

248
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,300
You seem to think that you're courageous.

249
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,095
You're not. You're just hotheaded.

250
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,057
You can't just be brash.
You being killed won't help all those men.

251
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,687
Don't try to lecture me, old man,
'cause I won't ever die.

252
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,856
You think you made it this far
with what, some skill?

253
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,486
It was luck. Nothing more than that.

254
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,196
No, but who cares?

255
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,782
You can keep on rambling,
but I won't stand around.

256
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,867
I'll save Choong-soo. Watch.

257
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,541
You may believe that you owe him.
Maybe you really do.

258
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,711
But your own life is still precious too.

259
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,006
Don't get killed
and break Choong-soo's heart.

260
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,234
Follow me.

261
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,411
Well?

262
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,622
Just what are you saying exactly?

263
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:06,499
You want all the prisoners
to be turned over to you?

264
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,669
The general would like to take advantage
of this fortuitous chance

265
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,631
to completely destroy
the hideout at Taepyeong-dong

266
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,008
and root out all of the lingering bandits.

267
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,011
However, as you surely must know,

268
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,430
we have not yet ascertained
the exact location.

269
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,183
You don't know the position
of Taepyeong-dong yet. Is that it?

270
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,018
After Nodeoksan died,

271
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,187
I heard there's nobody
who really knows anymore.

272
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,731
Even within the Joseon, I'm sure,

273
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,524
there's barely a handful
who know anything.

274
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,110
Indeed, you are correct.
That's why, Consul Yamada,

275
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,988
we ask you to hand us control
over the prisoners.

276
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,783
They won't give up the location
simply because of a threat or two.

277
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:40,909
Not these crooks.

278
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,662
You see that, I'm sure,
just as clearly as we do, don't you?

279
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,915
I know, but do you
really need to push so far?

280
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,293
Surely we can just take the leaders?

281
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,796
We'll punish those as a lesson
and drop it there?

282
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,384
That won't be enough.

283
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,304
We fulfilled our part of the alliance
as you had requested,

284
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,597
did we not, Consul Yamada?

285
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:07,060
Now it's time for you to fulfill your part
and meet your obligation to us as well.

286
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,814
You see, that's the easiest way
for us to maintain trust with one another.

287
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,440
See the point now?

288
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,738
Why is it that you wanna attack
Taepyeong-dong so intently, huh?

289
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,745
I need to kill him, you see.

290
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,497
Lee Yoon.

291
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,375
It's because he feels strongly
that we must

292
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,253
capture and kill the man
they call their leader.

293
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:42,554
This house belongs
to our group's Gando manager.

294
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:44,764
But we can use it for now.

295
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,268
He's been stuck in the hospital.
Some lunatic shot him.

296
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,689
I tried to get him to confess to me
who did it, but he wouldn't say.

297
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,527
He said he was worried
that I'd be in danger.

298
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,328
If I get my hands
on that damn son of a bitch,

299
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,490
I swear to God,
I'm gonna stomp him into the dust.

300
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,875
Ah!

301
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,008
I'm here like you wanted, all right?
All calm and collected.

302
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,176
So tell me more.

303
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,386
What's your idea?

304
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,973
We'll wait here till the sun goes down.

305
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,019
That way, the bad visibility will work
to our advantage.

306
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,771
What happens, then?

307
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,439
Then one person distracts Ki-ryong.

308
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,484
The other sneaks past
to rescue everyone in the police station.

309
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,403
I guess we'll need someone skilled
for the distraction.

310
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,073
The longer that person can hold out,
the more time we have to rescue them.

311
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,581
Okay.

312
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,209
I'll distract, then.

313
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,421
No, I'm doing that.

314
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,591
See, what's really important
is the rescue, so you do that.

315
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,719
Hey. You expect me
to trust you just like that, huh?

316
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,722
What happens if you can't
even last five minutes?

317
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,406
There'll be cops and bandits everywhere
when I get the others out.

318
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,229
Then those men will kill us all, huh?

319
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,356
That won't happen though.

320
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,107
And you're sure of that?

321
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,070
You know how well I shoot.

322
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,450
You're bragging now, really?

323
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,120
Oh, look at you
sliding in on that ego of yours.

324
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,248
I got flustered and almost agreed, huh?

325
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,213
Do you know what it feels like
when I talk to you?

326
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,297
What's that?

327
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:48,554
Hmm.

328
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:50,764
It's nothing.

329
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,521
I'll get some ammo
from Seon-bok's storage, so get some rest.

330
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,524
I'm sure you haven't slept in ages.

331
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,537
And thank you.

332
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:17,917
For what?

333
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:21,087
If you hadn't helped, then I
wouldn't have been there for Hee-shin.

334
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:27,927
And Choong-soo, thanks for that, too,
for choosing to stay by his side.

335
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Get some rest.

336
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,174
Your attention.

337
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,929
Our mighty general was just granted full
and complete authority over all of you

338
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,514
by Consul Yamada
to do with as he sees fit.

339
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,934
There's one important question
you need to answer.

340
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,853
You must reveal to us

341
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,689
the location of Taepyeong-dong.

342
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,445
That damn bastard says
to spill where Taepyeong-dong is at.

343
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:30,823
Whoever answers our question
will be allowed to leave unhurt.

344
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,367
And as for anybody who won't,

345
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:33,992
you'll die.

346
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:37,080
Those bastards will murder us if we don't.

347
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,043
You men listen very carefully.

348
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,711
Even if

349
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,881
we die right where we are today,

350
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,800
we must protect

351
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,594
every last family
still back in the village!

352
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,804
Do not let them trick you!

353
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,223
- Sir!
- Hey!

354
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,571
You.

355
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,826
Let's start with you
telling me the location.

356
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,838
Be quiet, old man, and wait for your turn!

357
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,090
Tell me!
Where is your village located, huh?

358
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,717
We're not talking, you jackass!

359
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,431
- Let's try this again.
- Cheon-man, no!

360
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:41,144
- Answer the question.
- Where is your village located, huh?

361
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,149
Hey, you jackass!

362
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,363
Damn it.

363
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,074
San-gun, you spilling it or what?

364
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,202
The directions are tough for me.

365
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,914
The underworld
will be tough for me to find.

366
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,626
Then I'll go with you. I'll lead the way.

367
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,503
Nah, you and I are done.

368
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:10,381
Noonim, you talking?

369
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,008
We're all gonna die.

370
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,344
There's no point being here on your own,
so let's go together, damn it.

371
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,518
Oh, Geumsu. Geumsu, no.

372
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,523
The location of Taepyeong-dong is...

373
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,115
Lean in closer.

374
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,951
Just come here. I'll tell you.

375
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,872
Or maybe you're too scared. Is that it?

376
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,958
Hurry. Just lean in close.

377
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,587
I'll tell you where it's at if you do.

378
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,012
You'll tell me now?

379
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,778
How's that?
What'd you take me for, dumbass? Huh?

380
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,866
I'll talk! Listen, please. I'll talk!

381
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,619
No, Nam-chun! Don't do it!

382
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,621
Don't tell them anything, Nam-chun!

383
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,707
Stop. I'll tell you where
Taepyeong-dong is at!

384
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,377
- Nam-chun!
- So let me and my Ye-bun live.

385
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,754
Just keep my child Ye-bun safe. I'll talk!

386
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,964
Nam-chun, no!

387
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,674
- No, you can't!
- What are you saying?

388
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,384
I'll save my Ye-bun, Choong-soo!

389
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,262
All of this,

390
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,432
it happened
because my friend didn't listen!

391
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,270
I said getting involved
was a bad idea, didn't I?

392
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,105
I told you to forget Yoon.

393
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:52,358
You had to protect our village instead.
I told you that!

394
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,154
Is this what it all came to?

395
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,282
Is this what it came to?

396
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,953
It's all because you made that mistake.
It's so infuriating.

397
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:10,459
I can take you to Taepyeong-dong
as soon as you want. I swear.

398
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,545
So will you please... Please!

399
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,796
Don't. Stop!

400
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,507
- Stand up!
- Nam-chun, no!

401
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,223
I... I could bring you to our village.
I'll show you.

402
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,934
And I'll take you
on all the shortcuts too.

403
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,436
I'll get you there fast.

404
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,730
So... so my Ye-bun, she...

405
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,192
Please spare her life. I beg you.

406
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,862
Sir, if I lose my daughter,
my life is over.

407
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,488
There's no reason to go on.

408
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,909
So please save her.

409
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,597
Tonight you'll bring us.

410
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,934
You'll bring both me and my men, old man.

411
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,437
Put all the rest of them in jail for now!

412
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,105
Yes, sir!

413
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,316
You can't do this to us, Nam-chun!

414
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,819
Don't resent me, my friend...

415
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,657
because how must the peach tree live?

416
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,035
Kill the plum tree, that's all.

417
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,437
Mr. Park.

418
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,439
Is it really true?

419
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,609
Dad and Mom's killer.
You got the bastard's name?

420
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,070
What's the bastard's name?

421
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,781
Now don't talk about an elder
that way, Eon-nyeoni.

422
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:07,201
The man is a well-respected man, I'm told.
A man of good character.

423
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,203
He's a respected man? That's bullshit.

424
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,958
A respected man doesn't just
kill someone in such a violent way.

425
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:17,712
He's a scholar-official.
A nobleman who's loyal to his country.

426
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,881
So he was forced to take action
against Donghak.

427
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,847
When your parents were killed
in that incident, he retired,

428
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,224
and the guilt drove him back
to his hometown.

429
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,852
He withdrew entirely from public office,
left behind everything,

430
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,979
and lived in seclusion in his hometown.

431
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,063
And, damn,

432
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,734
the Japanese stole our land and pride
from us all.

433
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,403
He became a general of
the Righteous Army in Jeolla.

434
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,486
But then,

435
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,282
the Japanese attacked
and destroyed them all.

436
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,492
This jackass's life history
isn't what's important.

437
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,661
I want to know his name. His name!

438
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,331
So just tell it to me quickly.

439
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,665
I'm real busy.

440
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,584
His name's still a mystery.

441
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,420
Although, I do know the man's alias,
as it were.

442
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,299
In battle, the man was called this
by his followers

443
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,551
since no one could stand against him.

444
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,219
So his people said he was...

445
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:15,186
...the "Invincible General."

446
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,772
What's wrong?

447
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,399
You okay?

448
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,657
The sun's down. Let's go.

449
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,881
A Type 14 Nambu?

450
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,218
But why are you putting a silencer on?

451
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,053
Our plan just changed.

452
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,099
Let's go into this together
without anyone distracting.

453
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:56,519
The plan's to barge in
and sweep the station?

454
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,813
That would work?

455
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,482
Mounted bandits are everywhere.

456
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,692
Those bandits will be departing soon now.

457
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,612
Nam-chun fessed up the location.

458
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:08,823
It's all for us.

459
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,455
Hold up, okay?

460
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,709
Who did what for us exactly?

461
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,462
What is it you're trying to say?

462
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,714
When the plum tree
takes the fall

463
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,716
in order to preserve the peach tree,

464
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,885
it's "Idaedogang," an army ploy, see?

465
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,847
About ten years ago now,

466
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,224
Nam-chun and I both served
as soldiers together.

467
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,476
That's when we made it our secret code.

468
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,105
Uh, so, what's "Idaedo" or whatever?

469
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:44,316
Explain it for us simply
so that the men can understand.

470
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,068
If you find you're in a fight,

471
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,780
trapped with the Japanese in a hurry
to capture your brothers in arms,

472
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,073
and they're about to...

473
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,742
...put every single man
to death there on the spot...

474
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,161
...the plum tree will

475
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,414
protect the peach tree
and offer itself up instead.

476
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,584
One person nobly sacrifices himself...

477
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:02,793
...to save the rest.

478
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:04,879
Idaedogang.

479
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,299
Choong-soo made me aware of it.

480
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,721
Ye-bun's dad misled them
purposely then, you're saying?

481
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,513
He did it for us?

482
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,311
That seems crazy. Why would he do that?

483
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:23,063
So Ki-ryong left Myeongjeong to go there.

484
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,859
Taepyeong-dong is what they're after,
it seems like.

485
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,987
The mounted bandits
will leave Myeongjeong for a while,

486
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,283
which leaves the town
with a minimal number of troops.

487
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,659
Then...

488
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:36,744
Then?

489
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,412
We'll break out of here, understand?

490
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,417
Better get started, then.

491
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:48,005
Wait. I mean, even with all of
those bandits gone, we're stuck in jail.

492
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,216
They took my guns, so what do we do?

493
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,219
Nam-chun already paid the price
to make this chance for us.

494
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,762
He stepped up to save us,

495
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,931
knowing full well
it may cost him his life.

496
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,600
Hurry. Hurry and break out, Choong-soo.

497
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:00,683
Hurry.

498
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,478
So, damn it, men,

499
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,314
we have to try something,
or we'll end up dead.

500
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,033
We might not have much longer to try

501
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,869
until Ki-ryong's damn bandits
discover the lie.

502
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:21,121
When Ki-ryong realizes
what's going on and returns...

503
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,998
Let's just make sure we're long gone.

504
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,125
- We'll be quick.
- And cunning.

505
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,294
- We'll rescue...
- We'll get the hell out of here.

506
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,810
Hey, you there.

507
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,105
Where are you heading now?

508
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,734
You have us all marching
to the northeast right now.

509
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,527
Huh?

510
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,948
Are you saying the village
is in Manchuria, or what?

511
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,785
How am I supposed to interpret your talk?

512
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,996
Blabbering on at me in Japanese like that.

513
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,462
Come here, Kimura.

514
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,382
Whoa.

515
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,510
General.

516
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:21,223
Soon he'll have to choose the path
to Dexsin or Yanji, where the road splits.

517
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,144
If he turns toward Yanji,
then we know he's been playing us both.

518
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:27,229
Dexsin means that we...

519
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,069
Dexsin would suggest
that we will go past Jisin

520
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:37,698
and aim at Hoeryŏng,
then go to the south once more.

521
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,074
Exactly.

522
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,785
So let's just wait until then.

523
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,829
Right now, that man is all we have.

524
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,918
Hey. Hey, show me your face.

525
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,853
We have to take them down quick
before we can liberate anyone.

526
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,689
- You can do it, right?
- Ah, come on. I can...

527
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,862
Ah, now you're pissing me off,
the way you're talking.

528
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,617
Tell me why you're still talking
like you're the boss right now?

529
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,452
You were never elected the boss here.

530
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,997
I said that?

531
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,084
Ah...

532
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,879
If you wanna nail this job here,

533
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,340
then it's my orders you'll follow
from now on, got it?

534
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,007
Do as I say.

535
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,222
Okay, I got it.

536
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,016
Give a command, then.

537
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,853
To make this whole escape work,

538
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,314
we gotta bring those bastards down first.

539
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:53,398
You can do it, right?

540
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,072
Better figure it out.

541
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,449
Your command, all right?

542
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,683
We're taking a smoke.
Yes, sir. Enjoy your time.

543
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,402
- What?
- Noonim, hey.

544
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,281
- What's wrong, Noonim?
- You all right?

545
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,909
Her wound must be infected.

546
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:30,996
Come on, she's real sick!
Do something! She might die!

547
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,206
Man!

548
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,750
- Man, hurry, we got someone dying!
- Are you okay?

549
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,543
Hurry, hurry! Let's go, you dumb fucker!

550
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,627
Quiet down!

551
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,505
I'm sorry, sir!

552
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,382
- Hey, she needs help!
- You're okay.

553
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,346
It really hurts!

554
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,848
- It hurts!
- Hey, come in here now!

555
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,266
Hurry up! She's dying!

556
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,935
I don't wanna die!

557
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,274
Just keep waiting.

558
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,616
What's going on?

559
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,952
It hurts right here.

560
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,204
It hurts!

561
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,833
I'm dying! I'm dying!

562
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,172
It hurts!

563
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,810
Ah shit.

564
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,524
You assholes!

565
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,068
You think I look stupid or something, huh?

566
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,451
Die, all of you!
You mongrel Joseon animals.

567
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,828
Hey!

568
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,038
What could we do?

569
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,957
I'm sorry, man.

570
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,501
"Sumimasen," you dumb fuck, okay?

571
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,295
Watch it!

572
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,468
Let go of me!
Just let go!

573
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,429
Just hold him, Geumsu, yes!

574
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,185
- Hey, stop!
- Just let go!

575
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,070
Don't make any noise. Just grab the body
so the thud doesn't alert anyone.

576
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,657
Man, I give the orders here.

577
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,165
Don't make any noise.
Grab the damn body so it doesn't thud.

578
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,419
I've got a question.
I'm genuinely curious.

579
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,130
How old you are?

580
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,301
Seems you might be worried, huh?

581
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,679
I've had more victims than you.
How's that?

582
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,974
That guy up there.

583
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,577
I fell down.
A bit slippery here, that's all.

584
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,900
Hurry, get the keys!

585
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,026
Push open the door!

586
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,277
Make it count!

587
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,198
Fall back, you damn fools!

588
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,546
I can't believe
you Joseon dogs.

589
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,715
There's no point in waiting.

590
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,428
Kill these assholes now!

591
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,526
- But it can't be you again?
- Yes, it can.

592
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,365
You're here!

593
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,742
Yoon!

594
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,494
Oh fuck. Oh man.

595
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,746
I thought we were dead.

596
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:01,975
Yanji or Dexsin, huh?

597
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,436
Which way do we need to go?

598
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,395
Hmm?

599
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,109
DEXIN

600
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,320
YANJI

601
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,741
Blabber as much as you want,

602
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,035
but I can't understand, so go this way.

603
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,383
Togu.

604
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,194
Why bother tricking us, huh?

605
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,572
Why bring me to this place, huh?

606
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:04,621
To stall. To stall for time, General!

607
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,499
Time for all his friends
to escape the jail!

608
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:10,752
And Myeongjeong's police
are too few to stop it.

609
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,840
All men, mount your horses now!

610
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,509
Make your way back to Myeongjeong, hurry.

611
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,592
Yes, sir!

612
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,430
And you can stay here.

613
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:26,017
If you pray enough,
you'll die quickly from shock.

614
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,813
If not, then you'll die slowly,
eaten alive by the beasts.

615
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,867
Take care of my girl...

616
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,163
Ye-bun, all right, Choong-soo? For me.

617
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,045
Took you long enough.

618
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,672
I know, sorry I'm late.

619
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,634
Yoon. It's about time, Yoon.

620
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,563
But why stick around to rescue us, huh?

621
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,315
At that point,

622
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:16,193
running the hell away was smarter, huh?

623
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,364
It's all my fault,
and I'm sorry you suffered for it.

624
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:24,367
We're family. You don't need
to say things like that, Yoon.

625
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,077
So don't make a fuss.

626
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,041
Nam-chun gave his life to save us all.

627
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,169
He made that sacrifice knowingly.

628
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,130
Yes, I saw him do that.

629
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,967
Nam-chun is still out there.
I won't quit just yet.

630
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,531
You just get everybody ready to go...

631
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,057
You are all surrounded!
Surrender now!

632
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,226
Sh. Keep low. Turn off the lights.

633
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,855
Make your surrender known
because if you don't,

634
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,816
you will be punished by my order
in the name of justice!

635
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,027
We... we will kill all of you!
