1
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,929
FIVE YEARS LATER, 1920

2
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:18,351
JAPANESE ARMY 19TH DIVISION
HOERYŎNG GARRISON CAMP

3
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,746
What's that?

4
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,081
Who... who is it?

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,420
State your name and rank.

6
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,047
Name and rank right now!

7
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,179
Sugiyama?

8
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,807
I need to talk to Major Minami.

9
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,274
Well, then, tell me.

10
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:09,360
What was it that happened
to the rest of your squad?

11
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,073
And how come you returned alive?

12
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,660
Yes, yesterday, we all went

13
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,081
on a scouting mission
to Orangkae Pass, and...

14
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,832
and then,

15
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,877
that was when they found us.

16
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,546
And just who are "they," huh?

17
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,720
Beasts and monsters.

18
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,981
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,860
You, there! Who are you?

20
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,581
Stop blocking the path

21
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,917
of the Imperial Scouting Force

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,545
of the great nation of Japan, you fool.

23
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,006
If you don't clear the way now,
you'll die!

24
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,218
This is the Orangkae Trail.

25
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,972
Hoeryŏng and on to Myeongjeong,
this all belongs to us,

26
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,682
so heed my warning!

27
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,519
If you try to take so much
as a single step forward,

28
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,271
you will be invading our land.

29
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,564
Do you understand?

30
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,358
If you dare to make one more move,

31
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,153
I'll crush all of your men into dust!

32
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,238
What did he say?

33
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,365
He lost his country
and his mind, I guess.

34
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,534
- Is he insane?
- Should we kill him, sir?

35
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,875
- Let's go on.
- March!

36
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,253
Sir, no!

37
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,922
Now you better listen!

38
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,009
- Load your guns, men!
- If you take one more step,

39
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,136
even a single step forward from there,

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,097
then you will all be utterly destroyed!

41
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,601
Don't take a step forward from...

42
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,437
Damn it. It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,564
Kill them all!

44
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,826
Kill them all!

45
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,953
- Kill them all!
- Charge, men!

46
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,674
So, then, you're saying
that your entire squad

47
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,760
was crushed without any resistance?

48
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,096
No, Major.
That's not what happened.

49
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,308
We all fought them back
as soldiers of our great army, sir.

50
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,644
Fire! Return fire!

51
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,687
Return fire!

52
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,152
However, much as I told you earlier,

53
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,240
they were all pure monsters, sir.

54
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,047
The man called Choi Choong-soo...

55
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,010
...used to be a leader
in Joseon's Righteous Army.

56
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,595
And despite his old age,

57
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,723
he still boasts of
inhumanly perfect aim with his bow.

58
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,895
And then the blade that he fought with...

59
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,073
...was strong enough
to cut through mountains

60
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,491
and stop rivers from flowing.

61
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,461
Help me! Anyone, help me!

62
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,156
Ah, this is how the old man
shows me thanks, huh?

63
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,543
Kang San-gun is

64
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,129
a great hunter
from Mount Seorak, they say.

65
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,506
The last of
the Joseon Tiger Hunting Force,

66
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,841
renowned for their skill.

67
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,935
Even amongst them,
his tiger-hunting skills were so great,

68
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,271
he was dubbed the "King of the Mountains."

69
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,280
So this Joseon commander,
fighting with just a sword and bow,

70
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,742
and his tiger-hunting friend
defeated your entire squad?

71
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,660
You've got to be kidding me, right?

72
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,622
I wish I'd imagined all of this, sir.
I really do.

73
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,377
Everyone from my squad would be alive
and sitting here with us today.

74
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,925
Ah, today I just keep on saving...

75
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,011
Hands in the air!

76
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,433
Hey. Come on. Just hear me out, okay?

77
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,062
Wait! Seeing violence
always roils my stomach, okay?

78
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,106
Wait while I close my eyes a bit, yeah?

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,651
I closed my eyes, Choraeng-yi!

80
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,905
Where is he?

81
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,409
Who is it?

82
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,246
Every single member of my squad,

83
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,456
they were all killed by Choraeng-yi.

84
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,252
Choraeng-yi, as his name implies,
used to be a clown in a Namsadangpae.

85
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,628
He moved so nimbly,

86
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,423
it was almost impossible
to hit him with a bullet.

87
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,803
He's a flying tiger. That's what he is!

88
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,448
No, uh, hurry, just load!

89
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,756
Whoa!

90
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,143
All done.

91
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,401
So then what's all that screaming
I can still hear over there, you liar?

92
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:10,031
That isn't me, man.

93
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:11,824
Okay, I swear to you.

94
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,118
Geumsu. It's Geumsu.

95
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,214
Then there's the Geumsu.
He was truly worse than a beast itself.

96
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,946
I don't know anything at all
about the man or his history...

97
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,325
...other than

98
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,119
he is a devil
that no ordinary soldier could ever kill.

99
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,039
And you cowered and cringed
so they'd let you live.

100
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,086
That's how you managed
to survive the fight, isn't it?

101
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,173
Because you begged?
Is that what you did?

102
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,431
I don't need a soldier
who begs the enemy for his life.

103
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,102
So take your own life.

104
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,146
Sir, I... I'm sorry!
Truly, I'm sorry!

105
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,940
Your words are meaningless now!

106
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,442
Do what you must and be brave.

107
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,446
Wait, I... I...
I know who's been leading them, sir.

108
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,865
The face of their captain!

109
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,326
Sir, I saw their captain's face.

110
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,875
Then what did he look like?

111
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,129
Just what does their captain's face
look like, then, huh?

112
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,507
He... he... he is a...

113
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,468
...he is a...

114
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,929
You're the only one left.

115
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,017
Do you wanna join them too?

116
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,769
You're the only one
of your squad left.

117
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,771
Do you want to join them in the grave?

118
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,316
No. No!

119
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,861
Then forsake everything you own,
and I'll let you live.

120
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:17,158
Give up everything you own,
and he just might let you leave alive.

121
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,827
Your conscience, your beliefs,

122
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,705
your country forsaken, then you can live.

123
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,172
You're better off than us, at least,

124
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,634
by having things to abandon, you see?

125
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,428
Their captain's

126
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,388
face is...

127
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,059
Soon you can observe it for yourself, sir.

128
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,355
The enemy! The enemy is here!

129
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,815
Someone bring me a gun!

130
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,320
You pathetic, cowardly bastard!

131
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,906
I wanted to keep on living,
even as a coward. I'm sorry, sir...

132
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,241
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

133
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,577
We can't hold them!

134
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,586
Good evening.
It's so nice to meet you.

135
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,214
Look, this jackass doesn't even say hello!

136
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,480
Are you with the insurgents?

137
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,662
Are you with the insurgents?

138
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,372
No, no.

139
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,836
Just bandits.

140
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,251
SONG OF THE BANDITS

141
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,304
GYEONGSEONG, AUGUST 1920

142
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,658
I asked you to see me here like this,
even though I'm being improper.

143
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,682
I'm sorry for that.

144
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,352
It's just that

145
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,189
there's a question I must ask
if that's all right with you?

146
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,900
Of course. What's your question?

147
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,776
Would you...

148
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,947
consider marriage to me, or...

149
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,418
Why did you wait so long to ask though?

150
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,004
You left me waiting for ages.

151
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,671
What?

152
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,802
I will marry you.
Gwang-il, I would like to.

153
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,807
Wait. You mean that?

154
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,101
You're saying you wanna get married?

155
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,652
My whole life...

156
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,572
my whole life, I will always love you.

157
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,036
Hee-shin.

158
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,996
I will too.

159
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,417
You are the only one I love, Gwang-il.

160
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,681
Come on.

161
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,976
Put your back into it!

162
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,398
Damn! Now these are some great guns, huh?

163
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,775
Yeah. By the way, did you hear?

164
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,735
What is it?

165
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,488
The independence soldiers
won again, you know?

166
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,865
And it seems like

167
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,909
they beat the Japanese Army
real good this time, you know?

168
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:29,993
Really?

169
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,327
Then that's great.

170
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,958
Yeah, it seems
the insurgent army is winning.

171
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,127
They could actually
bring back a little freedom, huh?

172
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,129
I'd never have guessed. It's crazy.

173
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,505
It may not be freedom quite yet,

174
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,008
but in Gando, I guess,
they're all breathing easier.

175
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,385
Oh, you're right, yeah.

176
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,513
I turned all patriotic
without even realizing it. Wow.

177
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,974
Hey. Hey, you.

178
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,809
Look.
That asshole's at it again.

179
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,227
Hmm?

180
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,564
It's becoming a full-blown addiction now.
Look at that damn thief. Just look.

181
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,485
How long's he been stealing?

182
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,041
He's been stealing from us
since he came here, so it's been a while.

183
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,700
He steals those
and sells 'em behind our backs.

184
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,868
Really?

185
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,914
Just how much do you need to love money
to steal from your... It's just... Ah, fuck.

186
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,584
Assholes like him would sell,
like, their own mothers, you know?

187
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,629
Goddamn traitor, that asshole.
He's just... Ugh!

188
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,548
Laughing?

189
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,929
Hyung, come on, don't.
Go and talk to him, at least. Seriously!

190
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,598
If you don't knock it off,
I'll break both...

191
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,770
Aw, fuck.

192
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,064
You all right?

193
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,398
Yeah.

194
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,276
I guess I, uh,
went too hard with my gun earlier,

195
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,653
but it's fine, it's fine.

196
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,372
You sure you're fine?

197
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,958
Yeah, don't worry. Anyway, Hyung.

198
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,879
If we're really gonna be free men,
I'm really hoping it happens soon.

199
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,382
I can tolerate
a lot of this outlaw lifestyle...

200
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,010
...but the food is complete shit.

201
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,054
It doesn't sit right.
It makes me homesick.

202
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,403
What's the worst part, then?

203
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,906
Hey, I'm just saying.
Freedom seems kinda nice, don't you think?

204
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,700
But I'm not picky.

205
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,493
What's this freedom nonsense?

206
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,329
What, do you think it's easy
to break free?

207
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,082
Ten years at least before we're free.
You can count on it.

208
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,210
See, the shaman just came by two days ago,
and that's what she says.

209
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,920
Yeah, right. She's useless, your shaman.

210
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,799
And she looks way more like a general
than a mystic, and she makes up stuff.

211
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,010
She said that I was going
to get married, you jackass.

212
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,637
It's 'cause you refused
to do her ritual, that's why.

213
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,514
Got you a discount
and everything, cheap-ass.

214
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,516
- Come on, you little...
- Ah!

215
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,518
Choraeng-yi arranged it?

216
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,480
Busy guy, huh?

217
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,525
Oh, yeah, Hyung.
Busy, crazy guy, all right.

218
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,153
He'll just grab a guy at random
from the village and say,

219
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:11,321
"A spirit's on your back!
You need a ritual, quick!"

220
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,991
And for how much? Ten won, right? Huh?

221
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,621
It was 20 won to start,
but I cut it down 50%.

222
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,999
I worked really hard
to persuade the shaman.

223
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,625
It took three days!

224
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,211
- Twenty won?
- Whoa!

225
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,047
Whoa, guys!

226
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,466
- Hey, stop it!
- Oh no, what's gotten into them now?

227
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,803
You said 30 won
for my father's sending ritual!

228
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,014
And my mother's ritual was the same price!

229
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,682
Thirty won!

230
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,934
You just took me for 60 won,
you son of a bitch!

231
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,352
- Hang on.
- Get over here!

232
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,896
I'll pull out that lying tongue!

233
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:46,273
Watching our men
just beating up each other...

234
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,232
Come here!

235
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,234
...scares me way more than the Japanese.

236
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,072
Wow, the moment they lock eyes,
you can bet a battle's about to start.

237
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,075
Huh? They wouldn't come here
if their brains worked right, huh?

238
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,534
They'd join the insurgents.

239
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,870
Leave 'em alone. They'll stop before long.

240
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,205
That's the dilemma, Hyung,

241
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,008
because when they need, they waste money
on some medical care, right?

242
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,603
Can you stop giggling
and make those guys...

243
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,254
Ah, forget it, forget it. Choong-soo, hey!

244
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,590
Choong-soo, they're fighting again!

245
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,010
Hey, where is the old man?
Probably napping somewhere, huh?

246
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:18,097
Ah shit.
He must be hiding somewhere again.

247
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,183
Hey, stop fighting, you assholes!

248
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,527
You're here again, huh?

249
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,156
You didn't have to come all the way here.
It's a rough climb.

250
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,992
Yeah, the climb is rough,
so I was worried you'd get hurt.

251
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,620
You can see Joseon so well from here.

252
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,540
That's why
they call it the Orangkae Pass.

253
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,834
You know, back in the day,

254
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,796
this is exactly where
the savages gathered and stood

255
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,674
and looked down at the Joseon lands.

256
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,260
And the sight
ignited their ambition to invade.

257
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,595
But now, the situation's reversed.

258
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,432
Now, it's such a doleful place
for those forced to leave their lands.

259
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,854
You miss it dearly?

260
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,690
Very much so.

261
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,610
When I think of my home,
there's nothing I don't miss.

262
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,448
Everything that was truly important
that mattered before all this,

263
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:22,286
I would have appreciated more
if I'd known I'd be away for so long.

264
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,250
Are you thinking of that lady again?

265
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,087
Strangely, I always seem
to think of her here...

266
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,758
...because she was my first
in a few respects.

267
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,261
Is that right?

268
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,140
What were those respects, exactly?

269
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,145
Mm, the first noble to ask my name,
not who I served.

270
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,231
The first noble to smile
and hold my hand in hers.

271
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,442
And the first person who...

272
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,530
brought me sincere joy
just by looking me in the eyes.

273
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,532
The first time I felt like that, yeah.

274
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,328
Though she must've forgotten me now.

275
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,412
So,

276
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,459
you miss her a lot, don't you, Yoon?

277
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,753
I do regret it a bit

278
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,381
with how much Ionging I've ended up with.

279
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,094
I should've gone to see her more.

280
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,483
Yes, I regret it. Just like you.

281
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,603
- This is it?
- Yes.

282
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,105
Then let's go.

283
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,128
Hee-shin.

284
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:42,467
What are you doing way out here?
I didn't know you had a meeting today.

285
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,512
Yes, I'm here on business,
just for an interview.

286
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,473
- It's related to my work.
- Oh, of course. I see, yes.

287
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,477
Right. This here
is First Lieutenant Han Tae-ju.

288
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,854
He's a subordinate of...

289
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:57,357
Uh, he's a friend of mine, yes.

290
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
We've been partnered together too.

291
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,031
Hello, Lieutenant.

292
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,533
My pleasure entirely, miss.

293
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,702
And my congrats.
You'll make a stunning bride.

294
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,912
I'm flattered. Thanks.

295
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,334
Oh, do you think you'd mind
if I sat with you for just a minute?

296
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,003
Oh, no. Not at all. Have a seat.

297
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:24,384
Uh, would you, uh,
go and save us a seat over there?

298
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,636
Oh, yes.

299
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,473
Well, miss,
thanks for the pleasure of meeting.

300
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,771
Have a seat.

301
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,401
So you're here for work, you said?

302
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,904
That's strange.
Why didn't you say anything?

303
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,949
Uh, the meeting was a bit sudden,
that's all.

304
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,202
My apologies.
There wasn't time to tell you.

305
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,163
See, a ceremony's being held
in Myeongjeong

306
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,832
for the Cheondo Light Railway
on the 30th this month.

307
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,542
The Japanese government decided

308
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,754
I'll attend the groundbreaking
as their ambassador.

309
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,838
Oh.

310
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,508
Myeongjeong.

311
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,677
Well, Myeongjeong is dangerous

312
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,889
because a lot of the insurgents
live there, you see.

313
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,182
Try to be cautious.

314
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,435
And submit a request to the State Office
to get some guards to escort you.

315
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,980
Yes, of course.
I'm happy to do as you say.

316
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,525
Your concern is appreciated.

317
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,859
No, it's my duty, you know?

318
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:26,196
It's natural to look after
your future wife. Don't mention it.

319
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,118
Uh, Hee-shin.

320
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,495
I'm sorry, but it's...

321
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,372
Well, it's your appointment, uh,

322
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,542
can you try to have it somewhere else?

323
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,211
In some other place, why?

324
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,047
An insurgent is going to come here.

325
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
What?

326
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,601
My sources have discovered a tailor,
a man named Jang Seok,

327
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,061
in the Main District.

328
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,705
And we received intel that he's meeting

329
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,489
a member of the Independence Army
here today.

330
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:05,026
So you understand
why I'm here with "friends" too.

331
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,905
Uh...
Is... is that right?

332
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,783
Yes. So, then, Hee-shin,
move your appointment, all right?

333
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,661
You and I are
working for the country as patriots.

334
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,290
It's just the job that I'm doing
is a little bit rough,

335
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,834
and I feel like
my fiancée can't be exposed to it.

336
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,296
Right.
Perhaps I'd better take that advice.

337
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,302
Then I should leave without delay
but make doubly sure you're safe.

338
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,387
I love you, Gwang-il.

339
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,311
Hee-shin.

340
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,900
I love you too, my dear.

341
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,938
Stop, hey!

342
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,612
What's going on?

343
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,620
You asshole!

344
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,706
I'll crush you, you bastard!

345
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,418
Get up!

346
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,754
You Josenjing!

347
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,427
Look away.

348
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,224
Maybe you should just go.

349
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,187
I'll talk to you soon.

350
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,240
I think there was a leak.

351
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,826
They knew everything.

352
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,203
Time, place, even Jang's identity.

353
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,080
It was a nearly seamless ambush.

354
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:26,001
It's likely the leak originated
with our side.

355
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,504
Sir, you must take precautions.

356
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,883
And especially, keep an eye on your crew.

357
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,762
The war funds we were sending
to the North Route Army.

358
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,848
Comrade Jang Seok had it, didn't he?

359
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,309
And the plan was for you
to receive it today

360
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,603
and deliver it to the North Route Army.

361
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,687
Yes.

362
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,940
Unfortunate.

363
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,737
My men can't hope to get
100,000 won so soon.

364
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,821
But maybe

365
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,699
we try other options.

366
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,659
What other option?

367
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,329
Hoeryŏng's Bank branch

368
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,664
is sending twice that
to Gando's Myeongjeong office

369
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,500
as a railroad construction fund
on August 30th.

370
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,421
We'll loot the entire sum
and give it to the North Route Army.

371
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,759
You mean, you seriously intend
to raid an armored truck?

372
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,431
It's much too perilous.

373
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,393
If the worst-case scenario should happen,
and our people get caught,

374
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,662
our whole organization will...

375
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,229
Don't you worry about that.

376
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,940
I could do it myself, sir,

377
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,276
without support from here.

378
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,278
How could you possibly do that?

379
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,696
No.

380
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,450
Let's find another way.

381
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:43,787
I can't approve of an operation
that puts anyone's life at this much risk.

382
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,872
- No, sir, I'm...
- Comrade Nam.

383
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,126
Just when, exactly, will you
stop shaming yourself this way?

384
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,340
I'm mortified that I had to match you
with that bastard Gwang-il.

385
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,551
I'm so ashamed that I can't

386
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,888
even bear the thought of
making myself face you.

387
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:07,352
- I've decided the operation won't happen.
- They get one rifle.

388
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,187
200 bullets.

389
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,773
One hand grenade.

390
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,069
Five potatoes.

391
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:17,987
A portion of grain.

392
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,490
A pair of straw shoes.

393
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,242
Those are...

394
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,957
what the soldiers in Gando receive
on their enlistment as supply kits.

395
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,878
Six days is how long
those supplies must last.

396
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,425
You claim you'll stop something

397
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,386
that risks the life of someone with us?

398
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,973
We can't sit back and wait.

399
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,518
We can't stop.
We have to put some lives at risk

400
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,521
so that our comrades
who are fighting in Gando

401
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,273
will have another meal to eat...

402
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,776
and one more chance to fight on.

403
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,405
And they'll live...

404
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,742
for just one day more.

405
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,343
All right, then, let's do it.

406
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:26,806
I'll agree to have you rendezvous
directly with the North Route Army,

407
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,809
but let someone else
rob the armored truck.

408
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,894
Sir, no.

409
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:34,314
We don't know if the spy
who betrayed Jang Seok will move again.

410
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,193
- There's too much risk that...
- I'm talking about an outsider.

411
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,111
The plan won't be leaked that way.

412
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,156
It'll be very dangerous though.

413
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:46,659
So, then, someone more dangerous
should take it on.

414
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,412
Who might accomplish the task?

415
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,372
I know who.

416
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,042
Someone capable of anything,

417
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,212
who'd maim or murder anyone all for money.

418
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,845
Please enjoy your meal.

419
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,938
The reason why I asked
to see you gentlemen like this

420
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:20,026
is that I simply have to admit that
I cannot fulfill both of your requests.

421
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,741
So I asked you both
to have some dinner tonight

422
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,869
in order to extend you this offer.

423
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,580
Park Chun-ho, sir,

424
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,750
you had wanted Kawaguchi here
to be killed, isn't that correct?

425
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,671
Ah, you already know my answer,
Eon-nyeoni.

426
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,718
And Kawaguchi wanted Mr. Park Chun-ho dead
as well, unless that was a mistake, sir?

427
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,345
No, that's right.

428
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,515
They say that life and death
are in Providence's hands.

429
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,062
So then, people's mortality
is already destined,

430
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,898
and the length of a life
is determined by the heavens,

431
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,441
not by a man's will.

432
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,904
So it's up to the heavens.

433
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,156
I can't be held responsible for it.

434
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,247
Well, then, we'll start at 100 won.
The bid is set.

435
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,501
You're saying that whoever wins this wager
is the one whose request you'll grant?

436
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,585
Yes.

437
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,297
Your offer, then, sir.

438
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,965
Whoever bids the highest wins.

439
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,802
I sure get surprised more by folks I know.

440
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,137
Ah, come on.

441
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,431
You'll pretend it's the "heavens"?

442
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,474
It is the heavens' decision.

443
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,730
See, cash is what I view as
the will of the heavens.

444
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,815
Ah shit.

445
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:41,900
Oh, forget it.

446
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,817
I quit.

447
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,863
110 won.

448
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,122
Kawaguchi here takes aim
with a 110-won bet, I believe.

449
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,123
Your offer, sir?

450
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,837
You know what? Fine.

451
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,172
Then I'll bet as well.

452
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,467
120.

453
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,555
120 won is the bid now!

454
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,723
Another offer, sir?

455
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,351
130 won.

456
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,353
Bet's raised by ten won.

457
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,897
- Ten won more!
- 140 won!

458
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,398
150 won!

459
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:23,982
Bet's now ten more!

460
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,068
Make it...

461
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,196
155.

462
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,697
155!

463
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,074
160 won!

464
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,203
Kawaguchi offers up
an additional bet of five more won.

465
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,622
- What do you say, sir?
- Make it ten more.

466
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,082
That's it. I can't do more.

467
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,293
Mr. Park Chun-ho counters with 170, sir.

468
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,587
What say you?

469
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,839
One hundred...

470
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,716
And?

471
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,180
No!

472
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:55,932
200!

473
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:59,394
You're a dead man now, bastard!

474
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,648
Hey, you motherfucker!
That's how far you'll go to kill me, eh?

475
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,650
Jackass! You asshole!

476
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,237
Goddamn it.

477
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,571
Ah!

478
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,949
Park Chun-ho, sir, come.

479
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,077
Now don't make a scene. Just sit down.

480
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,621
Nothing is settled quite yet.

481
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,545
Park Chun-ho has just bid 170,

482
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,132
and Kawaguchi has made a bid
of 200 won, right?

483
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,051
In that case,

484
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,181
Kawaguchi's request
is the one I should rightly grant.

485
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,516
Isn't that correct, sir?

486
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:41,893
However...

487
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,858
Park Chun-ho is a friend
who I've counted on for years now.

488
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:50,903
And he's a friend who I won't betray
for just a measly 30 won.

489
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,411
Sir, I'm very sorry.

490
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:01,080
Wait, what did you just say?

491
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,582
By his reaction,

492
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,210
I guess that you're saying I won, huh?

493
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,588
Well, then?

494
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:09,839
You did.

495
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,218
You, friend, have indeed won.
That's what the heavens planned.

496
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,344
Really?

497
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,061
You're a dead man now,
you asshole.

498
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,497
You thought you'd come and do business
across the Cheonggye,

499
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,521
you Japanese bastard?

500
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,325
How dare you,
you Josenjing peasant harlot!

501
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,952
You think you can wrong me
and live?

502
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,455
Yes, a Joseon girl
is doing this, that's right.

503
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,541
But that's why I wouldn't try it

504
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,044
unless I'm sure.

505
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,338
So, then, Mr. Kawaguchi,

506
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,340
go home to your hole...

507
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,885
and screw yourself, man.

508
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,892
Damn it!

509
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,902
All of you, take out your guns!
That peasant!

510
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,914
Kawaguchi's men
will be barging in any second now.

511
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,252
Use the back door right there.
You can escape through that.

512
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:33,172
And you should call me
next time you need a killer.

513
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,633
And your service fee?

514
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,846
Set it down there, okay?
It'll be there when it's done.

515
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,097
Oh, sure.

516
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,771
Fire!

517
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,086
It's her! Get her, quickly!

518
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,438
Don't lose her!

519
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:42,718
Die!

520
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,564
Die!

521
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,319
The girl's alone! Hurry!

522
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,630
- Kill her!
- Kill her!

523
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,632
Stop right there!

524
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:24,648
You may take seventeen won...

525
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,111
...and tomorrow's schedule.

526
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,041
Your parents' killer is near.

527
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,045
Gando, that's what I heard.

528
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:49,465
Gando is still quite vague.

529
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,175
Should I find out exactly?

530
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,554
That's all right.
I don't really care.

531
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,225
What kind of response is that?

532
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,436
You became this type of a woman
so you could

533
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,813
kill your parents' killer, didn't you?

534
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,025
It seems like
all the bloody battles I fought

535
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,027
changed things.

536
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,156
My big plans for revenge seem so

537
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,368
utterly useless to me now, you know?

538
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,622
Now it's important to live and eat right.

539
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,001
It doesn't matter anymore,
you know?

540
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,546
So don't look for him, all right?

541
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,007
And if I see him at some other time, I'll...

542
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,386
be sure to kill him then.

543
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:38,930
See ya.

544
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,158
DANSEONGSA MOVIE THEATER, 11:30 A.M.

545
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:22,141
You can't even open a door,
you moronic ass!

546
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:25,102
Noble birth, sure.
I can't believe I hired a moron like you!

547
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,313
- Sorry, miss. Ah!
- Get out of the way.

548
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,744
Ah.

549
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,037
Hello.

550
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,663
Where's Yoon at now? Yoon, huh?

551
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,916
Uh, he's up to something over there.

552
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,970
Don't laugh! Stand straight.

553
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,764
Legs out wider.

554
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,016
- Look up, now.
- Yes, sir.

555
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,812
Oh, great. What the hell?

556
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:11,732
Load it.

557
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,815
I did that.

558
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,317
Then, pull.

559
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,201
Hey, now, quit fucking around, asshole.

560
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,369
It won't work right.

561
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,746
Hey. Stop that! Hey, hey, hey!

562
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,085
How dare you?
The shooting range is holy, jackass!

563
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,339
And stop that smiling!

564
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,176
Oh! Hey!

565
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,721
Miss, hi! There's something cool I found.
It's amazing. Come on!

566
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,015
Quit your blabbering.
Is Yoon here? Get him for me now.

567
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,558
Hey, don't be such a meanie.

568
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,727
You could make me cry
if you keep doing that.

569
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,481
Ah, like I'm someone who cares at all
about hurting you. Bring him here!

570
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,044
You're really in the shit, okay?
You're about to starve to death, you shit.

571
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,278
- Uh...
- So now what's going on?

572
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,990
How will we end up dead?

573
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,161
You said the Japanese
blocked all our arms trade here,

574
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,289
so it's pointless to get you guns
because you can't sell any?

575
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,001
Do you know Bongo-dong, that whole thing?

576
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:16,088
The army has totally smashed
the Japanese recently.

577
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,464
That's a big part of it.

578
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,605
And they can't dispatch their main forces

579
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,915
since that would likely mean
a brush with Chinese forces.

580
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,009
Since they can't find
everybody they'd need to kill,

581
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,094
the plan now is just to...

582
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,433
Bleed us dry of guns and artillery.

583
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,563
What does the army say?
They have any ideas?

584
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,773
They tried in Yeonhaeju, it seems.

585
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,358
Did our ties there help at all?

586
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,695
The Czechs make things
a bit tricky there, you know.

587
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,990
They sell weapons dirt cheap
to earn enough to sail home again.

588
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,158
Buy a gun over there,

589
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:46,493
somehow a cannon just appears
gift-wrapped alongside.

590
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,995
Bastards are crazy.

591
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,581
And the Chinese Bonggye warlords?

592
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,224
You should be able to sell to them.
They're not part of all this.

593
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,711
Bonggye won't buy anything.

594
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,546
Not from us. We're a threat now.

595
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,423
Since our forces are getting stronger,

596
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,925
anyone from Joseon
is getting treated warily now.

597
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,720
Let's be real.
Our strong forces give us hope, all right?

598
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,680
We're a risk to those other guys.

599
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,558
We just cause friction
between them and the Japanese.

600
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,851
Oh shit.

601
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,520
Damn, Gando's a tough place
to do any business, huh?

602
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,316
Well, we still need
some other possible routes.

603
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:20,211
With a lot of mouths to feed,
we should do something, or they'll starve.

604
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,695
I have an idea.

605
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:25,532
What if we try, um,
shifting our plan just a bit?

606
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,660
I heard a little something
I bet you'll like.

607
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,169
What's this little something?

608
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:41,548
Recently, the government released plans
for a railroad to Manchuria, right?

609
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,259
It's a ten-year plan to connect

610
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,429
the Gilhoe, Gyeongwon,
and Hamgyeong lines all in one stretch.

611
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,473
All built within the next ten years.

612
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,352
Gyeongwon Line runs
from Gyeongseong to Wonsan.

613
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,313
Hamgyeong runs from Wonsan to Hoeryŏng.

614
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,732
The Gilhoe Railroad runs
from Hoeryŏng to Jilin.

615
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:00,192
So once it's completed,

616
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,237
Gyeongseong to Myeongjeong
to Jilin, all in one shot.

617
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,698
Japanese soldiers and weaponry
all right smack in the middle of our land.

618
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,035
Then it's no longer just a matter of us
blocking off the Orangkae Pass.

619
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,118
Think about it.

620
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,622
If they haul it all through
on these rail lines,

621
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,165
the Japanese will break us down.

622
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,334
Even if the Chinese joined up,
they'd have us beat.

623
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,506
So if the Gando Line gets built,

624
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,010
a huge Japanese force will come here,
and we're incapable of stopping it, right?

625
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:35,143
So that's bad. Could you explain
how any of that's good information?

626
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,604
Hey, why are you saying it's bad?

627
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,692
Do you think
railroads don't cost anything?

628
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:42,943
They sure do.

629
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:45,529
They cost a lot of money.

630
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,659
I said it when you first came here,
didn't I, huh?

631
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,995
Japanese cash,
Chinese land, and Joseon folks,

632
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,080
but who's gonna win the place in the end?

633
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,208
Go on.

634
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,837
Does that mean something?

635
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,548
Japanese wealth here

636
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,301
stretching its mouth wide
to eat up Chinese land.

637
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,887
What about us Joseon people?
Don't we get a share?

638
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,096
We should.

639
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,181
Yoon!

640
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,350
Get that money.

641
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:23,734
The Joseon Government Railway
has arranged for a manager

642
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,068
to travel to Myeongjeong.

643
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,822
The groundbreaking ceremony
for the Cheondo Light Railway

644
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,073
is on the 30th.

645
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,744
You're my client, I'm guessing?

646
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,791
However,
the groundbreaking is just a ruse.

647
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,269
Their real purpose is to inspect...

648
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,878
The Gando Line site.

649
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:43,962
Exactly.

650
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,750
The critical thing, however,

651
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:48,592
is that the Bank of Joseon
will send the funds by rail transport.

652
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,594
I bet you can guess where it lands.

653
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,429
Gando's Myeongjeong office.

654
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:56,141
They'll be moving assets.
A construction fund for the Gando Line.

655
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,893
I would like you...

656
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,393
...to acquire it all...

657
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,189
...and see it here to me.

658
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:05,734
So I'll be stealing money?
Railroad construction money?

659
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:11,365
Well, how much is it?

660
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:12,949
200,000.

661
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,577
200,000?

662
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:16,828
Hold it. How much?

663
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,497
That's right. 200,000.

664
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,750
What? I bet your heart
is pump-pumping now.

665
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,418
Oh God!

666
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,339
Well, then, um, go right ahead.

667
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:31,093
I paid a friend at the office a ton
to really investigate the entire plan,

668
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,469
so the intel's all been checked.

669
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,472
It's bona fide, Yoon.
And you know I gotta mention this.

670
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,058
It would be best
that you not think of going solo.

671
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,477
The Government-General's money stolen

672
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,730
by a woman from Namsan
and by the name of Eon-nyeoni.

673
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,234
Lee Yoon of Taepyeong-dong
is going to rob the government

674
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,902
and plans to pocket the cash.

675
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,739
Get your boys' mouths shut tight,
and don't let rumors spread, yeah?

676
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,075
Don't be concerned.

677
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,953
I certainly work on the dangerous side,

678
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,455
but I always live my life
on the smart side.

679
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,458
Am I worth the risk?

680
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,502
Ah, come on.
You trust the boys around here.

681
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,712
They keep our secrets.

682
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,795
Uh...

683
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,050
All right, all right. You promise me.

684
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,176
I will trust you.

685
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,845
Ah, I'm really special, huh?

686
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,346
To be blessed by your trust.

687
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,391
I'm wondering though.

688
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,474
Can I ask?

689
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,519
Sure, I'm listening.

690
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,148
This railway manager,
they'll run the project here?

691
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,941
Uh-huh, that's correct.

692
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:31,361
And they're coming
to the groundbreaking, you said?

693
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,029
Why?

694
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,907
So is this person a target?

695
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,619
If, by chance,
someone gets in our way,

696
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,372
and things do not go as planned,

697
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,916
then what are you willing to do?

698
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,544
You know what I'll do.

699
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,172
They need to die.
They're attempting to grab our land.

700
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,675
They'll need to die, of course.
They're attempting to take our money.

701
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:58,138
I mean, that's what I do, you know?
I'm paid to carry out murders like that.

702
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:00,140
It's the calling I chose, you know.

703
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,852
Killing people like them
and to protect this town here.

704
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,189
I simply wish that you keep your word.

705
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,484
I'm going to kill them with an audience.

706
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,736
And as cruelly as I can.

707
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,865
That way, I will teach them all
that Gando comes at a high cost.

708
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,284
Do you think that's necessary?

709
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,121
Yes, I think that it is.

710
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,085
We can't keep running away to survive.

711
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,171
For the first time...

712
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,800
...let us be seen as humans.
