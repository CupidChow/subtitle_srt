1
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,767
Encantadia is home to four
kingdoms

2
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:21,800
and territories brimming
with wonder and power.

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,267
Get ready!

4
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:51,200
They were the heirs

5
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:57,000
and protectors of the four
sacred gems that gave life

6
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,500
and protection to the whole
of Encantadia.

7
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:23,667
I cannot believe the day would
come when Arsus would be slain.

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,600
We owe that female warrior our
freedom.

9
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,767
From this day on,
I shall be...

10
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:35,167
the one you will call Queen!

11
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:43,867
I will seize the land
I loathe the most Encantadia!

12
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:08,333
The New Defender Goddess
Cassiopea is right.

13
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,967
She has never had a vision
that didn't come true.

14
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,400
So if there's danger looming
over her life,

15
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,800
then it might also mean danger
for all of Encantadia.

16
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,833
You are right, my queen.

17
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,400
That's why we must prepare.

18
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:29,367
Perhaps this is also the right
time to train our children

19
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:33,267
as the new guardians
of the gems we hold.

20
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,667
So that we can prepare them,

21
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,967
in case something terrible
happens to the four of us.

22
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:43,300
Nothing bad will happen to the
powerful Sang'gre.

23
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:48,467
You, whom I grew up seeing
as great warriors.

24
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:52,400
You will remain guardians,
not only of the gems,

25
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,633
but of all Encantadia.

26
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:00,367
But Amihan still died,

27
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:04,133
even though she was already
queen and held the gem of air.

28
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,800
So how can you be so certain,
my queen?

29
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:12,400
You've also witnessed the
miraculous events of the past,

30
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,767
and you are one of them,
Cassandra.

31
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,000
You, who miraculously
grew up overnight

32
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,933
and became the new queen.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,833
You know that many more
extraordinary things

34
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,400
can still happen.

35
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:26,867
Phenomena that may bring about
new enemies.

36
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,567
If that's the case, then there's
no time left to waste.

37
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,833
Begin the training and
preparation of your children.

38
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,267
As you command, my queen.

39
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,400
But the gem of air
that you hold...

40
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,100
who have you chosen
to inherit it?

41
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:59,767
The gem of air...

42
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:03,000
will choose the one worthy
to inherit it.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,867
I trust that person
will come for the gem.

44
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:33,800
The land of the curse in
Mine-a-ve.

45
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:46,500
Are you ready for our...

46
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,900
Deia, what are you doing here?

47
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:56,367
I'm imitating the Queen Mitena,
Mother.

48
00:05:56,433 --> 00:06:01,700
Mother, I also wish
to be a great dariken like her.

49
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:05,467
How can you be a great dariken
when you're weak and sickly,

50
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,700
Deia?

51
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,300
I'm not weak, Veshdita!

52
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,033
That's enough, Deia.

53
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,267
Go back inside our hut and rest.

54
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,533
You might fall sick again.

55
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,133
Wait for us there
until we return.

56
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,733
Where are you going, Mother?

57
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,467
Our queen is going to train us
to become great warriors.

58
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,100
That's why I can't
wait any longer.

59
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,200
I want to come with you, Mother!

60
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,600
I also want to train and learn
from the Queen.

61
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,400
Maybe someday...

62
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,333
when you're older, Deia.

63
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,333
But why are you bringing
Veshdita with you?

64
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:49,367
Because Veshdita comes from
the bloodline of our warriors,

65
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,633
so she too must be trained.

66
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,000
And you, Deia, you are our
little princess.

67
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,700
You should never wield weapons.

68
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:04,300
But how will I ever become
like our Queen Mitena

69
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,033
if I don't train like you do?

70
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,733
Deia, our Queen Mitena
is one of a kind.

71
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,067
Perhaps no one will ever surpass
her.

72
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,400
So now, go back inside our hut
at once.

73
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,467
Let's go.

74
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,567
You're wrong, Mother.

75
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:34,700
Someday, I'll be just like our
Queen Mitena.

76
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:39,100
I'll be a great warrior too.

77
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,667
Your weapon should never fall
from your hand.

78
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,333
You still need to learn to be
strong and resilient

79
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,967
so that you can defend our world

80
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:15,667
from anyone who wishes
to conquer it.

81
00:08:19,033 --> 00:08:20,967
Pick up your weapon

82
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,200
and face me again.

83
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:02,000
Gaiea, come.

84
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:27,667
The earth has a spirit.

85
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,200
It hears us...

86
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,033
it watches.

87
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,800
Come, touch the sand...

88
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,300
and feel its heartbeat.

89
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:03,867
Now, my child...

90
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:07,167
ask the earth...

91
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,667
to move.

92
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,000
It's not working, Mother.

93
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,933
Words are not needed, my child.

94
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,633
Your intention is enough.

95
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:51,967
The earth will become
your ally...

96
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:55,133
if you show it respect.

97
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,667
Mother, I did it!

98
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,167
Yes, my child.

99
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,667
And remember...

100
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:25,667
this isn't about power.

101
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,800
This...

102
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:30,333
is about harmony.

103
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,133
The earth is alive, my child,

104
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,667
and it will only be
your ally...

105
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:40,267
if you treat it with respect.

106
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,267
My son, water is both...

107
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,633
gentle and strong.

108
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:15,967
You must feel its current
and its flow.

109
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,900
Mother, this is so hard!

110
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,967
I can't do it!

111
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,533
Adamus, son...

112
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,633
a guardian of the gem
does not give up so easily.

113
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,933
Every Sang'gre

114
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,600
goes through the challenge of
training.

115
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:09,800
Understood?

116
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:12,800
If we had just given up...

117
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,933
no one would be left to defend
Encantadia.

118
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,967
Come.

119
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,600
Come, let's do it again.

120
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,600
Show me how strong

121
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,000
your heart and mind are.

122
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,133
Your whole life...

123
00:14:17,367 --> 00:14:22,100
you've been used to always
running away and being afraid

124
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,800
of your enemies!

125
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:28,267
And your weapons...

126
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,900
you've only used them

127
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,900
to capture the animals.

128
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,967
But that will change now!

129
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:39,300
Because your weapons will be
used,

130
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:43,133
not only to defend yourselves,

131
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,933
but to become fierce warriors
of Mine-a-ve!

132
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,933
You cannot be weak...

133
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,600
and clumsy!

134
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,367
Especially since
the enemies we face...

135
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:23,633
are not to be taken lightly.

136
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,933
How can we bring down the whole
of Encantadia

137
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,967
if you are weak, Zaur?

138
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,633
Forgive me, Sovereign Queen.

139
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,267
Continue the training.

140
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:06,500
The Sang'gres are now training
their children

141
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:09,300
in preparation for
the dark vision

142
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,767
that your divine eyes have seen,
revered Goddess.

143
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:17,100
May the new generation
be found worthy, Imaw...

144
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,833
to stand as the protectors
of Encantadia.

145
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:25,967
The new generation is worthy,
Ancient Queen,

146
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:29,167
especially since they come
from a lineage

147
00:16:29,233 --> 00:16:31,467
that remained strong
and unyielding through

148
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,167
the fiercest storms Encantadia
has faced.

149
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,333
Agtu.

150
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,367
Block!

151
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:38,367
Strike.

152
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:48,400
Block, strike.

153
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:58,200
That is why I have great faith
in the young Sang'gres.

154
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:03,400
I am certain they will
grow strong and capable,

155
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,567
just like their mothers.

156
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,067
Father!

157
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,267
She will die young,

158
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,633
at the hands of a human.

159
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:36,433
Who do you speak of, Goddess?

160
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,300
It is Gaiea.

161
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:45,667
Gaiea will not become the
guardian of the Earth gem,

162
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:50,133
for she will die young.

163
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:54,967
But Goddess,
if Gaiea dies too soon,

164
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,667
then who will become
Danaya's heir?

165
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,800
Danaya's child,
who is yet to be born,

166
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:28,500
will be the true heir
and guardian of the Earth gem.

167
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:45,300
Is Danaya's fate in
the world of mortals?

168
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,100
Ave, Cassandra.

169
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,400
Yes, Cassandra,
it is indeed there,

170
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,267
and we cannot stand
in its way...

171
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,200
for the sake of Encantadia,

172
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:54,033
send Danaya there at once,

173
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,467
along with her husband
and child.

174
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,833
To let Gaiea die in the world
of mortals?

175
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,167
It must happen.

176
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,867
It must come to pass.

177
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,767
So that Danaya may meet the man

178
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,700
who will give her the child

179
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,367
a true guardian of the Earth
gem!

180
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:14,933
One who will help save
Encantadia one day!

181
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:25,167
You want my husband,
my child,

182
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,200
and me to live in the world
of mortals?

183
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,833
You heard correctly, Danaya.

184
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,367
My apologies, Noble Queen,

185
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:39,700
but it seems unfair to send
Danaya away,

186
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:42,433
especially now that Cassiopea
sees dangers

187
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,133
through her visions.

188
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
Now more than ever,

189
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:50,567
we must stay together to protect
Encantadia, Noble Queen.

190
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:53,267
The world of mortals is
not so distant from ours.

191
00:19:54,467 --> 00:19:57,500
It is easy to enter
and leave that realm,

192
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:02,600
so summoning Danaya back in case
of danger will not be difficult.

193
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,867
Why do you want us to go there,
Noble Queen?

194
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:09,333
Have Aquil and I done
something wrong, Noble Queen?

195
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,133
The world of mortals is chaotic
and filled with grief.

196
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,933
They, too, need help
and so you will go there

197
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,033
to ease their lives.

198
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
You will also bring your gem.

199
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:29,967
But Cassandra,

200
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:32,333
I still don't see the purpose

201
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,733
of what you are commanding
Danaya to do!

202
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,167
Neither do I.

203
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,300
What if the danger
Cassiopea foresaw

204
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:41,600
comes sooner than expected?

205
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:44,867
That is precisely why they
must now go

206
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:49,500
to the world of mortals
to prepare Danaya's heir...

207
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,733
and the future savior
of Encantadia.

208
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,267
Prepare my heir?

209
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,333
Haven't I already prepared
Gaiea?

210
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,600
Obey my command!

211
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:12,400
None of you has the right
to argue with me!

212
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:20,533
As you wish, Noble Queen.

213
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,767
That very same day,
Danaya, Aquil,

214
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,767
and their child traveled
to the Tree of Asnamon

215
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,433
to enter the world of mortals.

216
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:51,400
Farewell, Danaya.

217
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,967
Until we meet again.

218
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,900
Asnamon arber!

219
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,433
Please accept our humble
offering, Sovereign Queen,

220
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,133
as a token of our gratitude
for your kindness to us.

221
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:34,800
If you allow it, we would like
to ask a question.

222
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,767
What is it, Zaur?

223
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,767
We are all wondering...

224
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:41,633
where you came from,

225
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,933
and why you possess
extraordinary strength

226
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
and skill in combat?

227
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:47,600
If you would permit, may I...

228
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:51,133
I will not answer
your questions!

229
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:53,867
Who I am...

230
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,867
and where I come from

231
00:22:56,933 --> 00:23:00,833
are things you need not know.

232
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:04,333
You may leave now.

233
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,800
As you wish, Sovereign Queen.

234
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:10,167
Forgive me for my questions.

235
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,567
Sovereign Queen!

236
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:39,133
Anaca.

237
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,767
May you bring good news

238
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,267
from your watch over Encantadia?

239
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,767
One of the enchanted being
sisters...

240
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,000
one of the Sang'gre,
has departed from Encantadia.

241
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:51,600
She has gone
to the world of mortals.

242
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:54,667
It seems she will live there for
a long time, Sovereign Queen.

243
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:55,933
Good.

244
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:58,533
Then, one less powerful
 enchanted being

245
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,333
stands in our way.

246
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,833
It seems fate is favoring me.

247
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,833
It will now be easier for me
to defeat Encantadia.

248
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,667
Danaya and her family
have departed

249
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:35,300
for the world of mortals.

250
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:39,433
They are unaware of
the grim fate

251
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,100
that awaits Gaiea.

252
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:44,100
We can't do anything, Imaw.

253
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,100
That is what is destined.

254
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:49,800
It pains me to think

255
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:53,433
that once the grim fate
of Gaiea unfolds,

256
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,800
it will surely shatter
Danaya's heart.

257
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,100
A great war.

258
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:43,000
Why, Cassiopea?

259
00:25:43,067 --> 00:25:46,633
Do your eyes
see something again?

260
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:54,800
The land shall once again
be stained with blood!

261
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,133
Many encantados will die!

262
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,300
No one can defeat this being.

263
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,967
The one I see leading them!

264
00:26:11,867 --> 00:26:15,900
But a female enchanted being
I do not recognize shall arrive,

265
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,233
bearing a weapon like Danaya's.

266
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,733
This being

267
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,433
will be the new guardian
and hope of Encantadia.

268
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,233
Oh, magical Book of Life,

269
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,233
show me a vision of the woman

270
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,767
Cassiopea spoke of!

271
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,933
A greeting to you, being.

272
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,267
I am my mother's second-born...

273
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,933
Cassiopea's twin!

274
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,100
She is a spirit !

275
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,600
I must do this,

276
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,967
for the good of all, my child.

277
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,100
Until now, this cannot be erased

278
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,467
from my mind.

279
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:09,933
I will end the power

280
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,167
of all the children
and descendants

281
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:15,033
of Memen and Ornia.

282
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,900
I will destroy all
of Encantadia!
