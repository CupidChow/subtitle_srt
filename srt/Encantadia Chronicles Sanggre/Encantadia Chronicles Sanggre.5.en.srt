1
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,700
She will die young.

2
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:19,733
Danaya's child,
who is yet to be born...

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,767
For the sake of Encantadia,
send Danaya there at once,

4
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,833
along with her husband
and child.

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,800
Greetings.

6
00:00:26,867 --> 00:00:29,433
May I know who you are?

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,067
I was born in ancient times.

8
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,367
I am Cassiopea's twin!

9
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:39,900
Inside that cave is
a powerful being.

10
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,600
It holds a powerful weapon.

11
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:45,433
You are the power
I have longed for.

12
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,867
You are the curse I will bring
to Encantadia.

13
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,633
Why do you want us to go there?

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,633
Have Aquil and I done something
wrong, Noble Queen?

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,800
The world of mortals is chaotic
and filled with grief.

16
00:00:55,867 --> 00:00:58,967
They, too, need help and so you
will go there.

17
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,600
Who is the woman I saw
in my vision?

18
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,833
And why does she mean me harm?

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,967
One of the Sang'gre has

20
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,733
has departed from Encantadia.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,967
Did you ask the flowers for
permission before picking them

22
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,100
and making them into a necklace?

23
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,200
Would it even answer if I spoke
to it?

24
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,533
Are you buying?

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,633
Accept this.

26
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,533
I said give it!

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,467
That's not yours!

28
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,933
Maybe you have more of that.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,800
- Yeah, come on.
- Give us everything.

30
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:26,733
Hand it over.

31
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:31,967
Thank you so much, dear.

32
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,533
You're not only rich...

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,667
you also fight really well.

34
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,333
Chapter 5

35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,967
"The Life of the Enchanted
being,

36
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,233
Danaya in the World of Humans"

37
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,900
My world has been changed...

38
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,333
and transformed.

39
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:57,233
In the world of humans...

40
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,667
where time moves so swiftly.

41
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,867
And like time,

42
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,300
the lives of the beings
who live here...

43
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,167
also move so quickly.

44
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,600
The humans...

45
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,800
Their forms are beautiful.

46
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:25,067
Many of them also possess pure
hearts.

47
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,500
But they are weak.

48
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,767
They have no powers or advanced
knowledge and ability.

49
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:48,133
To allow them to see
the true beauty

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,700
and wonder of their world.

51
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:54,833
A world that is also home
to many other magical beings...

52
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,700
that they cannot see.

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,933
Are you okay?

54
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:32,967
Humans lack the senses and sight
to perceive other beings.

55
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,100
Because they are too busy
with themselves

56
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:39,800
and their worries in life.

57
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:42,533
That's why they fail to see
and feel

58
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,167
the full blessing of nature
and of the highest God.

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,167
Instead...

60
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,133
what they see...

61
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,800
is the value of material things.

62
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,800
So, are we good?
Yes, Ma'am.

63
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:21,600
- Just charge it to my account.
- Money...

64
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:22,667
- Okay, Ma'am.
 - or wealth.

65
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,867
Which,
like the gems of Encantadia,

66
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:32,000
is considered the most precious
in their world.

67
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,633
That's why money is also their
weakness.

68
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:38,267
And the cause of evil for some.

69
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,500
Well, I already messaged him.

70
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,033
But it looks like he's not here
yet.

71
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,100
Get in!

72
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,733
Hurry up, quick!

73
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
Let's go!

74
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,533
Get out now!

75
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,900
Out now!

76
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:29,333
Get inside!

77
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,500
- Get inside! In!
- Go on, get in!

78
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, my gosh!

79
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:19,967
That was amazing!

80
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,533
How did you dodge the bullets?

81
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,733
What kind of person are you?

82
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:26,567
Listen.

83
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,533
To my simple enchantment.

84
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,700
To all who are present here...

85
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,233
whatever you may have seen...

86
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,100
whatever you may have
witnessed...

87
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,067
all of it will be erased
from your eyes...

88
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,500
minds...

89
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,933
and awareness...

90
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,500
and even from your tools
and devices.

91
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,833
Hear the mighty spirit
of enchantment.

92
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,600
What just happened?

93
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:16,400
Why are we here?

94
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,533
Wait.

95
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,800
I don't remember anything,
but...

96
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:22,033
We need to get out of here!
Come on!

97
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,800
My God, let's go! Help!

98
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,600
Help! Help! Help!

99
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,200
Thank you.
This is for you.

100
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,900
Thank you, you're heaven-sent.

101
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,433
- For your expenses.
- Thank you.

102
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,367
Spouse of Royal blood Danaya
Former General of Lireo.
Thank you.

103
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:49,700
- Thank you.
- They are so kind.

104
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,733
Sir, here, you need this.

105
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:55,933
Mother.

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,667
Avisala, my child.

107
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,100
Here.

108
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,100
For you.

109
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,033
Why are you only here now?

110
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:07,567
Forgive me, my husband.

111
00:10:07,633 --> 00:10:09,667
I just got carried away
with my stroll.

112
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,767
We've given everything away.

113
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:15,300
Shall we go home?

114
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,667
Have you eaten yet?

115
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:19,767
- Not yet.
- Not yet.

116
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,733
Come, let's go eat.

117
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,833
There's nothing left.

118
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,567
Come on.

119
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,833
Miss, Miss,

120
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,933
do you still have what you were
giving away earlier?

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's all gone.

122
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,533
Wait a moment, Aquil.

123
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,300
Miss, is this real?

124
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:57,433
Thank you.

125
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,967
Aquil and I had no idea...

126
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,167
that our help for the less
fortunate

127
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:08,900
would also awaken evil
in others.

128
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:26,400
Gaiea?

129
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,967
Gaiea, child?

130
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,533
It's time for our training.

131
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:53,767
Gaiea? Gaiea?

132
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,167
Get ready!

133
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,367
Father.

134
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:01,600
Do we really have to train?

135
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:03,867
You know it.

136
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,900
That's your mother's command.

137
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:20,600
Fight!

138
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:25,933
Get ready!

139
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:29,467
You lost, Father.

140
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:36,267
Who taught you that?

141
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:37,533
Who else?

142
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,833
Mother, of course.

143
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:47,167
Didn't I tell you?

144
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,333
Father!

145
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,700
Show me...

146
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,600
where the gold is hidden.

147
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,600
Thank you, Emre.

148
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:15,100
What are you doing with that
gold, Enchanted being?

149
00:14:17,267 --> 00:14:18,800
I will exchange it for money.

150
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,100
I will use it to help
the less fortunate.

151
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,833
They are ungrateful.

152
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,867
Most of them are greedy.

153
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:31,533
They don't deserve help.

154
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,833
If you don't want to help,
then just leave me be.

155
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,300
This is utter foolishness.

156
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:42,733
And if you try to stop me,

157
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,667
I cannot promise I won't fight
back.

158
00:15:15,567 --> 00:15:17,200
Who are the people in the house?

159
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:18,300
Just the father and child, Boss.

160
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,967
If anyone interferes,
you know what to do.

161
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:29,400
Don't meet it head-on.

162
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:30,733
Block.

163
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,033
Block.

164
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,600
Good afternoon, Sir.

165
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,633
Are you expecting any visitors?

166
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:40,867
Your mother didn't mention
anything.

167
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:44,800
Just a moment.

168
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:50,300
What do you want?

169
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,167
Gold.

170
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,367
Father.

171
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,767
We're here for the gold.

172
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,233
Where's the gold?

173
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,233
Don't make this harder on
yourself!

174
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,033
Friend...

175
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,967
you don't need to threaten me.

176
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,867
I will give what is due to you.

177
00:16:11,933 --> 00:16:13,967
All right, I like that.

178
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:16,333
Let's go!

179
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,300
Father!

180
00:16:27,033 --> 00:16:28,100
Be on the lookout.

181
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:49,100
My child!
Disappear!

182
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,100
Did you see that?

183
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:59,333
They've got magic or maybe
something demonic.

184
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,233
Let's go.

185
00:17:01,867 --> 00:17:03,233
No one leaves!

186
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,533
I don't care even if they're
demonic.

187
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,033
We're here for the gold.

188
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,800
Search the entire house.

189
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,467
Find the gold.

190
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,267
Move!

191
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:31,600
Father, who are they?

192
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,033
Bad people.

193
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,233
Gaeia.

194
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:46,667
Protect yourself.

195
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,633
I'll take care of them.

196
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,033
Get him!

197
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,900
Father...

198
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,100
You're testing my patience.

199
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:11,367
No one has to die if you just
tell us where the gold is.

200
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,233
Where's the gold?

201
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:18,867
Inside the room.

202
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:20,900
Under the floor.

203
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,033
Get it.

204
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,067
Pull him up.

205
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,867
Father!

206
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,767
Father!

207
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,267
- Come here! Go ahead!
- Father!

208
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:34,533
That's enough!

209
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,167
Let me go.

210
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:39,133
Father!

211
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:46,167
You already got the gold.

212
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,900
Just leave us alone!

213
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,267
- Father...
- That's right.

214
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,067
We've already taken the gold.

215
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,667
Father!

216
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,033
I'm sorry, child.

217
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,267
No witnesses must remain.

218
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,133
My child!

219
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:01,167
Let's go!

220
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:04,033
Father...

221
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:51,700
Let us through.
Let us through!

222
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,833
Ma'am, this is
as far as you can go.

223
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,767
She's the family of the victims.

224
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:56,800
Yes, yes.

225
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:58,767
Victims?

226
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,233
Come, please follow me.

227
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,667
Let's go with Danaya.

228
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,433
Be strong, Danaya.

229
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Ma'am, you're not allowed...

230
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:44,033
- Let go of me!
- Let her be!

231
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,467
She's the wife.

232
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:18,567
Stay away from them!

233
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,733
Stay away from them!

234
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:27,400
Stay back!
Back...

235
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:30,667
Stay away!

236
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,633
Stay away!

237
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:39,000
Stay away, stay away!

238
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,800
Ma'am, you're not allowed
to touch...

239
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:13,133
My child...

240
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:20,333
Why didn't you wait for me?

241
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,667
Didn't we have a promise?

242
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,233
We were going to go out,
weren't we?

243
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,300
My child...

244
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,267
By the power I possess...

245
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,267
I command you to wake up!

246
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,567
I command you to wake up!

247
00:27:17,633 --> 00:27:19,367
Gaeia!

248
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,467
Aquil...

249
00:27:30,467 --> 00:27:32,467
A tragedy!

250
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:44,967
No!

251
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,100
What was that?

252
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:35,333
Aquil...

253
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:37,900
Aquil...

254
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:05,800
Farewell, my love.

255
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:17,000
Until we meet again in Devas.

256
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,867
Aquil...

257
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,833
I love you.

258
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:35,000
I love you.

259
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,400
I really love you.

260
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,867
Ma'am, our deepest condolences.

261
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,633
Please be strong.

262
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,667
I just have something
I want to ask you.

263
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,733
Who killed my husband and child?

264
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,333
That's what we also
want to find out, Ma'am.

265
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,933
Ma'am, is there anyone who might
have held a grudge against you

266
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,800
or your husband
to commit this crime?

267
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,133
We've been good to people.

268
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:41,033
All we ever did was help.

269
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,833
But this is how they repay us.

270
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:56,700
Ma'am, not all people are bad.

271
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:57,833
There are still good ones.

272
00:30:58,433 --> 00:30:59,200
Don't worry,

273
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:00,467
you can count on us...

274
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,667
we'll do everything we can to
catch the criminal

275
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:03,767
and bring them to justice.

276
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,133
You know,
that family was so kind.

277
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,233
I still can't understand

278
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,167
why something like this
would happen to them.

279
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,733
My power...

280
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,333
I summon and gather you now.

281
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:03,733
Hear the plea of a Sang'gre who
once ruled over you!

282
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,200
Listen to the mourning cry.

283
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,533
And a plea for justice

284
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,233
from an enchanted being
who lost her husband and child!

285
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:29,167
I know you are
the only true witnesses.

286
00:32:32,567 --> 00:32:34,933
So show me...

287
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,733
the faces of those
who murdered Aquil and Gaiea!

288
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:54,967
Reveal to me...

289
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,367
the vile and merciless way
they took their lives!

290
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:20,200
I command you, nature...

291
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,133
reveal the location

292
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:25,933
of these heartless beings!

293
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:01,733
Prepare yourselves.

294
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,033
You will taste...

295
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:11,233
the vengeance of a Sang'gre!

296
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:37,533
Goddess, until now,
Imaw still hasn't awakened.

297
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,500
Do not worry about him for now,
for I have a new vision.

298
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:43,100
I sense her arrival.

299
00:34:44,567 --> 00:34:46,367
You really won't give in to me,
Flamarra?

300
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:49,467
Adamus, I will not fail
our mothers.

301
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:51,233
The people of Mine-a-ve

302
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,867
will stand with you too,
Sovereign Queen...

303
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,900
especially since they owe you
a great debt.

304
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,767
But how can they stand against
the encantados,

305
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,767
who are clearly more powerful?

306
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:03,100
I offer you all the strength...

307
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,033
resilience and power...

308
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,633
of a true warrior.

309
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,633
Sir Emil and the Pistol Gang
are the worst.

310
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,467
If only I had superpowers,

311
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:19,067
I'd be the one
to drive them out.

312
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,633
I really wish...

313
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,600
I was a superhero instead.
