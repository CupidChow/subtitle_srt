1
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:13,500
Goddess Cassiopea is right.

2
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,867
She has never had a vision
that didn't come true.

3
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,433
That's why we must prepare.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,933
Perhaps this is also the right
time to train our children.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,133
But the gem of air
that you hold...

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,433
who have you chosen
to inherit it?

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,400
Deia.

8
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:29,067
I'm imitating Queen Mitena,
Mother.

9
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:30,933
Our Queen Mitena is one
of a kind.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,600
Perhaps no one will ever surpass
her.

11
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:33,733
You're wrong, Mother.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,433
Someday, I'll be just like our
Queen Mitena.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,700
She will die young.

14
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:45,867
Danaya's child,
who is yet to be born...

15
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,500
For the sake of Encantadia,
send Danaya there at once,

16
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,533
along with her husband
and child.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,500
Your weapons will be used,
not only to defend yourselves,

18
00:00:56,567 --> 00:01:01,767
but to become fierce warriors
of Mine-a-ve!

19
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,800
Why do you want us to go there?

20
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,767
Have Aquil and I done something
wrong, Noble Queen?

21
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:10,333
The world of mortals is chaotic
and filled with grief.

22
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,567
They, too, need help

23
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:17,433
and so you will go there
to ease their lives.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,600
You will also bring your gem.

25
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:22,867
One of the Sang'gres

26
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,100
has departed from Encantadia.

27
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,167
It will now be easier for me
to defeat Encantadia.

28
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:32,400
It pains me to think that once
the grim fate of Gaiea unfolds,

29
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:37,367
it will surely shatter Danaya's
heart.

30
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:39,600
A great war.

31
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,933
The land shall once again
be stained with blood!

32
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:45,733
But an female enchanted being I
do not recognize shall arrive.

33
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,167
This being will be the new
guardian and hope of Encantadia.

34
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:11,233
Chapter 3
"The Cursed One"

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,900
Chamber of Wisdom,
Adamya Book of Life.

36
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,667
Akashic where are you?

37
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:41,533
Show yourself!

38
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,367
Reveal yourself to me, Akashic!

39
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,700
Come to me at once!

40
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,833
Do not worry!

41
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
I know what I'm doing,

42
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:27,967
that the Akashic must not be
opened and read lightly.

43
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:33,100
Because it has been forbidden
by our ancestors.

44
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:39,033
It can weaken and cause grave
illness.

45
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,733
But, I have questions that
I must find answers to,

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,400
and this is the only thing
that can help me,

47
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:51,700
so allow me and leave me now,

48
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,567
so you won't be dragged
into this.

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,700
Mystical book of life,

50
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:17,100
which contains all records
of things, events, beings,

51
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,433
those born and those long
dead...

52
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,467
you who are the wellspring
of all happenings of the past,

53
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,167
the present, and the future.

54
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:31,800
Open your pages this very
moment,

55
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:35,167
and reveal to me what you know
about the girl

56
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:37,167
that Cassiopea spoke of.

57
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,700
Greetings.

58
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,567
Greeting, little one.

59
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,300
May I know who you are?

60
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,167
Why do you ask?

61
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,467
Who are you, too?

62
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,300
And where am I?

63
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:21,133
I am Imaw.

64
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,867
You are in my home, in Adamya.

65
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:32,000
May you sit, and tell me who you
are and where you came from?

66
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:34,500
I promise,

67
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:40,967
I'll give you delicious bread,
once I hear your story.

68
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,233
Bread?

69
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,900
I want bread!
Please give me bread!

70
00:06:46,967 --> 00:06:48,633
Yes.

71
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,500
I'll give you some later,
little one.

72
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,533
But first, tell me your story.

73
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,533
I'm listening.

74
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,633
I was born in ancient times.

75
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
From the bloodline
of the ancient kings.

76
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,433
I shall call you
"Cassiopea."

77
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,200
Cassiopea,

78
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,200
such a beautiful name,

79
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,700
for such a beautiful child.

80
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:31,200
Your child, King Memen,
also bears sharp ears.

81
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:37,367
That is a sign she will
have a wonderful destiny,

82
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:42,500
and perhaps even attain immense
power.

83
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,533
Everything you say will come
true, Sil.

84
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,233
Because this baby...

85
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,867
this child of mine will be
my heir.

86
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,133
Someday, she will be a queen...

87
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,700
who will be known by all.

88
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,700
Ornia.

89
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,367
Ornia, what is happening to you?

90
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,400
Sil, what's happening
to my wife?

91
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,467
Ornia.

92
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:26,767
It seems...

93
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:31,133
it seems there's another baby
about to be born from her womb!

94
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:35,767
Unbelievable!

95
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,667
Come.

96
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:38,467
Lie down, lie down.

97
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
Push, now!

98
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,667
Push again!

99
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,333
- Harder!
- Ornia.

100
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,200
Keep pushing!

101
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:02,800
One more big push!

102
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:12,233
I was the second child
my mother bore.

103
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,067
I was Cassiopea's twin!

104
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,033
Surprising!

105
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,900
I never imagined Cassiopea

106
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:25,067
had another sibling besides
Minea!

107
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,367
Why am I only learning this now?

108
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,767
Listen well,

109
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:35,500
so you may find the answers
to the questions you seek!

110
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:50,033
She is an soul!

111
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,600
A child who should never
have been born!

112
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,167
Sil!

113
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,933
Sil! Come back here, Sil!

114
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:07,267
Merciful Gods!

115
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:11,667
What sin did my wife
and I commit,

116
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:13,533
to deserve such punishment
from you?

117
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:22,733
I was born and branded a curse!

118
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,800
An ill-fated soul...

119
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,933
whom they all feared!

120
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,933
That is why, that very night...

121
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,200
my own parents decided my fate!

122
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,633
I had no idea

123
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,733
that on that very night,
my own parents

124
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,767
had already decided my fate.

125
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:06,400
The honorable Sil is right,
Your Majesty.

126
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:09,233
She has reason to be afraid,

127
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,433
because your child...

128
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,600
the ivtre is a curse that will
bring misfortune.

129
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,633
Not just to you and Ornia...

130
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:22,300
but even to my sanctuary.

131
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:25,467
Especially since
she was born here.

132
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,800
An ivtre like her...

133
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:34,133
should not be allowed
to live among us.

134
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,000
And what do you suggest
we do with her?

135
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,033
She must be taken far away.

136
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,033
Gone from here!

137
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,367
Banished!

138
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:45,433
But she's my child.

139
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,067
Even if she is an ivtre,

140
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:50,067
I'm still the one
who gave birth to her!

141
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:55,933
I know how painful it is to be
separated from your infant.

142
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,300
But she will only consume

143
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:01,433
the energy of her twin!

144
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,133
Until Cassiopea
slowly grows ill...

145
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
and dies!

146
00:12:09,367 --> 00:12:13,433
They cannot grow up together!

147
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,100
But that is merely...

148
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,267
an old tale from your ancestors,

149
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,300
with no truth to it!

150
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,300
My beloved Ornia...

151
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,633
those ancient beliefs...

152
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,633
they're what have guided us all.

153
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:41,033
Even so, I will not allow
any of my children

154
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,567
to be taken away from me!

155
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:34,933
I still remember
the warmth of her embrace...

156
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,467
when our mother held me.

157
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,367
I thought...

158
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:44,400
she had truly accepted me.

159
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:51,533
Ornia.

160
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,533
Memen.

161
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,400
Cassiopea, our firstborn,
has a fever.

162
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,767
Sil, quickly.
Heal my daughter!

163
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,767
The cure is right
in front of you, Your Majesty.

164
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:13,933
If the source of your
firstborn's weakness disappears,

165
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:20,267
you will be able
to save Cassiopea.

166
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:21,900
I wanted to plead

167
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:27,267
with my parents
not to believe Hakun!

168
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:33,267
But I didn't yet have the
ability to speak.

169
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:48,033
You know well, Your Majesty,

170
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,067
our belief about the ivtre.

171
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,033
And you know...

172
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,067
and you know...

173
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,400
that this child is a curse!

174
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,133
Will you let
your healthy daughter die?

175
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,267
Cassiopea will die!

176
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:19,600
Because you pity
that ivtre child of yours!

177
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,400
My father and I
immediately set out,

178
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:40,000
far from Encantadia!

179
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:44,033
To the land of the cursed...

180
00:16:44,433 --> 00:16:47,067
the Mine-a-ve.

181
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,067
Even then, I already knew what
my father was planning for me.

182
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,767
I wanted to scream,
I wanted to resist!

183
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,200
But I could do nothing but cry.

184
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,233
Your Majesty, it looks like the
ivtre is beginning to sense

185
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,367
that she's going to be abandoned
in this cursed land.

186
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:54,733
Be quiet!

187
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:58,033
Especially, no one must ever
know that she's here

188
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,233
or that she's going
to live here!

189
00:18:11,933 --> 00:18:13,400
Hush now, Ivtre.

190
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,233
Don't cry anymore.

191
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,233
I have to do this...

192
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,933
for everyone's good, my child.

193
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,267
You will live here now.

194
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:08,067
In the land of the cursed,
here in Minea-ve!

195
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,067
I imprison you!

196
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,567
So that the curse may be left
behind here as well.

197
00:19:20,933 --> 00:19:24,733
for as long as you live!

198
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:51,533
You will never be able to leave
this place, my child...

199
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,867
because never again...

200
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,700
will you be able to set foot...

201
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:03,200
on any land in all of
Encantadia...

202
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,900
because on this island...

203
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:12,233
you will live here
for as long as you live.

204
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:40,333
He left me in the cursed land!

205
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,000
My own father betrayed me!

206
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:50,367
Just to save my sibling!

207
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,200
I kept hoping they would change
their decision.

208
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,500
That one day...

209
00:20:57,567 --> 00:21:02,367
my father or my mother would
come back for me.

210
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:09,033
But none of them
ever returned for me.

211
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,700
I was completely abandoned

212
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:16,233
and forgotten by my own parents.

213
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:21,733
Oh, I'm sorry
for what happened to you.

214
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,200
I can't fully comprehend

215
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:28,700
how Memen and Ornia could do
this to their own child,

216
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:31,033
even if you are an Ivtre!

217
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,633
They believed

218
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,167
I truly was a curse !

219
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,133
Their lives were
the ones truly cursed,

220
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,700
for they were slain by a soldier

221
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,867
of Queen Avria of Etheria.

222
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,500
That's why, just like you,

223
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,700
your sibling Cassiopea
was also orphaned.

224
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,900
It's only right that they died!

225
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,867
They had no hearts!

226
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:28,200
No mercy!

227
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,533
Don't be angry.

228
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,533
Calm down, child.

229
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,467
I still want to hear

230
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:36,333
what happened next to you.

231
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,300
The island of Mine-a-ve
is merciless!

232
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,300
How did you survive there?

233
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,833
No!

234
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,633
I don't want to remember!

235
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,967
I don't want to recall
everything I went through!

236
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:55,667
But I must know
so I can understand

237
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,033
- what needs to be done for...
- For what?

238
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:03,167
So you can learn my secrets?

239
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,167
Or my weaknesses?

240
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:10,333
So I can understand
and know you fully.

241
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,667
No!

242
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,367
I won't say anything more
to you!

243
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:17,667
You may not return to Akashic

244
00:23:17,733 --> 00:23:20,000
until I allow it!

245
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:21,667
Speak.

246
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,033
Tell me what else
happened to you...

247
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,067
No!

248
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:33,700
I have nothing more to say!

249
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:37,467
My past is painful!

250
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:40,300
I don't want to speak of it
anymore!

251
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:45,467
That is why I now seal myself
within the book!

252
00:23:45,533 --> 00:23:51,333
So that for eternity,
no one can read or learn!

253
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,667
Merciful Emre.

254
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:10,667
Why has such a sorrowful secret
been hidden

255
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:14,033
from us all for so long?

256
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:39,333
Imaw?

257
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,400
Imaw?

258
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,300
Imaw!

259
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:46,467
Imaw.

260
00:24:54,967 --> 00:24:57,300
Banak, Nakba, what happened?

261
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,867
He's so cold.

262
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:17,500
What?

263
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:18,900
I can't understand you.

264
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,600
Banak, Nakba, that can wait.

265
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:26,300
We need to get out of here so
Imaw can breathe some fresh air.

266
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:28,100
Let's go.

267
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:15,633
Why do I still remember
the past?

268
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,833
Why does it still linger
on my mind until now?

269
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:58,833
What happened?
You've aged even more!

270
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,300
I don't know!
But please help me!

271
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,533
I want to leave this place
and return to Encantadia!

272
00:28:12,867 --> 00:28:14,833
Please, giant!

273
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,933
Bring me back to my sibling
and my parents!

274
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,800
Do you really think
I'll listen to you?

275
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,567
No!

276
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,567
You're mine!

277
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:36,133
I'll make you my toy!

278
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,967
Don't cry, Mitena.

279
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:21,500
Don't let your heart soften

280
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:23,933
because of the pain you've
experienced.

281
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,500
I will take revenge
on all of them!

282
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,300
I will end the power
of all the children

283
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:48,167
and descendants of Memen
and Ornia.

284
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:52,667
I will destroy
all of Encantadia!

285
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:25,400
Goddess, are you here to visit
the one who is ill?

286
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,567
I need to speak with him.

287
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:31,433
I need something important to
him.

288
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:49,800
Strange, but my gem
is of no help.

289
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,633
Still, we must try.

290
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:08,633
Fire gives warmth to the breath
of a living being.

291
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,933
Perhaps this can heal Imaw.

292
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,233
Your gemstone holds no power

293
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,467
over the illness that
has afflicted Imaw.

294
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,333
Can your eyes not see

295
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,067
the cause of his illness,
Goddess?

296
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:26,467
A powerful force
caused this illness...

297
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,933
one so strong
that even I am unable to see

298
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,367
where it came from.

299
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:59,767
You still can't approach
the shore, Sovereign Queen?

300
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:01,767
Even now that you have power?

301
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:07,133
He truly does not wish for me to
leave this cursed land.

302
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,067
But...

303
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:12,867
the source of my scepter

304
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:16,067
is more powerful than him...

305
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:20,067
which is why I know
it can set me free.

306
00:33:45,967 --> 00:33:47,600
You did it, Sovereign Queen!

307
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:51,267
Yes, Anaca!

308
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:55,400
Truly powerful is my esperanto,

309
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,100
for it shattered the chains...

310
00:33:58,167 --> 00:34:01,133
that bound me here for so long.

311
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,467
Just a little while longer,
Anaca.

312
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,400
Encantadia is within my reach!

313
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,367
Cassiopea.

314
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:26,700
You, whom Anaca's research says
became a queen,

315
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:29,867
and now even
the Goddess of Encantadia.

316
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:32,967
Sing for me, Mitena.

317
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:38,400
To ease my weariness.

318
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,900
- Oh, a life of sorrow
- Do you know...

319
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:43,900
- was given to me...
- the hardship...

320
00:34:43,967 --> 00:34:46,600
and perseverance...

321
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,567
that I experienced in the land

322
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:52,933
where our father
cast me away?

323
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,600
Do you know what happened to me?

324
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:01,067
Do not be afraid, Mitena.

325
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:03,967
Because I am not your enemy.

326
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:06,600
That's the book Imaw opened
even though it was forbidden.

327
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,867
That's why he lost consciousness
and fell ill.

328
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:10,867
Book, obey our command.

329
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:11,900
Open.

330
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,233
It's coming .

331
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,100
I can already smell
the breath of death.
