1
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:23,333
Encantadia,

2
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,300
is the land of four kingdoms

3
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,233
and territories,

4
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,433
a place overflowing
with mystery and power.

5
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,067
Here, you'll find
beings of wonder

6
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,933
creatures with strange powers,

7
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,233
magic...

8
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,867
and forms.

9
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:15,933
This is the home
of brave and valiant daughters

10
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,633
of the Queen Mother.

11
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,333
The sisters known as the
Sang'gre...

12
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,167
who, back then,
were still united

13
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:27,200
and at peace with one another.

14
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:30,300
They were the heirs and
protectors

15
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:33,600
of the four sacred gems

16
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,933
that gave life and protection

17
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,833
to the whole of Encantadia.

18
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,500
PASHNEA - An expression of
 frustration or anger.

19
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:50,267
It's all right, Danaya.

20
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,500
This was a time

21
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:08,900
before all the chaos
and wars came

22
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:11,233
upon Encantadia.

23
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,933
Lireo is truly beautiful.

24
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,967
One day, I will inherit
my crown...

25
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,400
from our Queen Mother.

26
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:58,533
And I will rule not just Lireo,

27
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:01,700
but the whole of Encantadia.

28
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,933
Stop it, Pirena!

29
00:05:04,233 --> 00:05:06,533
You are not even sure yet who
will truly win

30
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,967
in the competition our
Queen Mother is about to hold.

31
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,267
Why are you two even arguing
about who will become queen?

32
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,133
It's such a heavy
responsibility.

33
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
One that I...

34
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,233
will never carry on my
shoulders.

35
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,733
Enough, all of you.

36
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Look over there.

37
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,367
A ferocious dragon!

38
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,167
Looks like we're in for a fight.

39
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,933
Get ready!

40
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,533
Animal!

41
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,933
Our Queen Mother needs to know
about this.

42
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:28,600
Let's go.

43
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,067
But, Amihan...

44
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:32,100
Our Queen Mother
will only scold us

45
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,200
because we stole the gems

46
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:35,133
from the chamber.

47
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,833
The beast has already been
vanquished.

48
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,967
So no one else needs
to know about this.

49
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:41,133
Witches!

50
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:44,833
Let's go home
and return the gems.

51
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,133
Before anyone finds out.

52
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,800
Come now.

53
00:11:11,233 --> 00:11:16,300
Chapter I
“The Queen of the Cursed”

54
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,800
Back in the day, your mothers
were still headstrong

55
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:29,867
and stubborn, Adamus,
Flamarra, Gaiea.

56
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:34,367
But their courage
and love for Encantadia

57
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:36,000
were remarkable.

58
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,567
They risked their

59
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,800
lives for the freedom and peace

60
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,700
we enjoy today.

61
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,800
Just like Amihan once did.

62
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:51,167
She died fighting for our world.

63
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,233
Amihan...

64
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,700
She sacrificed herself
for all of us.

65
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,900
It's a pity that you never got
to meet

66
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:25,867
such a great and
nurturing queen like her.

67
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:27,133
Oh...

68
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,733
Forgive me, young sang'gre.

69
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,367
Let us return to your lesson.

70
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,800
Encantadia is divided

71
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,400
into four kingdoms

72
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,767
and territories...

73
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,100
First, Lireo in the East.

74
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,300
Home of the fairies.

75
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:19,167
Guardians of the Gem of Air.

76
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,067
Second, Sapiro in the North.

77
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:28,067
Now ruled by King Ybrahim .

78
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:31,033
His kingdom was
once the guardian

79
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,867
of the Gem of Earth.

80
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,600
And in the West,

81
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:38,100
there lies
the Kingdom of Hathoria.

82
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,833
Where we now live, Elder.

83
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,800
Correct, Flamarra.

84
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,167
And you, of Hator blood,

85
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:49,500
were once the first guardians
of the Gem of Fire.

86
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:53,133
And in the South lies my home...

87
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,300
Adamya.

88
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,833
Where my father also came from,
Elder.

89
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,333
Precisely, Adamus.

90
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,233
We were once the keepers

91
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,700
of the magical Gem of Water.

92
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,567
What happened, Elder?

93
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:10,900
Why are the Ada now the ones
guarding the gems?

94
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:14,300
Because of a greedy being,
Gaiea.

95
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,067
Hagorn.

96
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,733
He was once
the King of Hathoria,

97
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,567
whose burning desire

98
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:25,700
was to seize all the gems.

99
00:14:25,767 --> 00:14:29,300
So that he could claim the whole
of Encantadia for himself!

100
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,167
Because of Hagorn,

101
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:35,933
great conflict
and war once erupted

102
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,833
across the land of the people
from Encantadia.

103
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,833
A war that claimed many lives...

104
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,633
And ended with Hagorn's death.

105
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,233
The death of the traitorous king

106
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,400
also ended all the strife.

107
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:56,733
And returned peace
to all of Encantadia.

108
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,733
I ask for forgiveness

109
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,867
for all the sins committed

110
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,633
by my ancestral king.

111
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,100
Forgive us all.

112
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,467
Flamarra...

113
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,567
You have nothing
to apologize for.

114
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:14,100
You carry no sin.

115
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,300
All of that is in the past.

116
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:19,033
That's true.

117
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,867
It's all in the past.

118
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,967
But why are you still
teaching us this?

119
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:26,400
So that you will never forget

120
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,433
the history of our land, Adamus.

121
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,467
So that if ever new invaders
come to our land,

122
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,567
you too will learn how to fight

123
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,567
and you'll fight for Ecantadia.

124
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:59,100
Land of the curse.

125
00:17:00,267 --> 00:17:06,400
The Garden of Cassiopea.

126
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,633
CASSIOPEA - Goddess and “ Eye ”
of Encantadia

127
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,133
Who are you?

128
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,967
Who is being referred
to in my dream?

129
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,467
Who will kill me?

130
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,200
Arsus is here!

131
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,367
I'm sure he's hungry again.

132
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,667
Escape while you still can!

133
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,567
Child, just hold on to me.
Don't let go.

134
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,200
Hurry up!

135
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,833
Veshdita, follow now!

136
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,700
Why does he have
a strange sword?

137
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,733
Who are you?

138
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:01,700
Does my former Lord no longer
recognize me?

139
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,533
Mitena?

140
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,867
Yes.

141
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:11,767
Arsus.

142
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,933
What happened?

143
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,533
You've changed your appearance.

144
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,933
Prepare yourself.

145
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,933
For the day of my reckoning
upon you has come.

146
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,833
If only Amihan were still
alive...

147
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,833
things would've been more
peaceful and joyful

148
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,733
here in Encantadia.

149
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,300
True, Danaya.

150
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,467
But Amihan is already at peace
and happy in heaven.

151
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:14,667
Let us just be glad
for our sister.

152
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:20,067
Let's not burden ourselves
further.

153
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:22,867
Indeed, Alena.

154
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:27,667
We should go and fetch our
children from Adamya.

155
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:30,033
Their lesson with Imaw
must be done by now.

156
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,733
Someone is making their presence
felt.

157
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:47,200
The honorable Hara Durye
 HARA DURYE - Ancient Queen.

158
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,367
What do you need from us,
Goddess?

159
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,067
I dreamt of my death

160
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,633
at the hands of a being from
another land.

161
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,233
Your death?

162
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,267
But it's impossible for a Hara
Durye to die.

163
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:11,567
And there is no other land more
powerful than Encantadia.

164
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:14,067
Cassiopea, it's just a dream.

165
00:23:14,133 --> 00:23:16,733
Don't trouble yourself with it.

166
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,233
But my dreams always come true.

167
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:24,433
There is nothing my eyes see
that does not come to pass.

168
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:30,100
But who will kill you?

169
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,867
I need to know who it is.

170
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,833
I will find out!

171
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,700
Mitena...

172
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:58,767
you?

173
00:23:59,933 --> 00:24:02,400
You will kill me?

174
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:04,367
The king...

175
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:09,267
and lord of all Minea-ve?

176
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:16,267
Prepare yourself.

177
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:19,367
Because I will capture you.

178
00:24:19,433 --> 00:24:22,800
And eat you!

179
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,233
Right now!

180
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:05,067
I am no longer the Mitena you
enslaved for so long.

181
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,200
You wretch.

182
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:13,733
I will prolong your suffering!

183
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,733
Feel the wrath of vengeance
from the one you cursed.

184
00:25:55,367 --> 00:25:56,733
She has slain Arsus.

185
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,467
Who could she be?

186
00:26:21,033 --> 00:26:23,067
Take to heart and mind

187
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:26,567
everything you have learned
about Encantadia, children.

188
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,033
Yes, Elder Imaw.

189
00:26:31,433 --> 00:26:32,733
Your Majesties.

190
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,033
- Mother!
- Mother!
Flamarra.

191
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,667
You go home first.

192
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,000
Leave us for now.

193
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,200
Go ahead, Gaiea.

194
00:26:44,267 --> 00:26:45,767
Be careful, Adamus, okay?

195
00:26:46,933 --> 00:26:47,767
Go on.

196
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:49,667
Yes, Mother.

197
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,500
Come now, Adamus.

198
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,500
It seems you have something
important to tell me,

199
00:26:58,567 --> 00:26:59,633
Your Majesties.

200
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,900
We received troubling news,
Elder Imaw.

201
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:05,067
There is someone destined
to kill Cassiopea.

202
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:06,900
What?

203
00:27:06,967 --> 00:27:08,600
And who could that be?

204
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:09,767
Whoever it may be,

205
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,900
I will never forgive the one
responsible

206
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:14,367
if what Cassiopea says is true.

207
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,200
But for what reason?

208
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,367
Why would someone want
to kill the Goddess Cassiopea?

209
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:21,533
That is exactly what we
are trying to figure out,

210
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,267
Elder Imaw.

211
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:27,333
Who is this being that
the Great Eye saw?

212
00:27:30,267 --> 00:27:31,700
I am worried.

213
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:34,067
Because that being might have
ill intentions toward

214
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:35,500
the whole of Encantadia.

215
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,667
Who is it?

216
00:28:44,967 --> 00:28:47,533
Answer me.

217
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,700
Who was it that my eyes saw?

218
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:08,833
Why won't my powers answer me?

219
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,400
Who really is this being?

220
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:39,067
I cannot believe the day would
come when Arsus would be slain.

221
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:42,533
We owe that Dariken.
 DARIKEN - Female warrior.

222
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,900
But who is she?

223
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,667
And where did she come from?

224
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,933
Does anyone here recognize her?

225
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,300
Not a single one of you
recognizes her?

226
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,167
Could it be that she came
from...

227
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,900
a race of flesh-eating beings?

228
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:00,233
Like the giant?

229
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,733
That being has a different form.

230
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,400
I'm certain she is not one
of them.

231
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:05,533
That's right.

232
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,467
I agree with that.

233
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:09,000
I don't know her either.

234
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:11,833
Ever since I was born in
this land,

235
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,400
no one has ever bested
the giant.

236
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:19,267
And so we lived in fear,
in worry...

237
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,467
that maybe tomorrow,

238
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,700
it would be our turn to be
caught and eaten by Arsus.

239
00:30:23,767 --> 00:30:25,533
Who would have thought...

240
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,567
someone could slay him?

241
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:32,933
That Dariken is not from here
in Minea-ve.

242
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,333
But where did she come from?

243
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:36,533
How did she end up here?

244
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:48,400
Leader.

245
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,767
The Dariken has arrived.

246
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,567
Beings of the cursed land...

247
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,867
from this day on,
I shall be...

248
00:31:07,933 --> 00:31:11,067
the one you will call Kera!
 Kera - Queen.

249
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:39,333
I will make you stronger.

250
00:31:40,633 --> 00:31:45,233
I will train you and turn
you into great warriors!

251
00:31:45,333 --> 00:31:46,767
And one day...

252
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,767
I will bring you to the land
of the Encantados!

253
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:55,667
So they may taste the wrath
of my vengeance!

254
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,800
From the hands of
the powerful fairies...

255
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,267
I will seize the land
I loathe the most...

256
00:32:05,333 --> 00:32:07,167
Encantadia!

257
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:19,033
The Sang'gres are currently
training their children

258
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:23,200
in preparation for the dark
vision that your eyes have seen.

259
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,867
You must not be weak!

260
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:37,033
Especially since the enemy
we face

261
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,333
is no force to be taken lightly.

262
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,133
There has never been a vision
of hers that did not come true.

263
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,033
So if there is danger
looming over her life,

264
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,800
that danger may very well
threaten all of Encantadia.

265
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,333
Danaya's child,
who is yet to be born,

266
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,200
will be the true heir and
guardian of the Earth gem.
