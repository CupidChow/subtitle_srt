1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,900
Oh, mystical book of life...

2
00:00:14,967 --> 00:00:18,567
open your pages this very
moment,

3
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:21,400
and reveal to me
what you know about the girl

4
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,367
that Cassiopea spoke of.

5
00:00:25,367 --> 00:00:27,633
Greetings.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,700
May I know who you are?

7
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:33,567
I was born in ancient times.

8
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,833
I was Cassiopea's twin!

9
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,733
She is a spirit!

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,100
A child who should
never have been born!

11
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:45,733
Even if she is a spirit,

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,433
I'm still the one
who gave birth to her!

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,367
But she will only

14
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,700
consume the energy of her twin!

15
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,567
Until Cassiopea
slowly grows ill...

16
00:00:54,633 --> 00:00:56,367
and dies!

17
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,400
In the land of the cursed,

18
00:00:58,467 --> 00:00:59,833
here in Mine-a-ve!

19
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,267
I imprison you!

20
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:06,867
So that the curse may be left
behind here as well.

21
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,100
Tell me what else
happened to you...

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,500
I have nothing more to say!

23
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:24,500
I will take revenge
on all of them!

24
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:26,733
I will end the power

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,567
of all the children

26
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:31,833
and descendants
of Memen and Ornia.

27
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,500
I will destroy all of
Encantadia!

28
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:40,567
Just a little while longer...

29
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,267
Encantadia is within my reach!

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,300
Chapter 4:"The Enslavement of
Mitena in Mine-a-ve"

31
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:15,900
Spring of Truth

32
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,667
Spring of truth...

33
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:26,000
You are now my only hope.

34
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:29,533
I plead for you to show me...

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,200
the answers to the questions
troubling my mind.

36
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,467
Greetings, Ancient Queen.

37
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:47,033
What is it you seek from me?

38
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:52,067
Who is the woman
I saw in my vision?

39
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,900
And why does she mean me harm?

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Forgive me.

41
00:03:56,667 --> 00:04:00,000
The answer lies in Adamya,
Ancient Queen.

42
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,967
It is now in Imaw's hands.

43
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,233
Cassiopea...

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,667
you, who were born...

45
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,633
with a more blessed destiny than
I was.

46
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,633
You, who, according to Anaca's
research,

47
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,733
became a queen.

48
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:00,400
And now even
a Goddess of Encantadia.

49
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,167
Do you know...

50
00:05:07,133 --> 00:05:08,567
what suffering...

51
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:11,567
and endurance...

52
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,267
I experienced in the land

53
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,467
where our father cast me away?

54
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,267
Do you know what happened to me,
Cassiopea?

55
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,833
Don't be afraid.

56
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,067
I'm not going to...

57
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:47,167
eat you.

58
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,900
Why did you lock me in here?

59
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,833
Please let me out.

60
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,567
I want to leave
and return to my family.

61
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:23,133
You have nowhere else to go...

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
except here,

63
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,967
my home...

64
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:29,700
and your...

65
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,833
prison!

66
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:41,167
Cry all you want,

67
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:45,067
but you'll never
get out of here.

68
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,467
You'll stay...

69
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:58,933
here in my home forever.

70
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:22,267
Lord!

71
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,133
I'm so, so hungry!

72
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,233
Where are you?

73
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,900
Lord!

74
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,200
I have to get out of here.

75
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,933
I have to escape the giant.

76
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,933
Giant!

77
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,033
Where are you?

78
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm really starving!

79
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,800
I haven't eaten for days!

80
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,633
Where are you?

81
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,633
Giant!

82
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:32,500
My father...

83
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,500
my mother...

84
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:40,700
Why did you do this to me?

85
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Why did you curse me
and abandon me?

86
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,533
You...

87
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,433
who grew up imprisoned.

88
00:09:24,233 --> 00:09:26,733
Held captive by a cruel giant.

89
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,467
Can you ever forget it all...

90
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,900
Mitena?

91
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,633
How sorrowful the life
that was given to me...

92
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,600
Abandoned, forsaken, left
in the cold world of Mine-a-ve.

93
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:57,900
Very good, Mitena.

94
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
Excellent.

95
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,000
Sing again.

96
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,033
Forgive me...

97
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,333
Lord.

98
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,467
But I'm very tired.

99
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:13,400
You must obey my wishes.

100
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:17,600
Unless you want me
to lock you up

101
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:21,867
inside my stomach instead.

102
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:23,433
Do you understand?

103
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:26,967
Sing again!

104
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,600
Oh, how bitter the fate...

105
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,033
Of one of the King's
daughters...

106
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,033
Never once...

107
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,900
Was she loved...

108
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,700
Cursed and thrown away...

109
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,067
Forgotten...

110
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,333
I don't want a sad song!

111
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,100
I want a cheerful song!

112
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,600
Sing a happy song

113
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,100
about a heroic giant!

114
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:22,600
Who saved someone like you,
Mitena.

115
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,133
A happy song.

116
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:32,500
Sing it right now!

117
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:41,033
Arsus the hero...

118
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,300
La, la, la, la, la, la...

119
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,667
But he stinks and he's very ugly

120
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,967
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

121
00:11:57,733 --> 00:12:00,433
Forgive me, Lord!

122
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:06,100
I won't do it again!

123
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:09,433
I'll obey everything you
command!

124
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:15,233
I'll never anger you again!

125
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,733
I promise!

126
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:33,567
Go on, Mitena.

127
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:38,600
Sing again!

128
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:48,667
How sorrowful
the life that was given to me...

129
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,633
Abandoned, forsaken, left in the
cold world of Mine-a-ve.

130
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,600
Deia!

131
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:25,900
What are you doing there?

132
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,567
Why did you follow us here?

133
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,300
Why won't you let the child come
with us?

134
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,400
So that she, too,
can learn how to fight.

135
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,833
Since that's what she really
wants.

136
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:38,767
I already told you, Zaur.

137
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,933
I don't want my daughter's
hands stained with blood.

138
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,633
You won't be able to protect
your child's life forever.

139
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,400
When she grows up...

140
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,267
she will also need
to defend herself.

141
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,700
What if you're no longer around?

142
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,767
Or us?

143
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:01,067
I will spend my whole life

144
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,500
trying to stay alive
for my child.

145
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,167
Leader Zaur.

146
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:17,467
When do you think our Queen
will arrive?

147
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,100
Where is our Queen?

148
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,467
Greetings, our beloved Queen.

149
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,467
It's good that I saw you.

150
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,133
Your Majesty.

151
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,833
May I ask you to also teach me
how to fight?

152
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:52,567
Leave this place and do not
bother me.

153
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,033
But, Your Majesty,
I greatly admire you.

154
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,067
That's why I truly want
to follow in your footsteps.

155
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,267
You want to follow
in my footsteps?

156
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,500
You don't know what you're
saying.

157
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:13,300
You don't know what I've been
through.

158
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:18,033
So leave me alone and go now!

159
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,733
Wake up, Mitena!

160
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,633
Your lord has returned!

161
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,267
My Lord.

162
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,800
It's good that you've come back.

163
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:01,933
Sing for me, Mitena.

164
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,467
To ease my weariness.

165
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,200
Sing now.

166
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:20,467
How sorrowful the life
that was given to me...

167
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:30,500
Abandoned, forsaken, left in the
cold world of Mine-a-ve.

168
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,500
Why did you stop?

169
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:47,233
Continue your song
or I'll throw you into the fire.

170
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:51,233
Do you understand, Mitena?

171
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,267
Sing!

172
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:56,067
Sing again!

173
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:03,100
How sorrowful the life
that was given to me...

174
00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:14,933
Abandoned, forsaken, left
in the cold world of Mine-a-ve.

175
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,200
That's the book that Imaw opened
even though it was forbidden.

176
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:01,333
That's why he lost consciousness
and fell ill.

177
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,033
What does it contain?

178
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:18,233
It seems like it doesn't want us
to read its contents.

179
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,000
Perhaps we can use our gems.

180
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:35,367
Book, obey our command, open.

181
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,500
Book, do not be stubborn
or disobedient.

182
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:46,700
Open.

183
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:58,500
Pirena!

184
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,000
It seems like it refuses
to listen to us.

185
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,433
Book, obey our command open!

186
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:24,633
Animal!

187
00:19:44,233 --> 00:19:47,267
Why are you still here, child?

188
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,400
Did I not already send you home?

189
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,167
Forgive me, Sovereign Queen.

190
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,000
I was just wondering...

191
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,433
why have you been standing
there for so long?

192
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,933
Are you waiting for someone?

193
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:10,500
When your kind becomes
skilled warriors,

194
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:14,400
I will gather you all here.

195
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,667
And together, we will go
to Encantadia.

196
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,833
I've heard you mention
Encantadia many times.

197
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,467
It's quite far based
on what I know.

198
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:35,100
And my mother said

199
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,600
that the beings who dwell there
are immensely powerful.

200
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,233
And they are cruel.

201
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,033
They spare not even those
of their own blood.

202
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,267
That's why we will punish them.

203
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,567
Forgive me, Sovereign Queen,
but...

204
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,600
what did they do to you?

205
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,500
Why do you despise them so much?

206
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,533
Go home now, or I will be
the one to punish you.

207
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,700
Forgive me, Sovereign Queen.

208
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,067
Who would have thought...

209
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,067
that my destiny would still
change?

210
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:48,933
ETHER: A rebellious deity
cursed to become a serpent.

211
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,100
Whoever you are,

212
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,433
if you desire to kill me...

213
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,900
do it.

214
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,233
End my suffering.

215
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:34,967
I want to disappear.

216
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:37,600
Do not be afraid, Mitena.

217
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,733
For I am not an enemy.

218
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,533
But a friend,

219
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,133
willing to rescue you
and set you free.

220
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,900
My centuries of suffering
have planted deep mistrust

221
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,033
in my mind and heart.

222
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,900
How can I believe in the promise
of this being?

223
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:59,433
When everyone I've ever known
has betrayed me?

224
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,467
I can read your thoughts.

225
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:08,700
We share the same fate, Mitena.

226
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:12,267
Like you, I was also betrayed

227
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,967
and cast aside by all of
Encantadia

228
00:23:15,033 --> 00:23:18,367
and even by their so-called
deity.

229
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:22,033
So accept my help.

230
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:25,800
And I promise you,
I will guide you

231
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:28,667
so that you become strong
and powerful.

232
00:23:28,733 --> 00:23:31,300
So you may exact vengeance
for me,

233
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:36,233
and for yourself against
our common enemies.

234
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:07,367
Listen to the wind.

235
00:24:07,433 --> 00:24:09,400
The wind whispers a warning.

236
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,133
Something is happening
that we do not yet know.

237
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:19,133
Does this have anything to do
with what happened to Imaw?

238
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:22,033
It is possible.

239
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:26,500
And the Book of Akashic?

240
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,733
Alena and I entered the library
together with two Adamyans.

241
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,467
We could not open it.

242
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:41,267
So whatever Imaw read in

243
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:46,200
that book remains trapped in its
pages and in his mind.

244
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:07,867
Mitena, sing now.

245
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:11,700
So that my weariness
may be lifted!

246
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,733
Come back!

247
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:36,767
Or I will tear your skin apart!

248
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:39,833
Mitena!

249
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:44,933
Don't pay attention to him
anymore, Mitena.

250
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,667
Let's go.

251
00:25:46,733 --> 00:25:49,200
Where are you taking me, Ether?

252
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:53,633
To a place where there resides
a being

253
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,400
from whom you can draw power
and a strength no one can match.

254
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:01,833
Come on.

255
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:20,200
Inside that cave is a being,
like me, also cursed.

256
00:26:20,267 --> 00:26:24,300
Therefore, it has a weakness.

257
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:30,167
And that lies in a delicate part
of its neck

258
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:33,567
if you wound it deeply,

259
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:40,933
the essence of its life
will slowly fade away.

260
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:46,767
It holds a powerful weapon

261
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:50,600
that you can use to change
our destiny.

262
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,633
This is what you will do,
Mitena.

263
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:02,167
Wait for it to fall asleep,
and then steal its weapon.

264
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:10,833
You are the power
I have longed for.

265
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:21,133
You are the curse I will bring
to Encantadia.

266
00:27:58,167 --> 00:27:59,533
It's coming.

267
00:28:00,933 --> 00:28:03,600
I can already smell
the breath of death.

268
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:23,100
Who is the savior that will end

269
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,433
the life of the being that will
bring me to death?

270
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,233
Where will this being come from?

271
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,600
Show me.

272
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,033
The child of Danaya.

273
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,433
That child is the savior
who will defeat the being

274
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,367
that will bring death
to all of Encantadia.

275
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,333
Did you ask the flowers
for permission

276
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,567
before picking them and making
them into a necklace?

277
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:06,900
Dear child...

278
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:08,567
most likely not.

279
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,800
Would it even answer
if I spoke to it?

280
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:16,233
Oh, grandchild,
bring this to your mother

281
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,833
so she can sell it.

282
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,267
So we can have something for
dinner tonight, okay?

283
00:30:20,333 --> 00:30:21,167
All right.

284
00:30:25,267 --> 00:30:27,233
Are you buying?

285
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,833
You'll be my first customer, it
might bring me some luck today.

286
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,500
It would be better...

287
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,867
if you accept this.

288
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:53,267
Use it so your life may improve.

289
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:55,767
I hope it helps.

290
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,867
What's this? Is this real gold?

291
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,233
There's so much of it!

292
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,367
Are you sure
this is really gold?

293
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:05,667
Oh, maybe you're tricking me?

294
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,800
I don't know
how to trick people.

295
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,733
I hope this helps
change your life.

296
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:12,767
I'll leave now.

297
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,533
Wait, what's your name?

298
00:31:33,233 --> 00:31:35,533
What's that?
Is that real?

299
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,667
Give it to me.

300
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:37,667
Temyong!

301
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:38,733
I said, give it!

302
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,267
That's not yours! Give it back!

303
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,500
Don't touch me!

304
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,567
Give it to me!

305
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,300
Don't annoy me, old lady, okay?

306
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,933
Hey, don't get involved in this.

307
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,733
Let it go.

308
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
- Let's go.
- Hey! My gold!

309
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,233
You're so mean!

310
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,533
That's mine! It's not yours!

311
00:32:58,533 --> 00:33:00,167
Miss.

312
00:33:00,233 --> 00:33:01,967
Maybe you have more of that.

313
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:04,133
- Yes, come on.
- Give us everything.

314
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,133
Hand it over.

315
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,333
What?

316
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,200
Run!

317
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:45,167
My gold! My gold!

318
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,967
Oh my, thank you so much, Dear.

319
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,933
You're not only rich.

320
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,033
You also fight really well.

321
00:33:57,367 --> 00:33:58,767
It's nothing.

322
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,667
Please be more
careful next time.

323
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:06,733
Thanks, you returned my gold.

324
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:12,133
My world has changed,

325
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,933
and transformed.

326
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,533
In this world of humans,

327
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,333
where time moves so quickly.

328
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,500
Just like time,
life here moves fast too,

329
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,867
for the beings who live in it.

330
00:34:24,933 --> 00:34:26,267
The humans.

331
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,333
It's time for us to train.

332
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,833
Get ready!

333
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:32,867
Father.

334
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:35,600
Get ready!

335
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,100
Money, or wealth.

336
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:41,967
Just like the gem of Encantadia,

337
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:45,033
it is treated
as the most precious jewel

338
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,467
in their world.

339
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:47,967
Good afternoon, Sir.

340
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,567
Are you expecting a visitor?

341
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,200
Your mother left no message.

342
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:52,667
Where's the gold?

343
00:34:52,733 --> 00:34:55,800
And so, money is also
their weakness.

344
00:34:55,867 --> 00:34:59,100
And the cause of evil for
others.
